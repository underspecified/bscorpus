He begins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Chris Mooney (of &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/06/storm-world/"&gt;“Storm World”&lt;/a&gt; fame) and fellow &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection//"&gt;“Intersection”&lt;/a&gt; blogger, scientist, and writer Sheril Kirshenbaum have written an extraordinary, if rather sobering book entitled &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unscientific-America-Scientific-Illiteracy-Threatens/dp/0465013058/"&gt;‘Unscientific America’&lt;/a&gt;. What I found most refreshing about the book is that it not only isolates the history behind, and source of, the problem in question—the pervasiveness and dangerousness of scientific illiteracy in modern society–but it offers viable solutions. This book is a must read for anybody who cares about science, and the growing disconnect between the scientific and popular cultures (the problem of the so-called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures"&gt;“Two Cultures”&lt;/a&gt; first discussed by C.P. Snow).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And ends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it were up to me, this book would be required reading for all undergraduate science majors, along with Sagan’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle-Dark/dp/0345409469"&gt;“The Demon-Haunted World”&lt;/a&gt;. Only when we begin training scientists to understand the relationship between science and society, and their crucial role in that relationship, will be begin to solve the dilemma so eloquently described in ‘Unscientific America’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What comes in the middle really captures the spirit of why we composed the book!

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You got married several years ago and had two children with your wife.  You all attend an evangelical Christian church on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During your visits to the church, you begin to grow wary of what you hear.  What’s with all the anti-gay rhetoric?  Is the pastor really espousing a pro-life stance even in cases of rape and incest?  And, for that matter, why does the church ignore the more abominable parts of the Bible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You decide this church and this faith isn’t for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, you and the wife are having issues and you get a divorce.  You’d still like to maintain contact with your children, of course.  One is 10 and the other is 15 — neither are legal adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge in the case, however, says &lt;em&gt;you may not have any contact with your children&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you continue to criticize the church and that is not in the children’s best interest.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My reaction would be: Are you &lt;a href="http://peebs.net/blog/2009/06/exclusive-brethren-rip-yet-another-family-apart/"&gt;shitting&lt;/a&gt; me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, that story is not very different from what has happened to &lt;a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25749563-2702,00.html"&gt;an Australian man who left the Exclusive Brethren church&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A family court judge has denied a father any role in the parenting of his Exclusive Brethren children, in part because of his “continuing criticism” of the controversial Christian sect. In the judgment, judge Sally Brown ruled that, while there was a legal presumption that both parents should share parenting, this was “contrary to the children’s best interests” in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The father, who cannot be identified because of restrictions on reporting of Family Court cases, is “devastated”, particularly as a previous court judgment had awarded him frequent access to two of his eight children. Justice Brown’s judgment means he has no right to see or even communicate with the children, in a reversal of those previous court orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The father had applied for custody of both children but late in the case changed his position, asking for custody of his daughter and access to his son. The judge condemned this as “indicative of a significant lack of understanding of the children’s needs” .
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cultish Christian sect Exclusive Brethren does not permit members to associate with non-members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way the father will be able to see his children now is by &lt;a href="http://peebs.net/blog/2009/06/exclusive-brethren-rip-yet-another-family-apart/"&gt;buying their photographs&lt;/a&gt; from the church’s school… when the kids aren’t around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has no money to appeal the decision — the case has already set him back $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m no lawyer.  Some of you who know Australian law may be able to shed some more light on this… but since when do absurd religious beliefs trump parental rights?  That sounds like a dangerous precedent to set.&lt;br&gt;

I’ve been reading a lot about Apollo lately — the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11 is almost upon us — and of course the Moon is in my thoughts anyway with the advent of NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter now snapping away. as it circles our cosmic neighbor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve done some interviews about this, and been asked about it endlessly: will the LRO’s incredibly high-resolution images of the lunar surface, including, eventually, the Apollo landing sites, finally quell the lunacy of the Moon Hoax believers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be nice, but obviously it won’t. If they don’t believe the thousands of pictures and video taken from the lunar surface by the Apollo astronauts themselves, why would they believe further NASA evidence? And besides, these true believers don’t live in an evidence-based world. They live in fantasy; it’s the only way they can be shown &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/tv/foxapollo.html"&gt;solid proof their claims are wrong&lt;/a&gt; and yet still cleave to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go into details, but happily &lt;a href="http://cumbriansky.wordpress.com/2009/07/05/lro-and-the-apollo-hoax-believers/"&gt;the Cumbrian Sky blog&lt;/a&gt; already makes these points pretty well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I will be happy to sit back and reminisce about Apollo, look over the new LRO imagery, and think about the future of space exploration with some optimism (and fight for the progress to be done rationally!), all the while ignoring the ignorant bleatings of the Apollo deniers. Sixty years from now, when people are celebrating the centenary of the first human to set foot on another world, I think the Hoax will be so long dead and gone that they won’t even know enough to ask, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/sibrel.html"&gt;Sibrel&lt;/a&gt; who?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I hope you have an expensive gold wedding band but otherwise start off by keeping your mouth shut. Find someone who will take care of you for a few days or weeks and then look for employment in the local church. Your marginal product is quite low, even once you have learned the local language. You might think that knowing economics, or perhaps quantum mechanics, will do you some good but in reality people won't even think your jokes are funny. Even if you can prove Euler's Theorem from memory no one will understand your notation. I hope you have a strong back and an up to date smallpox vaccination.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Readers, do you have any other tips? Is there any way that Londenio can leverage his knowledge of modernity (he is, by the way, a marketing professor) into socially valuable outputs? Would prattling on about sanitation and communicable diseases do him any good?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I can't wait to get there. Believe it or not, I'll even be on a panel!  While I'm there I'll probably manage to do a new post or two, but, in the meantime, while I'm away communing with fellow skeptics at &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;TAM7&lt;/a&gt;, I'll be reposting some Classic Insolence from the month of July in years past. (After all, if you haven't been following this blog at least a year, it'll be new to you. And if you have I hope you enjoy it again.) This particular post first appeared in July 2007.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of thing makes one wonder if the personification of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,,2135381,00.html"&gt;Death should in fact be a cat&lt;/a&gt;, although, oddly enough, not a black cat:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Oscar the rescue cat is not simply a welcome feline companion at the Steere nursing home in Providence, Rhode Island. According to a new report in a medical journal he has a remarkable, though morbid talent - predicting when patients will die.

&lt;p&gt;When the two-year-old grey and white cat curls up next to an elderly resident, staff now realise, this means they are likely to die in the next few hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such is Oscar's apparent accuracy - 25 consecutive cases so far - that nurses at the US home now warn family members to rush to a patient's beside as soon as the cat takes up residence there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He doesn't make too many mistakes. He seems to understand when patients are about to die," said David Dosa, an expert in geriatric care who described the phenomenon in the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me this just looks like a load of &lt;a href="http://skepdic.com/confirmbias.html"&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;. Probably what happened is that the cat happened to curl up near a patient who just happened to die within a couple of hours. After that, the staff were on the lookout and now they notice it. It's the same reason that, even though there is no evidence that craziness, injuries, or crime are any more frequent during nights of full moons, there is the persistent myth among emergency room staffs, police, EMS drivers, etc., that they're busier during full moons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, look at this excerpt from the story, pulled straight out of the &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/4/328"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/the_kitty_of_doom.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/the_kitty_of_doom.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/HcvMBkpkr4c" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247058684126"><id gr:original-id="http://www.realclimate.org/?p=689&amp;langswitch_lang=in">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6f3209de6a16b1c2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Climate Science"/><category term="Communicating Climate"/><category term="Reviews"/><title type="html">‘Unscientific America’: A Review</title><published>2009-07-08T12:39:21Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T12:39:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/07/unscientific-america-a-review/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Author Chris Mooney (of &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/06/storm-world/"&gt;“Storm World”&lt;/a&gt; fame) and fellow &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/"&gt;“Intersection”&lt;/a&gt; blogger, scientist, and writer Sheril Kirshenbaum have written an extraordinary, if rather sobering book entitled &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unscientific-America-Scientific-Illiteracy-Threatens/dp/0465013058/"&gt;‘Unscientific America’&lt;/a&gt;. What I found most refreshing about the book is that it not only isolates the history behind, and source of, the problem in question—the pervasiveness and dangerousness of scientific illiteracy in modern society–but it offers viable solutions. This book is a must read for anybody who cares about science, and the growing disconnect between the scientific and popular cultures (the problem of the so-called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures"&gt;“Two Cultures”&lt;/a&gt; first discussed by C.P. Snow). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Unscientific America’ explores how we’ve come to the point we’re now at, examining the historical factors behind the diminishing prominence of science and scientists in the popular culture of the U.S. since its heyday in the years following WW II. The authors uncover more than enough blame to go around. They find fault with the media, both in how it portrays science and scientists (e.g. the icon of the ‘mad scientist’), and in the decreasing news coverage devoted to issues involving science and technology. They find fault in the way policy makers often abuse science (cherry-picking those particular scientific findings which suit their agenda), and in the behavior of corporate special interests who, in areas such as our own area of  ‘climate change’, have often deliberately &lt;a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Heartland_Institute"&gt;manufactured false controversy and confusion&lt;/a&gt; to dissuade the public from demanding action be taken. At this point, the scientists among you might begin to feel absolved of any responsibility for the problem. Don’t–Mooney and Kirshenbaum won’t allow us to escape blame, and with good reason. As they point out, we ‘eat our own’, when it comes to colleagues engaged in public outreach and science popularization.  Case in point: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan"&gt;Carl Sagan&lt;/a&gt;–a hero to many of us who value science outreach. One of the darker episodes in modern U.S. science history was the blocking by Sagan’s fellow scientists of his entry into the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Evidently, a majority of his colleagues resented his having become a household name–something they presumably considered unbecoming for a scientist.  What sort of message does it send when the most effective science communicator in modern history was shunned by his colleagues for his efforts? Certainly not a good one. This is just one example, and there are many others–it is not surprising that so few scientists to choose to pursue the path of outreach and public education. The reward systems in academia and the scientific world typically do not favor scientists who choose to expend considerable time and effort engaging in public discourse. And here of course, it is as much that system, as the scientists themselves, which is to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that we (scientists) are part of the problem, it must stand to reason that we are also part of the solution. And indeed, this is a primary thesis advanced by Mooney and Kirshenbaum. The authors argue that we must fundamentally reinvent the way that scientists are trained, so as to encourage and reward those who choose to serve as much-needed science liasons and science communicators.  Indeed, the reward system must be reworked in such a way as to facilitate the establishment of a whole new class of scientists, so-called ’science ambassadors’ who are rigorously trained in science, but have the proclivity and ability to engage in the broader discourse and to help bridge the growing rift between the ‘two cultures’.  We can no longer rely on pure serendipity that figures such as Sagan will just come along. We must be proactive in establishing a pipeline of scientists who can fill this key niche. In the absence of such intervention, the authors argue, the current rift between the “two cultures” will continue to grow, and the chasm between science on the one side, and popular culture and public policy-making on the other, will grow ever more dangerously wide. Such was Carl Sagan’s great fear, as revealed in his classic “The Demon-Haunted world”, published shortly before his untimely departure in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some, the authors could potentially come across as a bit overly prescriptive here. One might interpret them as arguing that science needs to be taught in a fundamentally  different way, with the new generation of science students fully immersed in the social sciences as part of an entirely rethought curriculum. Were the authors arguing this, one might indeed expect quite a bit of push-back from the scientific community. After all, the course work required to prepare today’s science students for careers of advanced research in cosmology or genetics (or climate modeling for that matter) is extensive, and slapping a whole bunch of additional course requirements in, say, communication and sociology, on top of their current requirements would be onerous to say the least.  But this is not what the authors are saying (I can say this with confidence, having confirmed this in my discussions with them). To allow science to continue to flourish, it will of course be necessary to allow those scientists with neither the interest nor inherent aptitude for communication to continue to do science in the old fashioned way. It would be an unwise use of our resources and theirs to push these reluctant individuals towards outreach.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does make sense–and what the authors are indeed arguing for–is that we adapt the current system to facilitate the development of those individuals who are well suited to careers as ’science ambassadors’.  An appropriate step might be requiring science majors to take a course in college (perhaps a so-called ‘capstone’ course taken in the senior year) that focuses on the broader societal context within which the scientific topics they’ve studied resides.  Some, perhaps even most, of these prospective future scientists will decide that they want no more of this–and that’s fine. Once again, we should not force those who are reluctant to follow this new path. But hopefully the experience will identify, in a self-selecting manner, those scientists who do have broader interests and abilities in this area. And for those who do, there needs to an entire academic infrastructure, ready to absorb them and to help prepare them to join the ranks of those much needed science ambassadors. We need to be realistic in this venture of course. These innovations may not yield another Carl Sagan.  But they will certainly move us in the right direction. For those who believe that such dramatic changes in our way of doing things are not necessary–that the burgeoning litany of science blogs, such as RealClimate (which does get several mentions in the book!) will help to insure the penetration of science back into popular culture, the authors have a disquieting message: an entire chapter entitled “The Bloggers Cannot Save Us”. And to those who hope that the more forwarding-thinking attitude towards science within the current U.S. government signals the long-awaited stemming of the anti-science tide, the authors caution that the current crisis–such as the disappearance of science and technology journalism from our media–is far more fundamental and structural in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Unscientific America’ is extremely well written, which is no surprise to those of us who follow Chris and Sheril’s insightful blog postings. Its also remarkably error free (something I wish I could say  about our own book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dire-Predictions-Understanding-Global-Warming/dp/0756639956/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1208820449&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;“Dire predictions”&lt;/a&gt;–we still caught a few typos going into the 3rd printing). Every review must find some fault, and so here’s mine:  There is a very minor mistake.  The authors at one point refer to an exciting new venture known as &lt;a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/"&gt;“Climate Central”&lt;/a&gt; as being a Princeton University-affiliated effort. Its not.  Other than being physically located in Princeton, and having some Princeton folks on board, there is no formal relationship with the university. I doubt Princeton is going to sue however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it were up to me, this book would be required reading for all undergraduate science majors, along with Sagan’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle-Dark/dp/0345409469"&gt;“The Demon-Haunted World”&lt;/a&gt;. Only when we begin training scientists to understand the relationship between science and society, and their crucial role in that relationship, will be begin to solve the dilemma so eloquently described in ‘Unscientific America’.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>mike</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247058091879"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_power_of_nonsense.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ed7189ee6c3697c4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">The power of nonsense</title><published>2009-07-08T13:14:36Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T13:14:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/8FwWxb1sZP4/the_power_of_nonsense.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_power_of_nonsense.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Forgive me, readers, but &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/jul/01/science-religion-atheism"&gt;Madeline Bunting has raised up her tiny, fragile pin-head again&lt;/a&gt;, and I must address her non-arguments once more. Well, not &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; non-arguments, actually, but the same tedious non-arguments the fans of superstition constantly trundle out. She was at some strange conference where only people who love religion spoke and came away with affirmations of the usual tripe. It's as if the "New Atheists" have provoked a counter-attack by critics armored in pudding and armed with damp sponges.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…the Archbishop of Canterbury was brisk, and he warned, &amp;quot;beware of the power of nonsense&amp;quot;. Science&amp;#39;s triumphalist claim as a competitor to failed religion was dangerous. In contrast, he offered an accommodation in which science and religion were &amp;quot;different ways of knowing&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;what you come to know depends on the questions you start with&amp;quot;. Different questions lead to &amp;quot;different practices of learning&amp;quot; - for example different academic disciplines. Rather than competitors, science and religion were both needed to pursue different questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re quite aware of the power of nonsense — and I agree that it certainly has a powerful draw on some people, from those who &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/gosh_i_think_i_went_to_the_wro.php"&gt;frolic with fairies&lt;/a&gt; to the Archbishop of Canterbury. That's the frightening element of this whole argument, that people get sucked into spiritual fol-de-rol and think they're suddenly deep and perceptive thinkers, and that waving a little fluff at the atheists will make them run away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often get this vague claim that religion is a &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; methodology and a &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; way of knowing things, and that judging religion as a science is a category error. Very well: different way of knowing &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt;? What are these different questions that they are asking, how do they propose answering them, and why should we think these questions are even worth asking, and that their answers are valid? They never seem to get around to the specifics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, religion might well be the only avenue for addressing the question of how many bicycles are being peddled by angels right now, but that's because it's an irrelevant question that doesn't affect our lives or the universe in any way, doesn't have any way of being answered, and is built around imaginary referents, "angels", for which we don't even have evidence of their existence. But if religion is a way of knowing, how do &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; know what the answer is? What is their methodology? How do they verify their answers? Why is it that every religion, and even every individual within a religion, comes up with different answers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's an example of a trivial question, but the same problems apply to the big questions central to their beliefs. How do we even know that we need redemption from sin? Is sin even a valid concept? They can't answer these questions in an independently verifiable way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when they try to get specific, they are hopelessly vague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second question from the audience - from the philosopher Mary Midgley - was what comes next? What both science and religion needed, argued Conway Morris was a more fruitful conversation. He raised the possibility that religion might be needed to help develop understanding into questions which have baffled scientists such as the nature of consciousness. The future of science is a series of imponderables, he concluded, and it may require a set of scientific skills "of which we have no inkling at the moment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the fruitful conversation we need between science and religion is more of a loud roar from the science side to silence the lies of the faithful. This argument that we &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; more input from religion comes almost entirely from those already committed to the superstition — personally, I think we could use entirely less babbling gobbledygook from the apologists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Conway Morris's suggestion is pointless. &lt;i&gt;How&lt;/i&gt; will religion help us understand the nature of consciousness? Having someone assert that it is the product of ghosts, spirits, or other such invisible manifestations from some non-place outside our universe is, it has turned out, a useless, unproductive, and &lt;i&gt;old, dead&lt;/i&gt; hypothesis. Just to suggest that we may need new ways of thinking to approach a complex problem does not imply in any way that a very old way of thinking has some utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People like Conway Morris keep claiming that science and religion are not only compatible, but that both are necessary. I don't buy it. I have two simple questions for those who claim that the two are complementary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What specific fundamental principles of your religion do you actually use in your science? I don't mean just general ethical principles, because atheists also have those, but tell me something specific about how you apply your religion to science?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you apply scientific principles to your religion, and do you do so consistently? Do you, for instance, test religious claims with experiment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you put it that specifically, most of the religious scientists I know would unashamedly and rightly say that no, they practice science in the lab or field without expectation of an intervention by Jesus to change the results, and that no, turning the skeptical tools of science against their faith would be inappropriate, or that god is not subject to our scrutiny. This is not compatibility. This is tergiversation. The only way they can claim compatibility is by pointing out that some individuals practice both religion and science, like Simon Conway Morris, but that says nothing, since people are damned good at encompassing contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a terrifying look at what we get with religion, turn to this &lt;a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article6619456.ece"&gt;a review of Karen Armstrong's &lt;i&gt;What Religion Really Means&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. What a promising title! We godless atheists are always being told that we don't &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; understand the depth of religion, so a book that promises to clearly state what it is sounds like a welcome addition to the debate. Until, that is, you read what she says it means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She draws on 2,000 years of Christian theology and mysticism to demonstrate rich alternative ideas of the divine. Back in the 4th century AD, long before Wittgenstein and Derrida, Bishop Basil of Caesarea understood all about the limits of language, and stated them rather more clearly, too. "Thought cannot travel outside was, nor imagination beyond beginning." God is, by definition, infinitely beyond human language. Earlier still, the Christian scholar Origen (185-254) discussed the "incongruities and impossibilities" in scripture. The fact that Dawkins et al think that pointing out the Bible's imperfections undermine Jewish or Christian belief only demonstrates their ignorance of the traditions they presume to undermine. Of course it's not meant to be understood literally, the early Christians seem to sigh across the centuries.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Armstrong further shows how even the words "I believe" have changed, and become scientised, to mean "I assert these propositions to be empirically correct." Yet the original Greek pisteuo means something much more like "I give my heart and my loyalty." In the gospels, she says, quoting the great German theologian Rudolf Bultmann, Jesus himself sees God not as "an object of thought or speculation, but as an existential demand".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a sodden pile of words rendered meaningless by the attempt to bloat their meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, we know that many rarefied theologians believe in a lot of airy nonsense, but let&amp;#39;s not pretend that the vast majority of Christians would not reject those claims out of hand — they are far more literal. Or, rather, they claim to be more literal, but actually hold a body of faith that is just as subjective, just as highly evolved and refined, as the set of beliefs held by the most opaque and obfuscatory theologian. There really isn&amp;#39;t much difference in the methodology of Rudolf Bultmann or Ken Ham — both are piling up the subjective bullshit as fast as they can shovel it, they are just using different conventions and different language tailored to their different audiences. It&amp;#39;s simply different…framing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of Bunting's different way of knowing and different kinds of questions and different practices of learning, though, what do I learn from that slippery gemisch of pious protestations? One thing and one thing only: the power of nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we've all mastered that lesson by now. It's time for the theologians to grow up and move on to questions with some heft and meaning, that are actually applicable to our lives and our culture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_power_of_nonsense.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/8FwWxb1sZP4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247057424778"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_7_circadian_org_3.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/49c3a073fd39db41</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Tutorials"/><title type="html">Clock Tutorial #7: Circadian Organization in Mammals</title><published>2009-07-08T11:36:08Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T11:36:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/w3el41TGr8s/clock_tutorial_7_circadian_org_3.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_7_circadian_org_3.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://circadiana.blogspot.com/2005/02/clock-tutorial-7-circadian.html" title="Circadian Organization in Mammals"&gt;&lt;img alt="Circadian Organization in Mammals" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2006/06/ClockWeb%20logo2.JPG" width="104" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This February 06, 2005 post describes the basic elements of the circadian system in mammals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_7_circadian_org_3.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_7_circadian_org_3.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/w3el41TGr8s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247056112401"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=555">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/de9a6a97f773b928</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Chiropractic"/><title type="html">The British Chiropractic Association Responds to Simon Singh</title><published>2009-07-08T12:00:15Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T12:00:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=555" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Simon Singh is a science journalist who last year wrote an article in the Guardian critical of the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) for promoting chiropractic treatment for certain childhood ailments. Singh characterized these treatments as “bogus” because they lack evidence to back up claims for clinical efficacy. The BCA responded by &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=549"&gt;suing Singh for libel&lt;/a&gt;. In the English court system the person being sued for libel is essentially guilty until proven innocent, and even successfully defending oneself can be ruinously expensive. Therefore suing for libel in English court is a very successful strategy for silencing critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case resulted in a bit of a backlash against the BCA, who were accused of silencing legitimate and very necessary public scientific debate regarding the safety and efficacy of medical interventions. The BCA could have simply responded by providing evidence to back up their claims, and the Guardian even offered them space to do so, but instead they sued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this backlash is a movement, supported by many scientific organizations, to &lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/333/"&gt;keep libel laws out of science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently the BCA has responded to this backlash with a &lt;a href="http://www.chiropractic-uk.co.uk/gfx/uploads/textbox/Singh/BCA%20Statement%20170609.pdf"&gt;statement and a list of studies &lt;/a&gt;they claim provides the evidence Singh said was lacking. I won’t address their attempt at damage control, but rather focus on their response regarding the evidence. They write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of wider scientific debate, and having taken appropriate professional advice, the BCA has decided that free speech would be best facilitated by releasing details of research that exists to support the claims which Dr. Singh stated were bogus. This proves that far from being “not a jot of evidence” to support the BCA’s position, there is actually a significant amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They follow their statement with a list of 29 studies. This is a short reference list to support several individual medical claims, but actually it is a bloated list that contains many references that do not provide evidence for the claims of the BCA that Sign was criticizing. This is how the 29 references break down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 - Risks of NSAID medication&lt;br&gt;
1 - Nature of evidence-based medicine&lt;br&gt;
3 - opinion, chiropractic practice&lt;br&gt;
1 - letter to editor&lt;br&gt;
2 - review&lt;br&gt;
2 - risks of chiropractic&lt;br&gt;
8 - colic&lt;br&gt;
3 - nocturnal enuresis&lt;br&gt;
3 - otitis media&lt;br&gt;
3 - asthma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, out of the 29 references, only 17 actually provide evidence for the efficacy claims for chiropractic for these four pediatric indications. When each indication is considered, the list of supporting studies is embarrassingly thin. They are also of very poor quality and, as we will see, cherry picked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that the notion of spinal manipulation for medical issues, like a middle ear infection, is highly implausible. Such implausible claims should require robust clinical evidence before putting them into practice. The evidence presented by the BCA is far from robust, and when the totality of evidence is considered it is actually negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 8 studies presented for colic, one is a preliminary assessment of cranial osteopathy for colic. In the past chiropractors have complained that studies of non-chiropractic forms of manipulation cannot be used to dismiss the efficacy of chiropractic. It is disingenuous of the BCA to pad their list of evidence for chiropractic by including a study of osteopathic manipulation. Two of the studies were case reports. One report is a response to a questionnaire, and there were three unblinded or single-blinded studies, and one uncontrolled study. Therefore, not one prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is presented. All we are given is low grade evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the BCA left off the best designed study, which not surprisingly was negative. Olafsdottir et al (1) studied 86 infants with colic in a randomized controlled trial and found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chiropractic spinal manipulation is no more effective than placebo in the treatment of infantile colic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the BCA justify omitting this study from their list?  Do they think that an open scientific discussion of evidence means presenting only the evidence that seems to support their position?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCA also neglected to reference a review of the evidence for chiropractic for colic by Hughes and Bolton (2) which concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The evidence suggests that chiropractic has no benefit over placebo in the treatment of infantile colic. However, there is good evidence that taking a colicky infant to a chiropractor will result in fewer reported hours of colic by the parents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their conclusion was curious - chiropractic treatment for colic does not work but parents report that it does.  Ordinarily science-based practitioners would simply interpret such results as being consistent with a placebo effect alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we see is the typical pattern of evidence for an ineffective treatment - low grade evidence showing an effect, but higher grade controlled evidence showing no effect above placebo. The bottom line is that existing evidence suggests that chiropractic manipulation is not effective in the treatment of colic. But the BCA cherry picked only the low grade evidence that supported their claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asthma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the three asthma studies presented, two were of osteopathic manipulation and the third is a case series and pilot study. The two osteopathic studies were looking at markers of pulmonary function, and not clinical outcomes. Again, it is very telling that these three weak studies are all the BCA could come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, the BCA left off their list the largest and most definitive study of chiropractic treatment for childhood asthma - the 1998 New England Journal of Medicine study (3). This was a large randomized controlled trial, which found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In children with mild or moderate asthma, the addition of chiropractic spinal manipulation to usual medical care provided no benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pattern repeats again - the best data shows no effect from manipulation. It is my sincere contention that if the exact same evidence (even leaving out the lack of plausibility) existed for a medical treatment, it would be abandoned as a worthless dead end. At the very least, use would stop until further research were done. There might even be concerns about the ethics of further research given the negative evidence and lack of plausibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCA and chiropractors in general have simply ignored or dismissed the negative evidence of chiropractic for asthma and instead cherry pick the very low-grade evidence that seems to support what they want to claim. This makes chiropractic treatment for asthma “bogus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Otitis Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is precious little research into the treatment of acute otitis media (middle ear infection) with chiropractic adjustment. The three studies cited are all retrospective or uncontrolled. There are no double-blind placebo controlled studies - and therefore no reliable evidence upon which to base a clinical claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nocturnal Enuresis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we have three weak studies and nothing to defend the implausible claim that chiropractic treats nocturnal enuresis. One of the studies cited is by Reed et al, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7884329?ordinalpos=5&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;which concludes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The mean pre- to post-treatment change in the wet night frequency for the treatment group compared with the control group did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.067).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words - this is a negative study. The comparison of treatment to control showed no statistically significant difference. There was a trend - but they are not reliable enough to serve as a basis for clinical conclusions. That is the whole point of statistical significance. This was a small study, so you can say that it was simply not powerful enough to detect an effect - but that still leaves us without evidence to support the claim for an effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15846744?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt; of the evidence regarding chiropractic and other alternative treatments for nocturnal enuresis concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was weak evidence to support the use of hypnosis, psychotherapy, acupuncture and chiropractic but it was provided in each case by single small trials, some of dubious methodological rigour.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCA’s list of evidence for these four clinical claims is not impressive.  The best they have to offer is a few weak and poorly designed studies. They also ignore larger better trials where available that are negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more thorough assessment of the evidence for chiropractic treatment for asthma and colic reveals evidence for lack of efficacy. For otitis media and nocturnal enuresis there is a lack of evidence for efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the state of the evidence, the BCA feels they are justified in promoting chiropractic for these pediatric indications. The reader can decide if the term “bogus” applies.&lt;/p&gt;

So Texas &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/28/major-texas-win/"&gt;had its brief shining moment of light&lt;/a&gt; when the state Senate rejected creationist goofball Don McLeroy’s bid to once again head up the Board of Education. McLeroy was the guy who famously said, &amp;quot;Someone has to stand up to experts!&amp;quot; when talking about the science advisors contacted by the BoE to advise them on, y’know, &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even in that very post I said that this win was at best temporary, since the same Governor Rick Perry who picked McLeroy in the first place would pick his replacement.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And guess what? I hate being right all the time. It looks like Perry may pick über-far right religious zealot &lt;a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6514838.html"&gt;Cynthia Dunbar to replace McLeroy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunbar actively and opens hates the public school system (check that link in the last paragraph for details). Dunbar campaigns to tear down the First Amendment of the Constitution. &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/07/06/dunbar-to-head-sboe/"&gt;Dunbar is a ball of crazy even by Texas politics standards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, she has not yet been nominated by Governor Perry. Given his own leanings, even if he doesn’t tap Dunbar I’m sure he’ll find some other young-Earth creationist to try to teach the children of Texas fantasy instead of science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the good folks of the Lone Star State: make your voices heard. &lt;a href="http://governor.state.tx.us/contact/"&gt;Contact Perry’s office&lt;/a&gt; and let him know you’d rather have someone grounded in reality in charge of the education of your children. Otherwise — and honestly, I’d love to never have to use this graphic again, but I know I will –&lt;/p&gt;

It is certain to be a load of fun and skepticism. But if you cannot make TAM this year, don’t fret - there are other upcoming skeptical events this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dragoncon.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DragonCon 2009&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Atlanta, GA  - September 4th-7th&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes it is a gaming and sci-fi/fantasy convention. But it also contains a skeptical track, a podcasting track, and a science track. This way you get to hear skeptical and science lectures by all your favorites, and attend a live recording of the SGU, while simultaneously dressing up as Darth Vader and bumping elbows with nerds dressed as your favorite sci-fi characters, in varying degress of quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, I had a blast at DragonCon 2008, which was even more packed with skeptical goodness than TAM - more panels, more lectures, and more hours. If you cannot get your skepticl fix at TAM, this is the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.necsscon.org/eventinfo.htm"&gt;NECSS - Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
New York, NY - September 12th, 10AM to 6PM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first (perhaps of many) NECSS (pronounced “nexus”) -  a joint effort of the New York City Skeptics and the New England Skeptical Society. This is a full day event including lectures and panels with a live SGU recording. Here is the &lt;a href="http://www.necsscon.org/speakers.htm"&gt;full speaker list&lt;/a&gt;. Tickets are $65, or $40 for students or NYCS or NESS members. Get your tickets soon, before we fill up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what the significance of that is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is none.  None at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just thought I’d point that out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://j-walkblog.com/index.php?/weblog/posts/advice_from_usa_today/"&gt;The J-Walk Blog&lt;/a&gt; points out, how come the reporter in the article just quotes the psychics as if they’re credible?  At no point do we hear that these people are delusional, wrong, or misguided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand the need for objectivity in journalism, but can’t you just say numerology is bullshit without worrying about appearing biased?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why some people can&amp;#39;t put two and two together

JILL, 19, from Michigan, wants to go to university to read political science. There is just one problem: she keeps failing the mathematics requirement. &amp;quot;I am an exceptional student in all other subjects, so my consistent failure at math made me feel very stupid,&amp;quot; she says. In fact, she stopped going to her college mathematics class after a while because, she says, &amp;quot;I couldn&amp;#39;t take the daily reminder of what an idiot I was.&amp;quot; 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Last November, Jill got herself screened for learning disabilities. She found that while her IQ is above average, her numerical ability is equivalent to that of an 11-year-old because she has something called dyscalculia. The diagnosis came partly as a relief, because it explained a lot of difficulties she had in her day-to-day life. She can&amp;#39;t easily read a traditional, analogue clock, for example, and always arrives 20 minutes early for fear of being late. When it comes to paying in shops or restaurants, she hands her wallet to a friend and asks them to do the calculation, knowing that she is likely to get it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247042315517"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-3501660564382790456">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6358d1ac71b8fa50</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Critical Thinking" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Metablog" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Meatspace" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Randi" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Skepticism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Through Me You Will Have TAM</title><published>2009-07-08T07:37:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T07:37:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/07/through-me-you-will-have-tam.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SlRM7fLcirI/AAAAAAAAApE/6mIsM-7UQ9E/s1600-h/JamesRandi.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:178px;height:200px" title="He always looks so very exasperated." src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SlRM7fLcirI/AAAAAAAAApE/6mIsM-7UQ9E/s200/JamesRandi.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Thursday morning at 6:40AM Eastern Standard Time, my plane takes off out of Indianapolis and I will be en route to The Amazing Meeting 7 where I will meet new people, have dinner with the cast of the Skeptics Guide to the Universe, give a presentation, and overall have an amazing time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is my call to you, dear readers who cannot attend TAM, for requests.

In May, the Government Accountability Office (GAO)  released a &lt;a href="http://edlabor.house.gov/newsroom/2009/05/gao-report-finds-hundreds-of-a.shtml"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; entitled "Seclusion and Restraint: Selected Cases of Death and Abuse at Public and Private Schools and Treatment Centers." The GAO's investigation was the first conducted by the government concerning such &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/school_is_not_supposed_to_hurt_3_against_physical_restraints_amp_padded_rooms"&gt;practices in schools&lt;/a&gt; and was done at the request of &lt;a href="http://edlabor.house.gov/documents/111/pdf/statements/20090519GMHearingStatement.pdf"&gt; U.S. Rep. George Miller (D-CA)&lt;/a&gt;, the chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee.  Not only did the investigation find "hundreds of allegations that schoolchildren have been abused, and some even died, as a result of inappropriate uses of seclusion and restraint in classrooms"; it was emphasized that "these abusive practices were used disproportionately on children with disabilities."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, "abusive practices" such as &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/school_is_not_supposed_to_hurt_report_on_the_use_of_seclusion_amp_restraints"&gt;prone restraint&lt;/a&gt; were "disproportionately" used on children who are disabled---on children whose needs and challenges, whose communicative and cognitive disabilities, are far greater than that of most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A July 7th article on the GAO report in &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/articles/education/2009/07/07/students-suffer-abusive-restraint-gao-says.html"&gt;US News &amp;amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt; opens with the story of Christy Kilmer, who has cerebral palsy and autism. At the age of 4, Christy was strapped to what sounds like a Rifton chair (pictured in &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_perils_of_restraints_stop_now"&gt;this earlier post on restraints&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Christy attended preschool for only nine days before Kilmer learned of the restraint and removed her daughter from school more than 10 years ago, but the effects of the alleged abuse are still evident today. Doctors diagnosed Christy with post-traumatic stress disorder that causes her to experience extreme bouts of anxiety and anger, GAO investigators found. Though she was fully potty-trained before her teachers restrained her, Kilmer says Christy, at age 15, will wet her pants if she hears her name and the word teacher spoken in the same sentence. Christy becomes agitated when she is driven past her old school, and Kilmer need not look farther than her own home—the broken furniture and the fist-size holes dotting the walls—to see the costly manifestations of her daughter's anger. "We can deal with the beatings and the broken walls," Kilmer says. "But how can we heal her brain? I can't take the abuse out of her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A July 6th article in the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124683589628497923.html"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; notes that, while there are federal regulations concerning the use of restraints and seclusion in hospitals and government-funded facilities---"in psychiatric hospitals, for instance, only licensed medical personnel can order that a patient be restrained or put into a locked room"---there are no such regulations in place regarding the use of these in the public schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been speculation that the use of &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/use-of-restraints-increasing-in-public-schools/"&gt;restraints in public schools has increased&lt;/a&gt; in the US in part because there are more students with disabilities being educated in public school settings. Such an argument misses a basic point, that restraints and seclusion are overused and, in too too many cases, used too quickly. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I can say, based on our experience with my son Charlie in various public school districts, that restraints are indeed used too quickly and often without school districts first obtaining parental consent; other families we know have had similar, troubling experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/articles/education/2009/07/07/students-suffer-abusive-restraint-gao-says.html"&gt;US News &amp;amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt; notes that there are (as there indeed are) "alternatives teachers can use to handle classroom confrontations with students" in the form of "the encouragement of positive student behaviors" of positive behavior supports. Michael George,  director of &lt;a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/~insch/"&gt;Lehigh University's Centennial School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;....expected policies that promote positive student behavior to work at Centennial because the system had been successful at his old school, but when he told teachers of his goal to eliminate the use of restraint and seclusion altogether, they laughed. "Some teachers thought I was turning the institution over to the inmates, so to speak," George says. "My detractors placed bets on how long I would last." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of his second school year at Centennial, George had achieved his goal of decreasing the number of restraints to zero and getting all of Centennial's teachers to take the positive reinforcement method seriously, an accomplishment detailed in [a 2005 &lt;em&gt;Psychology in the Schools&lt;/em&gt;] article. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly pro-active teaching strategies that take into account why a student might get upset---communication difficulties and sensory overload, for instance----can be highly effective. (It should also be noted, that positive behaviors supports have come under criticism of their own.) I was puzzled by some statements by &lt;a href="http://www.albany.edu/schoolpsych/faculty_and_staff.htm"&gt;University of Albany psychology professor David Miller&lt;/a&gt;, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today, teachers say, "I really like how you did that" when a student behaves properly, and teachers make sure students feel valued by telling them, "We care about you and your future," Miller says. If students behave aggressively, teachers do not restrain them. Instead, they call the police and tell students, "I'm very sorry your behavior forced us to call the police. We will miss you while you are gone and look forward to your return," Miller says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There've been a few cases of autistic students being &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/handcuffed_at_school"&gt;handcuffed at school&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/tased_at_school"&gt;tased at school&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/10-year-old_arrested"&gt;arrested at school&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps Miller's references to the police are hypothetical, but I don't think calling in the police is a "positive," and certainly not a pro-active, strategy for addressing the needs and challenges of students with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own son has numerous challenges with his "behaviors" and I've thought long about these concerns. Again and again my husband and I try to see this issue from our son's perspective; try to understand why he does the things he does, and how he feels when being restrained. And I think, if everyone---teachers, educators, behaviorists, ABA consultants, administrators, therapists---thought about restraints and seclusion from the perspective of students with disabilities, we all could be thinking very differently about such practices, and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/end_the_use_of_aversives_restraints_and_seclusion"&gt;end the use of aversives, restraints, and seclusion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

And I think the latter will soon change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A good Blog always seeks to source statements. This is the beauty of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink"&gt;Hyperlink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the early internet journalist, especially those from the "print" traditions, will tend not to source statements. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is partly because journalists sometimes see themselves as professional interpreters of sources; but more often, as Nick Davies points out in &lt;a href="http://www.flatearthnews.net/"&gt; Flat Earth News&lt;/a&gt;, it just disguises laziness and exaggeration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Readers of internet journalism will increasingly expect hyperlinks to sources to be embedded into internet news stories. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, in the example highlighted by Ben Goldacre, any story which relies on the statement "&lt;em&gt;claim scientists&lt;/em&gt;" would link directly to the press release or to the published research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indeed, as a general rule, any "claim scientists" story which now does not link to the source is undoubtedly crap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I expect some old-fashioned journalists and editors will resist this transparency, not least because it could instantly demonstrate how little - or just how much - they are actually adding to their source.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I also expect that the new generation of internet journalists, even in the mainstream media, will instinctively link to their published sources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any good internet journalist who invariably linked to - and demonstrably did not distort - their published sources would become highly credible with readers and will secure a following, and this in turn will please editors and advertisers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I suspect &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churnalism"&gt;"churnalists"&lt;/a&gt; will soon just not be bothered with by readers, and then by editors and advertisers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I reckon that, in a year or so, good internet journalists - like good Bloggers - will routinely link to their published sources, and readers will forget that once this was not the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or am I just being &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_in_the_sky"&gt; optimistic&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-4194249701436796208?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247036092708"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3733">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ea36db0cc900c7f9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution"/><category term="Chris Mooney"/><category term="Crackergate"/><category term="Jerry Coyne"/><category term="john Kwok"/><category term="PZ Myers"/><category term="The Intersection"/><title type="html">Warring factions on Evolutionary thought cont’d</title><published>2009-07-08T06:41:58Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T06:41:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/07/warring-factions-on-evolutionary-thought-contd/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/06/05/warring-factions-on-evolutionary-thought/"&gt;Last month, I blogged&lt;/a&gt; about one of the REAL scientific controversies concerning evolution that has the scientific community split into 2 distinct camps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to how Evolutionary Theory is to be publicly discussed, there has for some time been 2 main schools of thought. The former, perhaps best represented by the likes of Doctors Eugenie Scott, Ken Miller, and Barbara Forrest, believes in reassuring the public that Evolution does not conflict with their religions and can co-exist with the belief in a god. Ken Miller furthers this position by being himself a self-avowed Catholic who fully accepts Evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the other camp, perhaps best represented by Doctors Richard Dawkins, PZ Myers, and Jerry Coyne, who believe Evolution is necessarily inconsistent with religious beliefs and that its not the role of scientists to sugarcoat the truth by reinforcing the lie that Evolution can co-exist with religious belief. This is the camp that I belong to as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well since then, tensions between the 2 camps have grown tremendously online, particularly on Chris Mooney’s blog, The Intersection, where this rising tension began last month when Mooney criticized an article by Dr. Jerry Coyne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conflict became more inflamed when Dr. PZ Myers learned that Mooney singled him out for allegedly furthering the rift between science and religion last year during &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2008/07/25/news-from-around-the-blogosphere-72408/"&gt;the Crackergate fiasco&lt;/a&gt; (4th story down) and blogged about it as well as not receiving his usual review copy of Mooney’s book. This led Mooney to post &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/page/2/"&gt;his blog response to Myers&lt;/a&gt; and probably also prompted this other blog entry discussing the conflict of whether science and religion can co-exist &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/06/lessons-from-dawkins-vs-degrasse-tyson/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s not Mooney or Coyne or Myers, etc who have resumed fighting but the readers of Mooney’s blog. And the comments section of these 2 blogs have fast become a battleground for name-calling, straw men arguments, and just plain irrational behavior, particular on the part of  commenter John Kwok, who illustrates perhaps more than anybody how dogmatic and irrational the scientific-minded can become on this one issue, specifically, in my humble opinion, those on the side insisting that science and religion don’t conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one thing seems to be clear. This issue isn’t going away on its own. And as atheists become more and more outspoken in American society and as creationists further their political agendas, we’re going to be facing this conflict more and more. And if the scientific community can’t find some kind of common ground, we won’t need creationists because we’ll have done their jobs for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No longer will any Ukrainian be allowed to legally possess video or photographs of naked humans sticking their body parts in each other. Truly, a victory for sense and freedom. The new law goes on to say that anyone caught with multiple copies of a pornographic image may be charged as a dealer. Also, there is an exemption for “medicinal” porn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NG81DNSQL._AA280_.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NG81DNSQL._AA280_.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="185"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I’d like to see more about this medicinal porn. Does that involve videos of sexy nurses showing up at someone’s door immediately followed by inexplicable screwing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s funny too because I was just saying the other day that all of the Ukraine’s problems would be solved if they could just get rid of all the porn. Why didn’t we see it before. It makes perfect sense. The Soviet Union didn’t have freedom, and look at how great that turned out. Oh…right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this raises a lot of questions about how porn is defined:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What exactly constitutes “pornography”? Two people having sex? One person having sex? Two people having sex with one person? Three monkeys, a girl, two cups, and a Klondike bar all having sex together?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to clear up the confusion, the Amateur Scientist makes a suggestion (Didn’t mean to copy so muc of AS’ blog):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way to resolve this situation is to mail Viktor Yushchenko every questionable image you can get your hands on so that he may personally tell you whether or not you’re allowed to have it in Ukraine. His address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Viktor Yushchenko&lt;br&gt;

Of course, he and his parents would rather continue to give credit for his recovery to the “alternative” “medicine” products they’ve been giving him in addition to the real medicine. But for those who understand how science work and actually have a grasp on reality, there’s no question that had Daniel not received the chemo, he’d have died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately,  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/prosecuting_another_case_of_medical_negl.php"&gt;Jeremy LaBrie wasn’t so lucky&lt;/a&gt;. Jeremy, an 8 year old autistic child with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, died because his mother Kristen. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://salemnews.com/punews/local_story_183001531.html"&gt;. . .withheld his medications&lt;/a&gt; and failed to take him to appointments with his oncologist. As a result of his failing to undergo his complete course of chemotherapy, his cancer returned with a vengeance. As of one year ago, his odds of survival were estimated to be no more than 10-20%, after having had a good prognosis when initially diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Kristen LaBrie is being prosecuted for manslaughter. And sickingly, despite all the evidence of her negligence, she’s denying the charges, especially given that she was EVEN MORE NEGLIGENT than Daniel Hauser’s parents up until they eventually surrendered their son to the will of the court:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case is different than the usual ones that I examine here in that Kristen did not refuse chemotherapy for her son because she wanted to pursue woo. Indeed, there is no evidence that she sought “alternative” therapy or other quackery for her son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I despise the “alternative” “medicine” industry, or as I like to call it, “The Industry of Death,” I can at least understand how a parent could be so suckered by quacks as to turn to them over real doctors. Kristen LaBrie doesn’t seem to have even done that. So for once, I can’t even blame the quacks for selling bogus medicine. I can’t even blame religious fanaticism for this one as she didn’t use prayer as a substitute for medicine. Really, this is a pretty clear-cut case of the blame falling squarely on bad parenting.&lt;/p&gt;

They scanned thousands of people to find variants of genes that tended to show up more in people with schizophrenia than in those without it. And they &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature08185.html"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; a heap of genes. There are thousands of different variants that each may raise your risk of schizophrenia by a tiny amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Wade, a veteran genetics reporter at the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, has been following the quest to trace diseases to genes for a long time now. And when Wade tried his hand at blogging last week, he laid down &lt;a href="http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/hoopla-and-disappointment-in-schizophrenia-research/?hpw"&gt;a harsh verdict&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Press releases from five American and European institutions celebrated the findings, one using epithets like “landmark,” “major step forward,” and “real scientific breakthrough.” It was the kind of hoopla you’d expect for an actual scientific advance. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It seems to me the reports represent more of a historic defeat, a Pearl Harbor of schizophrenia research. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By “defeat,” Wade was not saying that the research was wrong. It was just not going to lead to any quick fixes for this devastating disease. While the risk of schizophrenia can be inherited, that does not mean that you can take a pill that compensates for a single broken gene and cure it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new results are depressingly similar to a string of searches for the genes linked to other conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, as I explained in my recent essay for &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/204328"&gt;“The Gene Puzzle.”&lt;/a&gt; Now that scientists can read the human genome and scan thousands of people’s DNA, they’re not finding easy answers. They instead are finding networks upon networks of thousands of genes, that can be disturbed in a staggering number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be frustrating to discover just how complex our genes can be. But we really shouldn’t be too surprised. We’ve had plenty of warning about the complexity of life from a much simpler organism: &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; only has 4,000 or so protein coding genes (we’ve got about 20,000, plus thousands of other important chunks of DNA).  &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have to develop into a brain or a heart or a toenail: all it needs to do is be  &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, a single, tiny cell. As I explain in my book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307276864?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0307276864"&gt;Microcosm: E. Coli and the New Science of Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; has been studied up and down and every which way for a century. It is the best-understood species on Earth. And by 1973, the great biologist Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, decided  &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; should be the subject of a singular scientific project–a kind of biological moon shot. He called for the &lt;a href="http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/C/Q/"&gt;“complete solution”&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;: a total explanation of how the cell sustained itself, grew, and reproduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been 36 years since Crick’s call, but scientists have yet to figure E. coli out. For one thing, they don’t have a very good idea of what a lot of its genes are for. According to a &lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000096"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; in April, the function of a third of  &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;’s genes are uncharacterized. The authors of that study were able to come up with hypotheses for what all those 1431 genes do, but they are rough hypotheses at best. The scientists proposed the some genes are involved in building proteins, for example, or constructing membranes. They could not offer a detailed explanation for how the structure of each of those proteins allowed it to carry out some particular function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/msb/journal/v5/n1/fig_tab/msb200934_F6.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/07/isobutanol440.jpg" alt="isobutanol440.jpg" align="left"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take a lot of scientists doing a lot of experiments to figure out exactly what those 1431 genes are doing. And conversely, it will take a lot of work to figure out the interactions of genes that produce even the simplest things about &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. This diagram comes from a &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/msb/journal/v5/n1/full/msb200934.html"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published last month in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Systems Biology&lt;/em&gt; on one such simple thing (click on it for a bigger view). Scientists have been engineering &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; to make an alcohol called isobutanol, which might serve as an alternative fuel. The only catch is that isobutanol is poison for &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. Even a tiny amount of the stuff will cause the bacteria to stop growing, which is the last thing you want to happen to microscopic fuel factories. So scientists at UCLA tried to figure out how isobutanol makes &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;sick. This diagram sums up what they figured out: a single kind of molecule can trigger all kinds of changes in the activity of a number of proteins, and those changes cascade through the cell, as proteins shut down genes for other proteins or activate other ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, the scientists did figure out the answer to this particular question, and they are figuring out how to tweak this network to help &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; survive its self-made poison. While &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; should make us skeptical of big promises about mastering the human genome in the near future, we can still have some hope for the distant future. Pearl Harbor, after all, did not end the war.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Carl Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/</id><title type="html">The Loom</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247031875141"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1565">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bb1c3cdbb83a8e7b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Writing"/><category term="Writing Systems"/><title type="html">How should we spell "copy editor"?</title><published>2009-07-08T05:40:12Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T05:40:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1565" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing on which I would appreciate help from a copy editor, if there is a single one still prepared to talk to me after my latest &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1561"&gt;dumb copy editor story&lt;/a&gt;, is how to write the name of the worthy profession that I have so cruelly mocked for just occasionally displaying pointless tone-deaf bossiness.  I currently write &amp;quot;copy editor&amp;quot;.  But I notice that some of my commenters (even those claiming to be or to have been copy editors) write &amp;quot;copyeditor&amp;quot;, and others &amp;quot;copy-editor&amp;quot;. I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to be out of step with the literate world.  This is basically a spelling convention, and I have no axe to grind, and I&amp;#39;m perfectly prepared to go along with current literate practice, once I know what it is.  I did just one quick experiment to see if I was way off base: I searched the familiar 44 million words of 1987-1989 &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; files (they have become much beloved of computational linguists for testing parsers and so on since Mark Liberman on behalf of the Association for Computational Linguistics obtained them for scientific use in 1993), and simply counted the hits.  The modest results of this 60-second survey work with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep"&gt;&lt;b&gt;grep&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;      copy editor:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;      copy-editor:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;      copyeditor:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that looks like an overwhelming, knock-down, drag-out victory for my present policy. (A couple of the 12 hits supporting me seem to be repetitions; but even so, it's a win.)  However, perhaps someone has some good, clear evidence that this is misleading data and my spelling should be revised.  I am fully prepared to accept guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Earlier today I &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1563"&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; her phrase "I know that I know that I know this is the right thing for Alaska".  The &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Story?id=8016906"&gt;same interview&lt;/a&gt; contained a phrase that may well allude to the book of Esther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Kate Snow:&lt;/strong&gt; Is it possible, governor, that this could be the end of your political career?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sarah Palin: &lt;/strong&gt;I said before&lt;strong&gt; - &lt;/strong&gt; I stood in front of the mic the other day, you know, politically speaking, if I die, I die. I- so be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare&lt;strong&gt; Esther 4:14-15:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King James version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,&lt;br&gt;
Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by &lt;a href="http://www2.regent-college.edu/bookstore/authors/epeterson/"&gt;Eugene H. Peterson&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The Message&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esther sent back her answer to Mordecai: "Go and get all the Jews living in Susa together. Fast for me. Don't eat or drink for three days, either day or night. I and my maids will fast with you. If you will do this, I'll go to the king, even though it's forbidden. If I die, I die."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update 7/8/2009 — As evidence that the connection with Esther is one that comes easily to mind for people who see political action in biblical terms, here&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href="http://www.newswithviews.com/Daubenmire/dave158.htm"&gt;June 25 passage&lt;/a&gt; from the blog of  "Coach" Dave Daubenmire,  "founder and President of Pass The Salt Ministries  and Minutemen United"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Let’s be honest here, Sarah Palin was the only reason that John McCain didn’t get Walter Mondaled. Most evangelicals voted for Sarah Palin, not Juan McCrud. As I loved to explain to my friends, Sarah Palin was God’s man.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Just like in the times of Esther there didn’t seem to be a man to do the job. Like the young shepherd boy David, Mrs. Palin had toiled faithfully in obscurity of Alaska sharpening the down- home, mom and pop values which connected in the heartland like David’s stone to the forehead of the biblical bully from Gath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metaphorical equation of Sarah Palin's impact on the Republican base and the stone's impact on Goliath's forehead is one that Coach Daubenmire might, on reflection, decide to withdraw. But I think he'd stick with idea of Sarah Palin as Esther, stepping forward to save God's people because of the opportunity afforded by her beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or read "&lt;a href="http://women.ag.org/women_at_work/display/?targetBay=063e32ea-5717-4948-802b-4d0d7111e0d8&amp;amp;ModID=2&amp;amp;Process=DisplayArticle&amp;amp;RSS_RSSContentID=9420&amp;amp;RSS_OriginatingChannelID=1249&amp;amp;RSS_OriginatingRSSFeedID=3837&amp;amp;RSS_Source="&gt;Esther's First Impression Changed the World&lt;/a&gt;", in the Women's Ministries Unlimited section of the Assemblies of God USA web site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[T]he king&amp;#39;s search committee launched a crusade to find the most beautiful women to serve the king […] We have all had paramount interviews. Esther&amp;#39;s was essentially a beauty contest, but God uses beauty for a greater purpose.  […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Esther had a high calling to influence King Xerxes. To approach the king was unlawful, and the punishment could be death. In some ways, you could consider this a second first impression with much higher stakes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;If I perish, I perish," she said. Esther's courage, conviction, and trust in the Lord would save a whole lineage of people. She could not be silent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Queen Esther must have clothed herself in pure elegance, for the king extended the golden scepter and offered her half the kingdom! Clearly, the impression she made on the king saved her people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;How astonishing is God's sovereignty over all his people! May we, like Esther, open ourselves to being used by God—beginning with making a favorable first impression. Who knows? It might just change the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And resigning "to usher in what it is that needs to be done in our state or our country" can certainly be seen as trying for "a second first impression with much higher stakes". ]&lt;/p&gt;

One of these lovely women, &lt;a href="http://motherofallscientists.blogspot.com/"&gt;ScienceMama&lt;/a&gt; who you may remember from her time rocking my &lt;a href="http://motherofallscientists.blogspot.com/search?q=naughty+monkeys"&gt;Naughty Monkeys&lt;/a&gt;, has a question. How could I deny one of my favorite muffins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ScienceMama writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT:0px"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dearest Isis,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have a terrible confession to make. About 2.5 years ago, my purse broke. It was my only (decent) bag. Some preliminary shopping trips were not successful. Everything was either gigantic, bedazzled or ugly. Then I had a baby. And went back to work. There are no more "shopping trips for fun" these days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the past two years I have been using a rather unattractive shoulder bag that I happened to have lying around, but the situation is pretty untenable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I need a bag. Something simple but stylish. Something big enough to tuck a Science paper in, but not large enough to put a centrifuge in. Can you recommend something, dear Goddess?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you!&lt;br&gt;ScienceMama&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a terrible, terrible confession. I won't lie. It made me die a little inside to hear of the lack of adorable handbags in ScienceMama's life. It is fortunate for all of us that I am here, now isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ScienceMama's letter also really tugged my heart strings. I remember the day I turned in my Coach bag for a diaper bag. I cried like a little girl and as soon as I could retire it I did. These days I largely carry a handbag on Sundays when Little Isis takes me to church. My needs are very specific. It has to be large enough to carry one diaper and a pack of wipes, one book, one sippy cup, one bag of grapes, my wallet, keys, phone, and additional random beauty products. That's a lot of stuff, but I also demand that my bag not be 30 cubic feet. That's why I am loving these two handled beauties&lt;/p&gt;

I noticed some gigantic metal wall letters — 20-somethings can use them to spell clever things on their wall, I suppose, or artfully intersperse them with books and objects on a shelf. But I thought right away about Alex. He would love these, I thought. Unfortunately they are $14 a pop, making an entire alphabet an extravagance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:301px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/07/letter.jpg" alt="Giant wall letters from Urban Outfitters" width="291" height="431"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giant wall letters from Urban Outfitters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I caught up with Jeff and the boys at a coffee shop, I took out the bag and said to Alex in that sing-songy gift voice, “I have a present for you!” He lit up, reached out and unwrapped his big red A. “Boy, that was a big hit!” I said to Jeff. You don’t often see someone as pleased with a present as Alex was with that letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out Urban Outfitter’s web site has some different types of big &lt;a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=14276232&amp;amp;navAction=jump&amp;amp;isProduct=true&amp;amp;parentid=MORE%20IDEAS&amp;amp;isProduct=true&amp;amp;cross-sell=true&amp;amp;guide-bn=true"&gt;letters&lt;/a&gt; on sale, so I spent some time picking the sale ones and planning to go back to the store for the giant colorful enamel ones I saw first. I’m not really sure what I had in mind at the start, but clearly Alex needs a complete A through Z, with a few repeats of some of the vowels (and maybe some consonants). They’re big, they’re expensive, they take up a ton of room, they make an echoing, clattering sound when they hit the floor. But my boy loves them, and they are the very building blocks of words, of communication itself. So we’ll get rid of some toys and focus on these for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

Richard,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like your advice on the following:&lt;br&gt;
I’m an atheist, my wife is a fairly liberal cafeteria christian. Recently her good friend, an evangelical christian, committed suicide. No note was left, no reasons were given. At the funeral, 3 of the speakers blamed her death on “Satan” as his evil thoughts caused her to take her own life, and said that she was now in heaven. The entire ceremony spoke of her entrance to heaven, but I know from my understanding of their faith that suicide is a major sin. As an atheist, how should we deal with such a massive affront to reason in light of contradictory statements? A part of me understands their desire to see this person again in the afterlife and find an explanation for their actions, but I can’t reconcile things. How can logical people hold these massively contradictory beliefs? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Daniel-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Daniel, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suicide of a friend or loved one brings up many conflicting feelings toward the deceased, including grief and anger.  We have our loved one, the victim of a killing for whom we grieve, and the killer of our loved one at whom we are angry, rolled into the same person.  Many complex and subtle factors in the circumstances and the relationship will affect the proportions of that mix of feelings, and that mix will change over time.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the deceased was well known to be suffering for a long time from painful illness or loneliness, then people will tend to have more forgiveness for the suicide and less feeling of injustice.  But if, as in this case, it seems to come out of the blue, as it can with a well-hidden case of depression, then people are shocked, incredulous, and have a stronger reaction of outrage.  They don’t feel comfortable with dumping all that outrage on the deceased, so they look for a scapegoat, a surrogate “villain.”  Satan has always been a very convenient target for this, since he never speaks up in his own defense.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can hold conflicting ideas and beliefs because of the mind’s remarkable ability to compartmentalize, like pigeonholes in a mail sorting room.  They can think one thought, then move to another compartment and an opposing thought does not connect or collide with the other. They just don’t experience the conflict.   Some minds are more compartmentalized than others, and I’m not sure, but I suspect that religion tends to increase this.  Atheists, having stepped out of, or never been in that process, tend to have minds more like a large room with only a few compartments, where just about everything can see everything else.  So contradicting ideas don’t last long, and atheists can sometimes have a harder time being patient and understanding of people who harbor contradicting ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But atheists are still capable of empathy and compassion, and they should exercise those when they see people in anguish, regardless of the illogic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an atheist and as a husband, I think the thing for you to do at this point in time is to focus on how you can provide human-oriented comfort and support primarily for your wife in her grief, shock and loss, and secondarily for her friends if need be.  You’re not going to be able to change their beliefs, but you can be valuable as a human to a human in need.  Be an open ear with an open heart.  Encourage your wife to express any and all of her feelings as she goes through the process of grieving for her good friend.   No feelings are “bad” or “good,” they are just &lt;em&gt;there.&lt;/em&gt;  Give permission, over and over, for her to express whatever she feels.  Don’t argue with any of the illogic in the theology.  That won’t help the suffering and bewilderment of the human beings around you.  Right now, they need a safe place to grieve without tension from intellectual arguments.  Grief comes in waves with pauses in between, diminishing over a long time.  It takes as long as it takes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel, you have a clear, rational mind.  Sometimes the best use of that kind of mind is as a teacher who challenges irrationality, and sometimes it is best used as a companion who comforts and heals pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Science still cannot explain why women sleep around”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A study published today in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science details a series of careful experiments Swedish researchers conducted on mating seed beetles (pictured). They want to find out what the benefits were to females who mated with multiple males….” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as a normal person, you are probably thinking: “WTF does a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/324/5935/1705"&gt;paper in Science about beetles&lt;/a&gt; have to do with promiscuity in women?”  The answer would be &lt;strong&gt;NOT A GODDAMN THING&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
This is one of the most blatant, shameless examples of “sexing up science” I’ve seen in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the actual paper they are referring to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a paper about seed beetles, people. Seed. Beetles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-06/uu-gma062409.php"&gt;press release covering this paper&lt;/a&gt;, there is no mention that this research means anything for mammals, much less humans. So… where did this get connected up to explaining why women “sleep around?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the messed up little head of the writer, that is where. Because human women liking sex is clearly deviant, and in need of explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is how you get crazy sentences like &lt;a href="http://io9.com/5302600/science-still-cannot-explain-why-women-sleep-around"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Why would these insects have sex with so many different men, only to choose the crappiest sperm?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said initially, Amazing.  Aside from the &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/green-porno-part-2/"&gt;Green Porno of Isabella Rossellini&lt;/a&gt;, I am not aware of any human-insect hookups. (And, frankly, do not &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; to be aware of any, so please don’t email me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a whole host of other errors in this &lt;a href="http://io9.com/"&gt;i09&lt;/a&gt; article, and I’ll just pick this one:  It does not use the term fitness correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In evolution, the one who dies with the most babies wins. Even if the animal is small, unhealthy, and wimpy.  The males with the most offspring are, &lt;em&gt;by definition&lt;/em&gt;, the most fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, I was asked recently to recommend some things to read critiquing evolutionary psychology, and this seems like a good spot to stick some links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is akin to discussions regarding &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/114/5/S2/1458"&gt;autism vs. nonverbal learning disabilities&lt;/a&gt; (that link is a discussion by various professionals on a case study and is a case study in itself for the point of this post here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also akin to discussions regarding &lt;a href="http://www.mugsy.org/bishop.htm"&gt;autism vs. semantic pragmatic language disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, these labels can be &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/life-changing_benefits_of_diagnosis"&gt;a really positive source&lt;/a&gt; of self-understanding, of needed supports and services, of better communication, and a key to finding accommodations that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, these labels aren't life--how people think, feel, experience and interact with the world is incredibly complex.  Even if we discard (ha!) the interplay between personality, history, and biology, &lt;em&gt;mind&lt;/em&gt; remains &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind"&gt;too complex for us to even define&lt;/a&gt; let alone label with a tidy diagnostic word.  Sometimes it's easy to forget the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/what_is_normal_in_medicine_and_society"&gt;artificiality of these labels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end what matters isn't whether a person "has" this thing or this other thing or both, what matters is that a person "is"--complex, undefinable, real, alive.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247010019175"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/how_to_fake_your_own_moon_land.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/44876f4cf3b9e22a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Random Stuff"/><title type="html">How to Fake your own Moon Landing</title><published>2009-07-08T03:14:43Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T03:14:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/how_to_fake_your_own_moon_land.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Okay, so you've seen the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1969_and_th.php"&gt;famous photos&lt;/a&gt; from the Apollo Moon landings:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/how_to_fake_your_own_moon_land/NASAMOONLANDING.JPG" width="512" alt="NASAMOONLANDING.JPG"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you've been around the block enough to know why &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/tv/foxapollo.html"&gt;we really landed on the Moon&lt;/a&gt;.  But let's say you &lt;i&gt;wanted&lt;/i&gt;, for some reason, to stage your own fake jaunt on the Moon.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The band Rammstein did an excellent job with the first 30 seconds of their video, Amerika:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/4w9EksAo5hY%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you do it?  Well, first off, you need some nice, Moon-colored dirt.  You've got two options here.  One is to go someplace where you can see something like &lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/crmo/"&gt;Craters of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; national monument in Idaho.  After all, this will do nicely for an area to film:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/how_to_fake_your_own_moon_land/031120_moonscape_04.jpg" width="500" alt="031120_moonscape_04.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But really, not everyone has access to something like that.  A dry, treeless, grassless area will be fine as well, as long as you either spray-paint it a dull grey color &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt;, as is my preference, wait until the cover of night and illuminate everything with a low-pressure sodium lamp.  Why?  Because you get a picture that's monochromatic, like this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/how_to_fake_your_own_moon_land/2099616757_edc15e3839_o.jpg" width="500" alt="2099616757_edc15e3839_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily adjust the color on these pictures to turn the yellow into white/grey, and you've got yourself (roughly) a Moon.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You've then got some options as to the background.  A black screen is low-cost, but probably not ideal.  A green screen works better (just set up blackness and/or a further Moonscape, as you like), or, if your budget allows, actually do it at night with an artificial light source.  My bet would be the green screen converted into either blackness (easiest):
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/how_to_fake_your_own_moon_land/GI-Blog-RCA_GreenScreen.jpg" width="500" alt="GI-Blog-RCA_GreenScreen.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to green screen it and then add your favorite moonscape photo, like this one of Harrison Schmitt from Apollo 17:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/how_to_fake_your_own_moon_land/schmitt_moonscape.jpg" width="500" alt="schmitt_moonscape.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you've got to get yourself a nice &lt;a href="http://madhattermagicshop.com/magicshop/product_info.php?products_id=4521"&gt;fake astronaut costume&lt;/a&gt;.  Some of them are actually pretty good looking!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/how_to_fake_your_own_moon_land/countdowncreations_1969_8598830.jpg" width="250" height="538" alt="countdowncreations_1969_8598830.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, now that you've got everything, you're ready to start filming.  This is where a neat little physics trick comes in handy.  Gravity on Earth accelerates you (and everything else) at 9.8 meters/second^2 (32 ft/sec^2).  On the Moon, on the other hand, gravity is only &lt;b&gt;one sixth&lt;/b&gt; of Earth's gravity.  This means the Moon's gravity only accelerates you at 1.6 meters/second^2 (5.3 ft/sec^2).  So all you have to do is use a high speed camera to record at 180 (144) frames-per-second, then play it back at the standard 30 (24) frames-per-second, and you've got a slow-motion, Moon-esque video:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare that jump to a jump by an actual Apollo astronaut on the Moon (and note how they move differently than on Earth):
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/icayHrkoBvc%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad!  If you want to do like Rammstein and add yourself singing/playing an instrument, the next step is to record your audio at normal speed.  Then, play it back at 6x speed, and lip-sync to the sped-up version as you film yourself.  And you're all set!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot easier and cheaper than physically &lt;i&gt;going&lt;/i&gt; to the Moon, to be sure.  And that's how you do it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; Nobody caught this mistake, but you don't want to film it at one-sixth speed; you want to film it at &lt;i&gt;the square root of one-sixth&lt;/i&gt; speed, or 41% of its original speed.  Oops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/how_to_fake_your_own_moon_land.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247007768056"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/07/two-carnivals-no-waiting/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/74717e20ee5f1068</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">Two carnivals, no waiting</title><published>2009-07-07T23:00:12Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T23:00:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/07/two-carnivals-no-waiting/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Wilfredo De Jesus&lt;/strong&gt; is a pastor of a church in a neighborhood in Chicago.  &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-pastor-gays-alderman_avilajul07,0,4153366.story"&gt;He may end up getting a seat in the Chicago City Council&lt;/a&gt; via appointment, as opposed to winning it in an election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not all that surprising to see a religious leader make the leap into local or state politics, at least not in Illinois, so why is this newsworthy?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Jesus has a history of being anti-gay.  His sermons have equated “homosexuality with drug addiction and other social ills.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of evidence of his homophobia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In an interview last year, De Jesus told Christianity Today that his paramount priorities were opposing abortion and homosexuality. In a neighborhood newspaper story about a proposed new high school geared toward gay students, De Jesus raised the specter of a virgin being harassed by gays or lesbians to have sex.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that if he gets the council seat, he’d have control over funds for agencies with gay clients.  That’s really the crux of the issue.  It’s not just a personal belief — it’s a view that could have impact beyond his church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Jesus says this isn’t really a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
De Jesus says that he has never preached hatred of gay people and that his church’s opposition to homosexuality is rooted in a literal interpretation of the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Asked repeatedly whether he viewed homosexuality as a sin, De Jesus replied: “I didn’t say that. The Bible says that. I don’t sit in a seat of judgment.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate that argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s basically saying, “I don’t hate gay people.  The &lt;em&gt;Bible&lt;/em&gt; hates gay people.  And I support what the Bible says.  So I’m off the hook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a perfect analogy, but by that logic, I should be able to oppose Christian Bible Camps and make public statements that they should be condemned.  And if you accuse me of being hateful or intolerant, I can just say I am neither of those things.  But I’ve read &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGod-Delusion-Richard-Dawkins%2Fdp%2F0618918248%2F&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325"&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt; opposes indoctrination of children.  So don’t blame me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His argument and mine are both ludicrous.  If you want to make such claims, I don’t care where that belief stems from.  You better be able to defend it.  And if you’re in politics, you better be able to defend it without resorting to your “faith,” as if that’s a legitimate excuse for your bigotry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Jesus has said that he won’t let his beliefs influence his politics, but I have a hard time believing that.  How many politicians can you think of who are anti-gay in private but in support of equal rights for gay people in public?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my heart, I can’t believe that all 4,000 worshipers agree with his anti-gay rhetoric.  I wonder how many of them dare voice their opinion.&lt;br&gt;

Mark Sanford's interviews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Everybody's got their own value system, but to me, even if it's a place that I could never go, if I wanted to know that I knew that I knew, if that's more important to me than running for president, that's my prerogative as a human being.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered whether he might be exhibiting an unexpected run of multiple-target speech errors (compare "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1537"&gt;the biggest self of self is self&lt;/a&gt;" from his earlier press conference). But a commenter, William Ockham, &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1550#comment-35114"&gt;set me straight&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"To know that you know that you know" is a stock phrase in fundamentalist evangelical speech that's used to make an experiential claim about a supernatural reality. "To know" something is to have learned about it. "To know that you know" is to be certain of something you've learned. "To know that you know that you know" is to be certain of something because you learned it by experiencing it directly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I think Sanford is saying that he went to Argentina because he believed that he had discovered true love and wanted to be certain of that, even if it went against his own moral code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Story?id=8016906"&gt;Today's news&lt;/a&gt; brings another example of the same construction, this time from Sarah Palin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Kate Snow:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you happy?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sarah Palin:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m extremely happy!  I know that I know that I know this is the right thing for Alaska.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boring and obvious interpretation would be that piling up instances of &lt;em&gt;know that&lt;/em&gt; is just a form of emphasis by duplication, something like &lt;em&gt;very very very&lt;/em&gt; or&lt;em&gt; big big big&lt;/em&gt;. But we don&amp;#39;t usually create emphasis by stacking up propositional complements. You can say &amp;quot;I hope hope hope that X&amp;quot; to mean &amp;quot;I really hope that X&amp;quot; –  but &amp;quot;I hope that I hope that I hope that X&amp;quot; is just a strange form of emotional detachment, not an emphatic hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So William's analysis explains something that seems to need explaining. And the prevalence of religious examples among the web hits for &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=%22know+that+I+know+that+I+know%22&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search"&gt;"know that I know that I know"&lt;/a&gt; adds plausibility to his account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's strange, if true, that each epistemological layer should add the specific non-compositional meaning he gives: &lt;em&gt;"To know" something is to have learned about it. "To know that you know" is to be certain of something you've learned. "To know that you know that you know" is to be certain of something because you learned it by experiencing it directly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most linguistic theories allow for this kind of phrasal semantic suppletion, in principle — there&amp;#39;s the special meaning of idioms, for example. But I can&amp;#39;t think of any other examples like this one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247004071089"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/07/tam-7/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fe01810ef33d9ebf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="JREF"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">TAM 7!</title><published>2009-07-07T21:18:28Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T21:18:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/07/tam-7/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Today I leave on wings of steel to the shimmering mirage in the desert, Las Vegas. &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;The Amaz!ng Meeting 7&lt;/a&gt; starts on Thursday night, and I’m heading out a little early so I can help set up, stuff folders, sweep, carry &lt;a href="http://twistedphysics.typepad.com/cocktail_party_physics/2009/06/body-heat.html"&gt;Jen-Luc’s beret&lt;/a&gt;, whatever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how much time I’ll have to update the blog, but I’ll do what I can. I’ll also be using Twitter a lot at the meeting, &lt;a href="http://twitter./com/BadAstronomer"&gt;so follow me there&lt;/a&gt;! I’ll be uploading images from my Twitter account as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any BABloggee are coming to TAM, and we’ve never met before, make sure you come and say hi! And if we &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; met, well, that’s OK too. TAM is all about meeting and greeting and chatting. I’ll be doing a lot of that myself; I’m a major fanboy of a lot of the folks who are attending and I always release my inner squee when I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also marks the beginning of a ton of travel and talks for me, so I’ll have to make sure I take all echinacea and Zycam and Head On and 300 C diluted water and acupuncture and detoxifying foot pads and get my subluxations alleviated. I’d hate to let a little reality get between me and, well, reality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247002935612"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/proprioception_and_the_brain">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/91d16c6fa838be96</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Proprioception and the Brain</title><published>2009-07-07T21:26:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T21:26:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/proprioception_and_the_brain" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.allplayrec.com/LadderRung.JPG" height="170" alt="Ladder rung &amp;amp; sneaker from http://www.allplayrec.com/LadderRung.JPG" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-right:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="190"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Interesting study &lt;i&gt;(which &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/sensory_processing_movement_and_brainz"&gt;Dora just posted on&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/i&gt; on whether there's a connection between "deficits in motor control, imitation and social function" in autistic children and a "dysfunction in the neural basis of representing internal models of action" in the July 5th &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nn.2356.html"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nn.2356.html"&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt;, quoted in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Representation of internal models of action in the autistic brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have deficits in motor control, imitation and social function. Does a dysfunction in the neural basis of representing internal models of action contribute to these problems? We measured patterns of generalization as children learned to control a novel tool and found that the autistic brain built a stronger than normal association between self-generated motor commands and proprioceptive feedback; furthermore, the greater the reliance on proprioception, the greater the child's impairments in social function and imitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proprioception includes, according to a &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8064352"&gt;1994 Journal of Neurophysiology study&lt;/a&gt;, "all somatosensory information related to joint posture and kinematics." I've mostly heard the word used by occupational therapists in relation to sensory integration. A &lt;a href="http://www.wrongplanet.net/postx450-60-0.html"&gt;Wrong Planet forum&lt;/a&gt; refers to proprioception in terms of "body awareness"; a website on &lt;a href="http://www.sensory-processing-disorder.com/proprioceptive-dysfunction.html"&gt;sensory processing disorder&lt;/a&gt; suggests that "proprioceptive dysfunction" is the "REAL Reason He Keeps Crashing, Jumping, Tripping, Falling, Writing Too Dark, And Breaking Things!".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nn.2356.html"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; study interests me as it suggests what might be happening, or not happening, with Charlie thinking about doing some action, trying to get his hand or leg or body part to do it, and something signals getting "crossed." It's hard to know what certain motor actions seem like to him in his mind, with his limited language: We tried for years to show Charlie to tie a knot with his shoelaces and finally set that task aside (he prefers &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/its_all_part_of_the_design"&gt;slip-on shoes&lt;/a&gt; anyways). I often had the sense that he just didn't know where to position his fingers and how to move them to form the knot, and no amount of pictures or photos seemed to help (they just made him more frustrated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim and I have long noted that Charlie struggles to coordinate his body's motor (gross and fine) movements with our and other's verbal directions. We've also long observed that, even when Charlie is giving every indication of wanting to do some motor activity (holding a pencil, using a bat to hit a ball off a tee, climbing down a ladder), he often has balked, asked for help, refused to do it, or moved slowly and fitfully. He sometimes uses too much force when touching or patting someone or something. Lying face down with his hands under his body is still a position of comfort for him, and he still (though not nearly as much as he used to) wraps himself tightly in a big fleece blanket for comfort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Charlie is currently so athletic and at ease on his bike, it's easy to forget, if not disbelieve, that he might struggle with other aspects of mind-body and physical coordination, and in ways that are invisible, until you look a little more closely.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247002719953"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticblog.org/?p=3347">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5b38e41dd80cda29</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">TAM7 B.Y.O.S. (Bring Your Own Show)</title><published>2009-07-07T21:11:47Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T21:11:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/07/07/byos/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.skepticblog.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I work away on all my various production projects and try to get things settled for a few days away the end of this week, one thing is in the back of my mind… The Amazing Meeting is this week! Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TAM7 as we affectionately call it is the largest yearly meet-up and conference of skeptics in the world.  Brought to us by The James Randi Educational Foundation, and headed up by none other than fellow Skeptologist and SkepticBlog contributor Phil Plait. He’ll be the M.C. at the event which will bring together I’m betting easily over a thousand skeptics from all over the US and the world.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year at TAM6, in Las Vegas, I was proud to be able to screen an early cut of The Skeptologists to a good part of the group during on one the lunch breaks.  We’ve made a few changes since then and my only regret is that I’m not going to TAM7 with a big announcement that we’ve signed a network deal for the show. We have a great show, and an incredible cast, and the content is terrific.  The one critical thing that is missing: A network rep that is willing to stick his neck out on a science based show that is a bit left of center. — So far…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TAM7 will not be without it’s share of announcements and presentations.  I know that the Skeptics Guide to the Universe folks will be debuting a project that they are working on and Brian Dunning and I just might be bringing a rough-cut of a little project that we cobbled together last week.  In addition we’ll be bringing what we affectionately call our Network Promo” of The Skeptologists which is a 3 minute promo reel that shows the highlights of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Prady, the creator of The Big Bang Theory on CBS is the keynote speaker, and I think that this speaks highly to how the skeptical community has begun to embrace the importance of media and entertainment in getting the message out to a mass audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I look forward to meeting and talking with as many skeptics and critical thinkers as I can this coming weekend, my main goal is to make as many connections with people that may help us get The Skeptologists on the air as possible.  We’ve already got some pretty high-power meetings set-up and I have high hopes for them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate of network TV has changed drastically in the last year and our show, which would have been a slam dunk pitch a year ago, is now a tougher sell in an environment where nets want more conflict, violence and cheap thrills.  There are a few notable exceptions to that rule, and we are carefully crafting our approaches to each of them as we work to get a good deal signed.  I’m not content to just get any old deal and move forward, there’s a lot of critical pieces that I want in place so that I know this show will be able to be produced with integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve had a long and winding road to where we are now.  We haven’t made it to our destination, but we have certainly come a long way.   As we all head to the oasis in the desert, I hope that our trip from there will continue forward successfully and with renewed enthusiasm and some great direction.&lt;/p&gt;

The tension between science and irrationality was the original inspiration for this blog. There are a few elements that I would have approached differently, of course&amp;lt;&amp;gt; But my quibbles are minor and none detract from the the book’s primary strength: solid, concise writing that wastes no ink or paper (just 132 pages, not counting endnotes) getting to the heart of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The most famous story from that early period is the construction of a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/05/carolus_linnaeus_floral_clocks.php" title=""&gt;Flower Clock by Karl Linne&lt;/a&gt;, the father of taxonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, of course I got really exited when I saw, on the Mainau island last Friday, a reconstructed Linnaeus' floral clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2009/07/linaeus_floral_clock_on_the_is/Lindau%20055.jpg" width="336" height="448" alt="Lindau 055.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I looked carefully - and noticed it was not telling the correct time. This was taken at 3pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2009/07/linaeus_floral_clock_on_the_is/Lindau%20056.jpg" width="448" height="336" alt="Lindau 056.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thought about it for a second....and, well, this is what I think is going on here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2009/07/linaeus_floral_clock_on_the_is/Lindau%20057.jpg" width="336" height="448" alt="Lindau 057.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2009/07/linaeus_floral_clock_on_the_is/Lindau%20058.jpg" width="336" height="448" alt="Lindau 058.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Linnaeus' clock is a 12-hour clock, not a 24-hour one. It does not include plants that flower at night. The division of the daytime into 12 hours makes sense only during the equinox. As daylength changes during the year, each hour will become gradually longer than 60 minutes for six months, then shorter then 60 minutes for six months. Thus, such a clock will not be precise on any day except the (spring) equinox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2009/07/linaeus_floral_clock_on_the_is/Lindau%20059.jpg" width="336" height="448" alt="Lindau 059.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2009/07/linaeus_floral_clock_on_the_is/Lindau%20060.jpg" width="336" height="448" alt="Lindau 060.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the latitude of Mainau in Germany is different from that in Upsalla in Sweden. And yet, the same species of flowers were used in both places. Thus, the photoperiod will be different and plants will flower at different times of day at these two places (again, except on the day of spring equinox).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2009/07/linaeus_floral_clock_on_the_is/Lindau%20061.jpg" width="336" height="448" alt="Lindau 061.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2009/07/linaeus_floral_clock_on_the_is/Lindau%20062.jpg" width="336" height="448" alt="Lindau 062.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very pretty - but not a precise time-piece....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2009/07/linaeus_floral_clock_on_the_is/Lindau%20063.jpg" width="336" height="448" alt="Lindau 063.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2009/07/linaeus_floral_clock_on_the_is/Lindau%20064.jpg" width="336" height="448" alt="Lindau 064.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2009/07/linaeus_floral_clock_on_the_is/Lindau%20065.jpg" width="336" height="448" alt="Lindau 065.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Katherine Haxton of the &lt;a href="http://www.possibilitiesendless.com/" title=""&gt;Endless Possibilities&lt;/a&gt; blog (see the archives of her Nature Network blog &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/kjh2/blog" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello!  I'm Katherine and I'm a chemist.  Don't worry, I'm not just going to talk about molecules and things that might explode.  I've been a chemist since I figured out that I was a poor excuse for a physics undergrad and have never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently quite happy with the job I have, but don't rule out the prospect of doing something else in the future.  I don't intend to grow up, I just plan on growing old. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In real life I am a lecturer in chemistry in Britain.  It's a bit of a strange job really because it includes all the research stuff that you'd expect of an academic, a large whack of teaching and a whole load of other stuff that I never expected to be doing.  At the moment, I wouldn't want to do anything else, well, except spend a little more time in the lab perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="katharinehaxton pic.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/katharinehaxton%20pic.JPG" width="300" height="400" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good question!  I think the web offers us an amazing opportunity to connect with people, information and ideas.  It gives us the chance to communicate directly with all aspects of society (who use the web), and explain who we are and what we do.  We also have the opportunity to work more effectively as scientists, sharing data and information, making things more freely available.  The web hosts a wonderful array of collaborative tools for scientists, I'd like to see more tools being developed for scientists and 'the public' to engage with the issues and ideas that come up again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a bad blogger at the moment, struggling to find my writing voice now that I've gone to the trouble of setting up &lt;a href="http://www.possibilitiesendless.com/" title=""&gt;my own blog website&lt;/a&gt;. I'm having better luck with Twitter which was unexpected - I agreed to try Twitter for 30 days and see if I 'got it'.  Now I find it very useful for information gathering and satisfying my need for gossip!  I see blogging and Twitter as forms of outreach - between chemists, scientists and just generally reaching out in general. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stumbled on science blogs by accident a few years ago.  I remember quite clearly reading the early NatureNetwork blogs like Anna Kushnir's Blog, &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/U2929A0EA/blog" title=""&gt;LabLife&lt;/a&gt;.  My favourites include &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/highlyallochthonous" title=""&gt;Highly Allochthonous&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencewoman/" title=""&gt;ScienceWomen&lt;/a&gt;, and it was a real privilege to get to meet the authors of those blogs back in January.  I'm particularly enjoying this summer's crop of conference blogging/twittering from various chemistry conferences and the Lindau meeting.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the conference I've started reading &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/" title=""&gt;WhiteCoatUnderground&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://skullsinthestars.com/" title=""&gt;Skull in the Stars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://almostdiamonds.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Almost Diamonds&lt;/a&gt;.  I've implemented a 'one in one out' Google reader policy - for every new blog I want to read,Ｉhave to remove a blog that isn't updated often or that I no longer feel a connection with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In many online discussions, especially on sensitive topics like politics, religion and feminism, the "tone argument" raises its head, where one side, usually representing traditional power, tries to silence the other by insisting on politeness, while the other side tries to undermine the traditional power structure by shocking with impoliteness. The former sees the latter as rude, the latter perceives the former as dishonest. Do you think there is also a geographical or cultural difference in where exactly the line lies between civil and uncivil discourse? Is there, for example, a set of words, phrases or "tones" that may be considered perfectly civil by (some of) the Americans, but horribly impolite by (some of) the Brits? And if so, is there a way to point out to cultural differences in order to resolve a debate?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very complicated issue and really the tone argument just gets in the way.  My personal opinion is that we could all do to be more tolerant of those who disagree with us, and more conscious of how our words and statements can be misinterpreted.  There has been quite a bit of discussion about rules and protocols surrounding blogging, and that's been quite fascinating.  I believe that the blogger sets the tone for the comments thread, through moderation, counter-comment and other indicators of acceptable behaviour.  And those standards of acceptable behaviour vary widely between blogs, as they should.  I think some bloggers forget that the diversity of experience their readership brings to any issue is the most important aspect of using this medium to communicate, mainly through their desire to be agreed with.  I dislike intensely those bloggers who inspire persecution against opinions different to their own, and those who incessantly use impolite shock tactics - like anything, impoliteness looses its impact when continually overused (no, it doesn't become an iconic trademark of a particular blogger, it just gets old). Many bloggers (yourself included) have implied that their blog is like their living room, that to read a blog post and comment is to come into the living room and join the conversation. That implies a certain standard of behavior and politeness. The converse of the politeness argument is the need for rudeness. There are times and places where the most effective way to make a point is to be rude, to issue a short, sharp shock to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think that all debates need resolving - the beauty of having cultural differences is that there is frequently no right and no wrong, just varying degrees of interpretation.  I think that's seen quite plainly in arguments about feminism (I have no time for those about religion or politics).  There seems to be a growing trend in labeling people as feminist or not, supportive or not, with no acknowledgement that everyone's perspective is, and should be, different.  Some of those differences are because of cultural issues between the US and the Brits, but we're not the sole users of the internet, something we'd all do well to remember from time to time.  We should welcome open and frank discussion of the origins of those differences rather than the creation of rules and codified behaviours to moderate, and ultimately suppress, those who disagree with us or express their viewpoint in a manner we would not have chosen ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to see a little more tolerance in these debates and a little more curiosity as to the origins of opinions, and acknowledgment that there may be cultural differences or misinterpretation.  Words are, unfortunately, an imprecise method of communication and open to many interpretations.  I don't understand the need of a minority to take everything in the worse possible light.  In an ideal world it should be possible to point out that a cultural difference or genuine misunderstanding has had an effect, but reality is usually somewhat less than ideal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was overwhelmed by how friendly and open bloggers were in 'real life'. I was amazed by the open and frank discussion in many of the sessions and felt reassured that such communities exist.  It was a very good reminder that everyone does have different points of view, but that everyone can still come together and be welcoming and friendly.  The conference inspired me to blog more (which I'm struggling to do), and work out new ways to include blogging in my job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you in person and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Bora.  It was lovely to meet you in January and I'm looking forward to next year!&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll try, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago at SkepchickCon (which was amazing and which I will try to post about later), I was having drinks with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen"&gt;Greg Laden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.starstryder.com/"&gt;Pamela Gay&lt;/a&gt;, and a few other folks. I made a comment expressing surprise that &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/health/01fda.html?_r=1&amp;amp;em"&gt;the FDA is considering a ban on Vicodin and Percocet&lt;/a&gt;, drugs that I’ve always considered &lt;em&gt;amazingly&lt;/em&gt; helpful. I don’t have chronic pain issues, but as many of you know I do play physically demanding sports and also get hit by cars a lot. I also have serious back problems that I can usually keep under control with physical therapy but often require heavy-duty pain meds. I was a little horrified that the magical drugs might go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg and Pamela explained that the problem was the combination of drugs contained in those pills—an opioid, which can be addictive, and acetaminophen, which can destroy the liver. The idea (as I understand it) is that if those are separated, people who become addicted to the op can at least take less of the acetaminophen and thus spare their livers. Also, people with pain may be able to continue taking the opioid but with lesser doses of acetaminophen because separating the two will make it possible for patients to determine if they are able to achieve adequate pain control without the full dose of acetaminophen contained in each combination pill.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That struck me as rather logical and even kind, since it’s not often I hear our government attempt to actually help people with drug addictions, other than stupidly insisting they stop taking drugs. However, I was curious to hear the opposing viewpoint, which is why I was happy to see &lt;a href="http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2009/07/06/federal-advisory-panel-recommends-ban-on-vicodin-percocet/" rel="nofollow"&gt;just such a viewpoint&lt;/a&gt; pop up in my feed reader yesterday, courtesy of “amandaw” at Feministe, a feminist blog I read quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the post didn’t really clarify anything for me. She wrote that after the ban, chronic pain patients would have “to jump through an increasing number of hoops to obtain effective treatment,” but then failed to explain what that would entail. She made a case for why opioids are necessary for some patients, which isn’t an issue here since opioids were not being banned. She then suggests that if doctors are willing to advise patients to take Tylenol with their opioid, then they should be willing to advise them not to abuse a Tylenol/opioid combination. That seems to oversimplify the difficulty of addiction, but even if true, it doesn’t explain why this would significantly impact the lives of patients currently taking the combo drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also talks a good deal about how her life would be awful without Vicodin, and how difficult it is for her to get her needed dosage. This may be true, but it still didn’t explain for me what would change if the Tylenol were taken separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading the post several times, I clicked through to read the comments in the hopes that someone would answer the question. Happily, someone did. In comment #17, W. Kiernan explains that the combination drug is classified as Schedule III, while the opioid alone is Schedule II. This means that it’s easier for a patient to get the combination drug, which means they will face additional hurdles unless the opioid are reclassified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading that allowed me to make up my mind on where I stand: before these drugs are banned, the government must reclassify those opioids and ensure that patients will still have access to the pain meds they need. Also, accessibility to the full spectrum of evidence-based pain management services should be enhanced. As amandaw mentioned in her post, the use of pain meds is only one part of management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other comments on the thread, though, really surprised me. “Malathion” takes issue with another commenter’s assertion that “People who take these medications KNOW that they can cause liver damage.” Malathion says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is – this isn’t really true. According to the New York Times, “even recommended doses can cause liver damage in some people. And more than 400 people die and 42,000 are hospitalized every year in the United States from overdoses.” I’ve been prescribed Vicodin before, and I had no idea that a recommended dose could hurt me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with you that patients’ rights suffer when the government regulates with a heavy hand. But the medical profession has proven unable to properly manage drug interactions — over 20,000 deaths were caused by drug interactions in 2004. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/23/AR2007022301780.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also agree that educated medical consumers like you (people with access to the internet and other sources of research and the ability to effectively advocate for themselves with doctors) can and should be able to make these decisions for themselves, in an ideal world. But the government is supposed to protect everyone, not just those people smart enough/resourceful enough to figure out their prescriptions for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In making these comments, I am in no way saying that I don’t think people have a right to narcotic pain relief. That seems to be the crux of the problem here — it’s harder to get plain narcotics prescribed than it should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which amandaw responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;See folks, we have to “protect” those stupid, clueless, completely-removed-of-agency people who might abuse things. We’re the smart people, but some folks out there aren’t like us! They just don’t know how to manage their own lives, so we have to do it for them, yanno? Sigh, the abled man’s burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t reprint the entire thread here, but I wanted to give a taste of the way that facts and an opposing viewpoint, which is expressed incredibly politely, are met with ridicule and strawmen. I made the mistake of stepping in, writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amandaw: Mark and others have offered very well-reasoned and factual input to this discussion, clarifying important information about why these drugs may be banned and what that means for those who require them for pain management. Mark’s post had no attitude and not once did he imply anything about “God’s Gift To Us.” He didn’t even write that anything was “just that easy,” despite your use of quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read Feministe often and agree with the bulk of what’s here, but your OP and follow-up comments have surprised me. Instead of fostering a discussion about the topic, you’ve responded to reasonable facts with emotional appeals, insults, and strawmen. I understand that the topic is of extreme importance to you, but you might make a more persuasive argument if you addressed the points made and realized that no one is attacking you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, I was told I was privileged, patronizing, and not a feminist. The moderator said I was out of line. I was told that people with disabilities have a right to be angry, that I am ignoring them, and that I obviously don’t want to understand their viewpoints. My statement is completely twisted to mean things completely removed from the topic, such as that women have to “play nice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the responses left me seriously depressed. On Bug Girl’s advice, I turned to our good friend Lucy, a pain-management specialist, skeptic, and all-around amazing woman, to help me better understand the many issues surrounding this topic. Her response was so illuminating that I’m going to post it here—she says the comments on that blog are understandable, considering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They cannot respond to the facts and opposing viewpoints in a rational way because ironically, they have adopted their own position of privilege – the PWD. Somehow, being a PWD means you have exclusive access to truth and cannot be questioned or doubted. It means that the usual standards of scientific evidence applied in medicine no longer count. So, anecdote (lived experience) trumps the insight and information of professionals. ONLY PWD can understand disabilities and can make rational decisions about their management. The FDA, doctors etc. are not to be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of this does indeed come from a long history of inadequate care for people with pain. As recently as three decades ago, even people dying from cancer were denied opioids in the last few weeks of life for fear they would become addicts. And today, while opioids are more readily available to people with chronic non-cancer pain, there still exists a stigma against these people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However, there is a need for balance. Access has to be balanced with safety. Availability of safer formulations of drugs (the schedule change you mention), development of newer safer mechanism targeted drugs without addictive potential, and increased health related literacy due to warning on all products containing acetaminophen are potential outcomes of this change that we can and will work towards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m interested to hear what you all think about any of the topics I’ve touched on in this ridiculously long and overly serious post. Feel free to choose from the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The proposed ban: good idea or bad idea or something else?&lt;br&gt;
2. Are regulations like this imposed to protect us or control us?&lt;br&gt;
3. Is there a point where just asking questions or offering opposing facts becomes in and of itself offensive? Does this compare to the way many of us feel about Holocaust deniers or 9/11 conspiracy theorists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously I’m not going to moderate this discussion quite as severely as Feministe considers the norm, but I will ask you all to keep your comments civil. This incident has reinforced one of the things I love about the Skepchick community, which is our ability to discuss and debate topics while remaining relatively civil and occasionally even changing our minds.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246990249779"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/sensory_processing_movement_and_brainz">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8f8667700e024d97</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Sensory Processing, Movement, and Brainz</title><published>2009-07-07T17:52:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T17:52:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/sensory_processing_movement_and_brainz" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zero666/1322664382/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1163/1322664382_f2b0972e03_m.jpg" alt="black and white image of a woman&amp;#39;s head and shoulders. her hands are streaked in motion in front of her face" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In the pop-sci news, a study from Kennedy Kreiger on &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090706113647.htm"&gt;vestibular vs. visual learning&lt;/a&gt; of new movements.  The study found that autistic children relied more on their vestibular sense than on visual information when learning new movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll not argue that some of us on the spectrum have &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autism_and_motor_planning"&gt;motor differences&lt;/a&gt; (another Kennedy Kreiger study, as well as other studies, referenced from that link).  I'll also not argue that sensory processing differences play a large role for some of us in how we learn about and interact with the world (for example, the recent &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/sensory_integration_and_implications_on_understanding_speech"&gt;sensory integration and speech&lt;/a&gt; article).  I do wonder some things though about this quote from one of the study's investigators (bearing in mind of course I have no clue how out of context this quote has been taken by prior authors, and am, in this domain, a lay person myself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings not only demonstrate why children with autism have difficulty learning motor skills, but also provide real insight into why these children have difficulty learning to interact with the world around them," said Dr. Reza Shadmehr, senior study author and Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Neuroscience at the John Hopkins University School of Medicine. "If the way their brain is wired is not allowing them to rely as much as typically developing children on external visual cues to guide behavior, they may have difficulty learning how to interact with other people and interpret the nature of other people's actions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it's as simple as just a lack of visual cues to guide behavior, than why don't all blind people also receive an ASD diagnosis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do some of us have trouble learning motor skills because we aren't relying much on visual cues, or is it more that we are relying less on visual cues because of sensory integration issues and the motor skills issues are an entirely separate deal?  Or even that we are relying less on visuals because of the concentration that motor planning involves; i.e. needing to "turn off" vision in order to concentrate on the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_Dyspraxia"&gt;intense task of motor planning&lt;/a&gt;?  There seem to be many, many possible explanations for what is observed to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think?  Is the study and quote convincing or just an oversimplification of the true complexity of our mind, brain, and body relationships?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246989968959"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13475">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/50a6693ea6178593</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Pop Culture"/><title type="html">Michael Jackson in a Tree Stump</title><published>2009-07-07T18:00:16Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T18:00:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/07/michael-jackson-in-a-tree-stump/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don’t know whether to cry or laugh… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Stockton, California, &lt;strong&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/strong&gt; has supposedly appeared in a tree stump.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst.  Pareidolia.  Ever.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t see Jackson.  I don’t see Jesus.  I don’t see anyone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;Embedded video from &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/video"&gt;CNN Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money quotation, when asked why Jackson would appear in Stockton of all places:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Lady&lt;/strong&gt;: “To Stockton, Michael Jackson meant more to us than maybe Jesus did to some people.  I think they’re both about even; they’re both icons.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great… now I have a visual in my head of Jesus moonwalking on water.&lt;/p&gt;

I recently gave a talk at the National Academy of Sciences about science blogging, social networking, and communication in general. I had a lot of fun, and &lt;a href="http://media.nap.edu/podcasts/nax87science_20.mp3"&gt;the NAS has posted a podcast about the meeting with some excerpts of what I said&lt;/a&gt; (they have &lt;a href="http://media.nap.edu/podcasts/"&gt;a list of older ‘casts&lt;/a&gt; as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/09/13/the-evolution-of-revolution/"&gt;I’ve talked about this before&lt;/a&gt;, this new media we’re facing and embracing. Well, &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of us are embracing it. Recently, fellow science/skeptic blogger Ben Goldacre ran into some static from a journalist who just doesn’t get it, and in fact appears to have his fingers firmly in his ears while he yells &amp;quot;LALALALALALA!&amp;quot;. I was all set to write about this, but yet another fellow science/skeptic blogger,  Steve Novella, &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/07/06/the-new-journalism/"&gt;took the electrons right out of my keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s right: we need to look to the internet as a solution and opportunity, not a road block to information. Newspapers and other media who took the latter path are finding themselves starved of revenue, because &lt;em&gt;they just don’t get it&lt;/em&gt;. Ones who did — like Discover and Seed magazines — are flourishing online. I’d say that’s pretty strong evidence that media and journalists taking hold of this not-so-new medium are the ones who will still be around in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246987951980"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3036070768804518015.post-7928493617087377565">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/19c0b0b10fb12f68</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Prospecting Potter</title><published>2009-07-07T16:56:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T17:12:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.nap.edu/~r/x-changefiles/~3/4ZLTmnDCpcI/prospecting-potter.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/feeds/7928493617087377565/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2009/07/prospecting-potter.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2009/07/prospecting-potter.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/blog" type="html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SlOBIbsWD6I/AAAAAAAAACs/bkx--i-l5yk/s1600-h/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-01.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;float:right;width:134px;height:200px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SlOBIbsWD6I/AAAAAAAAACs/bkx--i-l5yk/s200/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-01.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we tell you that there are teaching moments in every film that could get a conversation started about science, we really do mean &lt;u&gt;every&lt;/u&gt; film.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We can prove it too.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We’re not afraid to put our money where our mouth is: &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417741/"&gt;HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Here’s a film about magic that takes place in a fantastical land where anything seems possible and Muggle science feels misguided and trivial… or so you thought.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rogerhighfield.com/"&gt;Dr. Roger Highfield&lt;/a&gt;, the Science Editor of &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; Commentator, wrote a book in 2002 called &lt;a href="http://www.teachersource.com/Books_SoftwareAndVideos/Books/TheScienceOfHarryPotter.aspx"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Science of Harry Potter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that covers many of the “teaching moments” that could get a conversation started using the brilliant world of J.K.

But we may need to start preparing for another round of bank failures ... in the virtual world.

If indeed it happens, a character named &lt;strong&gt;Ricdic&lt;/strong&gt; will likely be to blame. Ricdic is part of Eve Online, which I have never heard of, but according to this &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8132547.stm"&gt;BBC news report&lt;/a&gt; "has about 300,000 players all of whom inhabit the same online universe.

&lt;p&gt;Is it modesty?  No.  &lt;strong&gt;Carrie Prejean&lt;/strong&gt; (the former Ms. California) posed nude years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it family values?  A look at &lt;strong&gt;Mark Sanford&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jon &amp;amp; Kate Gosselin&lt;/strong&gt; suggests otherwise.  Divorce occurs &lt;a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/bc/2005/janfeb/3.8.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; often&lt;/a&gt; in “born-again” Christian families than in the general population. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it honesty?  &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Palin&lt;/strong&gt; has told &lt;a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/07/the-odd-lies-of-sarah-palin-xxxi-todd-and-the-aip.html"&gt;lie after lie after lie&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Galli&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Christianity Today&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/julyweb-only/126-42.0.html"&gt;disturbed by this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is coupled with the long-standing evangelical myth that there should be &lt;em&gt;something different&lt;/em&gt; about the Christian. A look. An attitude. A lifestyle. Something noticeable, something that causes the unbeliever to pause and wonder, “What does that person have?” Because it is such an integral part of our evangelistic method, we spend enormous amounts of psychic energy trying exude that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we find, more days than not, that there’s not much to that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. We drop our coffee and blurt out a four-letter word, or we drink too much at the office party, or we fail to enquire about the welfare of a neighbor who just discovered she has cancer. Most days, we seem to be no different from the rest of humanity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He goes on to say that while he may be a better person himself for being a Christian, “I’m always running into non-Christians who appear to be as patient, caring, kind, and compassionate as I am.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which I gather is not surprising to most atheists.  No religion has a monopoly on morality.  Belief in God doesn’t make you behave any better than a rational person who opts not to believe.  There’s nothing special about Christians in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of coming to that conclusion, though, Galli ends on a platitude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… What we [Christians] offer the world is our broken lives, saying, “We are sinners saved by grace.” What we offer the world is &lt;em&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;him crucified&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which isn’t saying much to non-Christians who don’t buy into that story, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do atheists have to offer the world that is unique to us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that came to my mind: A rational outlook on life that is based on evidence and not thinking we know all the answers to the big questions in life.&lt;br&gt;

to &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465013058?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0465013058"&gt;our book&lt;/a&gt;–but he &lt;em&gt;hates&lt;/em&gt; the way we, and many others writing trade books, handle endnotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orzel’s post on this matter, entitled “Death to the Un-Noted Endnote,” can be found &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2009/07/death_to_the_un-noted_endnote.php#c1757044"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In it, he writes the following of our book and another by &lt;a href="http://inversesquare.wordpress.com/"&gt;Tom Levenson&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they have very different subjects…they have one unfortunate element in common, one of the most pernicious ideas in non-fiction publishing: the un-noted endnote. Both books are exhaustively researched and contain many pages of notes at the end of the text– just under 40 pages in Levenson’s book, and a whopping 65– nearly 50% of the length of the main text– in &lt;cite&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/cite&gt;. And not a single one of those notes is indicated in the text. They all start with a page number and a phrase from the main text– for example, “87 “&lt;em&gt;being rational is considered the opposite of being creative&lt;/em&gt;“: Interview with Matthew Chapman, August 20, 2008″– but are not indicated by a number or symbol on the relevant page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate, hate &lt;strong&gt;hate&lt;/strong&gt; this. It’s especially infuriating in &lt;cite&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/cite&gt;, where the notes sometimes go on for multiple pages, and are critical to an appreciation of the main text. (Levenson’s notes in &lt;cite&gt;Newton and the Counterfeiter&lt;/cite&gt; are mostly confined to the sourcing of particular bits of information, with occasional discussion relating to the interpretation of ambiguous source material.) Reading the book without reading the endnotes lessens the book– by almost 33%, in fact– but the lack of symbols or numbers in the main text forces the reader to be some sort of literary telepath, able to intuit when the authors want to make additional remarks. Or if you’re a mere mortal like myself, you end up going back at the end of the chapter and reading through all the notes at once, making for a very disjointed reading experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay: We need to clear some things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it’s easy to pick out four key themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Fascism&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;To manage the global economy; to revive economies hit by the crisis; to avoid any deterioration of the present crisis and the greater imbalances that would result; to bring about integral and timely disarmament, food security and peace; to guarantee the protection of the environment and to regulate migration: for all this, there is urgent need of a true world political authority&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I think he stole this idea from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_Serfdom"&gt;Hayek&lt;/a&gt;, or possibly &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four"&gt;Orwell&lt;/a&gt;, or maybe both.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Monoculture&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Obviously it would have to have the authority to ensure compliance with its decisions from all parties, and also with the coordinated measures adopted in various international forums. Without this, despite the great progress accomplished in various sectors, international law would risk being conditioned by the balance of power among the strongest nations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This seems possibly related to Jesus’s famous recommendation to “Put all thine eggs in one basket.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Redistributionism “governed by politics”&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Economic life undoubtedly requires contracts, in order to regulate relations of exchange between goods of equivalent value. But it also needs just laws and forms of redistribution governed by politics&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Although he didn’t give any specific examples of “redistribution governed by politics,” the morning papers are consistently full of such stories, like “congressman seeks taxpayer dollars for &lt;a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2009366972_rainierclub22m.html"&gt;tony private club&lt;/a&gt;” and “congressman uses taxpayer dollars to fund remote, mostly-useless, &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/04/23/murtha.airport/"&gt;eponymous airport&lt;/a&gt;,” and  “city council member awards lucrative sludge-hauling contract to &lt;a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/06/conyers_wife_pleads_guilty_on_corruption_count.php"&gt;bribe-paying&lt;/a&gt; bidder.”  Obviously, the endorsement of such behavior by the church is not &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence#Abuses"&gt;without precedent&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Anti-atheism&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;ideological rejection of God and an atheism of indifference, oblivious to the Creator and at risk of becoming equally oblivious to human values, constitute some of the chief obstacles to development today.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, yes, those horrible, horrible atheists.  Why, I’m sure with their &lt;a href="http://www.adherents.com/adh_sc.html"&gt;oversized&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.adherents.com/adh_congress.html"&gt;presence&lt;/a&gt; in politics they’re getting in the way of all the religious people &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/episodes/june-26-2009/religion-and-health-care-reform/3377/"&gt;clamoring for nationalized health care&lt;/a&gt;, or perhaps they’re getting in the way of the religious people arguing &lt;a href="http://www.childandfamilyprotection.org/A%20Biblical%20Case%20Against%20Socialized%20Medicine.html"&gt;against nationalized health care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet it’s the atheists who are standing in the way of all the &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31586660/"&gt;pro-gun Christians&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in the way of all the &lt;a href="http://benwitherington.blogspot.com/2007/04/christians-and-gun-control-idea-whose.html"&gt;anti-gun Christians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it must be the atheists who are fighting against &lt;a href="http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=1005"&gt;minimum wage increases&lt;/a&gt;, while simultaneously fighting &lt;a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_6483.html"&gt;for minimum wage increases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, if you can think of a political issue that some Christians support and other Christians oppose (which includes, oh, pretty much all political issues), then probably it’s the nasty “oblivious to human values” atheists who are fighting for and against it.  You tell it to them, Benny!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246980465527"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7077/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6054c73862c7c418</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Rules on Stem Cell Research Are Eased</title><published>2009-07-07T15:38:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T15:38:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7077/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of embryonic stem cell lines, whose use in the United States had effectively been curtailed by the Bush administration, can be used to study disorders and develop cures if researchers can show the cells were derived using ethical procedures, according to new rules issued by the federal government yesterday... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In 1961 a new edition of an old and esteemed dictionary was released. The publisher courted publicity, noting the great expense ($3.5 million) and amount of work (757 editor years) that went into its making.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be $4,623.51 per editor-year,  if none of the $3.5M went for typesetters, pencils, rent, or other expenses.  And if I'm reading this &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt"&gt;CPI table&lt;/a&gt; right, the ratio of today's prices to those of 1960 is around 213.856/29.5, or about 7.25 to 1; so in today's dollars, the yearly per-editor costs would be around $33,520. Apparently lexicographers worked cheap in those days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new dictionary in question was &lt;em&gt;Webster's Third New International&lt;/em&gt; (Unabridged), and as Skinner explains,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;It was judged “subversive” and denounced in the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Atlantic, the New Yorker, Life, and dozens of other newspapers, magazines, and professional journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skinner's discussion reminds us of how serious the controversy over &lt;em&gt;Webster's Third&lt;/em&gt; really was. As a teen in the 1960s, I was vaguely aware of the fuss, but I saw it as faintly ridiculous histrionics,  like Jerry Falwell's denunciation of the Teletubbies. That's because the only sign of it that I encountered at the time was  the opening of Rex Stout's &lt;em&gt;Gambit&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1962, where &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero_Wolfe"&gt;Nero Wolfe&lt;/a&gt; tears pages out of the dictionary, one by one, and throws them into the fire. Archie explains to a would-be client:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;She was staring up at me. "He's burning up a &lt;em&gt;dictionary&lt;/em&gt;?"&lt;br&gt;
"Right. That's nothing. Once he burned up a cookbook because it said to remove the hide from a ham end before putting it in the pot with lima beans. Which he loves most, food or words, is a tossup."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps as a result, I never paid much attention to the details of the controversy. And four decades later, David Foster Wallace's long essay about the usage wars ("&lt;a href="http://instruct.westvalley.edu/lafave/DFW_present_tense.html"&gt;Tense Present&lt;/a&gt;", Harper's, April 2001) confirmed my impression that the furor over W3 was just clownish posturing by fussy eccentrics. (For chapter and verse on the clownishness, read languagehat's 8/12/2002 post "&lt;a href="http://www.languagehat.com/archives/000510.php"&gt;David Foster Wallace Demolished&lt;/a&gt;.) But Skinner's article suggests that the W3 controversy was a sign of a more serious set of issues in American intellectual history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major zeitgeist tremors aside, Skinner untangles a small scholarly puzzle about Wallace's 2001 article. DFW rails against "Descriptivism's five basic edicts", attributed to "[Philip] Gove's now classic introduction to Webster's Third". As Skinner explains, the quoted passage doesn't come from anywhere in W3, but rather from an article "Linguistic advances and lexicography" that Gove wrote for &lt;em&gt;Word Study&lt;/em&gt;, a Merriam-Webster newsletter for teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.metafilter.com/24721/Naom-Chomsky#464906"&gt;2003 comment at Metafilter&lt;/a&gt;, before taking up DFW's arguments against this list of  "Descriptivism's edicts", languagehat observed that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I have a copy of Webster's Third International, and there's no such list; in fact, there's no Introduction, just a short Preface that doesn't discuss theoretical matters. But I don't want to be unfair; rather than assume DFW is making the whole thing up, I'll assume my printing is lacking the Introduction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Skinner explains, Gove's article in &lt;em&gt;Word Study&lt;/em&gt; quoted five "precepts of linguistics", which he took from a 1952 work &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Z4k0AAAAMAAJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The English Language Arts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by the Commission on the English Curriculum of the National Council of Teachers of English. According to &lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1082487"&gt;Elizabeth Rusk in &lt;em&gt;The School Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 60(8): 500-501, 1952, this work &amp;quot;represents a major attempt at consensus on basic issues […] The thirty-one members of the Commission and the more than one hundred members of the Committee on Reading and Literature represent all levels of the educational system and all sections of the country.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission's five "precepts of linguistics" were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;1—Language changes constantly.&lt;br&gt;
2—Change is normal.&lt;br&gt;
3—Spoken language is the language.&lt;br&gt;
4—Correctness rests upon usage.&lt;br&gt;
5—All usage is relative. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skinner observes that "[w]hile these precepts may seem quite radical, they are in reality a defense of convention".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href="http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2009-07/Webster.html"&gt;Skinner's article&lt;/a&gt; for more on how DFW made this list "the centerpiece of a somewhat lengthy attack on &lt;em&gt;Webster’s Third &lt;/em&gt;and Gove’s editing of it". Skinner gives us a hint about how this probably happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[Dwight] Macdonald attributed W3’s radical departure from what he called “the old school” to the sinister influence of structural linguistics. As evidence, he quoted from, without tracing the exact source, Gove’s article on the teaching of language arts, “Linguistic Advances and Lexicography.”  Wrote Macdonald, “Dr. Gove and the other makers of 3 are sympathetic to the school of language study that has become dominant since 1934. It is sometimes called Structural Linguistics.” He then introduced the five precepts mentioned earlier by making it sound as if Gove had written them, “Dr. Gove gives its basic concepts as . . .”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's likely that DFW got the list of "edicts" from MacDonald's review, which was republished in his 1962 collection of essays &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Against-American-Grain-Capo-paperback/dp/0306802058/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Against the American Grain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. DFW probably didn't get it directly from Gove's little article "Linguistic Advances and Lexicography", which would have been hard for him to find in 2001; and he certainly didn't get it from the source that he attributes it to, namely Gove's Introduction to W3, since there is no such introduction, and the Preface is brief and innocuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more careful textual analysis of Wallace, MacDonald, and Gove might confirm or refute this hypothesis, which suggests that Wallace was guilty of the form of semi-plagiarism that consists of failing to cite the intermediate source of a quotation, and failing to check the quotation against its primary source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skinner again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;It seems fair to wonder if Wallace, for all his bluster, had much experience using W3. In the same essay, he credited Philip Gove with coining the terms &lt;em&gt;descriptivist&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;prescriptivist&lt;/em&gt; to represent the warring sides over usage, but he could have looked up the terms to find they were already so defined in W3, in which case they certainly predated Gove’s use of them following the dictionary’s publication. He also repeats the old &lt;em&gt;Life&lt;/em&gt; magazine mistake concerning &lt;em&gt;irregardless&lt;/em&gt; and commits yet another concerning the labeling of the dialectical variant &lt;em&gt;heighth&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or he could have checked the OED, and found these citations:&lt;/p&gt;

As a result of his failing to undergo his complete course of chemotherapy, his cancer returned with a vengeance. As of one year ago, his odds of survival were estimated to be no more than 10-20%, after having had a good prognosis when initially diagnosed. At the time, I thought it was entirely appropriate for the state to prosecute Kristen LaBrie for medical neglect and even negligent homicide if Jeremy were to die, which at the time seemed very likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the likely came to pass in March. Jeremy died, and now Kristen is being &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31754066/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/"&gt;prosecuted for manslaughter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;SALEM, Mass. - A woman accused of withholding cancer treatment from her autistic son has been charged with attempted murder.

&lt;p&gt;Kristen LaBrie is scheduled to appear in Salem Superior Court on Monday on charges of attempted murder, child endangerment and permitting bodily injury to a disabled person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LaBrie is &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31762322/ns/us_news/"&gt;denying the charges&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/prosecuting_another_case_of_medical_negl.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/prosecuting_another_case_of_medical_negl.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/L3zxNew-jhs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246979385804"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/2009/07/tam_7.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a3cc568b29cccdc3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Social Events"/><title type="html">TAM 7</title><published>2009-07-07T13:03:17Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T13:03:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ScienceAfterSunclipse/~3/ojIXiAPK30w/tam_7.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/2009/07/tam_7.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As it happens, a prior engagement will put me in the vicinity of &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;The Amaz!ing Meeting 7&lt;/a&gt; this weekend.

So it looks like you are expecting the UK's GMC to acquit him. And just like The Sunday Glaxo you want to start all sorts of new unfounded accusations to keep the MMR controversy running forever? Smart move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when are you going to start accusing CHS of lying? Bowditch can hardly ever write a sentence without accusing people of lying and you normally do much the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Looks like someone eise is desperate that they thought sending in you two characters might be worth doing.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;He was responding to my comment:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Let’s see…you make a claim that the PCC ordered Deer to removethe articles, and, Peter Bowditch says that the PCC website does not mention it. Then, you personally attack Pter Bowditch. Sounds like you are desperate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for Wakefield, the testimony during the Omnibus hearings should be use to indict him for gross negligence, willful harming of children and being a lying quack in the first degree. I read the entire transcript, every single word, and listened to much of the testimony. The experts submitted by the government destroyed any pretense of objectivity and competence that Wakefield may pretend to have.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Clearly, this blogger does not have a clue as too truth or logic. Another woefully blinded supporter of Wakefield.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, here is a serious question...Does anyone know what Wakefield is doing behind closed doors at Thoughtful House in Austin, Texas? He does not have a license to practice medicine anywhere in the US, and hopefully, will not have one in the UK soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and I expect the UK's GMC not to acquit Wakefield, but to strip him of his license and publicly tar and feather him. This is Britain, you know. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:180%;color:#ff0000"&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went back to this suppository of ignorance and found that yet, again, another response of mine was deleted. Thus, I wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This is fast becoming a bastion of censorship. Now I have had two posts censored.&lt;br&gt;However, the purely ad hominem attack on Peter Bowditch remains, and the drivel from John Stone, where he tortures logic and twists the facts to blame The Times and Brian Deer, when it was the duplicitous Wakefield who broke the gentlemen's agreement, remains intact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, this blog has become another suppository of censorship, run by a pro-infectious disease merchant of disability amd death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;What are these people so damn afraid of? Why can't they engage in discussion?&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Hinde is the elder statesman of the science of Ethology and one one of the most respected figures in British biology. I just met him at the big Cambridge Darwin Festival. Robert had agreed to speak in one of the sessions on 'Religion and Science' but withdrew on learning that it was sponsored by the Templeton Foundation. He is now even more respected among British biologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need more of this kind of action, and we need to publicize it more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other curious phenomenon: I searched the website for the festival for mention of the Templeton Foundation sponsorship. It's not there! It is, apparently, noted in very small type on the printed program. Isn't that odd that a big bucks foundation would be so shy about having their involvement advertised? Maybe it's because it's getting around that associating with the Templeton is a mark of shame, and the Templeton itself has noticed that people tend to turn away when their name is mentioned. Or maybe they're just noble and self-effacing.

I get enough creationist nonsense in my private email, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; are the ones who are supposed to smash the creationist lackwits who are babbling in the comments here. Now one of them, this fellow Grant, is apparently unsatisfied with the drubbing you were supposed to give him, and is now trying to pester me personally by email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also going to rebuke you Australians — he&amp;#39;s one of yours, running some kind of &lt;a href="http://seeitdesignstudio.com/about.php"&gt;web design studio&lt;/a&gt;, where he claims 14 years of experience in "Science". Come on, take this personally and rip into him.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You believe the world is older than 6000 years.  I believe it is not.  Do you want to call me a dingbat also? Or can you possibly raise your intelligence level a little higher to discuss things more maturely.  (I actually believe we need some laws to protect the earth, unlike the senator)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you know science, and I'm hoping you do, you will know that science CANNOT prove what happened at the beginning of the earth (whenever it was).  All both sides can do is look at the evidence and analyse it to see if it fits their theory.  So far, I can't see how it disproves my belief in 6000 years, so my belief stays.  You can insult my intelligence if you like (you probably do), but it doesn't change the facts about what science can and can't prove.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It would be nice if both sides could have sensible meaningful discussions over their beliefs and interpretations, but, unfortunately, many on the evolution/billions of years side aren't interested in proper debate, only in insulting those opposing them - which suggests something about their intelligence, perhaps?  One person once suggested that people who believe in an age of 6000 were worse than Islamic terrorists! That is absolutely ridiculous. When was the last time a young-earther killed 3000 people in a day?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I am not a scientist, but many scientists disagree on this (and indeed many other matters), and they are well-recognised, well-respected scientists.  I have read much about this (from both sides), I have been presented one side of the argument by media and society, but I have decided that 6000 years actually makes sense to me based on the evidence.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Please refrain from the unintelligent, insulting, degrading name calling jus tbecause you disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, he&amp;#39;s a dingbat, to put it mildly. The age of the earth is not a matter of personal belief, where you can just say &amp;quot;I have my facts and you have yours, and we draw different conclusions from them&amp;quot; — we actually have a &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/faqs-youngearth.html"&gt;huge body of mutually overlapping and supporting lines of evidence from physics, geology, astronomy, chemistry, and biology that &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; converge on the same answer&lt;/a&gt;: the earth is billions of years old. The only way Grant can claim that it makes sense to believe the earth is only 6000 years old is for him to completely ignore (or, more likely, be completely ignorant of) the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how about turning this thread into a summary of the evidence for the age of the earth? Go to it, people, tear him apart with the science. Let's see him respond &lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt; to the facts, and his lack of knowledge thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and don't insult him for just disagreeing. You'll have to insult him for being a frakkin' arrogant ignoramus.&lt;/p&gt;

So Texas &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/28/major-texas-win/"&gt;had its brief shining moment of light&lt;/a&gt; when the state Senate rejected creationist goofball Don McLeroy’s bid to once again head up the Board of Education. McLeroy was the guy who famously said, &amp;quot;Someone has to stand up to experts!&amp;quot; when talking about the science advisors contacted by the BoE to advise them on, y’know, &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even in that very post I said that this win was at best temporary, since the same Governor Rick Perry who picked McLeroy in the first place would pick his replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And guess what? I hate being right all the time. It looks like Perry may pick über-far right religious zealot &lt;a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6514838.html"&gt;Cynthia Dunbar to replace McLeroy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunbar actively and opens hates the public school system (check that link in the last paragraph for details). Dunbar campaigns to tear down the First Amendment of the Constitution. &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/07/06/dunbar-to-head-sboe/"&gt;Dunbar is a ball of crazy even by Texas politics standards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, she has not yet been nominated by Governor Perry. Given his own leanings, even if he doesn’t tap Dunbar I’m sure he’ll find some other young-Earth creationist to try to teach the children of Texas fantasy instead of science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the good folks of the Lone Star State: make your voices heard. &lt;a href="http://governor.state.tx.us/contact/"&gt;Contact Perry’s office&lt;/a&gt; and let him know you’d rather have someone grounded in reality in charge of the education of your children. Otherwise — and honestly, I’d love to never have to use this graphic again, but I know I will –&lt;/p&gt;

Well, new observations have now added significantly more complexity to this seemingly understood situation. It has just been reported that as well as the original sheep-albedo effect, there is now evidence of a &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8130907.stm"&gt;second sheep-albedo effect&lt;/a&gt; (smaller sheep as the world warms).  That would be a amplifying effect in general, but the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soay_sheep"&gt;actual population of sheep concerned&lt;/a&gt; come in many colours, so the overall affect is uncertain. (There is even  speculation about a third effect (the sheep lifetime albedo impact), which could go either way depending the Lamb Marketing Board advertising campaign). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet more evidence that the science is very woolly.&lt;/p&gt;

He started out with balloon molecules. Kind of a nifty way to demonstrate why you can write with graphite and not with a diamond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lindau 084.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Lindau%20084.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure the magician was aware that Dr.Kroto was sitting in the front row when he produced the bucky-ball (for which Kroto got his Nobel) but it worked out great in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lindau 071.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Lindau%20071.jpg" width="336" height="448"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it got suspicious when the guy switched to making balloon plants and animals. Could it be? Is that a balloon magician or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/07/lifecode.php" title=""&gt;Stuart Pivar&lt;/a&gt; disguised as a balloon magician?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lindau 081.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Lindau%20081.jpg" width="336" height="448"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then he blew his cover - he made a tentacled balloon animal and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/auf_wiedersehen_lindau.php" title=""&gt;placed it on PZ's head&lt;/a&gt;. Yup, that must have been him!&lt;/p&gt;

The reason: because the city allows a parking lot to remain open on Saturday, which means people are able to drive on their holy day, which they consider sacred. Anne Barker was there to record the event as a journalist, and she switched on her recorder to document it all — when the &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/07/06/2617502.htm"&gt;protesters turned on her&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found myself herded against a brick wall as they kept on spitting - on my face, my hair, my clothes, my arms.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It was like rain, coming at me from all directions - hitting my recorder, my bag, my shoes, even my glasses.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Big gobs of spit landed on me like heavy raindrops. I could even smell it as it fell on my face.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Somewhere behind me - I didn't see him - a man on a stairway either kicked me in the head or knocked something heavy against me.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I wasn't even sure why the mob was angry with me. Was it because I was a journalist? Or a woman? Because I wasn't Jewish in an Orthodox area? Was I not dressed conservatively enough?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In fact, I was later told, it was because using a tape-recorder is itself a desecration of the Shabbat even though I'm not Jewish and don't observe the Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something too many religious people fail to understand — you can practice your religion, other people can practice their religion, but you don&amp;#39;t get to tell other people that they must practice &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; religion. If your crazy superstition says you aren't allowed to push a button on a certain day of the week, &lt;i&gt;then don't&lt;/i&gt;. If your old myths claim that your god turns into a cracker when the right ritual is carried out, go ahead and &lt;i&gt;believe&lt;/i&gt; that. If your dogma dictates that you should visit a certain magic rock before you die, then go ahead, make your pilgrimage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But excuse us, everyone who doesn&amp;#39;t have these wacky ideas has a perfect right to push the button, disrespect your cracker, or stay home and skip the crowds…and we also have the right to point and laugh at you. And if you are so intolerant, so irrational, and so vicious as to try and impose your foolishness on others, especially in such disgusting ways, then we have an obligation to use civic law and the power of the state to protect those others&amp;#39; liberties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, some states become so entangled in the religious absurdities of a segment of their society that they lose the ability to protect every citizen's rights. That's happening in Israel, and it's happening to a lesser degree here in the US.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/every_religion_has_its_insane.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/x5-rgAMlFJ0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246970193795"><id gr:original-id="http://holfordwatch.info/?p=4554">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a5bccee8b622675c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Science: So What Is Recruiting a Dialogue Manager</title><published>2009-07-07T11:37:58Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T11:37:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://holfordwatch.info/2009/07/07/science-so-what-is-recruiting-a-dialogue-manager/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Science: So What is recruiting a Dialogue Manager for the social media wing of its campaign.&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=holfordwatch.info&amp;amp;blog=1336499&amp;amp;post=4554&amp;amp;subd=holfordwatch&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1"&gt;</summary><author><name>dvnutrix</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246970122960"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticblog.org/?p=3310">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/af25a5e97ad0ef39</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="conservative"/><category term="Jonathan Haidt"/><category term="liberal"/><category term="libertarian"/><category term="moral matrix"/><title type="html">Left, Right &amp;amp; Center</title><published>2009-07-07T12:00:16Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T12:00:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/07/07/left-right-and-center/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.skepticblog.org/" type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Liberals, Conservatives &amp;amp; Libertarians&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/06/30/chile-astronomical-observatory/"&gt;last week’s post&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned my trip to Santiago, Chile, for a &lt;a href="http://www.fundacioncienciayevolucion.cl/category/en/"&gt;conference on evolutionary economics&lt;/a&gt; hosted by Alvaro Fischer, in conjunction with the year-long series of celebrations of Darwin’s 200th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three main speakers at the conference were Ullrich Witt, a liberal economist from the Max Planck Institute in Jena, Germany (part of the old Iron Curtain East Germany), Kevin McCabe, a conservative economist from George Mason University, known for its free market leanings (unlike most universities and colleges in America), and myself, a “radical for liberty” (pace Ayn Rand’s self-description as a “radical for capitalism”). Our talks were formal, professional, and technical, but the lively action was in the table talk over meals. I very much enjoyed hearing the opinions of these learned economists, even while vehemently disagreeing (mainly with Witt). Since McCabe and I mostly agreed on everything, I’ll briefly summarize Witt’s lecture, which I think explains how he and I differ on the issue of the collective v. the individual.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Witt’s Lecture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ullrich Witt’s talk was entitled “Animal Instincts and Human Sentiments: On the Origin and Evolution of Economic Institutions.” What is an institution? Do institutions have something in common? How similar/different are the post office, the government, or the law? Does a Darwinian perspective help us understand the origin and evolution of institutions? Yes. Proto institutions arose in early hominids: instinct based and subject to natural selection and adapted to the environment. How do we know? No fossils! Observe higher animals to infer what most likely developed in early hominid bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, hunting requires cooperation, and many mammals employ joint chasing tactics (conventions), have a set of rules about feeding dominance/subordination, show rules for food sharing, and the like, and these are all examples of proto institutions (genetically fixed, shaped by natural selection, adapted to survival conditions similar to those of early hominids).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope of cooperation in social situations is constrained by social structures. Proto institutions in proto humans probably began with coordinating hunts, uniting to fight against rival clans, etc. Observational learning is a way of transmitting knowledge and cultural adaptations in interactions and these proto-institutions. Genetically based forms of proto-institutions emerged in human evolution to ease the coordination (when conflict is absent) through recognizing self in others as well as the intentionality of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultural success accrued to populations when we needed to settle down and make the transition to agriculture. It was here, during the Neolithic Revolution, that informal institutes spontaneously emerged from our genetic architecture for cooperation. Formal institutions must be purposely created for the coordination of behavior in interactions. Natural domination leads to proto institutions as a way of preventing others from contesting domination (thereby preserving the domination rent from competition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Hobbes’ “Leviathan” is an institute grounded in a social contract that legitimizes authority and enforces constitutional constraints on personal power. This governmental leviathan was necessary as populations grew too large for informal institutions to be effective in governing behavior. The concept of human rights is a radically new social model deviating from inherited dispositions and yet presupposes nonetheless formal institutions with coercive power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;At Wit’s End with Witt (and other liberals)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of our disagreement, I think, are several fundamentals: Witt emphasizes the institution, the society, the collective. I emphasize the individual, the person, and the fundamental rights of the individual from abuses and usurpations of the collective—what John Stuart Mill called “the tyranny of the majority” and for which our founding fathers brilliantly constructed the Bill of Rights. The danger of collectives is mob psychology. It is so easy to convince ourselves, especially when we are in a group, that we are right and “they” are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most liberals would agree with me on this point (I’m socially liberal myself, agreeing on free speech, separation of church and state, pro-choice, etc.), but would differ on what the individual has a right to. Here I make a distinction between liberty rights and benefits rights. Liberty rights are the rights we have not to have our liberties taken away from us: the right to believe what we want, the right to free speech, the right to protest, the right to practice whatever religion we want (or even not to practice any religion at all!), the right to own private property, the right to a fair trial, etc. At the core of liberty rights is what I call the Principle of Liberty: &lt;em&gt;the freedom to think, believe, and act as we choose so long as our thoughts, beliefs, and actions do not infringe on the equal freedom of others. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I (and most conservatives) disagree with liberals is on the issue of benefits rights, that is, the right to have certain things given to individuals by the state: the right to an education, the right to a living wage, the right to paid vacations, the right to three square meals a day and a roof over our heads, the right to retirement pay (Social Security), the right to healthcare (Medicare and Medicaid and whatever is coming next), etc. I think people should have the liberty to procure these benefits themselves without interference from other people or the state, but the problem with the state granting them as “rights” is that someone has to pay for all these benefits, and that someone is all of us, adding the always inefficient government as a middle-man to deliver these goods and services, which can almost always be done more efficiently through the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Solution to the Left-Right Dilemma&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One conceptual solution to this left-right difference has been nicely outlined by the University of Virginia psychologist Jonathan Haidt through his model of morality that allows us to avoid being trapped by what he calls a “moral matrix.” Haidt argues that there are &lt;em&gt;5 foundations of morality&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harm–Care&lt;/em&gt; (do not harm others, people should be cared for)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fairness–Reciprocity&lt;/em&gt; (justice for all)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;In-group Loyalty&lt;/em&gt; (we live in a dangerous tribal world so we need group unity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authority–Respect&lt;/em&gt; (a free society depends on the rule of law and law-and-order)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purity–Sanctity&lt;/em&gt; (conservatives: sex, drugs, rock’n’roll; liberals: food, environment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study encompassing over 23,000 subjects from countries all over the world, Haidt found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liberals are high on the Harm-Care and Fairness-Reciprocity dimensions, low on Loyalty, Authority-Respect, Purity-Sanctity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conservatives are about equal on the 5 dimensions (slightly less on Harm-Care and Fairness-Reciprocity, much higher on Loyalty, Authority-Respect, Purity-Sanctity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liberals question authority, celebrate diversity, keep your hands off my body. Liberals speak for the weak and oppressed, they want change and justice, even at the risk of chaos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conservatives emphasize institutions and traditions; they want order even at the cost of those at the bottom. Edmund Burke: “The restraints on men, as well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liberals and conservatives both bring something to the table. Libs and Cons as yin/yang.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vishnu the Preserver (stability–conservative) and Shiva the Destroyer (change–liberal).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haidt cites a study by Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter, (“Altruistic Punishment in Humans,” &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, 415, 137–140, 2002), employing a cooperation game in which people can give money into a commons. When there is no punishment for “free riding” (not giving but receiving the benefits) they discovered that cooperation decays fairly quickly within the first 6 rounds. But in the 7th round Fehr and Gachter allowed the subjects to allocate some of their money to punish free riders, and this they did, which immediately triggered a rise in the levels of cooperation and giving. Conclusion: it helps to have some sort of punishment to encourage people in big groups to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these sources of control and authority and punishment is religion. The other is government. Conservatives prefer the former, liberals the latter. The problem we libertarians have with both institutions is that our moral minds evolved to unite us into teams, divide us against other teams, and convince ourselves that we are right and the other group is wrong. And that has dire consequences, from 12/7/41 to 9/11/01.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Michael Shermer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246968576012"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=572">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/29e7a96afd465860</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Everything Old Is New Again</title><published>2009-07-07T11:42:17Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T11:42:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=572" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Welcome Collection in central London is holding an exhibit and show of “&lt;a href="http://www.wellcomecollection.org/exhibitionsandevents/events/Quacks-and-Cures/index.htm"&gt;Quacks and Cures&lt;/a&gt;” – exploring quaint quack remedies of the past. You can watch a slideshow presentation &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8129447.stm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find discussions of curious cures from the past particularly interesting these days as it always strikes me how little has changed. This show is another example of how people can marvel at the naivete of the public a century or more ago in the face of obvious patent medicine scams or bizarre medical treatments – and yet they are really no different than many alternative medicine and supplement industry claims of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that has changed, slightly, is the particulars of the marketing – the slogans and catch-phrases that were common. The advertisement for Parker’s Tonic asks, “Are you weary in brain and body?” and claims to work by “rejuvenating the blood.” This is actually less bizarre than therapeutic touch practitioners claiming to strengthen your human energy field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many remedies were sold through testimonials, especially from famous people or royalty. In the UK there is actually a continuous tradition of royalty lending their prestige to dubious remedies. Prince Charles is hawking his &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=494"&gt;Duchy Original Detox Tincture&lt;/a&gt; -  you can’t get more of a vibe of old patent medicine than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course the use of testimonials is key – you can find testimonials to support any product or claim that you wish. They are useful only for marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slide show depicts, “Baldwin’s Herbal Tonic Mixture, Nature’s general restorer of the system and purifier of the blood.” That is just slightly off of modern herbal products claiming to naturally detoxify the body.  And yet it is acceptable to call Baldwin’s Tonic an example of a quack patent remedy, while modern hawkers of the same con have managed to convince much of the public that it is closed-minded and impolite to do so regarding it’s contemporary equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also see electrical and magnetic quack devices – another theme that seems to recur with regularity in the quack medical device industry. Harness’ Electropathic Belts are “scientifically constructed,” and you can have a free consultation at the “Electropathic and Zander Institute” to treat your weakness. Wow – that can pass for an absolutely contemporary CAM clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also see a practitioner of “metallic tractors” which drew out “noxious substances” by “magnetic means.” This is a sort of combination of detox pads and magnetic bracelets. Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibit will feature on this Friday, July 10th, not only shows (including a patent medicine show) but also lectures. Ben Goldacre will be lecturing on the placebo effect. This is awesome, and makes me wonder if the exhibiters get it – do they appreciate the fact that by showing quack remedies from the past and exposing how they were marketed, they are taking a swipe at their modern equivalent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it – this is true enough in this case. There is much to learn from dubious remedies of the past. They teach us that millions can swear by treatments that we now know to be fraudulent and worthless, even harmful. We can see how such remedies are marketed with vague but pleasing slogans, how testimonials are used to deceive, and see that the themes which may seem new today (natural, detox, etc.) were old a century ago.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246966529295"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-389981259557504625">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9b8c73fae9969063</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quackery" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="ID/Creationism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Musings" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Bullshit" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Skepticism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Woo and Culture</title><published>2009-07-07T07:33:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T07:33:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/07/woo-and-culture.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SlMHdfcmlBI/AAAAAAAAAo8/EkG2FrouLIY/s1600-h/new-age.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:294px;height:320px" title="I wonder if her legs ever fall asleep.

I've had a couple of posts simmering for a while now but no time to write them as I had to perform diligently at work (it's hard being a professional layabout), study for summer classes, and put the finishing touches on my presentation for TAM.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tonight's a slow night, though, so I thought I'd tackle one of the posts that's been gestating inside my brain for a week or two. In my last two posts, written in Proper Victorian Gentlemen mode, I've looked at the claim by some folks at &lt;a href="http://www.wikisynergy.com"&gt;WikiSynergy&lt;/a&gt; that skeptics are "losing." I put it in quotes only because it's far more complex an issue than to say we are either winning or losing, and that's precisely what this post is about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first issue I have with the claim is one I addressed initially: no criteria for "victory" is set; indeed, it isn't even clear what conflict is being lost. Without being pedantic, I think it's possible to assume that what's being battled over is popular opinion on topics close to the hearts of skeptics. Criteria, then, would be the percent of the population that agrees with skeptics, perhaps, or (in the case of evolution and creationism) the legal and academic status of the other side. This sheds light on a different issue: there are lots of topics within the broad heading of "skepticism" (alt med, cryptozoology, spiritualism, anti-vaccination, etc.) and we may be "winning" some and "losing" others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notice, though, that I still put both of those in quotes. I still think that, even once you break down the various conflicts, decide what qualifies as a win or a loss, and judge based on your criteria, it's still silly to say that skeptics are losing or winning. The reason is simple: in many (if not most) of the subjects that skeptics deal with on a day-to-day basis, we simply have no cultural presence whatsoever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To try to break down the extremely complex societal and cultural context surrounding many battles of "woo vs. skeptic," so to speak, into simply "The skeptics are winning or the skeptics are losing" is myopic and I think even a little self-absorbed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let me explain, beginning with the note that this is speaking mostly about United States culture, as that's where I'm from and it's what I'm most familiar with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here in the skeptical blogosphere, we write a lot about the topics that interest us. Believers do the same thing. Often we lock horns over one issue or another, and usually each side leaves feeling like they "won" the debate. Both of the groups deal with these topics on a frequent, probably day-to-day basis, so it's easy to look out at the culture at large an interpret their beliefs based on our own common interactions. This view, however, is myopic in that it assumes that the debates that concern us spirited hobbyists in our little corners of the internet are the big deciding issues for public belief or unbelief. In reality, the picture is far bigger and far more complex than that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saying, say, "Skeptics are losing the 'ghost debate'" and applying that statement to the entire culture ignores the fact that &lt;i&gt;most people are completely ignorant of the debates going on between skeptics and believers&lt;/i&gt;. What we do amongst ourselves is immaterial to them, so to say that their slight-majority belief in ghosts is due to a skeptical "loss" is to pretend that they have some interest in or knowledge about the "ghost debate." Most of the public couldn't really care one way or another; for it's a matter of enculturation or tradition, or they've just never really thought of it one way or the other, or it's just a fun thing to do. The back-and-forth between the minority of hard-minded skeptics and believers is irrelevant to their decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than that, though, to say "Skeptics are losing the 'ghost debate'" ignores the context of the pop culture playing field. Currently there are probably at least a dozen TV shows, some quite popular, about "real" ghost hunters. Just off the top of my head, I can think of "Ghost Hunters," "Ghost Adventures," "Paranormal State," "Most Haunted," and "Haunted Travels." How many shows are there skeptical of ghosts? At the moment, precisely zero. If this debate were an Olympic event, skepticism would be sitting on a blanket outside the gates with a sign asking to be let in; you can't lose if they don't let you play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I'm not saying that believers are pushing out alternative viewpoints (at least not in the context of the ghost debate); I'm saying that right now the culture is in a place where shows about "real" ghosts are exciting and interesting and they snag the ratings, and shows about skepticism and rigorous science don't. The constellation of TV shows reflects this cultural obsession (and reinforces it to some degree, according to the work of &lt;a href="http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~sparks/"&gt;Purdue professor Glenn Sparks&lt;/a&gt;) and thus skeptical shows don't make it to air. The pop culture landscape is covered in ghosts and skeptics are pretty light on the ground; saying that a majority belief in ghosts is due to a skeptical loss completely ignores (and dichotomizes) the bigger picture. Pop culture is &lt;i&gt;drowning&lt;/i&gt; in ghosts while the skeptical side of things is, in large part, relegated to hobbyists on the web. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there are other debates. Let's take the debate over alternative medicine. Here is a case where skeptics can be said to be losing based on public belief, the popularity of pseudomedical modalities, the protected legal status of many pseudomedical modalities, and the incursion of these modalities into multiple medical schools.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The "debate" over alt med is one where skeptics and proponents of science- and evidence-based medicine really have worked hard to get themselves and their ideas into the public eye. It is not the kind of debate that has no ramifications for the average person; everyone deals with medicine throughout their lives. The fact that alt med seems only to be gaining ground despite a rather concerted effort from the other side is, I think, good grounds for saying this is a battle we &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; losing; The issue it has public presence and relevance, skeptics have come out in force in various forms of media, and yet public opinion in favor of pseudomedicine seems to be growing rather than shrinking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, alt med has Oprah on its side, which is like running a race against a guy in a Formula 1 race car. Oprah's pop culture influence makes this an inherently uphill battle. It's one we're fighting valiantly, but until we can get an equally influential pop culture presence on our side (if there even is one), the deck is stacked against us. This alters the playing field similarly to a dozen ghost hunter shows. It isn't quite as culture-saturating owing to the constant presence of real doctors, real hospitals, and real medicine, but it certainly has an effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there's 9/11 conspiracy theories. This is a debate with a lot of pop culture traction, thanks to the "Loose Change" guys. This is a debate we &lt;i&gt;won&lt;/i&gt;, for the most part, thanks to a massive and well-organized push back against the bullshitters. The issue is big in pop culture, the &lt;i&gt;debate&lt;/i&gt; is big in pop culture (that's really the key), and science won pretty definitively thanks to fantastic articles in magazines like Popular Mechanics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other end, there are debates we're "winning," but that nobody especially cares about. I think the evolution "debate" might be an example of this. Legally and scientifically, we're kicking asses and taking names; the DI has nothing to offer but stale old arguments, their "science" is nonexistent, and their representatives are chumps. More scientists are leaving the lab and joining the fight, and we've even become adept at predicting their next strategic reframing ("materialism," anyone?).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No variant of creationism is taught in schools. Teachers that teach it (like Freshwater, the teacher who electrocuted crosses onto students' arms) are weeded out and dealt with. The only headway the opposition has made is a few states that have passed "strengths and weaknesses" legislation. The scientific and skeptical communities stand firm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet most of the United States (around 60% at last count, if I remember correctly) still rejects evolution. So we're winning, but nobody cares.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or are we really winning at all?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most issues are not simple enough to break down into the dichotomy of "skeptics are winning" or "skeptics are losing." It is just not accurate to characterize things that simplistically. There are simply too many other things going on, too many other factors and variables that play into each and every debate. Many people are ambivalent about lots of the hot-button skeptical issues, and the culture is so very much bigger than just skeptics vs. believers. To characterize debates thusly is to myopically ignore popular culture at large and to oversimplify a very complex issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-389981259557504625?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246966207984"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13382">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/84fb3ef10bd2f9fb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Your First Crisis as an Atheist</title><published>2009-07-07T11:00:44Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T11:00:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/07/your-first-crisis-as-an-atheist/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Bellamy&lt;/strong&gt; is the Counsel and Director of Special Programs for the &lt;a href="http://secular.org"&gt;Secular Coalition for America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s undergoing some surgery today and shared a few of her thoughts with me.  With her permission, I’m posting them here in the hopes they might help others going through something similar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As a fairly recently minted humanist, I am facing my first serious crisis post-prayer.  I have cancer in two places in my left breast and “atypical” cells in my right breast.  Today, a doctor will remove all of my left breast and part of my right breast.  Hopefully my lymph nodes will be clear and that will be that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I miss having a deity to pray to?  No.  Being able to dispense with prayer is actually a comfort to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I still believed in a god, I would wonder why this had happened to me.  I would wonder how god would decide whose prayers to answer — mine or the prayers of others facing medical crises — since we would not all be spared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would wonder how I should pray.  Should I offer to make a deal — if you spare me I will… Should I bargain — if you spare me until I have seen my children grow up, I won’t complain when you do take me (that’s what I prayed the last time I faced a medical crisis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would wonder what I should pray for.  Is it selfish to pray for your own life/health?  Should I pray instead for the end of hunger in the world or for god’s will to be done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s freeing not to have to deal with the questions prayer raises.  I am free to focus on my needs, my family, my friends (even the friend who will light a candle at a shrine to the virgin for me today, because who better to watch over me today than she who suckled Jesus at her breast?).  So if anyone tells you that as atheists we have given up a comfort in a time of crisis, tell them no — we have given up a distraction and confusion, not comfort.  For comfort we have our families and our community.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you became an atheist, what was the first crisis you went through?  How did you deal with it at the time?&lt;br&gt;

Blogging has been very hard for me lately.  I love writing, but due to work and family mishegos it's been hard to keep up with the posting.  I'm hoping a stint up in the woods providing medical supervision to 400 souls will be rejuvenating.  While I'm gone, I'll leave you with some of my favorite posts about the human side of medicine.  I hope you enjoy reading them again, or for the first time.  --PalMD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. D. is one of those guys who is just &lt;i&gt;nice&lt;/i&gt;.  He's far from gregarious, but everyone who meets him likes him.  He's quiet, reserved, and hates to complain.  He's had his share of medical problems over the last 80 years---emphysema, stroke, cancer---all of which he's treated as inconveniences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he came into my office with his wife, he looked miserable.  His back was hurting so badly that he couldn't get comfortable.  It had been like that for two weeks, but he didn't want to bother me about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked him the usual questions---any fevers, weakness, incontinence---all negative.  By history and exam, he appeared to have a usual case of low back pain, but with his medical history, you can never be too careful.  He had been on immune-modifying drugs for an immunologic disease, so infection was a consideration, as was cancer.  I did some plain X-rays in the office which were unremarkable, and he had an appointment with a spine surgeon in a few days, so I sent him home with some analgesics and instructions to call me if things got worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now back to the Ed Biz, for a moment.  An &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;amp;storycode=407233"&gt;article in Times Higher Education&lt;/a&gt; last week caused something of a stir.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V-cs’ candid views slip out online.  2 July 2009 By Zöe Corbyn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Prematurely released paper reveals fears of staff revolution and desire to cash in, writes Zöe Corbyn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article refers to a paper that appeared on the web site of the journal &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/117999627/home"&gt;Higher Education Quarterly&lt;/a&gt;.  It is &lt;em&gt;Perspectives of UK Vice-Chancellors on Leading Universities in a Knowledge-Based Economy &lt;/em&gt;by Lynn Bosetti, University of Calgary, and  Keith Walker, University of Saskatchewan.  The paper quotes ten different university vice-chancellors (presidents) of UK universities. Some of the comments caused quite a stir when they were quoted anonymously in an &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;amp;storycode=407233"&gt;article in &lt;em&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  But the paper soon vanished and still has not reappeared. A version that lacks some of the names is expected to appear soon.  The original uncensored version has now &lt;a href="https://secure.wikileaks.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Quarterly_removed_paper:_Perspectives_of_UK_Vice-Chancellors_in_a_Knowlege-Based_Economy%2C_2009"&gt;appeared on Wikileaks&lt;/a&gt;. Its source is no great mystery since it was available to the public for a short time.  It seems a pity if vice-chancellors want to hide their views, so here are a few quotations from the original version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, Colin Lucas, cautions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the greatest distortions is this sense that the only thing that universities are for, is to drive the economy. The core mission of universities is threatened by a narrow value system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Schwartz_(vice-chancellor)"&gt;Steven Schwartz&lt;/a&gt; was vice-chancellor of Brunel University until February 2006 when he became Vice Chancellor of Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. He’s quoted as saying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know that education is a commodity that can be bought and sold, often at a very high price. So universities are busy doing that – charging students a large amount of money to study in England because it is a popular destination. Branding and marketing take the font seat and education is in the back. (S. Schwartz, Brunel University)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the traditional role of the university, the Vice-Chancellor of University of Oxford, Colin Lucas, is concerned that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“commodification threatens to destroy not only scholarly democracy but civilisation itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The vice-chancellor needs to have a network of people involved in ‘intelligence gathering’ to be able to swiftly deal with ‘even the faintest hint of a revolution’ (S. Schwartz, Brunel University)” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds a bit like the secret police and their network of informers.  Hardly a good way to get the loyalty of your staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“you have to lead with flow and authority.You can never be out of touch with what faculty are thinking . . . if in the end faculty don’t follow you, it isn’t because they are stupid, it’s because you are out of touch’ (S. Schwartz)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And that seems to say that you need to know how faculty think, not in order to listen to their views, but only to know how to beat them.  Perhaps it has never occurred to Steven Schwartz that he might, just occasionally, be wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummond_Bone"&gt;Drummond Bone&lt;/a&gt; succeeded Howard Newby (of whom &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=181"&gt;more here&lt;/a&gt;) as vice-chancellor of the University of Liverpool. he also seems to regard the drive to corporatisation of univeristies as a war against his own staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You need to start by setting the agenda for change, then you have to look at who is going to be a driver or champion of that change, who is going to be a passenger and who, quite frankly, is going to stand against it’ (J. Drummond Bone)”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Schwartz again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“we filled our senior management positions with people who had never worked in universities before. The HR [human relations] person came from mining, another from banking. It’s probably made a big difference to Brunel and its ability to move, in that people aren’t weighted down with a lot of public service type history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This attitude seems to me to be at the heart of the problem.  it is based on a mistaken idea of what it is that gives a university a good reputation. The reputation, at least in academia, is the sum of the reputations of eminent people who work there, Physiologists  will think of Bernard Katz and Andrew Huxley. Pharmacologists will think of Heinz Schild and James Black, People in English literature may never have heard of them, but they will think of John Sutherland and Rosemary Ashton, Each of them gives UCL a bit of reflected glory..But nobody will think about our Public Relations attempts at corporate image building. The only way to have a great university is to have great people doing the research and teaching. Anything that makes a university unattractive to them will, in the long run, harm the place. And one thing that makes a university unattractive is the perception that it is run by people who view it as a business, and who know nothing about what makes the place great. The sort of people whom Steven Schwartz seems to have gone out of his way to employ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was asked recently by  the head of media relations to answer some questions about UCL’s attempts to build its “corporate identity” (nice to be asked, for a change). My answer was that I though they probably did more harm than good. The reason for saying that is that they are, only too often, downright embarrassing. I’ve mentioned the examples of ‘&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=237#sust1"&gt;sustainable degrees&lt;/a&gt;‘,  the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=237#conc1"&gt;concordat&lt;/a&gt; fiasco and  ‘&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=237#conc2"&gt;research days&lt;/a&gt;‘. And the new-age junk forced on our research staff by &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=226"&gt;Human Resources&lt;/a&gt; is acutely embarrassing. Luckily for UCL, all universities have pursued this corporate path, so there is nowhere to run to, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general public, having lived through the Blair era, is able to detect vacuous spin when it hears it. And there is no shortage of that in universities now. The aim of science is to discover truth. The aim of PR is to disguise truth, They are utterly incompatible. In the words of the “unrepentant capitalist”&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=226"&gt; Luke Johnson, in the Financial Times,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have radically downsized HR in several companies I have run, and business has gone all the better for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another way to dismepower academics&lt;/strong&gt;   Steven Schwartz, with his spy network, is quite excessively conspiritorial.  There is a much easier way to do it,  You have a consultation.  You hold open “town meetings”.  The opposition then reveal themselves. Having taken the precaution of neutering the academic board, you are under no obligation to take the slightest notice of what anyone else says, and public humiliation of opponents will ensure there aren’t too many of them.  I have seen this &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=195"&gt;plan in action&lt;/a&gt;.  It works rather well, in the short run.    In the long run, though, academics lose morale, loyalty and altruism when treated in that way.  Vice-chancellors who behave like that are bringing their institution into disrepute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was poeted from the train to Edinburgh,where I’ll be giving the Paton lecture, on a related topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="follow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modified paper has now been published in &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/117999627/home"&gt;Higher Education Quarterly&lt;/a&gt;. And, guess what, Steven Schwartz’s name is not mentioned in it. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Colquhoun</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">DC&amp;#39;s Improbable Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246962585095"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_quotes_344.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/babf95ef32c91be1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-07-07T09:05:55Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T09:05:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/f-pxSTO9bCU/clock_quotes_344.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_quotes_344.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need time to dream, time to remember, and time to reach the infinite.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Complementary medicines, traditional remedies and home cures for medical ailments are used extensively world-wide, representing more than US$60 billion sales in the global market. With serious doubts about the efficacy and safety of many treatments, the industry remains steeped in controversy. Little is known about factors affecting the prevalence of efficacious and non-efficacious self-medicative treatments. Here we develop mathematical models which reveal that the most efficacious treatments are not necessarily those most likely to spread. &lt;strong&gt;Indeed, purely superstitious remedies, or even maladaptive practices, spread more readily than efficacious treatments under specified circumstances.&lt;/strong&gt; Low-efficacy practices sometimes spread because their very ineffectiveness results in longer, more salient demonstration and a larger number of converts, which more than compensates for greater rates of abandonment. These models also illuminate a broader range of phenomena, including the spread of innovations, medical treatment of animals, foraging behaviour, and self-medication in non-human primates.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Money quote from Chris Lee:

It also helps me understand why the meme of vaccine damage has spread. There are literally no demonstrators for the effectiveness of vaccination, making social learning difficult.

I see a story or hear about something. I write about it. I almost have to. Most stories in the blogosphere have a really short half-life anyway. Wait more than a day or two, and no one cares anymore. Hell, wait more than a few hours in the case of hyperkinetic bloggers like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula"&gt;P.Z.&lt;/a&gt; will be all over it. However, sometimes it's a good idea to restrain myself, not to leap on something right away even when I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of those times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was tipped off by the merry band of anti-vaccine loons over at &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/07/press-complaints-commission-orders-sunday-times-to-remove-deers-stories-on-dr-wakefield.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt; to a press release issued by one of the heroes of the antivaccine movement, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/the_autism_omnibus_the_difference_betwee.php"&gt;incompetent scientist&lt;/a&gt; who, as investigative journalist Brian Deer showed, was not only &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/surprise_surprise_andrew_wakefield_was_p.php"&gt;in the pocket of trial lawyers&lt;/a&gt; at the time he did his "research" allegedly implicating the MMR vaccine as a cause of "autistic enterocolitis" but probably&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/why_am_i_not_surprised_it_looks_as_thoug.php"&gt; falsified much of the original data&lt;/a&gt; used in his infamous 1998 &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper. Yes, I'm referring to the (in)famous Andrew Wakefield, whose amazingly incompetent research claiming a link between the attenuated measles virus in the MMR vaccine and "autistic enterocolitis" launched a scare that is still going on to this day and that has lead measles from being practically eradicated to now being endemic again in the U.K. It's also the scare that launched a thousand quacks.  Indeed, the most recent bit of news about Wakefield's scientific fraud came out during the General Medical Council investigation that was launched against him to investigate the allegations of research misconduct resulting from his activities a decade ago and reported by Brian Deer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wakefield was not pleased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, he was so displeased that he &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/andrew_wakefield_strikes_back.php"&gt;launched an attack&lt;/a&gt; on Brian Deer and lodge a specious complaint against him and his newspaper with the U.K. Press Complaints Commission. Last week, against all odds it appeared that Wakefield might have prevailed, at least if you believed his delusional &lt;a href="http://thoughtfulhouse.org/pr/sunday-times-ordered-to-remove-brian-deer-MMR-stories.php"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/no_one_can_shoot_himself_in_the_foot_lik.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/no_one_can_shoot_himself_in_the_foot_lik.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/K1ttIaNRtjA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246957067193"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=545">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0a3ef17bee88ffdf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clinical Trials"/><category term="Energy Medicine"/><category term="coronary artery bypass"/><category term="healing touch"/><title type="html">Healing Touch and Coronary Bypass</title><published>2009-07-07T08:00:58Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T08:00:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=545" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18616066?dopt=AbstractPlus"&gt;A study published in &lt;em&gt;Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;is being cited as evidence for the efficacy of healing touch (HT). It enrolled 237 subjects who were scheduled for coronary bypass, randomized them to receive HT, a visitor, or no treatment; and found that HT was associated with a greater decrease in anxiety and shorter hospital stays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is a good example of what I have called “Tooth Fairy Science.” You can study how much money the Tooth Fairy leaves in different situations (first vs. last tooth, age of child, tooth in baggie vs. tooth wrapped in Kleenex, etc.), and your results can be replicable and statistically significant, and you can think you have learned something about the Tooth Fairy; but your results don’t mean what you think they do because you didn’t stop to find out whether the Tooth Fairy was real or whether some more mundane explanation (parents) might account for the phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theoretical underpinnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study’s introduction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Healing touch is a biofield- or energy-based therapy that arose out of nursing in the early 1980s…HT aids relaxation and supports the body’s natural healing process, i.e., one’s ability to self-balance and self-heal.” This noninvasive technique involves (1) intention (such as the practitioner centering with the deep, gentle, conscious breath) and (2) placement of hands in specific patterns or sequences either on the body or above it. At its core, the theoretical basis of the work is that a human being is a multi-dimensional energy system (including consciousness) that can be affected by another to promote well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They cite a number of references to theorists who support these ideas. They cite Ochsman; he wrote a book &lt;em&gt;Energy Medicine: The Scientific Basis&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://quackfiles.blogspot.com/2006/01/review-of-energy-medicine-scientific.html"&gt;which I reviewed&lt;/a&gt;, showing that despite the book’s title, there is no credible scientific basis and the “evidence” he presents cannot be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They cite Candace Pert, who said in the foreword to Ochsman’s book that Dr. Oschman “pulled” some energy away from her “stagnant” liver. She said the body is “a liquid crystal under tension capable of vibrating at a number of frequencies, some in the range of visible light,” with “different emotional states, each with a predominant peptide ligand-induced ‘tone’ as an energetic pattern which propagates throughout the bodymind.” Does this even mean anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They even cite the PEAR study, suggesting that it is still ongoing (it isn’t) and claiming it shows that “actions in one system can potentially influence actions of another on a quantum energetic level.” (It didn’t.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nothing but imaginative speculation based on a misunderstanding of quantum physics and of what physicists mean by “energy.” It is a truism that electromagnetic phenomena are widespread in the human body, but there is a giant gap between that and the idea that a nurse with intention and hand movements can influence electrical, magnetic, or any other physical processes in the body to promote healing. There is no evidence for the alleged “human biofield.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They cite several randomized controlled studies of HT over the last few years.&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15154151?ordinalpos=&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.SmartSearch&amp;amp;log$=citationsensor"&gt; One &lt;/a&gt;showed “better health-related quality of life” in cancer patients. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14713325?ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;One, the Post-White study, &lt;/a&gt;showed no difference between HT and massage. One small study by Ziembroski et al. that I couldn’t find in PubMed apparently showed no significant difference between HT and standard care for hospice patients. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11890432?ordinalpos=25&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; showed that HT raised secretory IgA concentrations, lowered stress perceptions and relieved pain, and results were greater with more experienced practitioners; but it only compared HT to no treatment and didn’t use any placebo treatment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11685160?ordinalpos=5&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A pilot study&lt;/a&gt;  compared 4 noetic therapies-stress relaxation, imagery, touch therapy, and prayer, and found no difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16023511?ordinalpos=4&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A larger study&lt;/a&gt;  showed that neither touch therapy nor masked prayer significantly improved clinical outcome after elective catheterisation or percutaneous coronary intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They cite a &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15227762?ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;review of healing touch studies by Wardell and Weymouth&lt;/a&gt;  It concluded “Over 30 studies have been conducted with healing touch as the independent variable. Although no generalizable results were found, a foundation exists for further research to test its benefits.” Wardell noted that “the question has been raised whether the field of energy research readily lends itself to traditional scientific analysis due to coexisting paradoxical findings.” This is a common excuse of true believers who find that science is not cooperative in validating their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;237 patients undergoing first-time elective coronary artery bypass surgery were randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: an HT group, a visitor group, and a standard care group. All received the same standard care from the hospital. The HT group received preoperative HT education and 3 HT interventions. Practitioners established a relationship with their patients, assessed their energy fields, and performed a variety of HT techniques based on their assessment, including techniques that involved light touch and those that involved no touch (practitioners’ hands held above body). Sessions lasted 20 to 90 minutes; each patient had the same practitioner throughout the study. The “visitor” group patients were visited by a nurse on the same schedule. The visits consisted of general conversation or the visitor remaining quietly in the room with the patient. They mentioned that some visits were shortened at the patient’s request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results of the Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six outcome measures were postoperative length of stay, incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation, use of anti-emetic medication, amount of narcotic pain medication, functional status, and anxiety. HT had no effect on atrial fibrillation, anti-emetics, narcotics, or functional status. The only significant differences were for anxiety scores and length of stay. The length of stay for the HT group was 6.9 days, for the visitor group 7.7 days, and for the routine care group 7.2 days, suggesting that the simple presence of a visitor made things worse(!?). Curiously, for the subgroup of inpatients, the length of stay was HT 7.4 days, visitor 7.7 days and routine care 6.8 days, which was non-significant at p=0.26 and suggested that both HT and visitor made things worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mean decreases in anxiety scores were HT 6.3, visitor 5.8, and control 1.8. They said this was significant at the p=0.01 level. But the tables for results broken down by inpatient and outpatient show no significant differences (p=0.32 for outpatients and p=0.10 for inpatients). If it was not significantly different for either subgroup, how could it be significant for the combined group?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These discrepancies are confusing. They suggest that the significant differences found were due to chance rather than to any real effect of HT..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems with this Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four out of the six outcomes were negative: there was no change in the use of pain medication, anti-emetic medication, incidence of atrial fibrillation, or functional status. The only two outcomes that were significant were hospital stay and anxiety, and these results are problematic and might have other explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to interpret what the difference in length of stay means, because they did not record the reasons for delaying discharge. As far as we can tell from the paper, the doctors deciding when to discharge a patient were not blinded as to which study group the patient was in. It’s interesting that the visitor group length of stay was intermediate in the outpatient subgroup, but higher than control for the combined inpatient/outpatient group. They offer no explanation for this. I was puzzled by the bar graph showing these numbers, because the numbers on the graph don’t seem to match the numbers in the text. The numbers were manipulated: they did a logarithm transformation for length of stay “to handle the skewness of the raw data.” I don’t understand that and can’t comment. The range of hospital days is such that the confidence intervals largely overlap. In all, these data are not very robust or convincing and they raise questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They interpret the anxiety reduction scores (HT 6.3, visitor 5.8, and control 1.8) as showing a significant efficacy of HT, but it seems more compatible with a placebo response and a slightly better response for the more elaborate placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were fewer patients (63) in the visitor group than in the HT and control groups (87 each). This was not explained. The comparison of groups appears to show that the control group had significantly higher pre-op anxiety scores than either of the other groups, which would tend to skew the results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They didn’t use a credible control group. A visitor sitting in the room can’t be compared to a charismatic touchy-feely hand-waving practitioner. Other studies have used mock HT where the hand movements were not accompanied by healing thoughts. These researchers rejected that approach because they didn’t think it would be ethical to offer a sham procedure where the practitioner only “pretended” to help. Hmm… One could argue that they have provided no evidence that HT practitioners are ever doing anything more than pretending to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don’t comment on how practitioners were able to “assess the energy fields” of their patients. &lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/279/13/1005?maxtoshow=&amp;amp;HITS=10&amp;amp;hits=10&amp;amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;amp;fulltext=emily+rosa&amp;amp;searchid=1137358227934_1768&amp;amp;FIRSTINDEX=0"&gt;Emily Rosa’s landmark study  &lt;/a&gt;showed that practitioners who claimed to be able to sense those fields couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors consist of 3 RNs (2 of them listed as healing touch therapists and presumably the ones who provided treatment in the study), a statistician with an MS, and two “directors of research” for whom no degrees are listed. The authors are clearly prejudiced in favor of HT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They interpret this study as supporting the efficacy of HT. I don’t think it does that. I think the results are entirely compatible with a placebo response. With any made-up intervention presented with strong suggestion, one could expect to find one or two statistically significant differences when multiple endpoints are evaluated. And the magnitude of the improvement here is far from robust. This is the kind of result that tends to diminish in magnitude or vanish when better controls are used. I think the study is Tooth Fairy science, purporting to study the effects of a non-existent phenomenon, but actually only demonstrating a placebo response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if better results might be obtained by having a patient advocate stay with the patient and offer reassurance, explanations, massage and other comfort measures – something like the doulas who have been shown to improve childbirth outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frightening thing is that during the course of this study, patients increasingly bought into the HT belief system and refused to sign up for the study because they wanted HT and didn’t want to risk being assigned to a control group. And hospital staff bought into the belief system, were treated themselves, and became proponents of offering it to patients for other indications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper ends with a rather incoherent statement one would not expect to find in a scientific medical journal: “At the very heart of this study is the movement toward recognizing that the metaphoric and physical heart are both very real, if we allow them to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

I'm still trying to get my mind around the reports about Kristen LaBrie, the &lt;a href="http://www.wbur.org/2009/07/06/medication-denied"&gt;Massachusetts mother who is accused of withholding cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt; from her autistic son, Jeremy Fraser. Jeremy died in March of this year at the age of nine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday LaBrie pleaded "not guilty" to a charge of attempted murder; she had earlier been charged with child endangerment. The July 6th &lt;a href="http://www.wbur.org/2009/07/06/medication-denied"&gt;Associated Press vis WBUR&lt;/a&gt; reports that Jeremy was diagnosed with a "severe form of autism" while young. He was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in October of 2006 and given an 85 percent to 90 percent chance of recovery. He received "large doses of chemotherapy" and his cancer went into remission. LeBrie was given prescriptions for medications for Jeremy to take at home and this is when the story turns more than puzzling. According to Assistant District Attorney Kate MacDougall,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; LaBrie repeatedly failed to pick up prescriptions, but led doctors to believe they were being filled, at one point asking for a liquid version of the medication because her son was having trouble swallowing pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Miss LaBrie never expressed any misgivings about the treatment,” MacDougall said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2008, after one of Jeremy’s doctors called LaBrie’s pharmacy and learned she had not been filling prescriptions, LaBrie said the pharmacy must have made a mistake, MacDougall said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at that point that doctors discovered that the boy’s cancer had returned as leukemia and was untreatable with chemotherapy, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details only occlude the situation: LaBrie was divorced from Jeremy's father, Eric Fraser, and they shared custody until a year ago, when full custody and parental rights were signed over to Fraser. In court documents filed in April of 2007, LaBrie claimed that "Fraser chronically missed visits with his son and did not have contact with his school or doctors during the boy’s chemotherapy"; the withholding of medications for treatment occurred while Jeremy was in LaBrie's care. As reported in the July 4, 2008, &lt;a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/news/regional/general/view/2008_07_04_Mom__ex_racked_up_DSS_complaints/srvc=home"&gt;Boston Herald&lt;/a&gt;, since 2000 both LaBrie and Fraser had been "the subject of nine complaints of abuse and neglect, called 51As, although seven of those were unsubstantiated or screened out, according to DSS records. A 51A complaint triggers a DSS probe."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reading about this very sad case, I've mostly been thinking about what must life have been like for Jeremy, to have his cancer go untreated? What must he have suffered? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of difficult and sad news that one reads about autism but this one is particularly disturbing. There's plenty of disagreement among parents and within the autism community about what to do for autistic children, but there's certainly the acknowledgement that things need to be done, and a deep sense of responsibility to do what's right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not going to be easy to read further reports about Jeremy Fraser. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246951142485"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4324">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/300b702ac712243c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Slightly Off Topic" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="macaronicverse" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="macaronic verse"/><category term="poetry" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="poetry"/><title type="html">Waaay off topic</title><published>2009-07-07T06:50:05Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T06:51:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/07/waaay-off-topic.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never let it be said that we are pure science nerds on PT.  As is the case with all group blogs, PT has a back channel communication system in which we argue, discuss, argue, debate … erm, well, we talk about stuff. sometimes in vigorous disagreement.  Mostly it’s about one or another topic relevant to the stated purpose of PT, but sometimes we wander.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason a recent conversation wandered into limericks (is a limerick a limerick if it’s clean?), doggerel, and similar high-brow literary entertainments.  In the course of the conversation one of the PT crew composed a two-stanza poem in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaronic_language" rel="external "&gt;macaronic style&lt;/a&gt;, in which the lines of the poem are in different languages but the meter and rhyme scheme are preserved through the language shifts.  Most such works are in just two languages, but this particular one, which I won’t publish without permission, was in &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; languages.  Were there no other reason for being a member of the crew, seeing that kind of creation pop up in casual conversation would make it worthwhile.  Just thought you’d like to know.  :)&lt;/p&gt;

I kept the transcript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/06/john-edwards-new-psychic-website-infinite-quest-scams-the-gullible/"&gt;the Friendly Atheist did a write-up &lt;img title="psychic-crystal-ball_1114702c" src="http://skepacabra.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/psychic-crystal-ball_1114702c.jpg?w=199&amp;amp;h=124" alt="psychic-crystal-ball_1114702c" width="199" height="124"&gt;about Infinite Quest&lt;/a&gt; that was worth sharing. Infinite Quest goes beyond just the old “talking to the dead” schtick that hucksters have been doing for the better part of the 20th century. It combines big names in numerous arenas of woo from astrologers, to numerologists, to palm readers, tarot readers, etc.  And while there is a free forum on the site, don’t be fooled into thinking John Edward and company are going to tell you your future for nothing. No, there’s paid option that provides you with more site privileges. Those privileges apparently are that you get to give your money to some of the most notorious con artists in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most telling, as the Friendly Atheist reports, is the site’s disclaimer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s all you need to know about the site.  The Terms of Use has a disclaimer — a &lt;a href="http://infinitequest.com/Terms_of_Use"&gt;“limitation of liability”&lt;/a&gt; — that reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;JECO PARTIES MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT… THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SITE WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, they can make up whatever bullshit they want, and if they’re wrong, you can’t do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup, it’s been said before but &lt;a href="http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/103512"&gt;John Edward is a douche&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Mingling in this star-studded cast of what seemed like hundreds and was certainly scores of the finest linguists in the world, I ran across George Lakoff, who told me the best Dumb Copy Editor story I have ever heard.  I like Dumb Copy Editor stories, as you know; but this one is so good I think it takes the prize.  I will reveal all below the jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hr&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess you need to know that the book by Lakoff and Johnson called &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Metaphors-We-Live-George-Lakoff/dp/0226468011/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Metaphors We Live By&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published in 1980 by the University of Chicago Press, was a huge seller for them, and is now famous around the world, virtually a classic.  And you need to know that many, many Americans still live in terror of a rule invented by an essayist called John Dryden who died well over 300 years ago.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy editor used on the Lakoff &amp;amp; Johnson book was a senior editor for the Press, and he recommended large numbers of changes in grammar and style. The first of the changes concerned the first four words of the book — its title.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, you guessed it; those of you who are saying under your breath &amp;quot;Oh no, he didn&amp;#39;t…&amp;quot;, you are ahead of me, because he did.  Lakoff swears this is true. The man actually proposed that the title should be changed to &lt;i&gt;Metaphors By Which We Live&lt;/i&gt;.  No stranding of prepositions at the University of Chicago!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't that hilarious?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lakoff wrote a 23-page single-spaced blast against this man's recommendations, showing in detail and with clear arguments the nature of the hole up which the editor's head was.  And then unusually it turned out to be all happy endings: the linguists won, the editor resigned from the project, the editing changes were not made, the title was kept, and the book was a huge hit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So was the party.  Huge.  The sun sank slowly in the distance behind San Francisco skyline and disappeared down beyond the Farallon Islands, much wine was drunk on the deck but nobody fell off and plummeted down the precipitous slope of the Berkeley hills below; much excellent food was consumed (thanks, Larry!); and I chuckled for a long time over the Lakoff story (thanks, George!).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the real work of the Institute begins: classes started today. Much important linguistic business to transact and many students to teach.  More news from Berkeley as it happens.  &lt;small&gt;[— GKP, July 6, 2009.]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color:#220055;text-align:center"&gt;Do You Wake Up Every Morning Feeling 100% Fulfilled?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s not skirt the issue here. Do you wake up every morning knowing – with every fiber of your soul – that you’re enjoying the most creative life you can make for yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you love your work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you spend enough time with the family?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you earning enough?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you putting your creativity potential to full use?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you as healthy as you should be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you truly &lt;strong&gt;happy&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;99% Of People Would Say ‘No’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise really. We’ve all got issues in our lives that need fixing, whether they’re professional, personal or health-related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues that we just can’t seem to iron out, no matter where, how or who we look too. In fact, sometimes we’ve searched so much for the answer that we begin to wonder whether it really exists anywhere in this universe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing – sometimes, &lt;strong&gt;it doesn’t.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s where my secret comes in. Why? Because this secret to leave my body and jump into other dimensions has laid both the foundations of all my personal successes, and also the successes of every single person I’ve revealed it to. If you thought Astrological signs were powerful, wait until you start jumping!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumping has helped me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attract wealth&lt;/strong&gt; and abundance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instantly &lt;strong&gt;boost my creativity&lt;/strong&gt; and pick up new skills like painting, photography and singing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get guidance from other dimensions&lt;/strong&gt; and always know what decision to make when faced with multiple options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find inspiration, wisdom and knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; while jumping into another universe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helped me &lt;strong&gt;MANIFEST&lt;/strong&gt; everything I &lt;strong&gt;DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reminded of $cientology’s personality test that ensures no one can ever pass. Of course the person reading the website isn’t 100% satisfied with their life. NO ONE IS. And no matter what these hustlers claim, nothing they do will make you 100% satisfied with your life. Human beings are incapable of being 100% satisfied. Even if everything was going right with your lif,  you’re a rich, famous, powerful, have the most beautiful spouse in the world who you love, have great kids, have loads of loving friends and family, etc–you’ll still find something missing in your life. It’s just human nature. Maybe you’ll be satisfied for awhile, but eventually you’ll get bored with having everything and will crave adventure or something different. Or maybe you live an adventurous life already, so you’ll get tired of that. There’s an old (and rather crude) expression:  “Show me a beautiful woman and I’ll show you a man tired of fucking her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no better than &lt;em&gt;The Secret&lt;/em&gt; and like with that, it relies on people’s natural capacity for self-deception. As is pointed out in the recent film, &lt;em&gt;The Brothers Bloom&lt;/em&gt;, the perfect con is the one where “everyone gets what they want.” And if enough people try it, there’s a high statistical likelihood that enough small coincidences will occur that will reinforce the belief that this scam actually works, because if you want to believe badly enough, you’ll seek out any reason to justify that belief. The 2 psychological phenomena that come to mind are confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe I’m not giving this a fair shake. What is “Quantum Jumping” anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align:center"&gt;What On Earth Is Quantum Jumping?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum Jumping is the process of “jumping” into parallel dimensions, and &lt;strong&gt;gaining creativity, knowledge, wisdom and inspiration&lt;/strong&gt; from alternate versions of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…Are you still with me? Did that sound crazy? It did to me at first – and that’s precisely why I’ve been holding on to it until the right time, a time when someone like you would be willing to open your mind to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that time is now. Why? Because some of the finest minds on the planet are starting to discover powerful evidence supporting my claims. Creative and &lt;strong&gt;scientific geniuses&lt;/strong&gt; like Stephen Hawking, Michio Kaku and Neil Turok, all of whom are responsible for unbelievable breakthroughs in the field of quantum physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just as important as the acknowledgement of experts is what I’ve seen and experienced for myself. After sharing Quantum Jumping with selected students in my seminars, I’ve seen them &lt;strong&gt;manifest incredible results.&lt;/strong&gt; Stories of creativity and inspiration, stories of rags to riches, the kind of stories you’d usually only find in those feel good Hollywood blockbusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now it’s time for you to have your own story – which is why I’ve compiled a sample 6-module Quantum Jumping Introduction Course, so that you, and as many people as possible can gain an understanding of this remarkable phenomenon, and &lt;strong&gt;change your life for the better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! That’s funny because I’ve never heard Stephen Hawking  say anything remotely like this. Nor Michio Kaku. I’d love if this website would cite exactly where these scientists discussed it. Sadly, they never do. And if this was as successful as these guys claim, why aren’t they rich and famous? Can they cite any specific examples of former students of theirs who have achieved great success who we might know of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Burt Goldman must be a zillionaire a thousand times over with this new science he’s pioneered. I can’t wait to see the peer-reviewed studies showing this actually works. Oh, right. There are none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this Balony Detection Kit:&lt;/p&gt;

Attending many, many Mind Body Spirit (Wallet) festivals has taught me to keep a straight face, feign ignorance and ask questions.  This approach has given me a valuable insight into the thinking of those we oppose or at least investigate.  It’s hard to underestimate the amount of information peddlers of woo, will gladly tell you when you seem really interested in what they have to say.  My best result was a number of years ago when I managed to have members of the Australian Homeopathic Association Inc tell me at a Parents, Babies &amp;amp; Childrens’ Expo to keep clear of orthodox vaccinations but instead use homeopathy. (See &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/theskeptic/2005/2_homeopathy.pdf"&gt;Homeopathy Exposed Again!&lt;/a&gt; ) This resulted in Australian Skeptics blowing the whistle on the Australian Homeopathic Association Inc in the press and on radio.  A good outcome for our side.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jrefmail@randi.org (Richard Saunders)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246944901524"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/put_over_the_knee_and_spanked.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/958ed24549ccee4f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Feminist Stylings"/><title type="html">Put Over the Knee and Spanked in the Not Sexy Way....</title><published>2009-07-07T04:13:14Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T04:13:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/dEIRWVTKiHE/put_over_the_knee_and_spanked.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/put_over_the_knee_and_spanked.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Go check out &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bioephemera/2009/07/thats_one_way_to_get_bacon.php"&gt;these vintage ads&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/bioephemera"&gt;Bioephemera&lt;/a&gt;.  As I commented on her blog, I think she's trying to bait me.  It's totally working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Isis's sweet scibling BioE links to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bioephemera/2009/07/06/Spanking.jpg"&gt;this vintage advertisement&lt;/a&gt; of a woman turned over her husband's knee and spanked for bringing home the coffee without checking its "freshness."  It may be shocking to the modern liberated woman, but it is by no means unique.  That period was littered with domestic violence in popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/07/put_over_the_knee_and_spanked/spanking%20montage.jpg" alt="spanking montage.jpg" height="345" width="375"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1:  Back then &lt;i&gt;real men&lt;/i&gt; like Desi Arnaz, Elvis, and John Wayne all took their wives to task when they were out of line and got too mouthy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, part of what I love about Bioephemera posting that advertisement is that these kinds of posts seem to bring the real winners out to comment.  Winner and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bioephemera/2009/07/thats_one_way_to_get_bacon.php#comment-1757084"&gt;total dreamboat Art writes&lt;/a&gt; on BioE's blog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;
First, you don't give a proper spanking through a skirt. Skirts and petticoats, the petticoats are a nice touch, should be lifted. Also she seems to enjoying it too much. And what is that on her wrist? Looks like a substantial bit of bling... [It] first one does have a playful edge expressed through the look on the ladies face that carries the scene so it isn't entirely without some virtue. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How fortunate that Art is here to enlighten us on proper wife beating technique.  Still, I couldn't help but think that maybe Art was right in thinking that the ad wasn't quite right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I'd take my hand at correcting it for him.  Behind the cut for those of you at work...&lt;br&gt;

Turns out that there are both electrochemical methods to do it and electrodialysis methods (I'd call electrodialisys a subset of electrochemistry). But this is not a post on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;This is a post on an amazing product called the &lt;a href="http://www.equinox-products.com/HardnessMaster.htm"&gt;Hardness Master&lt;/a&gt;. Look at the amazing things this thing can do!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;p&gt; ▪ Provides an effective and healthy alternative to Water Softeners and De-scalers&lt;br&gt; ▪ Utilizes latest MaxConditioning™ technology to effectively address a broader range of scale and hard water problems&lt;br&gt; ▪ &lt;strong&gt;Handles up to 50 grains per gallon (or 50 gpg or 855 mg/L or 855 ppm) of water hardness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The Total # of grains per gallon (gpg) is equal to the Total # of mg/L value ÷ 17.1 (i.e., Total gpg = Total mg/L ÷ 17.1)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt; ▪ Easy to install &lt;em&gt;(do-it-yourself installation requires no plumber and no cutting of pipes)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; ▪ Accommodates up to 1 1/2" plumbing, or even greater (call for details) &lt;br&gt; ▪ NO salt or chemicals needed &lt;em&gt;(healthier &amp;amp; wiser choice)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; ▪ &lt;strong&gt;"Green" and eco-friendly&lt;/strong&gt; technology&lt;br&gt; ▪ No Maintenance &lt;em&gt;(just "set it and forget it" operation)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; ▪ Extends the life of your water heater and plumbing fixtures&lt;br&gt; ▪ Works with Copper, PVC and Steel pipes&lt;br&gt; ▪ Soap and shampoo lather much better &lt;br&gt; ▪ Changes the Hard Water Molecules to Soft Crystals &lt;br&gt; ▪ Treated Water Feels Silky Smooth &lt;br&gt; ▪ Prevents new Scale forming&lt;br&gt; ▪ Removes old Scale layers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;It's that MaxConditioning Technology that I am admiring so much! Really, who knew that running current in a coil could provide me with such an amazing list of properties as mentioned above! I mean really it changes Hard Water Molecules to Soft Crystals! Is that a molecule of hard water, or a water molecule that is hard? Calcium carbonate is a rock, a crystal of it is soft? Oh look! Customer testimonials!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Clearly this product has all the markings of being woo. But is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SlLFxqb8IeI/AAAAAAAABG8/sXaPYaSZRHc/s800/HardnessMaster_HowItWorks1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SlLFwrlu5ZI/AAAAAAAABG4/c-ZSxSrv2Aw/s800/HardnessMaster_HowItWorks1-thumb.jpg" height="332" width="380" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;OK, lets discuss the core technology here. There are so many things wrong with the description it is hard to know where to start. So, I'll go in bits and pieces and I hope you'll bear with me. Lets start with the field it creates . &lt;a href="http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/phy00/phy00338.htm"&gt;Electric fields and magnetic fields are in fact related&lt;/a&gt; but to simplify, an electric field is defined by the voltage potential between two objects (think Van Der Graf generator, or lightning) while an magnetic field is defined by the current traveling through a conductor (think electromagnet). MaxConditioning Technology is the latter, current runs through a wire, it is not an "electric field" as claimed. So which is it? Does an electric field make this process work? That would mean that this device doesn't do what it says because it created a magnetic field, not an electric one. So what about this magnetic field?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HardnessMaster™ advanced MaxConditioning™ technology produces an oscillating electric field in the water pipe (refer to pictures above and below) which changes continuously in frequency and amplitude. This changes the property of the hardness minerals so they stay in solution and not form scale in pipes, water heater, on fixtures and bath walls, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;What exactly is a "hardness mineral"? Shall we presume that they meant a magnetic field and that this performs the magic for them? OK, fine, but by what mechanism? Magnets mostly affect metals, in particular ferrous metals. If used in MRI strengths and frequencies, can be used to energize water. But there really isn't much of a case to be made that calcium carbonate is affects by magnets in any way. OK, so they oscillate the magnetic field at varying frequencies, but how does that change the solubility of the calcium? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.desline.com/articoli/8172.pdf"&gt;Here &lt;/a&gt;is an article that studied the solubility of calcium carbonate in water in a magnetic field (a static, unchanging one). The result?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was found that magnetic treatment increases the total amount of precipitate...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Uh, that's the opposite of what you want! They claimed the magnetic field decreased solubility, not precipitation! However, it appears that even with precipitation, there is a little more to the story. If you have precipitation of CaCO3 (calcium carbonate), you want it to come out in the water and not on the surfaces of things. So even with precipitation, if it only comes out in the flowing water, a case could be made that it is better than scaling up on and in small orifices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;I think we can say that &lt;a href="http://www.wqa.org/pdf/GovRelations/WQAMagneticsTaskForceReport.pdf"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is probably the definitive summary report on using magnetic fields to clean up water. They looked at 108 articles on magnetic water treatment and took the 34 best, based on procedural quality, measurement quality, hypothesis testing and other merits. While this great summary mostly concerns itself with permanent magnets without changing fields, there is one paper in there by Fan and Cho that seems to be the one that this particular device is based off of. Its a 1997 paper called, "Microscopic Observation of Calcium Carbonate Particles:Validation of an electronic Anti-Fouling Technology". There were three other papers by this group in 1998 and 1999 all using the same "anti-fouling technology" with small, but measurable differences in scale buildup between the AFT use and nonuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;However these results are not replicated by anyone, and the WQA discusses these papers in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SlLF1oQpfyI/AAAAAAAABHI/uwImhHBN-Rw/s800/Snapshot_2009-07-06_22-38-07.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SlLFyGr4e0I/AAAAAAAABHE/i5w6je5dSoM/s800/Snapshot_2009-07-06_22-38-07-thumb1.jpg" height="166" width="600" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The report doesn't set out to make any definitive statement statement that magnetic water treatments works (nor did the even define what "working" means). In fact, they summarize the findings of these 34 papers as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SlLF2GD5ooI/AAAAAAAABHQ/nPYuqlQF0y4/s800/Snapshot_2009-07-06_22-51-43.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SlLF13jvplI/AAAAAAAABHM/BGOeRkamVxA/s800/Snapshot_2009-07-06_22-51-43-thumb1.jpg" height="68" width="500" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One thing to note from the summary. None of the papers were able to verify any of the proposed hypotheses of why magnetic water treatment should work . Most of the papers didn't even show much, if any, improvement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;With no verified mechanism by which scaling would be prevented, sporadic and limited evidence that magnetic therapy has any effect at all on water quality, no reason that a magnetic field should have any effect on a non-ferrous particle, in particular calcium carbonate, and no verification that pulsing a magnetic field through which water with high calcium concentrations flow does anything, I think we can safely say that, until there is more evidence, this is not effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Forgetting for the moment that the core technology is unlikely to work, lets take a look at some of the other claims...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will also gradually dissolve away any preexisting scale that may exist in your pipes and water appliances&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Oh goody another claim for which a possible mechanism is completely absent. The coil only wraps around one little spot, why would scale that is located in the faucet get removed? I believe that the possibility they are going for is that if the calcium particles have agglomerated, then the water surrounding the crystals will have a low concentration of calcium in it, therefore the scale has a chance to dissolve in it. Or at least, thats how I would defend this claim if this were my product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;"Green" and eco-friendly&lt;/strong&gt; technology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;This would only be true if the device worked! Otherwise its a power consuming chink of plastic and metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;The funniest part, with respect to the rest of the product description is the &lt;a href="http://www.equinox-products.com/animations/hm/hardnessMaster.html"&gt;animation&lt;/a&gt;, which completely counters the claims made on the first page and all of the supporting data from journal papers as presented above. In that animation they do claim that the solubility rises. They show larger particles entering the coil area, and no particles leaving implying that they get dissolved. This is completely in opposition to the idea of "hard water molecules" being changed into "soft crystals". It also goes completely against the results from Cho in their anti-fouling papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;So we have:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extraordinary claims that defy current understanding of a process&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;User testimonials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flashy animations that describe processes that don't happen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Appeals to being green, cheap, easy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;I say don't buy this product. What do you say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;P.S. If anyone at &lt;a href="http://www.equinox-products.com/products.htm"&gt;Vitasalus&lt;/a&gt; (feel free to browse their selection of other woo-ish products), who makes this product, wants an independent test of it, I will happily do a professional job of it. But I am not going to spend 300 bucks just to find out that I was right on the off chance that I might be wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youngausskeptics.com/anthology/" title="Go to the nomination form"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/3000/sba150x70.png" alt="Submit to Skeptical Blog Anthology 2009" width="150" height="70"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/26613182-7980827345429277880?l=techskeptic.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Techskeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Effort Sisyphus</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246938159304"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8053">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/27caafb6617b9c4c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Contests"/><title type="html">Last Call for Tang!</title><published>2009-07-07T03:00:39Z</published><updated>2009-07-07T03:00:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8053" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eabf0397d6a4639a524a2211391c2d47&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will be picking and judging your Tang creations at TAM!

Today, I&amp;#39;d vote for T&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Land_Is_Your_Land"&gt;his Land is Your Land, This Land is My Land&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m fond of the 1986 Los Lobos / Bob Weir / Gerry Garcia version on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM18HENqNbk"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, and Arlo Guthrie &amp;amp; friends singing verses (also on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtYbl6E5xQ"&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;). 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here it is sung in a choral version by a high-school choir (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z3VaYcz45U"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;) -- poor acoustics and I am not wild about the choral arrangement.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a herd of preschoolers (or kindergarteners) singing (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2aEcRDTGXo"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And 1,803 guitarists and singers ( &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MHO4Wc9aZk"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; -- sorry, the audio is terrible)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a concert-hall version from the gospel group the Talley Trio (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_L3FqVCqQc"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On to replacing the &lt;a href="http://www.usflag.org/"&gt;Pledge of Allegiance&lt;/a&gt;, which only &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance"&gt;dates back to 1892&lt;/a&gt;, and the &amp;quot;under God&amp;quot; phrase was only officially added in 1952.  &lt;a href="http://chicagoboyz.net/archives/7848.html"&gt;Shannon Love&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://chicagoboyz.net/"&gt;Chicago Boyz &lt;/a&gt;suggests replacing the Pledge with a recitation of the Preamble:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We hold these truths to be self-evident,
&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;
that all men are created equal,

that they are endowed by their Creator
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
that among these are
&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;
Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;
That to secure these rights,
&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;
Governments are instituted among Men,
&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I believe in the United States of America as a government of the people, by the people, for the people; whose just powers are derived from the consent of the governed, a democracy in a republic, a sovereign Nation of many sovereign States; a perfect union, one and inseparable; established upon those principles of freedom, equality, justice, and humanity for which American patriots sacrificed their lives and fortunes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I therefore believe it is my duty to my country to love it, to support its Constitution, to obey its laws, to respect its flag, and to defend it against all enemies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;You see, Isis the Scientist is just that -- a real life scientist. I come with all the accessories. I have a lab coat, safety glasses, a cool notebook, and 2-3 Sharpies in my pocket at any given time. I also have some data.  I am, basically, amazing.  And also very humble.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/07/how_blogging_can_hurt_your_car/Baby%20Phat%20coat.jpg" alt="Baby Phat coat.jpg" height="600" width="449"&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.uniform.ca/assets/images/bplab-26332-26370.jpg"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;: I mean, sure Dr. Isis's labcoat is Baby Phat, but whatevs. Lab couture is pretty hot.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;I really love the idea of the Citizen Scientist movement and teaching science to the huddled masses, thirsting for knowledge.  I like to keep tabs on people like ScienceGoddess &lt;a href="http://www.joannelovesscience.com/"&gt;Joanne Manaster&lt;/a&gt;. That woman cracks me up and her videos are amazing. So much so, that I don't smite her over the whole "goddess" thing. I mean, have you seen her silk/acrylic earrings in her &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g11-I30jaNk"&gt;recent video&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;But, I digress. Hot earrings will do that to me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;I love the idea of Citizen Science, but I also know that, to use wording from a recent grant application, there are particular things that I am &amp;quot;uniquely qualified&amp;quot; to do and I am not sure that I am on board with the idea that the interwebs or general public will ever completely replace classically trained bench scientists.  I love keeping my blog, but I know that my job first and foremost is to be a totally hot and promising young investigator.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="justify"&gt;That's why my ears (er, eyes?) perk up whenever I see an article or blog post about how blogging can impact one's career as a scientist.
  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;Last week, Godfather of the Internet Coturnix from&lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/clock"&gt; Blog Around the Clock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/boraz"&gt;tweeted a post&lt;/a&gt; written by Alex Wild entitled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://myrmecos.wordpress.com/2009/06/24/is-blogging-bad-for-my-academic-career/"&gt;Is Blogging Bad for my Academic Career&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/em&gt;You might remember Alex from over at the ScienceBlog &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/photosynthesis"&gt;Photo Synthesis.&lt;/a&gt;  He&amp;#39;s the dude with the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/photosynthesis/2009/05/the_ant-mugging_flies_of_kwazu.php"&gt;smokin' ant pictures&lt;/a&gt; (as opposed to Isis, who is a smokin' aunt).
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/07/how_blogging_can_hurt_your_car/Godfather%20Coturnix.jpg" alt="Godfather Coturnix.jpg" height="336" width="448"&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/photo.php?pid=34573106&amp;amp;id=11805043"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt;: Godfather Coturnix. If you screw with that guy, he'll put &lt;a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/?p=629"&gt;a horse head in your print journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;So, you can bet that when I saw that title, I clicked through faster than you can say "&lt;a href="http://www.sephora.com/"&gt;Sephora&lt;/a&gt;."
  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Here's what Alex has to say about blogging and his career...

&lt;p&gt;It comes from “Bob.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His girlfriend’s dad is subborn, conservative-but-science-inclined, and a partial geek.  He doesn’t believe in the supernatural, but appreciates church for the community it provides and for “maintaining harmony in the household.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His girlfriend’s mom is a very devout Christian — a Southern Baptist.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His girlfriend is an atheist.  According to her dad, it’s just a phase.  (Yep.  You read that right.  Her dad.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s Bob:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Not wanting to maintain lies with her folks, my girlfriend told her mom that I was an atheist to no real conflict. When she told her mom that she was an atheist, however, the sparks began to fly.  Her mother insists that I’m a bad influence and insists that I was the one who led her astray, and her father (her father!) laid down an ultimatum: break up with me for her spiritual growth, or forfeit college support, medical insurance, and further contact with them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How’s that for religious compassion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets worse.  Bob and his girlfriend can’t really support themselves right now… Bob will graduate in a semester and he will hopefully find a job.  The girlfriend would have to put her college plans on hold until then.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of medical insurance might force them to have to get married for financial reasons, and that’s not very romantic.  But it might be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob explains that using that Dad’s unbelief against him wouldn’t work.  Furthermore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Maintaining a relationship with her parents is an extremely high priority for my girlfriend, so burning bridges is out of the question, but she also knows that if she gives in here, she’ll just have to fight the same battle again down the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think she’ll ditch me for the education, logical as that would be, because she’s not willing anymore to live her life on their terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you or your community have any thoughts for us?&lt;/strong&gt;  I think we’re at an impasse and, barring renegotiation of the ultimatum, we’ll be striking it out on our own.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instinctively, I would tell Bob to just give it a shot and try striking out on his own.  It won’t be too long before he’s working (assuming he gets a job) and then he’ll be somewhat ok financially even if it’s really rough for a while.  Hopefully, by that time, her parents will have come around.&lt;/p&gt;

He's dead! But that's one corpse that you know isn't going to rest easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the ghouls are out in force. &lt;a href="http://www.palluxo.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=609:exclusive-interview-with-dead-michael-jackson-psychic-medium&amp;amp;catid=4:news&amp;amp;Itemid=104"&gt;"psychic" ghoul James Van Praagh says he's been having conversations with Jackson's ghost&lt;/a&gt;; ghoul enabler Oprah Winfrey has quickly snatched him up to appear on her show and make the entire country disgusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sylvia Browne, quick to gnaw the scraps off the bones, now &lt;a href="http://www.palluxo.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=619:after-death-michael-jackson-shows-signs-of-life&amp;amp;catid=90:blogs&amp;amp;Itemid=284"&gt;claims that &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; has been chatting with the dead guy&lt;/a&gt;. Coming in second means she gets the consolation prize of appearing on the Montel Williams show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is now a &lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,28383,25739531-5019114,00.html"&gt;video circulating about that claims to have captured Jackson's ghost&lt;/a&gt; walking through a hallway in Neverland. Oh, the ignominy of it all: lively, talented, enthusiastic black kid, reduced to creepy, wispy white man, and now at the end, seen as nothing more than a compression artifact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after the flesh has been stripped from his bones, something has to be done with those untidy scraps of discarded mortality, lest they interfere with subsequent myths about his faked death and new life frolicking about with Elvis. There will be a memorial service. A huge, overblown, &lt;i&gt;expensive&lt;/i&gt; memorial service to the tune of $2.5 million. Would you believe there is a &lt;i&gt;poll&lt;/i&gt; about who should pay for it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/06/should-california-taxpaye_n_226643.html"&gt;Should California Taxpayers Pay For Michael Jackson's Memorial?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yes, absolutely, 100%. 46.73%&lt;br&gt;

 They should pay for some of it, and the Jacksons should also help pay. 22.43%&lt;br&gt;

 No, this is not their responsibility. 30.84%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;They can't be serious. A dead wealthy popular entertainer with an &lt;i&gt;extremely&lt;/i&gt; checkered reputation should not be receiving a state-sponsored funeral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will say that she got the household work off last week, when I had dinner ready for her every night when she came through the door at 6:45, after spending the day with both boys (who were off from school). But yes, when she returned from a July Fourth weekend last night I was the one who expected to kick back a little bit. She had spent the last two days with friends and family, waving sparklers on July 4th night and releasing Ned to play with new friends who’ve become very special to him at grandpa’s lake house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/06/focus.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of JunCTionS (flickr.com)" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo courtesy of JunCTionS (flickr.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent July Fourth with Alex, walking one end of the Bronx Zoo to another, looking at the animals. Later we hit a coffee shop. Alex had chicken fingers; I had a BLT. Neither of us had a hot dog or a hamburger with chips on a paper plate, and that’s because Alex and his autism are too hard to chase at grandpa’s lake house. The zoo was great, the BLT tasty. But they added up to no real Fourth of July with family or friends for either Alex or me, and that’s autism’s fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I could crab jere about autism or remember the Thanksgiving of 1981 (also a bummer), or I could join forces with Jill and make sure that next year if the neither of us actually get the work off, at least we’re all overworked in the same place. Book a car early. Try to book a babysitter early. Plan activities with Alex at grandpa’s lake house, a schedule to eat the afternoon. Treat July Fourth with the importance is has come to acquire. Do not surrender to the temptation and the slippery slope of excluding Alex from family events. Somehow give autism a holiday weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

The atrocity only came to light because one of the staff people lost their cell phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it seems that one of the staff people, a woman named Stephanie Garza, is being &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/self-advocacy_and_support_worker_atrocities"&gt;offered immunity in return for testimony&lt;/a&gt;--not an overly popular offer.  But even more disturbing is this statement from the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge in this case is that most of the victims suffer from some sort of mental disability and a jury is much more likely to doubt their testimony than the testimony of someone like Garza, who is perfectly competent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference back to the connection between &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/megaconference_special_1_of_6_violence_and_abuse"&gt;abuse and power&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we protect ourselves, how do we report violence in a way that assures the violence will end, when we are so often automatically dismissed just because we have a diagnosis of something "mental?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is all too easy to continue to abuse when there are no, or very light, consequences to the action.&lt;/p&gt;

At least, I think that's what I have; my attempts to get the condition diagnosed have generally been unsatisfying. For me, it manifests as a static sound, accompanied by a feeling of movement or pressure or something in my ear canal. It comes and goes, and it usually accompanies sounds, but not with any particular pattern I've been able to discern. Naturally, it never seems to happen when I'm getting tested, so I'm sure that's contributed to the vagueness of my diagnoses. It's a nuisance, more than anything, but I'd certainly like to be rid of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, recently I've heard this commercial on my local Air America affiliate. It starts with some overly dramatic voices--"Do you hear it?" "I hear it all the time!" "It's annoying." "It keeps me awake at night."--and so forth. There's an annoying sound in the background, which rises in intensity as the voices rise in desperation, and if that portion of the commercial were to escalate any further, I'd expect it to head for some desperate Lovecraftian or Poeian declaration of insanity--"'TIS THE BEATING OF HIS HIDEOUS HEART!" or something. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cue the soothing sales pitch, saying that you can "hear the silence" with &lt;a href="http://www.quietrelief.com/"&gt;Quietus&lt;/a&gt;, an all-natural herbal remedy for tinnitus. My first reaction was one of sardonic literary geekery: yes, I imagine that &lt;a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/quietus"&gt;quietus&lt;/a&gt; is a cure for a great many ailments. All of them, in fact. I just wonder if they make it with a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_be,_or_not_to_be"&gt;bare bodkin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That lame English major joke would have been the end of this post, but that "all-natural herbal" tagline in the commercial seemed like an opening for copious amounts of woo, so I dug a little deeper. Lo and behold, when I found their website (such as it is--it's just a one-page ad with no information about the composition), the woo ran hot and cold like pure water:&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kYu2r3RVPhY/SlJfD7DoTVI/AAAAAAAABA4/6hLsojYj9Jo/s1600-h/safe_graphic.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="width:273px;height:153px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kYu2r3RVPhY/SlJfD7DoTVI/AAAAAAAABA4/6hLsojYj9Jo/s400/safe_graphic.gif" border="0" vspace="3" title="I suppose it&amp;#39;d cause quietus if you drank enough of it." alt="I suppose it&amp;#39;d cause quietus if you drank enough of it."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's right, it's homeopathic. For the two of you who don't know, &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/homeo.html"&gt;homeopathy&lt;/a&gt; is a pseudoscientific alternative medicine modality based around the "Law of Similars"--that if you have some symptom, the way to cure it is by taking small amounts of substances that &lt;i&gt;cause&lt;/i&gt; that symptom. In order to achieve those small amounts, one part of the allegedly curative substance is diluted in ten or one hundred parts of water, which is then shaken in a particular way. This procedure may be repeated several times, giving incredibly dilute solutions. And by "incredibly dilute," I mean "well beyond Avogadro's Number, so diluted that none of the solute remains in the solution." This is okay, because the water has memory, and shaking it causes something about the vibrations of the substance to yadda yadda. The point being that if it worked the way homeopaths claim, it would require us to completely rewrite the laws of physics. Thankfully for the physicists, homeopathic remedies consistently fail all well-designed tests of efficacy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, it's possible that Quietus uses one of the more potent dilutions--1X, for instance, would be a 1/10 dilution, which is quite potent for some substances. I don't know, because the website doesn't include any information on the product. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what the website &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; have is a phone number. I decided that this blog fodder was too rich to pass up, especially since it hit so close to home. So I gave them a call. I stayed on hold for awhile, jotting down the questions I wanted to make sure to ask. Eventually a representative picked up--we'll call him Dane--and asked me basic information about my name and condition. I was completely honest, describing my symptoms just as I did above, and mentioning that I've had them since about sixth grade or so. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He explained that Quietus is a chewable tablet that you take twice a day; over the course of the conversation, he further explained that most people show an effect in seven to ten days, and that you should wean yourself off of it once your symptoms are gone. But he was also careful to note that this isn't a cure for tinnitus, but it will cause the symptoms to go away, or it will cause you to stop noticing the symptoms--that much wasn't entirely clear. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dane mentioned in the early part of the call that Quietus is a proprietary mix of various herbal remedies "proven" to relieve the buzzing, ringing, etc., associated with tinnitus. He also noted that it was "certified effective by the FDA Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia." When I could, I asked if he'd be able to tell me the ingredients--I wouldn't want to risk an allergic reaction, after all. He listed off a bunch of ingredients: Potassium blends, sodium, salicylic acid, iodide, and something called "cenosha" or "senosha" bark. I've tried looking up the latter on Google in a variety of spellings, but I can't find anything even close. After each substance, he mentioned that it has been "proved" to be effective on tinnitus symptoms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I then moved on to the only question I had to really play dumb for: "You mentioned it's certified effective by the FDA Homeopathic...what did you say? I've heard of homeopathic stuff before, what is it?" Dane explained that it was the branch of the FDA in charge of vitamins and supplements. I understand what he meant, but he really wasn't answering anything even remotely like the question I asked. It was also clear that he either didn't know what homeopathy was, or really didn't want to say--and I suspect the former. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, I asked, since it had been certified effective by the FDA, if there were any clinical trials. He answered that they had been proved effective, and that it had been proved for five years to be safe and effective. I asked if the results would be published anywhere, and if that information was available; Dane said that the literature that would be included with the pills would have testimonials and such. I may have cut him off a bit there; "I was thinking more like medical journals or something like that." He replied that he was pretty much just a salesman, and wasn't sure about anything like that. Obviously, I understood that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given that, I said that I wasn't sure if he'd be able to answer the other question--"What mechanism it works through, like the biochemistry of it?" He really didn't know, and I didn't blame him. At one point he'd said that the remedies enter the body and cause the brain (or ear) to no longer recognize the noise, but it was unclear how this happened. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dane realized at that point that he hadn't even told me how much it cost--$59.95 for one bottle of 64 pills (I think that was the number), and discounts for more bottles, plus a 100% money-back guarantee if I'm not satisfied. I explained that I'd have to do a little more research first, and that I'd call him back. I realized the call wouldn't end there, because I'm sure he gets paid on commission. He asked whether it was a cost issue, or if I was just skeptical about whether or not it worked; I answered that it was a little of both. Dane suggested that the best way to find out if it works is to try it yourself, and I really held back the torrent that &lt;a href="http://rockstarramblings.blogspot.com/2006/11/doggerel-46-dont-knock-woo-before-you.html"&gt;that Doggerel&lt;/a&gt; could unleash. I said "sure," and Dane said that everyone was different, so even if you look at all the trials, it won't tell whether or not it'll work for you. I agreed, but said that I know there are also cognitive biases that I wouldn't want to fall into, and so I'd like to do a little more research before I make a decision. Dane said that he thought we could both agree that the best idea would be to do some more research, look at the information, and try it myself. I chuckled a little and said that I agreed, and I figured I'd do the first step and call him back for the second. I thanked him for the information, and he more or less hung up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't want to say anything disparaging about Dane, he was a nice guy, not really pushy at all, and I only wish he was a little more knowledgeable about the product. I feel a little bad for him; I wasn't going to be dropping $60 on homeopathic pills, regardless of the dosage, and so I did kind of waste his time. It's not his fault that homeopathy is bunk; he's just the guy answering the phones, and he wasn't prepared for some skeptic blogger to call and bother him for twenty minutes. Then again, that wouldn't be a concern if his employers weren't peddling pseudoscience as real treatment. Thinking back, I would have liked to have asked him about the dilution, but that would have tipped my hand as someone who knew a thing or two about homeopathy. I also would have liked to know if there were any expected side effects, and I'm kicking myself a little for not thinking of that in the first place. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to hit on that "proved" word which kept coming up in the conversation. Now, if it were a normal drug, then I would expect that word to refer to a multi-phase series of clinical trials, the results of which would be published in medical journals and available to anyone with the appropriate subscription. What "proving" means, apparently, in homeopathy is "homeopaths showing that a given substance causes a given symptom at some dosage." I don't know that this is what Dane meant in particular (and I don't know if he'd have known either), but I do find the repetition of that particular word to be interesting, since it &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; have such significance in homeopathy. In any case, the fact that it's in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia really doesn't mean anything to me; the FDA's regulations governing homeopathy are almost nonexistent, a problem exposed most recently by the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=530"&gt;Zicam scandal&lt;/a&gt;. If Quietus went through tests to demonstrate safety, as Dane suggested, then it went above and beyond what's necessary under FDA guidelines. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What all this comes down to is that tinnitus is really the perfect woo-friendly ailment. The symptoms are &lt;i&gt;entirely&lt;/i&gt; subjective, which opens the door to some significant psychological effects. At least in my case, the symptoms also come and go irregularly and unpredictably, and I'd be a little surprised if even chronic tinnitus didn't wax and wane in severity over time. Not only does this open the door to &lt;a href="http://skepdic.com/confirmbias.html"&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc"&gt;post hoc ergo propter hoc&lt;/a&gt; thinking, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_fallacy"&gt;regression fallacies&lt;/a&gt;, but it explicitly suggests that the latter is to be expected as a normal effect of treatment. Quietus isn't a cure, and Dane specifically recommended keeping some pills on-hand in case symptoms recurred. Therefore, any improvement in symptoms--even if that improvement is just normal, expected regression to the mean--would be attributed to the pills' effectiveness, and any restoration of symptoms has already been explained away as normal, expected, and reason to use more pills. I think the only fault in this scheme is the relatively small pool of sufferers--which I think accounts for the $60 bottles, as opposed to a more Zicam-esque $15 or so--but even then, since there is no actual cure, they've got a chance of snagging quite a large portion of those sufferers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't say, without knowing a little more, whether or not this is a scam. After all, it &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; have therapeutic dosages of the substances in question, and they &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; be effective. What I &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; say that there's not a chance that I'll be dropping $60 on tinnitus remedies anytime soon, and that "try it for yourself" is about the last method I'd choose to evaluate the efficacy of such a drug.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20494433-1690415371218947613?l=dubitoergo.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Foss</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Dubito Ergo Sum</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246923795539"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/musing_about_skeptical_bloggin.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5d3f67d7860b9c19</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Education"/><title type="html">Musing about skeptical blogging.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park describes the scene: "The stage is black and bare except for a pulpit, a small altar bench, three rickety folding chairs, and a coat tree, all starkly white. Brother Sam, in his signature frock coat, blue vest and matching spectacles, conducts the crowd through a hilarious and hair-raising tour of his childhood among 'the tongues-speaking, snake-handling, frothing-at-the-mouth holy rollers,' and subsequent 'reversion to the atheistic state into which we all are born,' before ending Act I with a mercilessly satiric deconstruction of the role of God in American life."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She notes that the second act has Brother Sam teaching a "biblically accurate but somewhat irreverent "Bible class" in which Brother Sam satirically details the symbolic use of penises throughout the Scriptures. "Nobody ever told me that what ties the whole book together, its narrative thread, is penises,' he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I'm going to have to try and make it to this one.&lt;/p&gt;

Coli and the New Science of Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; will be published. In the book I approach &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; as a microscopic oracle that can reveal great secrets about how life in general works. This is not actually a rhetorical stretch; over the past century scientists have put a spectacular amount of work into understanding this bug. And, as I write in the book, &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; continues to offer surprises. In celebration of the arrival of the paperback &lt;em&gt;Microcosm&lt;/em&gt;, I’m going to take a look at some fresh-out-of-the-oven research on &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; that may change the way you think about life as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no better way to kick off &lt;em&gt;Microcosm&lt;/em&gt; Week than with some chocolate chip cookies. Or, to be specific, some raw cookie dough carrying a dangerous cargo of toxic &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name ” &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; ” embraces a veritable empire of bacteria. While all  &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; share the same backbone of certain genes, they can be divvied up into a vast number of strains, each with a distinctive genetic profile. Many of those strains are harmless. You have a couple dozen strains of  &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;  dwelling inside you right now, quietly grazing on the extra sugar in your gut. But some strains are extremely nasty. One strain, known as  &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; O157:H7, can stick to the walls of the intestines and build needles through which it can inject molecules into host cells that can alter them in many ways, so that the cells disgorge food the microbe can eat. Typically this manipulation leads to painful, bloody diarrhea but little more. On rare occasion, however, the bacteria unleash toxins that can spread through the blood stream, killing cells and leading to kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of June the Centers for Disease Control &lt;a href="http://cdc.gov/ecoli/2009/0630.html"&gt;detected&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; O157:H7 in a batch of Nestle chocolate cookie dough. It’s a mysterious new move from a mysterious microbe. The normal host of  &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; O157:H7 is livestock–especially cows and sheep. In those animals, this strain doesn’t seem to do much harm and may even benefit its host. &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/21/8713.abstract"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; on the evolution of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; O157:H7 suggest that it emerged and spread in parallel with the spread of cattle over the past 1000 years. The bacteria can spread from cow to cow by passing out of one host with their droppings. The bacteria can survive for months in a barn or a corral, and can then get blown onto grass or other food eaten by another cow. People can get sick from an infected cow if its intestines are nicked during slaughter and the bacteria can contaminate the muscle. That’s why you should always cook hamburgers all the way through–just a few microbes are enough to get you sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet some of the worst outbreaks of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; O157:H7 have not been caused by tainted beef. In 1996, for example, radish sprouts contaminated with &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; O157:H7 &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol5no3/watanabe.htm"&gt;infected&lt;/a&gt; thousands of school children in Japan. And now the bacteria have turned up in cookie dough. There’s no official word for how the bacteria got from a cow to a cookie (or at least, a cookie in the making). But chances are good that the story is going to be complicated, in a way that’s both disturbing and fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I base that prediction on the last headline-making &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;outbreak, in 2006. Then it was spinach that was ferrying the bacteria, not cookie dough or sprouts. Over the course of two months, 205 people got sick from tainted spinach, and 15% of them developed the more dangerous form of the infection (called hemolytic uremic syndrome). That was over three times the average rate in previous outbreaks, and so scientists have taken a closer look at these particular bacteria–this sub-sub-strain, as it were, to figure out what made it so nasty. The scientists published their preliminary results last year (about which I wrote&lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2186711/"&gt; a piece for&lt;em&gt; Slate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), but now they’ve &lt;a href="http://iai.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/IAI.00198-09v1"&gt;just published&lt;/a&gt; their detailed analysis in the journal &lt;em&gt;Infection and Immunity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study drives home a remarkable lesson: the bacteria that caused the spinach outbreak was different in many ways from other &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; O157:H7. It changed in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way #1: New mutations arose spontaneously in individual microbes, were passed down from ancestors to descendants, and then spread through the population by natural selection or a more random process called genetic drift. These mutations altered genes that carry out many functions in &lt;em&gt;E. coli,&lt;/em&gt; from the chemical reactions it uses to break down food to the shape of its membrane. It also has mutant genes for cellulose and for hair-like projections from its surface, both of which have proven important to &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; O157:H7’s ability to stick to surfaces, like those of sprouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way #2: It turns out there are also a lot of genes in the spinach outbreak bacteria that are not found in any &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; O157:H7. Some aren’t even found in any other &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. These genes did not evolve through the familiar rise of new mutations in old genes. Instead, the bacteria picked them up from other species at some point in the past few years. Viruses, for example, can accidentally pick up genes from one host and then insert them in the genome of a different host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genes acquired by the spinach &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;include one encoding a protein that can twist the DNA in your cells so that they can’t send out alarms to your immune system. Another imported gene allows the bacteria to suck in the iron-bearing molecules in your blood. And two other genes bears a striking resemblance to a pair of genes found only in a species of bacteria that grows on plant roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those genes are particularly interesting. The plant-dwelling bacteria uses their genes to manipulate the biology of their plant hosts, such as stimulating the roots they live in to grow. It’s possible that when the spinach &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; picked up these genes, they helped the bacteria thrive by letting them grow on plants. In other words, this particular kind of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; didn’t just get swept away from its ordinary home inside a cow. Along with genes for living inside mammals, it has also picked up genes that help it live on plants. And it made that transition only very recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll have to wait to see if the cookie &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; has evolved its own peculiar set of genes. But as I write in &lt;em&gt;Microcosm&lt;/em&gt;, this kind of evolutionary history–a mix of mutations handed down through the generations along with genes moving from one species to another–is hardly unique to a few outbreaks of food poisoning. In fact, these intertwined processes have been shaping life, our own included, for billions of years.&lt;/p&gt;

From an island galaxy ruled by Newton's gravity and classical electromagnetism, we've come through &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1919_einste.php"&gt;the discovery of general relativity&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1929_hubble.php"&gt;expanding Universe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_the_1930s_a.php"&gt;need for dark matter&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1948_gamow.php"&gt;big bang&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1950s_the_t.php"&gt;synthesis of all the elements in the Universe&lt;/a&gt;, and, for good measure, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1969_and_th.php?utm_source=sbhomepage&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_content=channellink"&gt;we walked on the Moon&lt;/a&gt;.  By the 1970s, we had a fabulous picture of the History of the Universe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1979_and_in/history-of-the-universe.gif"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1979_and_in/history-of-the-universe.gif" width="510" height="class=" alt="history-of-the-universe.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's just one (huge) problem: &lt;b&gt;What caused the Big Bang?&lt;/b&gt;  We know the laws of gravity and quantum mechanics, and we know that the Universe is finite in age, expanding, cooling, and bathed in the afterglow of the Big Bang.  As far as we could tell, galaxies and clusters of galaxies looked exactly as they should, and the only cosmological problem left was the one of the dark matter holding clusters and galaxies together.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1979_and_be/ngc1399-FornaxGalaxyCluster.jpeg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1979_and_be/ngc1399-FornaxGalaxyCluster.jpeg" width="512" alt="ngc1399-FornaxGalaxyCluster.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a closer look revealed a number of problems.  First off, this "leftover glow" from the Big Bang was the same exact temperature everywhere.  &lt;b&gt;Why?&lt;/b&gt;  Why would this be the case?  After all, if you look in one direction, you find a temperature of 2.725 Kelvin, and it comes from a distance of around 46 billion light-years away.  But in the opposite direction, 46 billion light-years the other way, the temperature is &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; 2.725 Kelvin.  How could this be, if these two things never touched each other?  It takes time for temperatures to even out; this is why the people in the back seat of your car always complain about a lack of air conditioning in the summer!  Even today, we know that the temperature difference in any two parts of the sky is only a few hundred thousandths of a degree:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1979_and_be/dn11172-1_640.jpg" width="512" alt="dn11172-1_640.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that's the first problem.  &lt;b&gt;Why&lt;/b&gt; is the Universe the same temperature everywhere?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's not the only problem.  If you take a look outside, the Earth looks pretty flat to you, doesn't it.  We know it's a sphere, but the reason it &lt;i&gt;looks&lt;/i&gt; flat to us is because we can only see a tiny area of it.  What about the Universe?  Well, we can imagine three possible "shapes" for the Universe: flat, sphere-like, or saddle-like:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1979_and_be/End_of_universe.jpg" width="500" alt="End_of_universe.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we observe is not only that the Universe is flat, but it's &lt;b&gt;so&lt;/b&gt; flat that, back in the early stages of the big bang, it had to be flat to 1 part in 10^51!  This is so unlikely, it would be like throwing a dart at the entire Earth and hitting the correct &lt;i&gt;atom&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there were other problems as well, such as:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What provided the tiny, gravitational imperfections that allowed stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies to form?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why, if the Universe was so hot early on, are there no stable relics (like magnetic monopoles, for example) left over?  And finally,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did we wind up with a Universe that was hot, dense, and expanding in the first place?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;There were a number of very smart people working on these problems, many of whom made great contributions.  But it was a (then) young MIT physicist who figured it out:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1979_and_be/2008-10-AlanGuth-300.jpg" width="500" alt="2008-10-AlanGuth-300.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)"&gt;Cosmological Inflation&lt;/a&gt; was put forth by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Guth"&gt;Alan Guth&lt;/a&gt; in late 1979, and by time the paper was published in early 1980, practically every cosmologist on the planet was working on it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what Guth's inflation says.  Start with a completely random Universe.  Maybe some parts are expanding, maybe some parts are contracting, maybe some parts are hot, maybe some parts are cold.  But in one (perhaps miniscule) location, you get the right conditions for inflation.  What inflation does is it takes this one tiny region of space, and inflates it, like a high pressure hose inflating an infinitely stretchable balloon.  Regardless of what the Universe looked like before inflation, after only a tiny fraction of a second of inflation, the Universe will be stretched flat, will be empty, expanding exponentially fast, and will be &lt;i&gt;unstable&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1979_and_be/era1-inflation.jpg" width="500" alt="era1-inflation.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exponential expansion solves most of the above problems.  Things can be the same temperature everywhere because the tiny region where inflation started -- that gives rise to our Universe -- could easily have been uniform enough to give us the same temperature everywhere in the Universe.  The Universe is flat, because inflation stretched it so that it appears flat.  (Take a look at this balloon from the ant's perspective if you don't believe it.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1979_and_be/ant_flat.jpg" width="359" height="439" alt="ant_flat.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, the tiny little imperfections that give rise to stars, galaxies, and clusters can be created in a very clever way.  Empty space, according to the laws of quantum mechanics, isn't so empty.  Tiny little pairs of particles and antiparticles, waves and anti-waves, are popping in and out of existence all the time.  But in an exponentially expanding Universe, the space between them gets stretched so far that they can't find each other again to annihilate, and this creates slight differences in densities that persist to this day.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most remarkable thing about inflation is that it's unstable!  This exponentially expanding space is full of this mysterious energy, but since E=mc^2, we can &lt;i&gt;use this energy to make matter!&lt;/i&gt;  And that's precisely what happens.  This unstable energy converts into photons, quarks, electrons, neutrinos, and all the types of matter and antimatter that are physically possible.  At the end of Inflation, this gives us a Universe that is:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;roughly the same temperature everywhere,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;necessarily flat (or indiscernible from flat),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;devoid of any crazy stuff that may have existed before inflation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seeded with tiny differences in densities on all scales, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hot, dense, full of matter, and expanding!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
And that describes the Big Bang, as we need it to be, almost exactly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflation is a rich area, and Alan Guth wasn't the only one working on it, but he &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the first and only one to articulate how inflation solves all of these problems.  I've had the privilege to meet Alan Guth, and he's very congenial and humble, if just slightly socially awkward.  I've also had a chance to meet other important people who've worked on inflation, such as Andrei Linde, Alexei Starobinski, and Paul Steinhardt.  They're not humble, and make overt glory-grabs when it comes to taking the credit for inflation.  Make no mistake about it: &lt;b&gt;this is Guth's idea&lt;/b&gt; and Guth's alone.  Watson didn't invent the telephone, Hilbert didn't invent General Relativity, and for this idea, Guth will surely win a Nobel Prize.  It makes me feel dirty to realize that he's going to wind up sharing it with some of the more political (and less scientifically deserving) people above.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But from me, Alan Guth gets the accolade he deserves: the inventor of inflation, the most important scientist of his decade, and the glory of figuring out &lt;b&gt;what must have caused the Big Bang!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1979_and_be.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246919586041"><id gr:original-id="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/?p=786">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/20f571579f35ba43</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">The biochemistry of ethanol consumption</title><published>2009-07-06T22:32:42Z</published><updated>2009-07-06T22:32:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/07/06/ethanol/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, this is really about alcohol consumption in general, coupled with, I hope, a decent review of the underlying mechanisms of what happens psychologically and chemically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be covering the biochemistry in several aspects. The metabolism of ethanol is central to this. Some ethanol is produced by bacteria in the gut, so everyone has, at the very least, a low level of ethanol metabolism. Once ethanol is consumed, it then begins being oxidized by an alcohol dehydrogenase. This enzyme converts ethanol into acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is a much more directly toxic substance. Acetaldehyde is then converted to acetic acid which is then converted to acetyl-CoA. At each step of this, the substances have physiological effects on the body which I shall briefly discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethanol is an allosteric modulator of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Since GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is an inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor, which causes a decrease in neuron firing, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is essentially a depressant receptor. Continuous activation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; results in it being downregulated to allow for the nervous system to function properly. This is what partially causes alcohol tolerance and physical dependence. Complete withdrawal from alcohol after prolonged heavy use can result in uncontrolled synapse firing. (siezure, convulsion, etc.)Some medications can reduce this hypersensitivity of neurons. This is why severe alcoholics generally must undergo “detox” to treat these physiological effects of alcohol dependence prior to a therapy to prevent relapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acetaldehyde is one compound which contributes to hangovers and is partially responsible for the damage associated with alcohol consumption. It has been hypothesized that cirrhosis may partially be due to acetaldehyde. Additionally, prolonged use of alcohol results in fatty deposits in the liver, although the exact mechanism of this is unknown. Acetaldehyde also is a potent carcinogen and mutagen which is partially responsible for many of the cancer and disease risks associated with smoking, car exhaust, and alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the beneficial effects of ethanol consumption in low to moderate levels (less than two drinks per day), there is good evidence that this is the case. These include a decreased incidence of cardiovascular disease and some protection from some infectious diseases and diabetes. In higher levels, however, these benefits seem to be countered by greater than two drinks per day. The optimal point of mortality associated with alcohol is near the one drink per day mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the physiological effects of alcohol withdrawal, these are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_withdrawal_syndrome"&gt;slightly more complex&lt;/a&gt;. The most severe of the symptoms are anorexia, delirium tremens, diarrhea, hyperthermia, nausea, seizures, sweating, and tachycardia. All of these are due to the overexcited state of neurons. Typically given to suppress these effects are a range of GABA modulators such as benzodiazepines, Carbamazepine, and Flumazenil. These medications are typically given due to the ease which these can be metered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No word on the amount she is getting paid for it (rumors place her advance at &lt;a href="http://www.quillandquire.com/blog/index.php/2009/05/13/you-betcha-sarah-palin-to-pen-memoir/"&gt;~$7,000,000&lt;/a&gt;), but what we do know is that &lt;a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/08/sarah-palin200908?printable=true&amp;amp;currentPage=all"&gt;there will be two versions&lt;/a&gt; — the “regular” version and the “Christian” version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Soon Palin will take a crack at her own story: she has signed a book contract for an undisclosed but presumably substantial sum, and has chosen Lynn Vincent, a senior writer at the Christian-conservative &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt; magazine, as co-author of the memoir, which is to be published next year not only by HarperCollins but &lt;strong&gt;also in a special edition by Zondervan, the Bible-publishing house, that may include supplemental material on faith&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which version will sell more copies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What additions will be included in the special Bible-ier edition?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will she stop writing the book halfway through for unspecified reasons?  (That one, via &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bookslut.com/blog/archives/2009_07.php#014772"&gt;Michael Schaub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would guess the Christian version sells better.  And she’ll somehow find a way to compare her own journey with that of Jesus.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday me and the kids went on an unusual package tour. First we took the &lt;a href="http://www.mariefred.info/"&gt;1903 steam ship Mariefred&lt;/a&gt; from Stockholm to Mariefred, and got to visit the engine room while the machine was working. Mariefred is a small town on Lake Mälaren whose name preserves that of Pax Mariae, one of the last monasteries founded in Sweden before the Reformation. It is home to &lt;a href="http://www.oslj.nu/"&gt;one of Sweden's liveliest steam railroad societies&lt;/a&gt; which runs a narrow-gauge railroad with a plethora of lovely locomotives and wagons. We saw an amateur musical played at the old railway station, with the actors making entrances and exits by steam train! Afterwards my old buddy Jonas showed us the workshops and "hangars". Then we had dinner within sight of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gripsholm_Castle"&gt;Gripsholm Castle&lt;/a&gt; and went home, first by narrow-gauge steam train, then most of the way by one of Swedish Rail's new-fangled double-decker passenger trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/07/weekend_fun_4/P1010211lores.JPG" width="500" height="274" alt="P1010211lores.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday we went by boat in the opposite direction: out to friends on Nämdö in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_archipelago"&gt;Stockholm archipelago&lt;/a&gt;. We've spent two days walking the island's paths, enjoying the cultural landscape, the flora and fauna (snakes!), and checking out a lot of interesting archaeological sites.&lt;/p&gt;

The developer of two Utah private schools, one called the "School for Autistic Healing," is under scrutiny for the schools' finances, as well as their business and education licenses and whether or not they are being "'ethically' marketed." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the July 5th &lt;a href="http://www.sltrib.com/ci_12754436?"&gt;Salt Lake Tribune&lt;/a&gt;, real estate developer Bob Jones is bankrupt. He acquired a private school, Woodland Hills---which had served students with Asperger's syndrome and other cognitive and behavioral impairments since the 1990s---in 2007. After promising to "inject cash and build a comprehensive sports program," he changed the name of the school and "began recruiting athletes with scholarships, angering tuition-paying parents of special needs kids who said their children were bullied and neglected." Jones now appears to be "using the Woodland Hills name and non-profit status to raise money for his new schools, which opened last January -- at about the same time Jones filed personal bankruptcy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um, talk about "using" autism and disability for one's own ends?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.sltrib.com/ci_12754436?"&gt;Salt Lake Tribune&lt;/a&gt; describes what sounds like a kind of pyramid scene to get parents of autistic children to contribute money in the hopes of having a child's tuition provided:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Web site promoting the School for Austistic Healing claims affiliation with Woodland Hills and encourages people to make tax deductible donations. If parents with autistic children give $50 a month and find three other people to make the same commitment, they could qualify to have their child's $14,000 annual tuition "paid for by the fundraiser," the site advertises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 138 people---"banks, contractors, suppliers to the construction industry and parents of students and former employees of the now defunct &lt;a href="feed://www.etsy.com/rss_shop.php?user_id=5085436"&gt;Utah Southvalley Community School&lt;/a&gt; (USC), formerly known as Woodland Hills"---are claiming that Jones owes them "tens of millions of dollars."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents are desperate to get the education and services for a child that they need. It's pretty terrible to think that some might be giving precious dollars to what looks like a scam and certainly not to an actual school that can educate their child---and that there are people out there dreaming up such (potentially fraudulent) schemes to make a profit, and not to educate students who more than need it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246915708180"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/06/arizona-is-6000-years-old/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a9aaacfd23da640f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Religion"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Arizona is 6000 years old?</title><published>2009-07-06T21:27:04Z</published><updated>2009-07-06T21:27:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/06/arizona-is-6000-years-old/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.astroengine.com/?p=5875"&gt;Ian O’Neill at Astroengine&lt;/a&gt; posted &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtzJhTfQiMA"&gt;this stunning bit of video&lt;/a&gt; featuring Arizona State Senator Sylvia Allen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/PtzJhTfQiMA%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that she says the Earth is 6000 years old — twice, just to make sure — that floors me. It’s the casual way she said it, as if she said &amp;quot;I had a cup of coffee today.&amp;quot; From her manner, it’s clear that not only does she believe this complete and utter nonsense, but this is a simple fact woven into her mind just like &lt;em&gt;the Sun is bright&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;chocolate is tasty&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To her, the Earth being 6000 years old just &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to be fair, this video is without context, and so we can’t be absolutely sure she’s a creationist. But it sure as heck sounds that way, and &lt;a href="https://www.votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=28166"&gt;given her voting record&lt;/a&gt; it fits right in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony, of course — and there’s &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; irony when creationism is involved — is that she’s talking about uranium mining, and &lt;em&gt;it’s through the radioactive decay of uranium that we know the Earth is billions of years old&lt;/em&gt;. And she also praises technological achievements!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIIIIiiiiieeee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while you soak that up I leave you, of course, with this:&lt;/p&gt;

So it was earlier, when I saw an unreasonable article by an otherwise reasonable guy sneak into my newsfeed. If you want to see an example of a bad analogy, watch Dr. Kevin Pho have at it in a post entitled &lt;a href="http://www.getbetterhealth.com/weve-tried-single-payer-healthcare-and-it-has-failed/2009.07.06"&gt;We've Tried Single Payer Health Care, and It Has Failed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoth Kevin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Based on an agreement in 1787, the government is responsible to provide free health care to Native Indians on reservations. And, as you can see from t&lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/maine/articles/2009/06/15/promises_promises_indian_health_cares_victims/?page=full"&gt;his scathing story&lt;/a&gt; from the Associated Press, that promise has not been kept.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a horrible story about how badly underfunded and run the Indian Health Service (IHS) is, certainly a story worthy of comment. Unfortunately, Kevin uses the story as an excuse to indulge his dislike of anything resembling a single payer system by laying down one of the worst arguments I've ever seen anywhere (and I do mean anywhere):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;And, after Haiti, where in the Western hemisphere do men have the lowest life expectancy? It's on Indian reservations in South Dakota.

&lt;p&gt;The primary reason, not surprisingly, is lack of money, compounded by a difficult time recruiting physicians and other clinicians. Indeed, many Indian health clinics cannot "deal with such high rates of disease, and poor clinics do not have enough money to focus on preventive care."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you're in the camp that supports a Medicare-for-all-type solution to our health care woes, consider how that same government, whom you're entrusting to be the single-payer, has neglected the Indian Health Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem arises when it’s time to return the book and the lender says, “How did you like it?” The blunt truth would be to say, “I hated it – what a waste of time!” but I could never be so tacky. But neither could I lie and say, “Oh, it was great!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where’s the middle ground here? Is there a polite way to tell the truth without making a big deal of it and shoving my disbelief in their faces? Or should I resort to the old trick of saying “I’ll read yours if you’ll read mine?” Help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;
Skepticat&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Skepticat,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get the idea that you’d prefer that they stop offering you that stuff entirely. You’re right, lying with “Oh it was great! I loved it!” is bound to get you deeper into trouble, and the brutal truth, “Don’t waste my time with this crap!” will probably also cause you trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;truthful&lt;/em&gt; middle ground would probably be the best path. “Middle ground” of course doesn’t mean a half truth, it means being truthful with a mid-range of confrontational tone, so the effect is that they stop offering the books without stopping the friendship.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe a casual statement like, “Oh, thanks, but I’m just not into that,” or “Oh it’s ok, but I’m just not interested in that right now.” It’s truthful, expresses a disinterest, and most likely it will not the first time they’ve heard it.  A kind of shallow disinterest will probably turn them away gently where a strong rejection might stir up their sense of challenge or their resentment. Hopefully, eventually they’ll shrug their shoulders and look for someone else with whom to share their books, without starting The Shunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only consider your idea of the book exchange if you really want to start an on-going atheist-Christian dialogue with these friends. Some of them may be mature enough for that, but others may not handle it in a positive, respectful way.  In Mississippi you’re greatly outnumbered, and how many “discussions” with the immature ones are you willing to have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard&lt;/p&gt;

The world is going to descend into a bloodbath while someone known as the antichrist attempts to seize control of the planet. That is what some of your neighbors think—and some of your politicians.  Many of them even relish the thought. Is Revelation, the last book in the Bible, a set of prophecies or a set of hallucinations?  Neither, says Reverend Rich Lang of Trinity United Methodist in Ballard Washington.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the Book of Revelation isn’t a blueprint that tells us what is coming in the End Times, what the heck is it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Like  any book in the Bible, Revelation was written from the perspective of faith for the purpose of giving faith.  It was written in the early days of the Jesus movement to a persecuted minority that was fearing worse persecution. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the Jesus movement started in Jerusalem and Jesus was crucified, and there was this experience of resurrection, at the same time, there was a simultaneous political movement within Judaism of rebellion against the Roman Empire.  It peaked in the 60’s and 70’s.  It culminated finally—horrifically-- in the Roman legions marching into the country, destroying Jerusalem and burning down the temple. These two factors – the young Jesus movement and the brutally crushed rebellion–intersect in the writings we now call Revelation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But Revelation doesn’t talk about Jerusalem being destroyed.  It talks about a beast with many heads and a dragon and the four horsemen. . . &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;That poetic language which sounds so strange to us was actually familiar to ancient readers.  The author was writing a dramatic script in a form of popular media. Today we all recognize different modes or “genres” of writing—the detective novel, the love sonnet, manga. . Each has its own familiar structure and images.  The same was true in the past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book of Revelation belongs to a then popular genre of literature called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_literature"&gt;apocalyptic.&lt;/a&gt;  The term apocalypse means “unveiling.” There were lots of apocalypses, each a graphic poetic vision of some radically transformed future in which the good guys win.  This genre began around 200 BC and went out of style around 150 AD.  The book of Revelation is also called the Apocalypse of John, and it is one of several explicitly Christian apocalypses that still exist today. In each, metaphoric language was used to communicate something that, experientially, felt too big for words. It was a way of trying to speak the unspeakable—and to inspire endurance and hope. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what was the author of Revelation unveiling?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Revelation was written about twenty years after &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Jewish_Revolt"&gt;the fall of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;. The author, who we know only as John, had lived during the horrors that accompanied fall of the city. Imagine: the Roman Empire is surrounding Jerusalem. At the same time, civil war is raging within the walls. People are literally starving to death. As the siege continues, the Romans capture 20,000 Jews and crucify them on the walls of the city—while the city still is under siege.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20,000! We think of the crucifixion being unique. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;No. Crucifixions happened all the time. There were thousands and thousands of crucifixions. The Jews wanted freedom. To them it was a blasphemy to have the Romans in their land. Many of them rebelled, and they lost. Eventually, the city fell, and the people were slaughtered. Many remaining were expelled from the land. This is part of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora"&gt;Diaspora&lt;/a&gt;—the scattering of the Jews, who became dispersed around the Mediterranean—Asia Minor, Greece, Northern Africa and Europe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the author, John, is a Christian. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember, the earliest members of the Jesus movement were Jews, and so early Christians scattered with the rest of the Jewish people. Over time, thanks to this scattering and missionary activity, Christianity began to be adopted more widely by gentiles and at that point it began to grow rapidly throughout the Mediterranean. John is writing to Pauline (gentile) churches, but they are very rooted in Judaism and the Hebrew scriptures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the time Revelation is written, about twenty years after the devastating events of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Jewish_Revolt"&gt;The Great Revolt&lt;/a&gt;, the young scattered Christian movement is being persecuted. They are treated like Blacks in the South during the ‘30s and ‘40s. A Christian carpenter might not be able to get work. Some are lynched. John, himself, is writing from exile, so whatever he was preaching was viewed by the Roman Empire as a threat to law and order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why was the message so threatening?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Clearly, part of his message was “Stop participating in the imperial cult.  Stop participating in the patriotic way of life of the Roman Empire which requires paying homage to the gods of the Empire and in particular the emperor as an incarnation of God.”  The Early Christian movement was an alternative to the way of empire. You know, Jesus is called “Lord and Savior”.  If you ask where did that language came from, that language came from Caesar.  Caesar was “Lord and Savior.”  Christians celebrate the birthday of Jesus on December 25, which was when Roman celebrated the birthday of the Unconquered Sun.  The pagans believed that if they didn’t take care of the gods, the gods wouldn’t take care of them.  By forbidding the cult of the gods, the Christians threatened this balance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing confuses me.  Is John writing about events in his past or events in his future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;First of all, he is writing from a lived experience of what Empire can do.  That is the key to understanding his perspective.  He is writing a book that combines familiar political images.  The dragons, for example, are much like our political cartoons.  When you see an eagle and a bear you know it means the United States and the Soviet Union.  For him, he is using images largely out of Hebrew scripture to convey what the Roman Empire is, and what he believes will happen to the early Christian movement.  John’s primary message comes in Chapter 18:  Empire will fall.  Rome cannot last.  This power structure that seems so big and is so crushing of the people will crumble, and God will re-create out of the ruins a new Jerusalem. John continually counsels the movement to hold fast:  Those who endure to the end will be saved.  This is a book of hope: The empire is going to fall.  God is going to make a way where there is no way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But had he—lost it?  With all of the bizarre images, I’ve heard Revelation called  “John on Acid.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;No.  Almost all the imagery in the book of Revelation is rooted in the Hebrew scriptures, and some comes from Greek myths.  In Chapter 12, you have the woman clothed in the sun and Satan falls out of the sky and there is this dragon that chases the woman.  Well, that is the birth of Apollo.  Domitian, who is the emperor at that time, he likens himself to Apollo.  He is the sun god.  So John is taking this known story and writing a counter-myth.  He is saying that Domitian is not so important as he thinks. The birth of the child, Jesus, that’s the real big story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The images of Jesus himself are rooted in Hebrew stories.  They simply cannot be understood unless you know that they are coming from the book of Daniel and Ezekiel and Zachariah.  The narrative, the story line is rooted in the Exodus story in which God liberates the Jews from Pharaoh’s empire – walks them through the Red Sea and the wilderness and sends them to a promised land.  Revelation is a recapitulation, a re-telling of the same story.  God is the god who frees us from empire, whether Pharaoh or Dominion.   We will come out of this into a land flowing with milk and honey.  One of the big exhortations of the book is:  “Come out of her.”—Come out of Roman Empire (as the Jews came out of Egypt).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you are saying helps me to understand  why people who are immersed in this theology are so fearful of empire – the League of Nations, the Soviet Union, the United Nations—any form of internationalism. Among the “Left Behind” crowd, people who are bridge builders or peacemakers are seen as evil and to be mistrusted.  That is what John was talking about, that was his experience, even if people take it out of context.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the very beginnings, part of the Christian message was the notion of an end time.  God is going to clean up the world –which is a messy awful a place with a lot of violence and evil.  After all, the central hero of the Christian story is tortured and crucified-- put to death by an empire!  How is God going to clean up the world?  Jesus is going to come back and rule the world and shepherd the nations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Hebrew understanding of history is that it is going somewhere.  It is linear, not cyclical, which is a break with the agriculture-based earth religions.  Christianity, which is a child of Judaism, picks up the Hebrew storyline:  History is linear.  But –and this is really important-- in the Bible the end is never the end of the physical world.  It is the end of an age.  It’s the end, for example, of the Roman empire, and then what happens is not that everyone is whisked off to heaven but that on earth there is a renewal , a renewal of the earth itself, of culture, of the nations ,peace and justice, everyone has their own vineyard and fig tree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, where did the notion of everyone being lifted out of their clothes and cars and cockpits come from?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;That comes from the 19th Century.  An Anglo-Irish  theologian called John Darby created a new interpretive lens for the Bible.  It’s called Dispensationalism, because in this system, history is divided into seven “dispensations” or ages within an age. In this system, the Rapture leads to the Millennium when Jesus reigns on Earth for 1000 years but before the Millennium is the reign of the antichrist.  At different historical junctures different bad buys are picked as the antichrist.  In the 1970’s, thanks to Hal Lindsey’s book, The Late Great Planet Earth, it was all about Russia. And the ten nations, the European Union would become part of the Beast.  Today &lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/antichrist.asp"&gt;dire warnings&lt;/a&gt; about Barack Obama being the antichrist are scattered about the internet. Or Osama Bin Ladin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Believe me—I’ve seen plenty of both—even Chavez and Bono.   But come back, for a moment, to the Rapture itself.  What about that verse in Thessalonians  (1 Thess. 4:16).  There’s the Lord descending with a trumpet, and the dead in Christ rising and then “we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;That is wonderful graphical mythical language which, when written, had very little to do with the plot of &lt;em&gt;Left Behind&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thessalonians is Paul talking with an early church in southern Europe, and he faces a specific challenge: Christians have died.  We had expected Jesus to come back before that happened. Now what do we do?  Paul thought he was living at the end of an age.  He thought he would see the day that God would come back, clean up the earth and restore Paradise.  But it hasn’t happened within the timeframe he expected, so he offers an explanation that integrates the existing facts—instead of Christ returning before any Christians have died, the dead and the living are united with Jesus together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Flash forward a little bit.  When you study very early church history, if you study the art of the early church you don’t see a lot of images of the crucifix or scenes of the crucifixion; you see images of paradise.   And there was a proclamation of the early church that had an optimistic view – that where we were headed --on earth as in heaven, was a paradise.  This was the expectation of many in the early Jesus movement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a historical process, and over time this expectation changed for some.  This process, which I don’t have time to go into, was wrapped around when Constantine became emperor and absorbed Christianity as the state religion.  Rather than being a minority faith it became the dominant faith.. Once it became the dominant faith Christianity radically changed because it became about politics and power and control of the nations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have this book that is all about how evil empires can be because he has this horrifying experience and now all of a sudden Christianity is in power; empire is on the side of Christianity. That’s a little awkward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Yes.  And, the book of Revelation was dormant for many many years because of this. In our time the book of Revelation has come back with a vengeance because the imagery is made to order for wild interpretation.  You’ve got an entire generation of children being raised in these fundamentalist end-times churches, being told they are the last generation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You obviously think this is a bad thing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, thankfully these families don’t live as if what they say is true is really true.  They  are still stashing away money to send their kids to college and for their own retirement.  If they really believed you would see a hardening of the faith.  There is a far right segment of Christian in which you do see this hardening—churches focused on “spiritual warfare” building walls rather than bridges, organizing services to celebrate gun rights, praying public prayers for the death of abortion providers or Barack Obama or judges.  This kind of far right hardening comes out of the misuse of apocalyptic literature. Christianity gets translated into a quest for purity and righteousness that will bring these prophesies to fruition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You said earlier that there were lots of apocalypses.  It was a popular medium. How did this particular book get into the Bible?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, there was controversy about that.  Many Christians didn’t want it in the Bible, and even Martin Luther question the decision of the Catholic councils to include it.  Revelation got into the Bible because the church fathers chose to believe that the same John who knew Jesus in person was the author of this and several other texts.  Their primary criterion was “apostolic authority.”  What we now know – this is just the evolution of our own knowledge—is that the authors who wrote the Gospel of John, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Letters of John, and the Apocalypse of John, were not the same person.  The script is very different.  The same phrases are not used.  One is written by a highly educated Greek author, the other written by a person whose primary language is Semitic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These books that the counsels thought were written by John, the companion of Jesus, they were written by two or three people? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The people who actually knew Jesus, the twelve, none of them left writings for us.  All of these writings are written well after the death of Jesus.  The Church was looking for authority, and so they tried to choose writings that fit a hierarchical form of Christianity and that traced their lineage through the apostles back to Jesus.  The Bible is the book for the church and it was compiled by the Church for the purpose of helping the Church advance faith.  The books didn’t become finalized as scripture till 300 years after Jesus lived and died. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was taught as a child that the Bible was essentially dictated by God to the authors.  I was never taught about which books were chosen and how.  But I would assume that Catholics believe God gave perfect insight to the councils that made the decisions? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I would assume so.  And that is a wonderful mask for authority.  When religion becomes a pursuit of power—a system to keep people in control, you are always going to have those games that are being played.  Against religion, you have the message of Jesus, which is a spiritual message – a message of freedom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part of what this comes down to is:  What is the Bible?  When you are dealing with an end times fundamentalist Christian, you are dealing with a person who believes that the Bible was written by God– God writes it and there is a secret code and if you are in the know you will know the code and the elect will know the code.  The Bible itself becomes a magical book, a secret script.  If you just know how to read the script, you’ll know where the world is going. And so people begin to live this script as if they live in the end times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re so into that secret knowledge thing, aren’t we? You see it many places: Gnosticism, the Knights Templar, Freemasonry, the Mormon temple, childhood clubs, Skull and Bones . . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Yes, and I think you see it in all religions.   I think that part of the religious impulse easily gets perverted into a quest for secret knowledge because it makes me more than you.  I am special, I am elect, I am closer to God, I know the truth.  The reality is that we are all schmucks trying to muddle through as best we can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is adapted from an interview conducted by Valerie Tarico on Moral Politics Television, Seattle, June 12, 2009.

Blogging has been very hard for me lately.  I love writing, but due to work and family mishegos it's been hard to keep up with the posting.  I'm hoping a stint up in the woods providing medical supervision to 400 souls will be rejuvenating.  While I'm gone, I'll leave you with some of my favorite posts about the human side of medicine.  I hope you enjoy reading them again, or for the first time.  --PalMD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't tell you the number of people who complain to me about having their hope taken away.  Exactly what this means, though, isn't always clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes an oncologist will tell them (so they say) that they have a month to live.  Sometimes their cardiologist tells them (so they say) not to travel to their grandson's Bar Mitzvah.  Sometimes the spine surgeon tells them their back will always hurt, no matter what.  So they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients tell me a lot of things.  I'm not always sure what other doctors really told them, but what is important is what the patient &lt;em&gt;heard&lt;/em&gt;. The oncologist might have said "incurable" but followed it up by "but treatable for years."  I suspect after hearing "incurable", not much else gets in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I've finally learned after a number of years is that patients actually listen, even if you don't think they do.  What they hear is a different story.  Depending on their mood and circumstance, they may hang on single phrases, subtle inflection, the way your eyes dart.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be an effective physician, you must also be an actor of sorts; not in the sense of pretense, but in the way you pay attention to everything your words and body do, and how your audience reacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a patient a few years back, a very pleasant older woman, who came to me with difficulty in swallowing.  There can be a number of different reasons for this.  A radiographic study, however, showed a lesion in her esophagus that was almost certainly cancer.  Normally, I won't speak on the phone to people about such things, but she and I had decided for various reasons that this would be the best way to communicate.  I told her about the results:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/never_say_hopeless.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/never_say_hopeless.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/NBUiTfg2PM8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246911085960"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_case_of_pvt_joshua_fry">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c880cbad38c6bc66</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The Case of Pvt.

21-year-old Joshua Fry is a Marine.  He is on the autism spectrum, and his recruiter knew this when he recruited Fry from a group home in Irving, California.  After making it through 11 grueling weeks of boot camp, Fry was sent to Camp Pendleton for infantry training where "within weeks he was under arrest for desertion and possession of child pornography," today's &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-marine-autism6-2009jul06,0,7706948.story?page=1&amp;amp;track=rss"&gt;LA Times&lt;/a&gt; reports. He has been court-martialed and imprisoned for the past year; his next court-martial hearing is July 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he's not doing well, according to his grandmother, Mary Beth Fry of Newport Beach. When Fry was 18, she became his legal conservator meaning that "under the conservatorship, Fry is prohibited from signing contracts without his grandmother's approval." The recruiter ignored the fact that he needed Mary Beth Fry's legal approval to recruit Joshua Fry. According to court documents, Fry's life has not been easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 35-page motion filed by Fry's lawyer details a troubled childhood: parents who were drug addicts, an evaluation of autism at age 8, multiple stays in foster homes, behavior problems at Newport Harbor High School, an arrest for stealing iPods and a court-ordered stay at a facility for psychologically disturbed youth that lasted 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as the &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-marine-autism6-2009jul06,0,7706948.story?page=1&amp;amp;track=rss"&gt;LA Times&lt;/a&gt; notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism is not among the conditions that automatically bar a would-be recruit. But, if Navy doctors had known of the diagnosis, Fry would have been evaluated more skeptically during the pre-boot camp medical examination and most likely would have been rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, a psychiatrist for the Orange County mental health agency wrote that, although Fry "is high-functioning for a child with autism, he exhibits the typical characteristics of anxiety, impulsive behavior, distractibility, very poor social skills and an inability to read social cues and interact appropriately in social situations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it is wrong that Joshua Fry was, as he has been charged with, in possession of child pornography. But it's very, deeply, disturbing to know that military recruiters are so pressured to get enough recruits that they (knowingly) overlook legal and ethical principles. It's Joshua Fry who is getting the shortest end of the proverbial stick. As Mary Beth Fry notes, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's had a lot of problems being locked up,......He's on psychotropic drugs. He's been diagnosed as bipolar and is having trouble holding it together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He struggled with behavioral problems – including violence, stealing and self-abuse – throughout childhood"---his mother was addicted to heroin when he was born and his father to crack).

&lt;p&gt;This is the difference between the dittoheads who will follow the anointed head of the Republican Party into a big pile of dogshit if he so orders them and us.  They follow their sens less leaders, they stomp their feet and whinge and threaten, but it takes forever for even the most thoughtful Republicans to even begin to question their leaders.  But we in the Liberal Blogosphere do not do this.  We watch and we evaluate and we comment and we do not give anyone a pass just becasue we voted for them.&lt;/p&gt;

These were uniformly bad, mind you, bordering on unreadable. But it was good practice. It exercised my mind, I was always looking for ideas, and it helped me hone my writing skills. Well, maybe only a little, but I am technically a professional writer now, so it seems like maybe there’s something to be said about all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve toyed with writing fiction over the years. I’ve got some novel ideas I may one day wrestle to the ground… but really, I need to cut my teeth first on some simpler writing first. I’m not really planning on using this blog for that, but then an interesting thing came my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little while back, fellow professional writer Wil Wheaton &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/wilw/statuses/2108454355"&gt;posted a link on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to a story he liked on a website called Ficly. It’s a free website where you can write and post stories, but the catch is they can only be 1024 characters long. Including spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ficly.com/stories/935"&gt;The story he linked to&lt;/a&gt; was fun. And Ficly allows you to write prequels and sequels. When I read it I was having a rough day, and was having a really hard time nailing down some writing I needed to do for work (yes, I work). So I thought, what the heck, and &lt;a href="http://ficly.com/stories/1416"&gt;wrote a prequel&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not all that good, but it was fun to write. At first I felt guilty spending time on it when I had so much else to do, but what I found is that it shook loose some mental cobwebs, enabling me to finish the difficult writing job I had to do for work that day. Call it a palate cleanser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… but then I remembered an idea I had for a story back in high school. It was a pretty good idea, but I couldn’t make it work. Now I realize the problem: I was putting in too much exposition, too much explaining. Ficly doesn’t allow you to do that. Hmmmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ficly.com/stories/1456"&gt;So I wrote the story, and it’s on Ficly now&lt;/a&gt;. Titled &amp;quot;Deep&amp;quot;, those of you who have read my latest book may recognize some of the science in it. But there’s a twist…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that in the coming months there will be opportunities to write more. I may have to dig through my old high school stuff.

The F.A.A. refused, saying that the cost of an extra ticket could force parents to travel by car instead.</summary><author><name>By Freakonomics</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246909891914"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=14429">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/831c8c548f4f32ed</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="price theory"/><category term="wine"/><title type="html">Do Taste and Smell Adjectives Signal Value, or Do They Create It?</title><published>2009-07-06T18:45:28Z</published><updated>2009-07-06T18:45:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/V7Zih24d1L8/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/do-taste-and-smell-adjectives-signal-value-or-do-they-create-it/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Two papers at last month's meeting of the American Association of Wine Economists in Reims (this is my second of &lt;a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/are-empty-wine-bottles-on-ebay-being-used-for-counterfeiting/"&gt;two articles&lt;/a&gt; about the conference) investigated this question with respect to the wine industry, which is, if not a microcosm of all consumer-products industries, at least an increasingly apt caricature of them.

&lt;p&gt;I am exhausted from head to soul. There is not a part of my being that isn’t close to maxed out (and most of me is now paying crazy fees for being over the limit.) I am officially dubbing myself a skeptical lightweight. I could barely keep up mentally this weekend and this was just the TAM warm-up! I mean, sure, I can drink with the best of them… but thinking is hard work (especially when you spend several consecutive nights doing both until 4am.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, I’ve always been insecure about my smartiness. Most of the time, the thing that keeps me from totally hating myself for being stupid is something my dad once said to me. He told me that the smarter you are, the dumber you feel because the smarter you are, the more you realize how much you don’t know (and my dad is one of the smartest people I know.) I’m pretty sure that makes me WAY more brilliant than Einstein… especially after this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think that’s true? Do smarter people feel dumber because they know how much they don’t know?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As so often happens with such projects, it turned out to be fairly challenging and developed an offshoot, on innovative &lt;em&gt;ling&lt;/em&gt;- vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;My earliest finds are from Enigmatic Mermaid's site (pombostrans.blogspot.com) in 2002, starting with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(4/7/02) &lt;strong&gt;Gregory Rabassa Gets a Beating and Other Tidbits from the NY Times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The New York Times is ripe with stories of interest for the readers of this linguablog.&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="http://pombostrans.blogspot.com/2002_03_10_pombostrans_archive.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(and throughout that year, and thereafter, &lt;em&gt;Linguabloggers&lt;/em&gt; is listed as a label on the site). Here are a few more cites from Enigmatic Mermaid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(6/10/02&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Les Coupes de Langue de la Grand Rousse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0105068/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cybercarnet d'une appassionata de la langue de Moliere&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It's a linguablog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;em&gt;link&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(6/15/02&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quasi-Linguablog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.pohadka.com/research/archives.php"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pohadka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a linguablog of sorts, also covering Information Architecture, odds and ends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="http://pombostrans.blogspot.com/2002_06_01_archive.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(6/23/02) &lt;strong&gt;ForeignWord Linguablogs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="http://pombostrans.blogspot.com/2002_06_01_archive.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to Language Hat the next year, early on in his blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(2/31/03) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;When I began, my readership could be counted on the fingers of both hands—and the fact that the second hand was needed was due entirely to Pat's and Merm's brilliant mutual-backscratching invention, &lt;span&gt;Linguablogs&lt;/span&gt;. It rose steadily to an average of several dozen a day, then shot upward this month because of a combination of the excellent &lt;a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pepys' Diary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; site, to which I quickly became addicted, and the Jan. 28 MSNBC &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/809307.asp?0ql=cbp"&gt;&lt;span&gt;recommendation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;quot;One of the most exciting blogspotting finds I’ve made while judging Bloggies is the large and active community of linguabloggers…&amp;quot;).&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.languagehat.com/archives/000356.php"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hat used the vocabulary fairly often, as did other bloggers, for instance Melon Colonie in a posting about Language Log:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(11/9/03) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;AWE-INSPIRING LINGUABLOG&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.meloncolonie.com/blog/?p=527"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can  tell, the vocabulary doesn't appear on Language Log itself until 2005, when Mark Liberman produced an entertaining portmanteau:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(2/5/05) &lt;span&gt;Having a couple of minutes to spare, I thought I&amp;#39;d check out the latest that the linguablogosphere has to offer, … (&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001875.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, Mark &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001885.html"&gt;quoted&lt;/a&gt; this from Language Hat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(2/9/05) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's the "else" that baffles me, and I'd love to hear one of the &lt;span&gt;Language Log&lt;/span&gt; mavens or other linguabloggers try to account for how it got there.&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.languagehat.com/archives/001744.php"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's plenty more after that, from Mark and other Language Loggers (in particular, Ben Zimmer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there might well be occurrences in print before Enigmatic Mermaid in 2002, so I&amp;#39;m allowing comments. I welcome earlier sightings — but, please, these should be verifiable, not just recollections of what you said in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the analysis of the word &lt;em&gt;linguablog&lt;/em&gt;, which is clearly a combination of the elements &lt;em&gt;lingua&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;blog&lt;/em&gt;, the second a word of ordinary English, the first not. The question is: what sort of a combination is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clue to the answer comes from the wider world of naming blog types. One pattern that is always available in this world is the N + N compound: the second N is &lt;em&gt;blog&lt;/em&gt;, the first N names the domain covered by the blog. &lt;em&gt;Science blog&lt;/em&gt; is 'blog about science'; similarly, &lt;em&gt;physics blog&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;chemistry blog&lt;/em&gt;, and many others. The pattern is productive; things like &lt;em&gt;lexicostatistics blog&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;biochemistry blog&lt;/em&gt; are semantically transparent and unproblematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ordinary people also like brevity, so as an alternative to &lt;em&gt;astronomy blog&lt;/em&gt;, they're ready to jump to &lt;em&gt;astroblog&lt;/em&gt;, with the first element shortened to &lt;em&gt;astro&lt;/em&gt;, as in learnèd vocabulary like &lt;em&gt;astrophysics&lt;/em&gt; and in more demotic student uses in &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m majoring in astro&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;My astro professor is a bastard&amp;quot;. (Such usages then leak out into other contexts — as with an astronomer friend of mine who&amp;#39;s gone under the name Astroboy for some years, though he&amp;#39;s no longer realistically describable as a boy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes there are clipped versions of the domain names already available: &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;mathematics&lt;/em&gt;, giving &lt;em&gt;mathblog&lt;/em&gt;. This particular clipping is available in a great many contexts ("Do the math!"), but other clippings are more restricted: &lt;em&gt;chem&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;chemistry&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, which surfaces in student uses like "I'm majoring in chem" and "My chem professor is a bastard". Still, they are available for reference to blog domains: there are plenty of &lt;em&gt;chemblogs&lt;/em&gt; (as well as &lt;em&gt;chemistry blogs&lt;/em&gt;), plus &lt;em&gt;statblogs&lt;/em&gt; (as well as &lt;em&gt;statistics blogs&lt;/em&gt;). (There's more, of course; this is not an inventory of a universe, only a sampling of the phenomena in it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a large number of academic-domain names are composites, with a learnèd base that's a bound element in Englsh (most commonly ending in a linking &lt;em&gt;-o&lt;/em&gt;, derived from Ancient Greek — whether or not the base arises in Greek), plus a suffix (most commonly &lt;em&gt;-logy&lt;/em&gt;): &lt;em&gt;anthropology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;geology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sociology&lt;/em&gt; (with the initial base from Latin), &lt;em&gt;biology&lt;/em&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is a "short form" &lt;em&gt;astro&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;geo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;socio&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;bio&lt;/em&gt;, usable not only in learnèd composites (like &lt;em&gt;geophysics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sociolinguistics&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;biochemistry&lt;/em&gt;) and collegiate clippings ("I'm a geo/socio/bio major"), but also in compound-like composites with &lt;em&gt;blog&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;geoblog&lt;/em&gt; (both 'geology blog' and 'geography blog'), &lt;em&gt;socioblog&lt;/em&gt; ('sociology blog'), &lt;em&gt;bioblog&lt;/em&gt; ('biology blog'), and a ton of others. (The preferred pattern has alternating accent, so &lt;em&gt;anthroblog&lt;/em&gt; 'anthropology blog', rather than &lt;em&gt;anthropoblog&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly more complicated: &lt;em&gt;-o&lt;/em&gt; short forms for fields whose names end in &lt;em&gt;-ics&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;econoblog&lt;/em&gt; 'economics blog' (cf. &lt;em&gt;econometrics&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;em&gt;politicoblog&lt;/em&gt; 'politics blog' (cf. &lt;em&gt;politico-economic policy&lt;/em&gt;). And then there's &lt;em&gt;biblioblog&lt;/em&gt; 'biblical studies blog'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to languages/linguistics. On the basis of what I've just said, you'd expect a blog on these subjects to be a &lt;em&gt;linguoblog&lt;/em&gt;, but in fact there's a very small handful of hits for &lt;em&gt;linguo-blog&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;linguo blog&lt;/em&gt;. And a very small number for &lt;em&gt;linguiblog&lt;/em&gt; and its variants, plus some for &lt;em&gt;lingblog&lt;/em&gt; and its variants. But there are hundreds of hits for &lt;em&gt;linguablog&lt;/em&gt; and its variants; this is clearly the predominant usage, probably because the Latin noun &lt;em&gt;lingua&lt;/em&gt; has a sense 'language'.  (Perhaps it's also favored because it combines the &lt;em&gt;lingu-&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;linguistics&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;-ngua-&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OED&lt;/em&gt;2 has an entry for &lt;em&gt;linguo-&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;lingua-&lt;/em&gt; as combining forms of Latin &lt;em&gt;lingua&lt;/em&gt; 'tongue', which notes that the correct combining form would be &lt;em&gt;lingui-&lt;/em&gt;. All the cites involve reference to the anatomical organ rather than to language, but the dictionary also has entries for rare or obsolete items referring to language in some way, with various forms of the &lt;em&gt;lingu-&lt;/em&gt; element:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in &lt;em&gt;-a&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;linguacious&lt;/em&gt; 'talkative, loquacious', from 1651 on, but labeled "rare";&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in &lt;em&gt;-a&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;linguacity&lt;/em&gt; 'loquacity', cites from 1656 and 1721, labeled "obsolete";&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in &lt;em&gt;-i&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;linguipotence&lt;/em&gt;, a nonce word from Coleridge 1820, uncertainly glossed '?mastery of the tongue, or of languages';&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in &lt;em&gt;-o&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;linguosity&lt;/em&gt; 'talkativeness', one cite (1727), labeled "obsolete".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inventiveness with the element &lt;em&gt;ling-&lt;/em&gt; (in the sense 'language') continues. I spent some time last Thursday with friends, imagining possible &lt;em&gt;ling-&lt;/em&gt; innovations; almost all of our candidates turned out to be attested. Here's a small sampling of what I found. Some of them are, like &lt;em&gt;linguablog&lt;/em&gt;, compound-like; others look like portmanteaus; still others look like playful word formation, with recently minted suffixes like &lt;em&gt;-tastic&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;-icious&lt;/em&gt;; a number are hard to categorize. (Some are spelled as two separate words, some as hyphenated, some as solid; I'm giving only one version here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;linguabot / linguobot, LinguBot (automated question answering service), linguacide / linguicide 'language death' (whether by intentional annihilation or not), Lingua Mania (screensaver cum language instruction), Linguanaut (language instruction), linguaphile / linguiphile / linguophile, linguaphobe / linguiphobe / linguophobe, linguaphone (a musical instrument), LinguaScope (language teaching), Linguasphere Observatory (language research netwood)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lingualicious (blog on learning and teaching foreign languages), linguilicious (adjective of praise, with reference to writing), linguatastic / linguitastic (ditto), Lingtastic (translation service)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;among the suggested new names for JapanesePod101.com: Lingfinity, LingoLizard, Lingovation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'language' element appears as &lt;em&gt;ling-&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;lingu-&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;lingua-&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;lingui-&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;linguo-&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;lingua-&lt;/em&gt; seems to be the most frequent variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ling World, invention abounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Miriam Goldstein of the &lt;a href="http://theoystersgarter.com/" title=""&gt;Oyster's Garter&lt;/a&gt; blog to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a graduate student at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. I write the ocean science blog the &lt;a href="http://theoystersgarter.com/" title=""&gt;Oyster's Garter&lt;/a&gt; which has recently undergone a strange metamorphosis into a twice-weekly science column at the Slate spinoff &lt;a href="http://www.doublex.com/blog/oystersgarter" title=""&gt;Double X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in New Hampshire and majored in biology at Brown University. Before starting graduate school, I worked in environmental consulting, outdoor education, taxidermy sales, and condominium construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="MiriamGoldstein pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/MiriamGoldstein%20pic.jpg" width="336" height="411" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to somehow make a living as a science educator and communicator, like a Borscht Belt version of &lt;a href="http://www.drtatiana.com/" title=""&gt;Dr. Tatiana&lt;/a&gt; . The world is crying out for a Yiddish-spouting biological oceanographer with a love for naughty invertebrate hijinks, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My graduate research is in marine debris. I'll be leading an expedition to the North Pacific Gyre (sometimes called the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch") this summer. We're going to try to accurately measure the distribution of the tiny bits of plastic floating out in the middle of the ocean, and get a sense of how they might be affecting the animals at the base of the food chain. There will definitely be an expedition blog and Twitter, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the web is perfect for building community. While I started blogging to share my love of the spineless and slimy, I've found that a network of interested people can make your voice a lot louder. I'm interested in leveraging that for conservation. We've had some successes in the past, such as by debunking the iron fertilization company Planktos' ridiculous claims that they were saving the ocean by throwing iron in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the trick in online communication is reaching people who don't already agree with you. I'm trying to use my Double X column to reach people who don't necessarily care about the ocean or environmental issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm SIO's resident cheerleader for online outreach. I think online outreach is a powerful tool for getting a broad audience to remote places, like the middle of the ocean. It's also great for building community, which you need to do if you work in conservation. After Science Online '09 I gave a rousing presentation on the glory of blogging to my fellow students, though I'm not sure that I've convinced anyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to explicitly incorporate blogging into my own research. I'm very excited about the potential for really awesome blogging on our upcoming marine debris cruise. And I have a pipe dream of creating a multimedia thesis chapter, but my committee probably won't let me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have started running into the downside of blogging and social networking, which is that it takes time to do it well, and time can be pretty limited in graduate school. I had to put the main Oyster's Garter blog on hold for the summer because organizing this cruise is so time consuming. I also discovered that I don't have time to follow social networks much - it's just too much media to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started with an office job and a Metafilter addiction. I started by occasionally reading &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" title=""&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://bitchphd.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Bitch PhD&lt;/a&gt; . Then I got hooked on ocean blogging (pun fully intended) with &lt;a href="http://deepseanews.com/" title=""&gt;Deep Sea News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogfishx.blogspot.com" title=""&gt;Blogfish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://coralnotesfromthefield.blogspot.com" title=""&gt;Malaria, Bedbugs, SeaLice, and Sunsets&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to be part of that community, so I started my own blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came to the Conference explicitly to meet my ocean blogging buddies as well as the landlocked yet fabulous  &lt;a href="http://urban-science.blogspot.com" title=""&gt;DN Lee&lt;/a&gt;. At the Conference, I did discover some wonderful new bloggers, particularly Glendon Mellow of the &lt;a href="http://glendonmellow.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Flying Trilobite&lt;/a&gt;, Daniel Brown of &lt;a href="http://biochemicalsoul.com" title=""&gt;Biochemicalsoul&lt;/a&gt;, and Mike Bergin of &lt;a href="http://10000birds.com" title=""&gt;10,000 Birds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is it about life out on the ocean and singing, anyway?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States oceanographic fleet is alcohol-free, so while at sea we compensate by singing about grog instead of drinking it.  ARRRR!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly enjoyed learning about specific tools and techniques that incorporate online learning into the classroom. The "How the Facebook Generation Does It" session was absolutely fantastic. I have already given two presentations based on what I learned at Science Online, one to fellow scientists and one to teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to finally meet you and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the opportunity, and I really hope I can attend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To my mind, though, the really important parts of the book are Chapter 5 and Chapter 6, on political and media culture, respectively. They lay out in great and depressing detail just how the culture of science fails to match up with the ways that politics and the mass media work, and how it got to be this way. The problems really are huge, and if anything, they’re getting worse, not better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very good book, well argued and engagingly written. There’s a lot of good stuff here, and a lot of food for thought about the history and future of science in America. I suspect I’ll be boring you all with posts about different aspects of the book for most of this week. I recommend, though, that you pick up a copy and check it out for yourself. Even if you’ve read their blog, &lt;cite&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/cite&gt; presents the most complete and coherent version of their basic policy argument you’re likely to find, and it’s well worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi Isis,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As far as I can tell they finally corrected it- they halted all ads from that network. I haven't seen any bad ads last night or this morning andfriends I've been clicking around for awhile. Our ad VP suggested that if some readers are still seeing bad ads, they may need to clear their cache for them to stop showing up. Otherwise, all looks good!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- The Overlords&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there you go. We can resume our shenanigans, which is good because being away from my little muffins sucked hard and I have so many things to tell you. I tried to retreat to my &lt;a href="http://isisthescientist.blogspot.com/"&gt;Blogspot blog&lt;/a&gt;, but it just didn't feel right. For better or worse, this is my home now and &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey"&gt;it's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground"&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/clock"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/dispatches"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska"&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/neurotopia"&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/clock"&gt;are&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really easy to walk away from something when one finds their sensibilities offended, but it&amp;#39;s more difficult to stay and try to reach an understanding.  I am thankful that Seed took the concerns that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/"&gt;Zuska&lt;/a&gt;, our readers, and I expressed seriously.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of you made a very valid point in my comments section...that perhaps my hiatus was was not enough.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/naughty_ads_and_why_im_on_hiat.php#comment-1751537"&gt;You wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Will you be returning the money SB pays you for blogging with them? Some at least of that will have come from clicks on the ads you despise&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Fair enough, little muffin.  In my haste to put myself on hiatus, I did not consider the personal revenue I would receive directly from your clicks and indirectly from the display of those ads.  That makes me just as complicit as ScienceBlogs in the exploitation, doesn&amp;#39;t it?  At the end of the month, when I see my final blog clicks, I will donate 1/6 of my blog income (the duration of time the ads appeared on my blog) to the &lt;a href="http://www.ncadv.org/donate.php"&gt;National Coalition Against Domestic Violence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be back later in the day.  I&amp;#39;ve got a letter from &lt;a href="http://scientistmother.blogspot.com/"&gt;ScientistMother&lt;/a&gt; to answer, some shoes, tales of my life-threatening vacation adventures, some thoughts on the media, and all sorts of other things to talk with you about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plus, I'm not going to tell you who, but someone is having an anniversary...&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The withdrawal of philosophy into a “professional” shell of its own has had disastrous consequences. The younger generation of physicists, the Feynmans, the Schwingers, etc., may be very bright; they may be more intelligent than their predecessors, than Bohr, Einstein, Schrodinger, Boltzmann, Mach and so on. But they are uncivilized savages, they lack in philosophical depth — and this is the fault of the very same idea of professionalism which you are now defending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s probably true that the post-WWII generations of leading physicists were less broadly educated than their pre-war counterparts (although there are certainly counterexamples such as Murray Gell-Mann and Steven Weinberg).  The simplest explanation for this phenomenon would be that the center of gravity of scientific research switched from Europe to America after the war, and the value of a broad-based education (and philosophy in particular) has always been less in America.  Interestingly, Feyerabend seems to be blaming philosophers themselves — “the withdrawal of philosophy into a `professional’ shell” — rather than physicists or any wider geosocial trends.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But aside from whether modern physicists (and maybe scientists in other fields, I don’t know) pay less attention to philosophy these days, and aside from why that might be the case, there is still the question:  does it matter?  Would knowing more philosophy have made any of the post-WWII giants better physicists?  There are certainly historical counterexamples one could conjure up:  the acceptance of atomic theory in the German-speaking world in the late nineteenth century was held back considerably by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach"&gt;Ernst Mach&lt;/a&gt;’s philosophical arguments.  On the other hand, Einstein and Bohr and their contemporaries did manage to do some revolutionary things; relativity and quantum mechanics were more earth-shattering than anything that has come since in physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual explanation is that the revolutionary breakthroughs simply haven’t been there to be made — that Feynman and Schwinger and friends missed the glory days when quantum mechanics was being invented, so it was left to them to move the existing paradigm forward, not to come up with something revolutionary and new.  Maybe, had these folks been more conversant with their Hume and Kant and Wittgenstein, we would have quantum gravity figured out by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not.  Philosophical presuppositions certainly play an important role in how scientists work, and it’s possible that a slightly more sophisticated set of presuppositions could give the working physicist a helping hand here and there.  But based on thinking about the actual history, I don’t see how such sophistication could really have moved things forward.  (And please don’t say, “If only scientists were more philosophically sophisticated, they would see that my point of view has been right all along!”)  I tend to think that knowing something about philosophy — or for that matter literature or music or history — will make someone a more interesting person, but not necessarily a better physicist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might not be right, though.  Maybe, had they been more broad and less technical, some of the great physicists of the last few decades would have made dramatic breakthroughs in a field like quantum information or complexity theory, rather than pushing harder at the narrow concerns of particle physics or condensed matter.  Easy to speculate, hard to provide much compelling evidence either way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246899108281"><id gr:original-id="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/?p=1672">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1189276aa9234d1d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="1"/><title type="html">Arctic Research Stations Profiled</title><published>2009-07-06T16:05:33Z</published><updated>2009-07-06T16:05:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/2009/07/06/arctic-research-stations-profiled/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/" type="html">Canadian arctic research stations are old, run-down, but heavily used – and are thus thrilled at the prospect of improvements from the government’s $11-million Arctic Research Infrastructure Fund – according to a story by the Canadian Press.

It’s a con for people into comics, science fiction, gaming, fantasy, manga, movies, and probably twenty or thirty other categories I missed. It’s a cozy meeting; only about 150,000 close friends attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I was on a Discover Magazine-sponsored panel about science and science fiction, and it was so popular (standing room only in a room that held 1000 people!) that we’re doing it again. But this time it’ll be bigger and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I’m moderating it. That means I get to tell people when they can talk and when they have to shut up, which will be fun considering most of the panelists are awesome Hollywood types who make great shows, and can buy and sell me or have me killed on a whim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we have some new blood on the panel! Here’s the whole list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1958727/"&gt;Jaime Paglia&lt;/a&gt; — co-Executive Producer of Eureka&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Kevin_Grazier"&gt;Kevin Grazier&lt;/a&gt; — Battlestar Galactica and Vituality science advisor &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.janeespenson.com/"&gt;Jane Espenson&lt;/a&gt; —  major scifi writer/producer: Firefly, Dollhouse, Battlestar, and on and on&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_%28TV_Series%29"&gt;Rob Chiappetta and Glenn Whitman&lt;/a&gt; — writers for Fringe&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://neurotree.org/neurotree/peopleinfo.php?pid=8716"&gt;Ricardo Gil da Costa&lt;/a&gt; — neuroscientist and advisor for Fringe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coooool. Really though, of all of them, the only one I’ll feel comfortable telling to shut up is Kevin, but that’s just because a) we’ve been friends a long time, and 2) I want his job. I’ve been watching all these shows as I can to bone up on ‘em, and I have lots of questions to ask at the panel, most of which inevitably lead to, &amp;quot;Why haven’t you hired me to vet your scripts?&amp;quot; That should go over well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other bloggers have taken notice, include the &lt;a href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2009/06/comic-con-2009-science-as-double-edged.html"&gt;the Science and Entertainment Exchange&lt;/a&gt; and our very own DM blog &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/sciencenotfiction/2009/06/10/comic-con-2009-on-like-donkey-kong/"&gt;Science Not Fiction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between this panel and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/25/moderating-the-mythbusters-comic-con-panel-confirmed/"&gt;moderating the Mythbusters panel&lt;/a&gt;, Comic Con will rock the west coast.

Hood</title><published>2009-07-06T16:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-06T16:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/06/a-review-of-supersense-by-bruce-m-hood/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most atheists would probably claim they’re not superstitious in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re right when it comes to religion.  But consider these situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would you not want to live in a house in which someone once got murdered?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you needed a heart transplant, would you not willingly receive the organ from a once-convicted rapist?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever slept next to a teddy bear?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would you want to hold a pen that was once owned by Einstein?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you wear a certain article of clothing on every “big” date?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answered yes to any of those questions, then there’s some sort of supernatural thinking going on in your mind — something author &lt;strong&gt;Bruce M. Hood&lt;/strong&gt; calls a “&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061452645?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061452645"&gt;SuperSense&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061452645?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061452645"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/supersense-us-cover.jpg" alt="supersense-us-cover" title="supersense-us-cover" width="405" height="600"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does that sense exist in a world that prides itself on scientific progress?  In his new book, Hood explains and elaborates on the answer.  He is chair of the Cognitive Development Center in the Experimental Psychology Department at the University of Bristol, so he’s certainly had plenty of time and experience looking into this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the explanations for this SuperSense is the idea of a human need for cohesion and community.  Religion serves that purpose, via common rituals and places of worship, and that is one key reason why it persists.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it even possible to get rid of that SuperSense?  Not really, argues Hood.  It’s a by-product of our evolution and a better way to tackle it is to simply understand where it comes from and why it’s there.  In fact, it could help us achieve a stronger sense of unity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ramifications to this argument.  Indeed, if even atheists can be accused of supernatural thinking, perhaps a science-based rebuttal to religion is not the way to go…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic and interesting book for religious and non-religious readers.  It probes into our ways of thinking without necessarily offending either side, a tough feat to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any high-schooler can understand Hood’s arguments, and the &lt;em&gt;Freakonomics&lt;/em&gt;-ish chapter titles (e.g. “Blooming, Buzzing Babies” and “Would You Let Your Wife Sleep with Robert Redford?”) definitely make you want to read each page.  It manages to be both a quick read a thought-provoking book.  I definitely &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061452645?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061452645"&gt;enjoyed reading it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

However, while these are exciting news items, this preponderance of coverage given  to these state-of-the-art studies compared to assessments such as from the National Academies, can give a misleading impression about the state of a scientific knowledge. The more mature and solid a field, the less controversy there is, and thus the fewer news stories. Ironically, this means the public is told the least about the most solid aspects of science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One effect of this tendency is that quite often news stories are focused on claims that turn out to be wrong, or if not actually wrong, heavily reduced in importance by the time the dust settles. This is not deliberate, but merely how science works at the frontier. People push measurements to the limit of their accuracy (and sometimes beyond) and theories are used slightly out of their domain of applicability. In recognition of that, Richard Feynman had a useful rule of thumb that the last data point on any graph should be discounted because, if it had been easy to obtain, there would have been another one further along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are of course aware of this, and are usually very cautious about adopting new studies that appear unless they’ve been confirmed independently. The blogosphere and Marc Morano? not so much. There have been many times when seemingly dramatic new climate studies have been widely (and wildly) touted where RealClimate (amongst others) have suggested that more caution is warranted. That caution is usually based on what can be loosely describe as “Bayesian priors” – the accumulated wisdom that underpins most of the ‘balance of evidence’ arguments supporting how we understand the real world. Conclusions that aren’t built on single pieces of evidence, but are the most likely explanation to fit a whole set of observations, are generally pretty robust to revisions to single parts of the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the news last week was an attempted replication of the surprising finding in 2007 by &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp067660w"&gt;Pope et al.&lt;/a&gt; that a key reaction rate related to polar ozone depletion was very different to what had been supposed. In a guest posting here, &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/09/uncertainty-in-polar-ozone-depletion/"&gt;Drew Shindell&lt;/a&gt; cautioned that this was unlikely to stand since it would make good observations of related effects almost impossible to explain. And so it has proved. &lt;a href="http://rabett.blogspot.com/2009/07/science-lurches-forward-about-two-years.html"&gt;New methods&lt;/a&gt; to pin down this reaction rate have placed it &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/324/5928/781"&gt;very close&lt;/a&gt; to where people thought it was before the 2007 paper. This is not of course the final word (despite the &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090507/full/news.2009.456.html"&gt;Nature News headline&lt;/a&gt;), but it does illustrate how science deals with the inevitable anomalies that always crop up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of this was a paper back in 2005 that described a possibly dramatic &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/decrease-in-atlantic-circulation/"&gt;slowing down of the North Atlantic circulation&lt;/a&gt; over the last 30 years. Our prior knowledge about the likely impacts of such a thing (cooling in the North Atlantic for instance) which hadn’t been seen, made us cautious about the interpretation of such a result. And a couple of years later, that caution was vindicated by much higher frequency sampling of the data which revealed a &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/08/who-ya-gonna-call/"&gt;great deal more variability&lt;/a&gt; than had been expected, implying that the signal in the earlier paper was more likely to have been an artifact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in 2006 we reported being baffled by a story on &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/01/scientists-baffled/"&gt;plants producing methane&lt;/a&gt;, which lead to an unfortunate rash of erroneous ‘&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnXToHGldxo"&gt;Trees cause global warming&lt;/a&gt;‘ stories (which weren’t justified even if you fully accepted the paper’s results). A few years and many attempted replications later, the potential for &lt;a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1660/1347.abstract"&gt;methane fluxes from living plants&lt;/a&gt; has been dialed down almost to zero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just a few examples, but all of them illustrate the importance of context in interpreting new results. Not every surprising new finding will be wrong, but seeing what other scientists say about it is a good indication of how likely it is to stand. The key importance of this back and forth though is, as Marcus Rex points out in the Nature News piece on the ozone chemistry story: “Even though [the] results now seem to be wrong, his study did prompt other groups to think about alternative approaches”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is a big part of what scientific research is about.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>gavin</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246896794815"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/07/risk-management-for-autism-families.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1aa3fb697405eb87</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="autism"/><title type="html">Risk Management for Autism Families</title><published>2009-07-06T14:54:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-06T14:54:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/07/risk-management-for-autism-families.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">Tanya Savko writes the &lt;a href="http://teenautism.com"&gt;Teen Autism&lt;/a&gt; blog and has a two-part story on a &lt;a href="http://www.autismriskmanagement.com/autism_presentations.cfm"&gt;Dennis Debbaubt semina&lt;/a&gt;r.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="http://teenautism.com/2009/06/21/autism-safety-risk-management-part-2/"&gt;managing risk for our children is part of our daily safety routine&lt;/a&gt;. We don’t have incidents occurring every day, but we still need to have those risk management efforts in place. And in many cases, there is more that we can be doing, even in our own home.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="http://teenautism.com/2009/06/23/autism-safety-risk-management-part-3/"&gt;ASD people, throughout their lifetimes, &lt;/a&gt;have up to seven times more contact with law enforcement than the general population. Add to that figure the fact that there is a deficit of training for interactions with ASD people, and we have a gap that needs to be filled. Dennis Debbaubt’s &lt;a href="http://www.autismriskmanagement.com/autism_presentations.cfm"&gt;training seminars&lt;/a&gt; help to fill that gap, but what’s equally important is parents’ willingness to disclose information about their child. We all value our privacy - and need it to protect our children. But if you want to upgrade safety, Dennis points out, you have to give up a little privacy.

[Insert big, fat frowny face.] But there’s good news! We are not alone, and I hope to prove that on &lt;em&gt;Saturday, July 11&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;TAM 7&lt;/a&gt; will be reaching its climax Saturday evening, with parties galore… So why don’t those of us who are stuck in the TriState area get together for drinks and banter? There are so many skeptics in the area that I have yet to meet, so this is as good a time as any!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking &lt;a href="http://philadelphia.bardiver.com/bar/sugar-moms/"&gt;Sugar Mom’s&lt;/a&gt; in Old City. Drinking Skeptically with &lt;a href="http://skepticphilly.com/"&gt;Skeptic Philly&lt;/a&gt; meets at &lt;a href="http://philadelphia.citysearch.com/profile/8990890/philadelphia_pa/tattooed_mom_restaurant.html"&gt;Tattooed Mom’s&lt;/a&gt; on South Street, so I don’t want to step on anyone’s toes. To avoid confusion, we’re planning on &lt;em&gt;Sugar Mom’s&lt;/em&gt;. Now I know some of you will be in atTAMdence, so I’d like for as many of us as possible to get out for an evening. Just think of all the fun they’ll be having in Las Vegas without us! We can have fun, too!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to be a drinker. I’ll be sitting there with a Shirley Temple [They&amp;#39;re good - don&amp;#39;t hate.]. Just come and hang out for a while with really cool people. They’ve got arcade games, a pool table and lots of really cool stuff to look at, and if you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need extra motivation, I’ll see if I can save the bumber&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/1875626-Yeah-we-know-if-you-drink-drive-your-a-bloody-idiot-0.jpg" alt="1875626-Yeah-we-know--if-you-drink--drive-your-a-bloody-idiot-0" width="225" height="300"&gt; car seat for you. I said it – &lt;strong&gt;bumper. car. seat&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I get an idea of how many of us there will be, I’ll figure out the rest of the deets (time, etc) and update. We’ll probably want to get there not-too-late, as it’s Old City and it gets crazy on the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

One major shortcoming of the more commonly used evidence-based medicine paradigm (EBM) that has been in ascendance as the preferred method of evaluating clinical evidence. Specifically, as Dr. Kimball Atwood IV (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=48"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=49"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=55"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=11"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=21"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=25"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=35"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=42"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;) has pointed out extensively before, EBM values clinical studies above all other forms of evidence. On the surface, this sounds quite reasonable (after all, what we as physicians really want to know is whether a treatment works better than a placebo or not). Unfortunately, it ignores one very important problem with clinical trials, namely that prior scientific probability really does matter. Indeed, four years ago, John Ioannidis made a bit of a splash with a paper published in JAMA entitled &lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/294/2/218"&gt;Contradicted and Initially Stronger Effects in Highly Cited Clinical Research&lt;/a&gt; and, more provocatively in PLoS Medicine, &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=16060722"&gt;Why Most Published Research Findings Are Wrong&lt;/a&gt;. In his study, he examined a panel of highly cited clinical trials and determined that the results of many of them were not replicated and validated in subsequent studies. His conclusion was that a significant proportion, perhaps most, of the results of clinical trials turn out not to be true after further replication and that the likelihood of such incorrect results increases with increasing improbability of the hypothesis being tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, CAM advocates &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/09/the_cranks_pile_on_john_ioannidis_work_o.php"&gt;piled onto these studies&lt;/a&gt; as "evidence" that clinical research is hopelessly flawed and biased, but that is not the correct interpretation. Basically, as &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php?p=8"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/09/why_most_publis.html"&gt;Alex Tabarrok&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/09/the_cranks_pile_on_john_ioannidis_work_o.php"&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, prior probability is critical. What Ioannidis' research shows is that clinical trials examining highly improbable hypotheses are far more likely to produce false positive results than clinical trials examining hypotheses with a stronger basis in science. Of course, estimating prior probability can be tricky based on science. After all, if we could tell beforehand which modalities would work and which didn't we wouldn't need to do clinical trials, but there are modalities for which we can estimate the prior probability as being very close to zero. Not surprisingly (at least to readers of this blog), these modalities tend to be "alternative medicine" modalities. Indeed, the purest test of this phenomenon is homeopathy, which is nothing more than pure placebo, mainly because it is water. Of course, another principle that applies to clinical trials is that smaller, more preliminary studies often yield seemingly positive results that fail to hold up with repetition in larger, more rigorously designed randomized, double-blind clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, a paper was published in &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org"&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; Thomas by Thomas Pfeiffer at Harvard University and Robert Hoffmann at MIT that brings up another factor that may affect the reliability of research. Oddly enough, it is somewhat counterintuitive. Specifically, Pfeiffer and Hoffmann's study was entitled &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005996"&gt;Large-Scale Assessment of the Effect of Popularity on the Reliability of Research&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, the hypothesis being tested is whether the reliability of findings published in the scientific literature decreases with the popularity of a research field. Although this phenomenon is hypothesized based on theoretical reasoning, Pfeiffer and Hoffmann claim to present the first empirical evidence to support this hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/popularity_versus_reliability_in_medical.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/popularity_versus_reliability_in_medical.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/q2TFDkvG-Dc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246888672435"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/06/lessons-from-dawkins-vs-degrasse-tyson/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bc6586fe746050e2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Media and Science"/><category term="Science and Religion"/><category term="Unscientific America"/><title type="html">Lessons from Dawkins vs. deGrasse Tyson</title><published>2009-07-06T13:02:10Z</published><updated>2009-07-06T13:02:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/06/lessons-from-dawkins-vs-degrasse-tyson/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over at Coyne’s blog, a commenter named Peter Beattie &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/02/almost-done-are-science-and-faith-compatible/#comment-4721"&gt;advances&lt;/a&gt; a point that is so incredibly important, I want to draw more attention to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jerry&lt;/strong&gt;, this may be a tangential point, but do you think that perhaps we have been remiss in taking the state of mind of religious believers seriously? I’m thinking of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s point at &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_2xGIwQfik" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beyond Belief ‘06&lt;/a&gt;, directed at Richard Dawkins, about a sensitivity towards the state of mind of the audience that is needed, together with facts, to create impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think there is a legitimate field there for us to plough that might at least take the edge off the confrontational character of exposure to the facts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tangential&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Mr. Beattie, your point is anything but tangential. Indeed, it is fundamental to the cause of trying to create a more science-friendly society than the one we now live in.&lt;/p&gt;

We've followed the semantic travels of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=%22passive+voice%22"&gt;"passive voice"&lt;/a&gt; through meanings like "vague about agency", "stylistically listless", and "failure to take sides". I recently &lt;a href="http://www.mediaforfreedom.com/ReadArticle.asp?ArticleID=16032"&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; that writers should "Use an active voice (putting things in present/future) instead of a passive voice (putting things in the past)".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terminology of the "autism spectrum" seems to have started a similar journey through successive steps of family resemblance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For example, Jason Calacanis ("&lt;a href="http://calacanis.com/2009/01/29/we-live-in-public-and-the-end-of-empathy/"&gt;We Live in Public (and the end of empathy)&lt;/a&gt;", 1/28/2009), used the term "Internet Asperger's Syndrome" to  describe the reaction to a late-90s "art project" in which his friend Josh Harris "put a couple dozen cameras all over his loft and recorded the inevitable breakdown of his life with the love of his life", and set up internet chat rooms for public discussion of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commenters in the chat rooms were so &amp;quot;vicious&amp;quot;, according to Calacanis, that &amp;quot;it took Josh five years to recover&amp;quot;: something about the experiment &amp;quot;robbed the subjects — and their audience — of every last ounce of empathy&amp;quot;. This leads Calacanis to propose what he calls &amp;quot;Harris&amp;#39; Law&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;At some point, all humanity in an online community is lost, and the goal becomes to inflict as much psychological suffering as possible on another person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he says that he's come to "recognize a new disorder, the underlying cause of Harris' Law", &lt;em&gt;Internet Asperger's Syndrome&lt;/em&gt;, which "affects people when their communication moves to digital", causing them to "[stop] seeing the humanity in other people", and to behave in other ways that (in his view) parallel the symptoms of Asperger's Syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;Internet Asperger's Syndrome&lt;/em&gt; was recently picked up by Jonathan Kimak in a humorous piece for Cracked  ("&lt;a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_17522_p2.html"&gt;6 New Personality Disorders Caused by the Internet&lt;/a&gt;", 6/30/2009). Kimak writes (inaccurately) that Asperger's Syndrome is a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;… rarely diagnosed but often claimed disorder is a mild form of Autism that comes with what seems to be a biological inability to show empathy for other human beings, as well as (and maybe stemming from) an inability to recognize nonverbal cues. They continually do weird, upsetting things because they don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s upsetting you. That part of their brain is broken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;People cringe when they hear this term because they know that a large number of the teenagers claiming Asperger's are, in fact, merely dicks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He agrees with Calacanis's diagnosis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Calacanis figured out that people who do all of their communicating online wind up mimicking Asperger's behaviors because they are imposing the same disadvantages on themselves. In both cases, when the ability to see nonverbal responses and facial expressions goes away, so does empathy. Soon the thing you're communicating with isn't a person, they're just a bunch of words on a screen. A bunch of words that the &lt;em&gt;little bastard didn't even bother to spellcheck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus Kimak ends up connecting Asperger&amp;#39;s Syndrome with various forms of internet-mediated mob cruelty — his characteristic examples are things like &amp;quot;A kid commits suicide on webcam while the trolls cheer him on … Normal kids, … but get them in a chat room and suddenly it reads like the transcript to a Charles Manson parole hearing&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it takes a certain lack of empathy to see &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Manson"&gt;Charles Manson&lt;/a&gt;'s sociopathic crimes as having any similarity at all with the social awkwardness and focused, "systematizing" interests of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger%27s_syndrome"&gt;Asperger's&lt;/a&gt; people. And spontaneous adolescent mob cruelty, internet-mediated or not, strikes me as having little to do with either one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, Calacanis and Kimak make the the connection between chat-room meanness and Asperger&amp;#39;s because of the idea that the lack of non-verbal cues leads to the depersonalization of victims. But the kind of mobbing gossip that they describe — as familiar from school cafeterias as from web forums — is way outside the spectrum of Asperger&amp;#39;s behaviors, from everything I&amp;#39;ve seen and read. And charismatic sociopaths like Manson are especially skilled in exactly the sorts of communicative manipulation that Aspies have problems with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current DSM-IV-TR description of Asperger's Disorder (299.80) is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#339966"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a name="14326"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#339966"&gt;&lt;span&gt;marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#339966"&gt;&lt;span&gt;failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#339966"&gt;&lt;span&gt;a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest to other people)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#339966"&gt;&lt;span&gt;lack of social or emotional reciprocity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#339966"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a name="14327"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#339966"&gt;&lt;span&gt;encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#339966"&gt;&lt;span&gt;apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#339966"&gt;&lt;span&gt;stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#339966"&gt;&lt;span&gt;persistent preoccupation with parts of objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#339966"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The disturbance causes clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Calacanis and Kimak have taken two points of association — the lack of non-verbal cues characteristic of text-mediated interactions, and the &amp;quot;lack of social or emotional reciprocity&amp;quot; that is a possible diagnostic indicator for Asperger&amp;#39;s Syndrome — and made a terminological jump to a completely different sort of phenomenon, namely socially-reinforced mob cruelty in chat rooms and similar web forums. (With a nod to yet another phenomenon, namely Charles-Manson-like sociopathic charisma.)  This is quite like the chain of associations at work in various folk interpretations of &amp;quot;passive voice&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different chain of autism-associations emerges in Gary Stix, "&lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-science-of-economic-bubbles&amp;amp;print=true"&gt;The Science of Economic Bubbles and Busts&lt;/a&gt;", Scientific American, 6/22/2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before getting to the autism part, let me take advantage of the digression-tolerant blog format to point out a lovely example of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1378"&gt;Explanatory Neurophilia&lt;/a&gt; from the same article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Behavioral economists have identified a number of biases, some with direct relevance to bubble economics. . In confirmation bias, people overweight information that confirms their viewpoint. Witness the massive run-up in housing prices as people assumed that rising home prices would be a sure bet. The herding behavior that resulted caused massive numbers of people to share this belief. Availability bias, which can prompt decisions based on the most recent information, is one reason that some newspaper editors shunned using the word “crash” in the fall of 2008 in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid a flat panic. Hindsight bias, the feeling that something was known all along, can be witnessed postcrash: investors, homeowners and economists acknowledged that the signs of a bubble were obvious, despite having actively contributed to the rise in home prices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Neuroeconomics, a close relation of behavioral economics, trains a functional magnetic resonance imaging device or another form of brain imaging on the question of whether these idiosyncratic biases are figments of an academician’s imagination or actually operate in the human mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about that for a minute. Decades of careful experimentation have demonstrated the existence of these biases, and explored their nature in elaborate quantitative detail, resulting in thousands of publications and a &lt;a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2002/public.html"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt;. But all this might just be a figment of some academician&amp;#39;s imagination — until we see the fMRI pictures to be found in Bernd Weber et al., &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/13/5025.abstract"&gt;The medial prefrontal cortex exhibits money illusion&lt;/a&gt;", PNAS 106(13): 5025-5028, 2009, which show that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;… areas of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which have been previously associated with the processing of anticipatory and experienced rewards, and the valuation of goods, exhibited money illusion. We also found that the amount of money illusion exhibited by the vmPFC was correlated with the amount of money illusion exhibited in the evaluation of economic transactions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_illusion"&gt;money illusion&lt;/a&gt;" is the tendency of people to evaluate sums of money in terms of their nominal or face value instead of in terms of their purchasing power.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could digress further, to explain why the fMRI evidence is actually weaker, so far, than the evidence from experiments using behavioral dependent variables other than blood oxygenation level in various brain regions — and likely to remain that way for some time — but that&amp;#39;s a topic for another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, on to what Mr. Stix has to say about the relationship of autism to financial bubbles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;One group that does not value perceived losses differently than gains are individuals with autism, a disorder characterized by problems with social interaction. When tested, autistics often demonstrate strict logic when balancing gains and losses, but this seeming rationality may itself denote abnormal behavior. “Adhering to logical, rational principles of ideal economic choice may be biologically unnatural,” says Colin F. Camerer, a professor of behavioral economics at Caltech.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggestion here is that the rational-choice dynamics of neo-classical economics is somehow "autistic".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea may be connected to the rebellion in 2000 of a group of French economics students, who wrote an open letter to their professors and administrators to complain about the domination of the neoclassical model in their curriculum, explaining that "Nous ne voulons plus faire semblant d’étudier cette science autiste qu’on essaie de nous imposer" ("We no longer want to pretend to study this autistic science that is being forced on us").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They named their website &lt;a href="http://autisme-economie.org"&gt;autisme-economie.org&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="http://www.autisme-economie.org/article30.html"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; on their website explains their choice of terminology as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Nous avons utilisé ce terme d’ « autisme » parce qu’il nous semblait bien résumer ce que nous ressentions, notamment la fermeture totale de la discipline au monde extérieur. Or cette fermeture à l’extérieur est communément associée à l’autisme, même si, comme beaucoup d’autres personnes, nous connaissons très mal cette maladie. Selon le Petit Robert, l’autisme désigne une « attitude de détachement de la réalité extérieure accompagnée d’une vie intérieure intense ». Pour le Larousse, c’est une « perturbation affective caractérisée par un repliement du sujet sur lui-même avec perte plus ou moins importante des contacts avec le monde extérieur ». Ce seul mot parvient donc, selon nous, à caractériser le comportement du courant dominant (académiquement) en économie. Celui-ci se caractérise en effet par sa coupure au monde extérieur, d’ailleurs couplée à une « vie intérieure intense », c’est-à-dire la production à jets continus de petits modèles tous plus débiles les uns que les autres.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;We have used the term "autism" because it seem to us to summarize what we were objecting to, namely the complete closure of the discipline to the outside world. Now, this closure to the outside is commonly associated with autism, although we, like many others, know very little about this illness. According to the Petit Robert dictionary, autism refers to an "attitude of detachment from exterior reality accompanied by an intense inner life". For the Larousse, it's an "affective disorder characterized by withdrawal of the subject into himself, along with a significant loss of contact with the outside world". This single word then, we feel, manages to describe the behavior of the dominant (academic) trend in economics. This is characterized in fact by its cutting of connections to the outside world, at the same time coupled with an "intense inner life", that is, the production of a continuous stream of little models, each more retarded than the last.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An American relative of this movement is called "Post-Autistic Economics", with a &lt;a href="http://www.paecon.net/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and a journal called the "&lt;a href="http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/index.htm"&gt;real world economics review (Formerly the post-autistics economics review)&lt;/a&gt;". (See Edward Fullbrook "&lt;a href="http://www.altruists.org/static/files/The%20Post-Autistic%20Economics%20Movement%20%28Edward%20Fullbrook%29.pdf"&gt;The Post-Autistic Economics Movement: A Brief History&lt;/a&gt;".) In the French rebellion and its American echo, the idea seems to be that neoclassical economics is "autistic" because it is isolated from society and "[preoccupied] with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus". This is arguably insulting both to neoclassical economics and to autism, but it's plausible as a metaphorical application of the DSM-IV type of definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colin Camerer&amp;#39;s ideas about the relations between autism and rational-choice theory, in contrast, seem to include the idea that they both apply logic inappropriately in attempting to predict human behavior. (For a hilarious account of game theory mis-applied to normal human interactions — without any mention of the autism spectrum — see Dan Zettwoch&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.danzettwoch.com/comics/deadlock.html"&gt;Deadlock&lt;/a&gt;.) This perspective is  expressed at somewhat greater length in Camerer et al., "&lt;a href="http://www.psycho.unibas.ch/fakultaet/angewandt/articles/Camerer_2005.pdf"&gt;Neuroeconomics: How Neuroscience Can Inform Economics&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Journal of Economic Literature&lt;/em&gt; XLII: 9-64, 2005. Here's how the authors discusses irrationality in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_Game"&gt;Ultimatum Game&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;When players do follow the dictates of game theory, the result can be a low payoff and confusion. Consider this quote from an upset subject, an Israeli college student, whose low offer in a $10.00 ultimatum game was rejected (from Shmuel Zamir 2000):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I did not earn any money because all the other players are stupid! How can you reject a positive amount of money and prefer to get zero? They just did not understand the game! You should have stopped the experiment and explained it to them . . .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Ironically, while the subject’s reasoning matches exactly how conventional game theory approaches the game, it also sounds autistic, because this subject is surprised and perplexed by how normal people behave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camerer et al. discuss "Elizabeth Hill and David Sally’s (2003) extensive comparison of normal and autistic children and adults playing ultimatum games". But the Hill and Sally experiments don't support a view that the "rationality" of conventional game theory is "autistic", either in the Ultimatum Game or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The citation by Camerer et al. is to a 2003 UCL working paper, Elisabeth Hill and David Sally, "&lt;a href="http://www.som.yale.edu/faculty/keith.chen/negot.%20papers/Autism%20and%20Bargaining03.pdf"&gt;Dilemmas and bargains: Autism, theory-of-mind, cooperation and fairness&lt;/a&gt;". The research was continued, and the final published version was David Sally and Elisabeth Hill, "&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joep.2005.06.015"&gt;The development of interpersonal strategy: Autism, theory-of-mind, cooperation and fairness&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Journal of Economic Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, 27(1) 73-97, 2006):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Mentalising is assumed to be involved in decision-making that is necessary to social interaction. We investigated the relationship between mentalising and three types of strategic games – Prisoners’ Dilemma, Dictator and Ultimatum – in children with and without autistic spectrum disorders. &lt;strong&gt;Overall, the results revealed less dramatic differences than expected among the normally developing age groups and the children with autism&lt;/strong&gt;, suggesting that in these laboratory tasks, mentalising skills are not always necessary. There were, nonetheless, some important findings. Young children were more cautious about initiating cooperation than their older peers and, in bargaining situations, they were less generous in their opening unilateral grants and over-solicitous of an empowered receiver. Participants with autism did have a harder time shifting strategy between versions of the Prisoners’ Dilemma, and they were much more likely to accept low initial offers in the Ultimatum game and to refuse fair proposals. In addition, participants’ measured mentalising abilities explain intentional and strategic behaviour within the prisoners’ dilemma and the avoidance of unsuccessful ultimatum proposals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differences between ASD children and neurotypical controls were significant, but not explainable in terms of a difference in rationality (nor do Hill and Sally attempt any such explanation). For example, the distribution of offers in the Ultimatum Game looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/UG_Offers.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/UG_Offers.jpg" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ASD kids were more likely to offer 0, 6, and 7 units than their non-ASD peers — but none of those choices are dictated by rational-choice game theory. And similarly for the acceptances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/UG_Acceptance.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/UG_Acceptance.jpg" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the explanation that Hill and Sally offers is not that the ASD children were more rational than the others, but rather than they were less likely to be able to model the mental state of others. The main evidence is the distribution of Ultimatum Game behaviors as a function not of ASD diagnosis, but of score on a test of "mentalising" ability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/UG_FalseBelief.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/UG_FalseBelief.jpg" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the conclusions of game-theoretic &amp;quot;rationality&amp;quot; do overlap in part with the results of failure to model the likely reactions of others — but this is not because the poor mentalizers are more rational. In some respects, the poor mentalizers were even further from the &amp;quot;rational&amp;quot; standard than the good mentalizers were. I&amp;#39;d be willing to bet, in fact, that low scores on the &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;amp;uid=1994-36931-001"&gt;second-order false belief test&lt;/a&gt;" would usually correlate, especially developmentally, with low scores on test of abstract logical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So along with the extended or figurative use of &lt;em&gt;Asperger's Syndrome&lt;/em&gt; to mean something like "rude and cruel", we seem to be seeing an extended sense of &lt;em&gt;autistic&lt;/em&gt; to mean &amp;quot;excessively rational&amp;quot;. This is all part of the normal — and irrational — process of semantic drift.

After ditching creationist dentist Don McLeroy as head of the state board of education, &lt;a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6514838.html"&gt;Governor Rick Perry is now considering Cynthia Dunbar for the job&lt;/a&gt;. Dunbar is the author of a book called &lt;i&gt;One Nation Under God&lt;/i&gt;, and despises public education…just the person to put in charge of public education, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a book published last year, Dunbar argued the country's founding fathers created "an emphatically Christian government" and that government should be guided by a "biblical litmus test." She endorses a belief system that requires "any person desiring to govern have a sincere knowledge and appreciation for the Word of God in order to rightly govern."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Also in the book, she calls public education a "subtly deceptive tool of perversion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The establishment of public schools is unconstitutional and even "tyrannical," she wrote, because it threatens the authority of families, granted by God through Scripture, to direct the instruction of their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion in that article is bizarre. Crazy Dunbar is regarded as a likely choice because her selection would make far-right conservatives happy; they don't even want a moderate Republican to be considered for the job. And Dunbar claims that she is just the person to bring together the various factions on the current board!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/mcleroy_is_down_could_texas_po.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/omK67mRTNGg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246887635598"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/06/jenny-mccarthy-spreading-dangerous/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ae12822e8a0c706a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Jenny McCarthy: spreading more dangerous misinformation</title><published>2009-07-06T13:30:35Z</published><updated>2009-07-06T13:30:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/06/jenny-mccarthy-spreading-dangerous/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t had your quota of shockingly wrong medical advice for the year yet, &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org/media/Biomedical-101.html"&gt;try watching this video by &lt;em&gt;Dr.&lt;/em&gt; Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;, as she manages to squeeze about a metric ton of misinformation into a two-ounce package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Update (July 6 2009): I checked this link last night, but in the meantime Generation Rescue — Jenny McCarthy’s antiscience organization and the hosting site for the video — removed the page for some reason. I don’t know why they did that, but &lt;a href="http://74.125.93.132/custom?q=cache:7VdKTUNtV7QJ:www.generationrescue.org/media/Biomedical-101.html+Biomedical-101&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=us"&gt;the video is cached online and you can see it here&lt;/a&gt;. SCAM Blasting &lt;a href="http://blog.fuzztwin.com/?p=125"&gt;also has the video online&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Incidentally, as if her antiscience nonsense isn’t bad enough, this video is in flash, so you cannot fast forward or rewind; making it far less useful for its purported purpose: to &amp;quot;educate&amp;quot; parents, so I guess that’s a good thing). It starts off with the nonsense right away, when she says, &amp;quot;I am not antivaccine. I am antitoxin,&amp;quot; then barely takes a breath before saying that vaccines are full of toxins, and that toxins cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeat after me: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/08/22/antivaxxers-must-be-stopped-now/"&gt;Vaccines do not cause autism!&lt;/a&gt; We know they don’t. The tests have been done, the studies examined, &lt;em&gt;and we know that vaccines have nothing to do with autism&lt;/em&gt;. Anyone who says differently is trying to sell you something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/drjennymcarthy.jpg" alt="Dr. Jenny McCarthy"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things goes even farther off the rails from there, with her making all sorts of ridiculous and unfounded assertions. One of the first things she says is that autism isn’t genetic, and then confuses the issue with a statement about epidemics. But she’s wrong (which is pretty much the case with everything she says); &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=528"&gt;there are strong genetic indicators of autism&lt;/a&gt;, but the underlying cause is still unknown. She makes claims about what triggers autism, when in fact no one knows what physically causes autism. But we do know vaccines do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; cause them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hear antivaxxers all the time saying that if we don’t know what causes autism, how can we know vaccines &lt;em&gt;don’t?&lt;/em&gt; But that’s just more empty rhetoric. It’s possible to not know something’s cause while still eliminating possibilities; that’s one way how medicine and science work. Start with an event and possible cause — for example, does chocolate cause acne? — then test the idea. If it comes up negative, move on. And, as I said, there is a lot of research on vaccines, and the conclusion is clear. When people like McCarthy say vaccines cause autism, they are ignoring the tsunami of evidence showing they are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know a vast amount about children’s health issues; pediatricians devote their lives to them, and the antivaxxers are bent in throwing all this knowledge away, replacing it with fairy tales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccinations rid this world of smallpox, a scourge that killed millions of people. Measles was on the decline, pertussis was on the decline, rubella was on the decline. &lt;a href="http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/notices.aspx"&gt;We are seeing a surge in outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; from these and other easily preventable diseases — including, tragically, deaths of children, deaths of babies —  and a lot of it is traceable to the misinformation from the antivaccination movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a medical doctor. But I do understand science, and I have talked to many friends who are doctors, including one who is a pediatrician. So here’s my advice: Don’t listen to Jenny McCarthy. &lt;strong&gt;Talk to a doctor instead&lt;/strong&gt;. Get real advice, based on actual science, knowledge, experience, and above all, &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems to be a place with which Ms. McCarthy is unfamiliar. But if you have young kids, reality is where you have to be. Your kids depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;

Specifically, as Kim Atwood (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=48"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=49"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=55"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=11"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=21"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=25"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=35"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=42"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;) has pointed out before, EBM values clinical studies above all else and devalues plausibility based on well-established basic science as one of the “lower” forms of evidence. While this sounds quite reasonable on the surface (after all, what we as physicians really want to know is whether a treatment works better than a placebo or not), it ignores one very important problem with clinical trials, namely that prior scientific probability matters. Indeed, four years ago, John Ioannidis made a bit of a splash with a paper published in JAMA entitled &lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/294/2/218"&gt;Contradicted and Initially Stronger Effects in Highly Cited Clinical Research&lt;/a&gt; and, more provocatively in PLoS Medicine, &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=16060722"&gt;Why Most Published Research Findings Are Wrong&lt;/a&gt;. In his study, he examined a panel of highly cited clinical trials and determined that the results of many of them were not replicated and validated in subsequent studies. His conclusion was that a significant proportion, perhaps most, of the results of clinical trials turn out not to be true after further replication and that the likelihood of such incorrect results increases with increasing improbability of the hypothesis being tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, CAM advocates &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/09/the_cranks_pile_on_john_ioannidis_work_o.php"&gt;piled onto these studies&lt;/a&gt; as “evidence” that clinical research is hopelessly flawed and biased, but that is not the correct interpretation. Basically, as &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php?p=8"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt; and, especially, &lt;a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/09/why_most_publis.html"&gt;Alex Tabarrok&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, prior probability is critical. What Ioannidis’ research shows is that clinical trials examining highly improbable hypotheses are far more likely to produce false positive results than clinical trials examining hypotheses with a stronger basis in science. Of course, estimating prior probability can be tricky based on science. After all, if we could tell beforehand which modalities would work and which didn’t we wouldn’t need to do clinical trials, but there are modalities for which we can estimate the prior probability as being very close to zero. Not surprisingly (at least to readers of this blog), these modalities tend to be “alternative medicine” modalities. Indeed, the purest test of this phenomenon is homeopathy, which is nothing more than pure placebo, mainly because it is water. Of course, another principle that applies to clinical trials is that smaller, more preliminary studies often yield seemingly positive results that fail to hold up with repetition in larger, more rigorously designed randomized, double-blind clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, a paper was published in &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org"&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; Thomas by Thomas Pfeiffer at Harvard University and Robert Hoffmann at MIT that brings up another factor that may affect the reliability of research. Oddly enough, it is somewhat counterintuitive. Specifically, Pfeiffer and Hoffmann’s study was entitled &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005996"&gt;Large-Scale Assessment of the Effect of Popularity on the Reliability of Research&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, the hypothesis being tested is whether the reliability of findings published in the scientific literature decreases with the popularity of a research field. Although this phenomenon is hypothesized based on theoretical reasoning, Pfeiffer and Hoffmann claim to present the first empirical evidence to support this hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why might more popular fields produce less reliable research? Pfeiffer and Hoffmann set up the problem in the introduction. I’m going to quote fairly generously, because they not only confirm the importance of prior probability, but put the problem into context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if conducted at best possible practice, scientific research is never entirely free of errors. When testing scientific hypotheses, statistical errors inevitably lead to false findings. Results from scientific studies may occasionally support a hypothesis that is actually not true, or may fail to provide evidence for a true hypothesis. The probability at which a hypothesis is true after a certain result has been obtained (posterior probability) depends on the probabilities at which these two types of errors arise. Therefore, error probabilities, such as p-values, traditionally play a predominant role for evaluating and publishing research findings. The posterior probability of a hypothesis, however, also depends on its prior probability. Positive findings on unlikely hypotheses are more likely false positives than positive findings on likely hypotheses. Thus, not only high error rates, but also low priors of the tested hypotheses increase the frequency of false findings in the scientific literature [1], [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, a high popularity of research topics has been argued to have a detrimental effect on the reliability of published research findings [2]. Two distinctive mechanisms have been suggested: First, in highly competitive fields there might be stronger incentives to “manufacture” positive results by, for example, modifying data or statistical tests until formal statistical significance is obtained [2]. This leads to inflated error rates for individual findings: actual error probabilities are larger than those given in the publications. We refer to this mechanism as “inflated error effect”. The second effect results from multiple independent testing of the same hypotheses by competing research groups. The more often a hypothesis is tested, the more likely a positive result is obtained and published even if the hypothesis is false. Multiple independent testing increases the fraction of false hypotheses among those hypotheses that are supported by at least one positive result. Thereby it distorts the overall picture of evidence. We refer to this mechanism as “multiple testing effect”. Putting it simple, this effect means that in hot research fields one can expect to find some positive finding for almost any claim, while this is not the case in research fields with little competition [1], [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential presence of these two effects has raised concerns about the reliability of published findings in those research fields that are characterized by error-prone tests, low priors of tested hypotheses and considerable competition. It is therefore important to analyze empirical data to quantify how strong the predicted effects actually influence scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, new scientific fields are almost, by definition, full of hypotheses with low prior probabilities, because, well, it’s new science and scientists don’t have a sufficient base of research to know which hypotheses are likely to be true and which are not. I particularly like this phrase, though: “low priors of tested hypotheses and considerable competition.” Sound familiar? That’s exactly what’s going on in CAM research these days, the difference being that most CAM hypotheses are unlikely ever to become more plausible. In any case, as more and more groups start doing CAM research (multiple independent testing) and more and more literature is published on CAM, given the very low prior probability of so many CAM modalities, it is not at all surprising that there are, in essence, papers reporting positive findings in the scientific literature for pretty much any CAM claim, and we can expect the problem to get worse, at least if this hypothesis is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it true,though? Pfeiffer and Hoffmann chose a rather interesting way to test whether increasing popularity of a field results in the lower reliability of published findings in that field. They chose to look at published reports of interactions between proteins in yeast (&lt;em&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/em&gt;, a common yeast used in the lab to study protein interactions, often using a system known as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-hybrid_screening"&gt;yeast two-hybrid screen&lt;/a&gt;). The interesting aspect of this choice is that it’s not clinical research; it is far more likely to find definitive yes-no answers and validate them than it ever is in clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Pfeiffer and Hoffmann did first was to use the text mining system iHOP to identify published interactions between proteins and genes in titles and abstracts from the PubMed database and expert-curated data from IntAct and DIP, major databases for protein interactions consisting of expert-curated interactions extracted from the scientific literature and high throughput experiments, as an additional source for published statements on protein interactions. Overall, there were 60,000 published statements examining 30,000 unique interactions. The reported frequency of each interaction was then compared to data derived from recent high throughput experiments based on yeast-two-hybrid experiments, high-throughput mass spectroscopy, tandem affinity purification, and an approach that combines mass-spectroscopy and affinity purification. The strength of this approach is that these high throughput results are not influenced by popularity because they make no a priori assumptions about the protein interactions studied and look at thousands of interactions nearly simultaneously; thus, they are not influenced by either effect being examined, the inflated error effect or multiple testing effect. The weakness of this approach is that these high throughput methods are not free from errors or bias and they do not test all the interactions that can be found in the literature. Finally, Pfeiffer and Hoffmann estimated the popularity of various proteins, or the corresponding genes that encode them, by estimating the number of times the protein or its gene is mentioned in the scientific literature, comparing the popularity of the protein interaction partners and how often the high throughput analysis confirmed interactions reported in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are summarized in this graph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/slideshow.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0005996&amp;amp;imageURI=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0005996.g001"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3549/3690214302_dd2e4d96ed_o.png" width="500" height="157" alt="journal.pone.0005996.g001"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(Click to go to original, larger image.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1A shows what I consider to be a bit of a “well, duh” finding. Specifically, what it shows is that, the more frequently a specific protein interaction is reported in the literature, the more likely it is to be correlate withthe results found in the high throughput experiments, or, as the authors put it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interactions that are described frequently in the literature tend to be confirmed more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is reassuring in that it at least implies that the more frequently a result is reported by independent labs, the more likely it is to be correct. After all, repetition and confirmation by other investigators are hallmarks of science. However, panels B and C, looking at both datasets examined, show a decreasing reliability for reports of protein interactions that correlates with increasing popularity of individual protein partners in the interactions. In addition, Pfeiffer and Hermann tried to look at the inflated error effect and the multiple testing effect, and found evidence for both being operative, although the evidence for a multiple testing effect was stronger than it was for the inflated error effect–ten times stronger in fact. In other words, if the results of this study are accurate, random chance acting on the testing of hypotheses with a low prior probability of being true is a far more potent force producing false positives than either fraud or “statistical significance seeking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean for clinical research or, for that matter, all scientific research? First, one needs to be clear that this is a single paper and has looked at correlation. The correlation is strong, and, given the methodology used, does imply causation, although it cannot conclusively demonstrate it. What it does imply, at least from the perspective of clinical trials research, is that the more investigators doing more research on highly improbable hypotheses, the more false positives we can expect to see. Indeed, I’d love to see Pfeiffer and Hermann look at this very question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My impression–and, let me emphasize, it is just that, an impression–is that the number of seemingly “positive” CAM studies is increasing. Certainly, it’s not unreasonable to hypothesize this to be the case, given the growth of NCCAM over the last decade, to the point where it is funding approximately &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=36"&gt;$120 million a year of little but studies of low probability hypotheses.&lt;/a&gt; Add to that the well-known problems of publication bias and the so-called “file drawer” effect, in which positive studies are far more likely to be published and negative studies far more likely to be left in the “file drawer,” and the problem can only get worse. On the other hand, remember that this study looks only at the reliability of individual studies, not the reliability of the literature on topics in totality. The more times a result is seen in science, in general the more reliable that result will be. Similarly, the more frequently a positive result is seen in well-designed clinical studies, the more likely it is to be true. That’s why it’s so important to look at the totality of the scientific literature; the problem is, of course, winnowing out the huge number of crap studies from that totality. All Pfeiffer and Hermann’s work does, at least for me, is to provide evidence supporting a phenomenon that most researchers intuitively suspect to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether that’s confirmation bias or real evidence that it is true will await further study.&lt;/p&gt;

Conner, a science journalist, heard about a Skeptics in the Pub meeting that Ben was holding to discuss why the  “mainstream media’s science coverage is broken, misleading, dangerous, lazy, venal and silly.” Conner, apparently, took exception to that discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben gives full &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/07/steve-connor-is-getting-eggy/"&gt;details here&lt;/a&gt;, including a nice response to Conner, but here is Conner’s best rant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But their arrogance is not new. Medical doctors in particular have always had a lofty attitude to the media’s coverage of their profession, stemming no doubt from the God-like stance they take towards their patients. Although I wouldn’t go as far as to say their profession is broken, dangerous, lazy, venal and silly – not yet anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben took great pleasure in pointing out that while Conner was being defensive about criticism aimed at lazy journalists – he got the date of the meeting wrong and falsely assumed that the three speakers were all doctors when only one was. It is also interesting that Conner appears to have nothing but contempt for a profession that he covers as a journalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This exchange raises two issues regarding the state of science journalism (and all of journalism, really). The first is the one the Skeptics in the Pub were discussing – an apparent decline in the overall quality of science journalism at a time when the complexity and volume of science is increasing and when their are rising voices of anti-science and pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science journalists today not only have to deal with reporting on complex science news stories, like stem cells, fMRI studies, quantum mechanics, global warming, and artificial intelligence – they also have to make sense of the anti-vaccination movement, intelligent design, free energy claims, as well as ideological think tanks and  corporate science spin. It’s challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time they are facing declining resources. News rooms are closing at a rapid pace, and those that are surviving so far are downsizing – which often means closing the dedicated science department and turning science stories over to generalist writers and editors. The result is a widening gap between the science savvy of primary journalists and the complexity of science news reporting. It’s no wonder the quality of science reporting it getting alarmingly low, and that was exactly the topic of the Skeptics’ discussion. That Conner would have been offended by this is really quite absurd and alarming in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source of journalists’ woes is, by all accounts, the devastating blow that the internet has dealt to the journalism business model. People are used to getting news for free on the internet, so why pay for a clumsy paper news source that is mostly filled with stories you could have read (and probably did read) hours or days ago on the internet? This problem does need to be solved, because we need primarily journalism and dedicated journalists who can spend their full time chasing down stories (not just blogging in their spare time). The internet needs to be looked at as a solution, not just a problem. Forward looking outfits are doing this, but have yet to hit upon a viable business model – but they will eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other issue this exchange brings to light is the fact that the internet, and in this case specifically science bloggers, has altered the news cycle a bit, adding a second wave. And again, journalists like Conner may see this as a problem for them, but more savvy journalists will see it as a boon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a science news story hits the cycle used to be – press release to the media following by a single wave of journalism covering the story with varying quality. More in depth stories would later appear in long format in science magazines or as feature articles in the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the cycle is more complex and involves at least a second wave – press release followed by primary reporting (both by the media but also now along side science bloggers) but then followed by an immediate reaction to the reporting from science bloggers. Therefore, sometimes the science bloggers hit the first wave, reporting right off the press releases or, more often, the primary publication in the science literature. But then they also generate a second wave of commentary on the reporting itself, sometimes even evolving into a series of reactions among bloggers – a virtual discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalists like Conners may see this as a problem, but it isn’t, it’s a solution. What this means is that science journalists are being held by scientists and science-afficionados to a higher standard. If they screw up, they are immediately called on it. It also means they have to compete with actual scientists who are sometimes doing the primary science reporting right along with the journalists. In my opinion, scientist bloggers (speaking from the bias of being one)  generally do a better job of reporting science than journalists. Don’t get me wrong, there are still great science journalists out there. I just think being a scientist and educator first and a journalist second puts one in a better position to report science news than being a journalist first and science enthusiast second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing – this is not even a choice we have to make; we can have both. Science bloggers entered this new world order looking for a niche and a purpose and rapidly found it. Science journalists are the ones who have to adapt, but I think the good ones will. As I said above, there is a role for journalists with the time and resources to do interviews and investigations full time. And there is a role for science bloggers to provide their expertise and hold science reporting to a high standard, as well as add in depth discussion to mere reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the internet, news is now a two way street – a dialogue. Journalists have to adapt to that. If you are going to report on science news you will likely be hit with a wave of analysis, commentary, and criticism from an army of scientists and their blogs. Deal with it. This serves the public well, and they know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some journalists have adapted well. They often contact science bloggers who have covered a topic to get their analysis of a news story. They see science bloggers as a resource, not a source of unwanted criticism. New outlets are now also incorporating science bloggers, and journalists are blogging. So the lines between journalist and blogger are blurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science bloggers also, in my opinion, need to see journalists not just as a source of horrible science gaffes that need to be fixed, but also as a potential resource. We need to encourage and praise good science journalism as much as we criticize the bad, and make ourselves available as a resource to journalists and news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I think that science blogging has opened up a new era of collaboration between scientists and journalists that is resulting in vastly better science news reporting to the public. Quality may be declining in the traditional media, and there is still a great deal of crap out there on the internet, but we are in transition. For anyone interested in a science news story, you can find in depth analysis from multiple perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, science bloggers have always been in the position that journalists now find themselves – open to criticism and correction from an army of commenters – the third wave of science news reporting. Sometimes I have even had the researchers themselves show up in my comments to discuss the reporting and discussion of their discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Steve Conners of the world need to open their eyes and see what it happening. Like any paradigm shift in any industry, you can see it as a threat to the status quo and fight against it, or you can embrace it and profit from it. Science bloggers are here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;

This small town has quite an interesting past with regard to aiding runaway slaves. Then we went on a walking tour of a few of the homes where these slaves found rest on their journey to Detroit and then into Canada, which was a free country. The people of this town probably helped thousands of them.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our guide mentioned that there are rumors of an underground tunnel between the leader’s house to either the library or someone else’s house. But the library wasn’t built until years later and she couldn’t find any evidence of a tunnel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here then lies an example of what we do in testing a claim. The first thing we do is to think. Can we account for the origin of a rumor that would lead us to think it’s not true? The &lt;em&gt;Underground Railroad&lt;/em&gt; was neither underground nor was it a railroad (although in some cases slaves did hitch a ride on trains). Rumors after all, like folklore, spring up all of the time because we’re story-telling people. Rumors of tunnels have sprung up everywhere with no basis (although archaeologists did discover one under George Washington’s home). Then too, we must ask ourselves what would be the purpose of a tunnel? Tunnels to transport slaves would require a great deal of work, so the payoff would have to be significant. Our tour guide told about one house that had a trap door on the second story where runaway slaves would climb down into a room with no windows and no other way to get out but to climb back up. That seems to have been a good enough hiding place. Why would they need a tunnel? These runaway slaves could be easily transported at night, which they were. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While this disproves nothing, it does cause us to require evidence before we’ll accept such a claim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See, that way easy. The analogy here at DC is obvious. If it isn't then &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/07/if-god-knows-how-to-get-my-attention.html"&gt;my next post will make it so&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-8846661749433427235?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I saw an old friend named Joe there are we got into a conversation. He is a Bible Thumper, and by that I mean someone who finds all of his theological questions answered decisively in the Bible, not in reason. Even as a believer I thought Joe was lopsided, since reason was something God created and he required us to think about these issues as well. But Joe has all of the answers. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe is sure that he's right and that he has the proper interpretation of the Bible, even though he has had no deep theological training at all. He has the tendency to talk down to others since he has divine truth and it doesn’t matter if someone has studied these issues out deeply either. Again, he has divine answers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the course of our conversation he told me that he cannot convince me to believe again, only the Holy Spirit can do that. As he was starting to quote the Bible I interrupted him. I told him about the presentation I just heard concerning the &lt;em&gt;Underground Railroad&lt;/em&gt; and the rumors of a tunnel, and how to think through such claims. Then I said to him he needs to begin by thinking, not quoting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Don’t quote the Bible to me. Just think about what you’re saying. Does the Holy Spirit know how to get my attention?” He said that “it depended on whether I reject the Spirit or not.” “But even if I rejected it can the Holy Spirit get my attention anyway, like what supposedly happened to Paul who was so hard-hearted that he was even persecuting Christians? Can he get my attention like his supposedly got Moses’ attention with a burning bush? Can he get my attention like he did with Gideon, or many others?” Joe had to admit that I was right, "yes he knows how to get your attention." Then I simply asked him: "If God knows how to get my attention why doesn’t he do so? It’s not that I don’t want to believe. I am open to the evidence just like I’m open to the evidence that there is a tunnel in the town of Orland. It’s just that I cannot believe. I really can’t. It not only doesn’t make sense, there isn’t enough evidence to believe these ancient stories.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the end Joe asked if he could pray for me. I told him yes that would be fine. But then I also said if prayer works it’s a done deal. I should eventually believe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We parted as friends, but I hope the lesson was not lost on him. We must begin to evaluate a claim by simply thinking about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-3953659561562981749?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What pseudo-scientific categories are discussed on the site?  Astrology, Numerology, Tarot, Psychic, Reincarnation, etc.  Just like his TV show, it targets people who are depressed and vulnerable, who would rather get false hope than reality, and who are ready to throw their money at the first con artist who shows up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s free membership and paid membership.  The “IQ Membership” is the one that requires you to pay money.  (Ironically, one would think people with higher IQs would avoid joining the website altogether…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s all you need to know about the site.  The Terms of Use has a disclaimer — a &lt;a href="http://infinitequest.com/Terms_of_Use"&gt;“limitation of liability”&lt;/a&gt; — that reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
JECO PARTIES MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT… THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SITE WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, they can make up whatever bullshit they want, and if they’re wrong, you can’t do anything about it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire second section of the Terms of Use is called “Not Healthcare Advice” and urges you not to take their recommendations seriously.  Instead, you should ask your doctor before doing anything they say.  Which they’re making up, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward appeared on &lt;strong&gt;Sean Hannity&lt;/strong&gt;’s show (are you surprised?) to promote the site.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out some of &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,526883,00.html"&gt;Hannity’s hard-hitting journalism&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;HANNITY&lt;/strong&gt;: See, I actually think there’s — there could be a good side to what you’re doing in terms of entertainment. I think hypnosis is entertaining. I believe it’s real. I also think that you might be able to give comfort to people, to think that that loved one is sending a message. And whether real or not, it could be comforting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I worry about [are] the people that would take advantage of people that are psychologically, spiritually, emotionally vulnerable.  [&lt;em&gt;Hemant's note: Does Hannity have *any* idea who he's talking to at this point?&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDWARD&lt;/strong&gt;: And that’s why it’s important to raise your awareness, so that you understand what’s real and what’s not real. But you know, if you’re going to see a psychic, and the psychic is telling you what to do, not a good place. No psychics shouldn’t be telling you what to do. They should be providing you insights, and then you choose based upon your own God-given ability of free will as to what’s going to happen or what you’re going to choose to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HANNITY&lt;/strong&gt;: … And I hope you use [your gift] for good. And not like some of these hucksters. These people in New York are nuts, you know, that supposedly do this for a living…

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 250 people came to the Methow Valley June 26 through 28 from as far away as Europe and Hawaii to participate in the ninth annual &lt;a href="http://www.friendsofthetrees.net/fairycongress/"&gt;Fairy and Human Relations Congress&lt;/a&gt;, an outdoor festival in a secluded mountain meadow called Skalitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, I know where that is — near Twisp (a wonderful name for a fairy congress), Washington, and very lovely place. And they were gathered for such a noble purpose!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The purpose of the congress is to encourage communication and cooperation of the fairy realm," said Michael "Skeeter" Pilarski, the event's founder and organizer.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The human world is in crisis and can use all the help it can get, Pilarski said, so why not form alliances with those in other realms?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not, indeed. It sounds so reasonable. They're also right about something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skeptics might mock the participants or dismiss them as New Age hippies, but they say their belief system is not much different from Native American animists or even Christians who believe in angels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're exactly right, Skeeter. There's no difference at all between what you're doing and what's going on in churches every day, all across the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/gosh_i_think_i_went_to_the_wro.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/IOU74sLJ6yk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246879563568"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clocktutorial_5_circadian_orga_3.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f2313ae63804f918</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Tutorials"/><title type="html">ClockTutorial #5: Circadian Organization</title><published>2009-07-06T11:33:41Z</published><updated>2009-07-06T11:33:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/hLNnVb0-JrE/clocktutorial_5_circadian_orga_3.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clocktutorial_5_circadian_orga_3.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://circadiana.blogspot.com/2005/02/clocktutorial-5-circadian-organization.html" title="ClockTutorial #5: Circadian Organization"&gt;&lt;img alt="ClockTutorial #5: Circadian Organization" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2006/06/ClockWeb%20logo2.JPG" width="104" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although not addressed by this study, it is also common for companies to specifically claim that their brain-training exercises alter the brain waves. This is just an added layer of pseudoscience used for marketing. Any company that claims they can improve your brain waves is engaging in pure quackery. Some companies even claim to do this passively, just by listening to their tapes, for example. This would actually be counter productive, as it is active participation in any mental activity that seems to be important for improving mental function.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market for brain training products this year is estimated at $225 million. This is not all necessarily waste - many may find Brain Age or other such games to be fun in their own right. Just don’t buy the hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246869158318"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_quotes_343.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a434587d32415d7f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-07-06T09:05:50Z</published><updated>2009-07-06T09:05:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/0g4044lodcA/clock_quotes_343.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_quotes_343.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once upon a time a man dragged his father from their house and as they reached a tree his father cried Stop!

21-year-old Joshua Fry is a Marine.  He is on the autism spectrum, and his recruiter knew this when he recruited Fry from a group home in Irving, California.  After making it through 11 grueling weeks of boot camp, Fry was sent to Camp Pendleton for infantry training where "within weeks he was under arrest for desertion and possession of child pornography," today's &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-marine-autism6-2009jul06,0,7706948.story?page=1&amp;amp;track=rss"&gt;LA Times&lt;/a&gt; reports. He has been court-martialed and imprisoned for the past year; his next court-martial hearing is July 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he's not doing well, according to his grandmother, Mary Beth Fry of Newport Beach. When Fry was 18, she became his legal conservator meaning that "under the conservatorship, Fry is prohibited from signing contracts without his grandmother's approval." The recruiter ignored the fact that he needed Mary Beth Fry's legal approval to recruit Joshua Fry. According to court documents, Fry's life has not been easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 35-page motion filed by Fry's lawyer details a troubled childhood: parents who were drug addicts, an evaluation of autism at age 8, multiple stays in foster homes, behavior problems at Newport Harbor High School, an arrest for stealing iPods and a court-ordered stay at a facility for psychologically disturbed youth that lasted 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as the &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-marine-autism6-2009jul06,0,7706948.story?page=1&amp;amp;track=rss"&gt;LA Times&lt;/a&gt; notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism is not among the conditions that automatically bar a would-be recruit. But, if Navy doctors had known of the diagnosis, Fry would have been evaluated more skeptically during the pre-boot camp medical examination and most likely would have been rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, a psychiatrist for the Orange County mental health agency wrote that, although Fry "is high-functioning for a child with autism, he exhibits the typical characteristics of anxiety, impulsive behavior, distractibility, very poor social skills and an inability to read social cues and interact appropriately in social situations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it is wrong that Joshua Fry was, as he has been charged with, in possession of child pornography. But it's very, deeply, disturbing to know that military recruiters are so pressured to get enough recruits that they (knowingly) overlook legal and ethical principles. It's John Fry who is getting the shortest end of the proverbial stick. As Mary Beth Fry notes, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's had a lot of problems being locked up,......He's on psychotropic drugs. He's been diagnosed as bipolar and is having trouble holding it together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jeff and Alex went to the Bronx Zoo. Ned and I had sparklers, fireworks, barbecue. Alex had hot dogs and played with toy animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a break from autism. Jeff had about 30 hours of  autism (except when he was sleeping — luckily Alex slept through the night, too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this puts us at something of a marital disadvantage this evening, when I’m tired and feel like kicking back, but he’s been working (really - it is a kind of job, coping with Alex except for a couple of breaks). It’s the boys’ bedtime; he feels snappish and put-upon; I feel like I’m back in a newsroom, where you get the time off, but not the work: if you take time off, you simply pay for it when you get back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was at (and helped to plan) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AggieCon"&gt;AggieCon&lt;/a&gt; XIII. AggieCon is “the oldest and largest student-run science fiction convention in the United States.”  We showed &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073629/"&gt;Rocky Horror&lt;/a&gt; for the first time on what was (and still is) an extremely conservative campus with a large military presence. Ted, our faculty adviser, was very nervous that the higher-ups would be upset with the sexual content of the movie.  I think that was a pretty realistic fear &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; go into CONvergence with an idea of what a sci-fi con was.&lt;br&gt;
One of the fun things about Cons is all the weirdos come out to play.  But the nature of the play has changed. &lt;em&gt;A lot.&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/3689338855/"&gt;&lt;img title="ZARDOZ!" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2529/3689338855_78df2b3f56_m.jpg" alt="" width="132" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much everyone at CONvergence seemed to be wearing a corset, dudes included. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3YiPC91QUk"&gt;Huge tracts of land&lt;/a&gt; were on display everywhere, as well as fetish costumes that would keep you in your bunk for weeks. Hot damn, &lt;a title="Sadly, this was not in the Skepchick suite" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nudecarbon/3686801385/"&gt;things&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="a butterfly I didn&amp;#39;t collect" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nudecarbon/3686737879/"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="corset cutie" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nudecarbon/3687536338/"&gt;changed&lt;/a&gt;!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every flavor of freak flag was flying happily and proudly. Everyone was so beautiful. And they all had &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/3690111214/"&gt;AMAZING SHOES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had a great series of panels on the skeptic/science track at the convention, with lots of attendees and great questions. I got to spend some time chatting with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/"&gt;Greg Laden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.starstryder.com/"&gt;Pamela Gay&lt;/a&gt;, which gave my brain some exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some interesting stories to write up for you when I’m less sleep deprived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*the first commenter to mention they weren’t even born in 1982 will be dope-slapped within an inch of their life. You’ve been warned.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

One of the fun things about Cons is all the weirdos come out to play.  But the nature of the play has changed. &lt;em&gt;A lot.&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/3689338855/"&gt;&lt;img title="ZARDOZ!" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2529/3689338855_78df2b3f56_m.jpg" alt="" width="132" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much everyone at CONvergence seemed to be wearing a corset, dudes included. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3YiPC91QUk"&gt;Huge tracts of land&lt;/a&gt; were on display everywhere, as well as fetish costumes that would keep you in your bunk for weeks. Hot damn, &lt;a title="Sadly, this was not in the Skepchick suite" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nudecarbon/3686801385/"&gt;things&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="a butterfly I didn&amp;#39;t collect" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nudecarbon/3686737879/"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="corset cutie" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nudecarbon/3687536338/"&gt;changed&lt;/a&gt;!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every flavor of freak flag was flying happily and proudly. Everyone was so beautiful. And they all had &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/3690111214/"&gt;AMAZING SHOES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had a great series of panels on the skeptic/science track at the convention, with lots of attendees and great questions. I got to spend some time chatting with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/"&gt;Greg Laden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.starstryder.com/"&gt;Pamela Gay&lt;/a&gt;, which gave my brain some exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some interesting stories to write up for you when I’m less sleep deprived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*the first commenter to mention they weren’t even born in 1982 will be dope-slapped within an inch of their life.

Thus, making sure that everything is controlled for in an experimental setup is of paramount importance.  Furthermore, for the studies to be replicable in other labs, it is always a good idea for experimental setups to be standardized.  Even that is often not enough.  I do not have access to &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; but you may all recall a paper from several years ago in which two labs tried to simultaneously perform exactly the same experiment in mice, using all the standard equipment, exactly the same protocols, the same strain bought from the same supplier on the same date, the same mouse-feed, perhaps even the same colors of technicians' uniforms and yet, they got some very different data!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circadian behavior is, fortunately, not &lt;a href="http://brembs.net/spontaneous/" title=""&gt;chaotic&lt;/a&gt;, but quite predictable, robust and easily replicable between labs in a number of standard model organisms. Part of the success of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; research program in chronobiology comes from the fact that for decades all the labs used exactly the same experimental apparatus, this one, produced by Trikinetics (Waltham, Massachusetts) and Carolina Biologicals (Burlington, North Carolina):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="drosophila%20apparatus.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2007/05/drosophila%20apparatus.jpg" width="250" height="122"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a series of glass tubes, each containing a single insect.  An infrared beam crosses the middle of each tube and each time the fly breaks the beam, by walking or flying up and down the tube, the computer registers one "pen deflection".  All of those are subsequently put together into a form of an &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/07/clock_tutorial_4_on_methodolog.php" title=""&gt;actograph&lt;/a&gt;, which is the standard format for the visual presentation of chronobiological data, which can be further statistically analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early fruitfly work was done mainly in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila pseudoobscura&lt;/i&gt;.  Most of the subsequent work on fruitfly genetics used &lt;i&gt;D.melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; instead.  Recently, some researchers started using the same setup to do comparative studies of other Drosophila species.  Many fruitfly clock labs have hundreds, even thousands, of such setups, each contained inside a "black box" which is essentially an environmental chamber in which the temperature and pressure are kept constant, noise is kept low and constant ("white noise"), and the lights are carefully controlled - exact timing of lights-on and lights-off as well as the light intensity and spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such a setup, with a square-wave profile of light (abrupt on and off switches), every decent &lt;i&gt;D.melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; in the world shows this kind of activity profile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="fruitfly%20crepuscular.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2007/05/fruitfly%20crepuscular.JPG" width="137" height="135"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activity is bimodal: there is a morning peak (thought to be associated with foraging in the wild) and an evening peak (thought to be associated with courtship and mating in the wild).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of standardization is difficult to overemphasize - without it we would not be able to detect many of the subtler mutants, and all the data would be considered less trustworthy.  Yet, there is something about standardization that is a negative - it is highly artificial. By controlling absolutely everything and making the setup as simple as possible, it becomes very un-representative of the natural environment of the animal.  Thus, the measured behavior is also likely to be quite un-natural. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike in the lab, the fruitflies out in nature do not live alone - they congregate with other members of the species.  Unlike in a 'black box', the temperature fluctuates during the day and night in the real world.  Also unlike the lab, the intensity and spectrum of light change gradually during the duration of the day while the nights are not pitch-black: there are stars and the Moon providing some low-level illumination as well.  Thus, after decades of standardized work, it is ripe time to start investigating how the recorded behaviors match up with the reality of natural behavior in fruitflies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three recent papers address these questions by modifying the experimental conditions in one way or another, introducing additional environmental cues that are usually missing in the standard apparatus (and if you want to know what they found, follow me under the fold):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/flirting_under_moonlight_on_a_2.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/flirting_under_moonlight_on_a_2.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/Fu6vTVlY7MQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246845982286"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13392">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9d1833ff9441075c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Anything But “Atheist”</title><published>2009-07-06T02:00:19Z</published><updated>2009-07-06T02:00:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/05/anything-but-atheist/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MM107I?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000MM107I"&gt;Letting Go of God&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Julia Sweeney&lt;/strong&gt; talks about her parents finding out about her atheism.  &lt;/p&gt;

The prospect of additional warming because of greenhouse gases means that situation could happen even sooner.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="rainband.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/rainband.jpg" width="400" height="144"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lead author Julian Sachs, associate professor of oceanography at the University of Washington, said:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We're talking about the most prominent rainfall feature on the planet, one that many people depend on as the source of their freshwater because there is no groundwater to speak of where they live. In addition many other people who live in the tropics but farther afield from the Pacific could be affected because this band of rain shapes atmospheric circulation patterns throughout the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers found evidence of salt-tolerant microbes buried in lake sediments, corresponding to a period 400 - 1,000 years ago, suggesting a period of reduced rainfall. Additional evidence was provided by ratios of hydrogen isotopes of material in the sediments that can only be explained by large changes in precipitation. The findings are based on sediment cores from lakes and lagoons on Palau, Washington, Christmas and Galapagos islands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/07/as_rain_moves_north_galapagos.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246841638181"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4bdf800c52d709b3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Freedom Rock</title><published>2011-05-30T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2011-05-30T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/patriotic/freedomrock.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Photographs show a rock painted with patriotic scenes alongside an Iowa highway.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246839043693"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/to_communicate_and_how_that_is_the_question">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/183220d59f31cfce</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">To Communicate and How, That is the Question</title><published>2009-07-05T23:18:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-05T23:18:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/to_communicate_and_how_that_is_the_question" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.childrenshospital.org/clinicalservices/Site1850/Images/symbols.jpg" height="170" alt="Picture communication cards from http://www.childrenshospital.org/clinicalservices/Site1850/Images/symbols.jpg" style="float:right;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-right:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="170"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Communication's been on my mind a lot this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're constantly seeking ways to help Charlie communicate better in words and language, even as Jim and I are &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_little_talk_and_a_lot_of_pictures"&gt;ever trying to understand&lt;/a&gt; what Charlie is &lt;i&gt;saying&lt;/i&gt; to us, with words and (as if more often the case than not, due to his limited verbal ability) without. We've consequently been looking much more at &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/promote_the_use_of_augmentative_communication_devices"&gt;augmentative communication devices&lt;/a&gt; while being careful to note that, as Dora posted, a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_device_is_just_a_device"&gt;device is just a device&lt;/a&gt;, and that, while Charlie has a lot more that he would like to communicate, there's more than likely no magic machine that will lead him to start regaling us with paragraphs. (Though I wouldn't be unglad if that did happen.) (It would certainly be interesting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always encouraging to read about a story like that of Colin Monichon in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/opinion/ci_12751123?nclick_check=1"&gt;Mercury News&lt;/a&gt; (California). Monichon just graduated from Branham High School. He's on the autism spectrum and was able to transition from from special education to "on-level, mainstreamed courses"; he uses a &lt;a href="http://www.assistivetech.com/corporate/products/lightwriter_(r)_sl40.aspx"&gt;Lightwriter&lt;/a&gt; to type out what he wants to communicate (he does not speak):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Colin began school at an early age and enjoyed attending. But ﻿"as I got older," he wrote, "the classes changed and became more like baby-sitting. We would sit in circles and the teacher would sing. I was in a severely disabled class where they did not expect us to learn how to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got hit a lot by a big kid in class because they did not have enough staff to watch everyone. That is when the school first gave me an aide. I had only four picture icons (to express personal needs) and no other way to talk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.......&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After proving his cognitive skills through his new means of communication, he was transferred to an inclusion program, where he faced new struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I missed school at least one day a week because my aide did not come to school," he wrote. "Many days, my aide and I spent more time walking the playground than we did in class. I then spent a year being home-schooled because the district could not find me an appropriate aide or include me in regular education. I was very lonely and missed being around other students and people my age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give a student a communication device and he'll.................. communicate. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246838507432"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/07/03/catching-the-waves/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6239494d867765b7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Technology"/><title type="html">Catching the waves</title><published>2009-07-05T22:44:24Z</published><updated>2009-07-05T22:44:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/07/05/catching-the-waves/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent last week at Columbia University attending the &lt;a href="http://www.amaldi8.org/index.html"&gt;Edoardo Amaldi Conference&lt;/a&gt;, the largest annual international meeting on gravitational waves. Short synopsis: GWs have not been found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded that I still owe CV readers a discussion of gravitational waves, following-up from &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/04/25/the-difficult-childhood-of-gravitational-waves/"&gt;an ancient post on their convoluted theoretical history&lt;/a&gt;. While the theoretical community was arguing about the existence of gravitational waves, the observational community was essentially non-existent. The wave strengths expected at Earth are extraordinarily weak, with the most promising sources being the inspiral and merger of stellar-mass compact binary systems (e.g., neutron stars and/or black holes). It took great courage and vision to propose instruments to detect the waves at all. One of the pioneers of gravitational wave detection was Joe Weber, who first invented and built so-called Weber bar detectors. As the gravitational waves pass through a large cylindrical bar of material, they excite resonant modes of the bar, which might then be detectable. In 1969 Weber published an &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1969PhRvL..22.1320W"&gt;article in Physical Review Letters&lt;/a&gt; announcing the detection of gravitational waves by noting coincidences between two bar detectors separated by a thousand kilometers. These observations generated tremendous excitement, especially given that they suggested wave strengths greatly in excess of what was expected. Unfortunately, as other experimenters built ever more sophisticated follow-up detectors, they were unable to reproduce his findings. Over three decades later, and with many orders-of-magnitude improvement in detector sensitivity, gravitational waves have yet to be directly detected.  An unfortunate side-note is that Weber continued to claim that he was seeing gravitational waves, even in the face of compelling counter evidence, right up until his death in 2000. Weber was an experimental master (having independently invented the maser and the laser), and is widely credited as the father of gravitational wave astronomy, but in his last decades he was an outcast of the very community he helped found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A profound development in gravitational waves detection came in 1974 with the discovery by Hulse and Taylor of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16"&gt;binary pulsar&lt;/a&gt;. This system consists of a 59 millisecond pulsar in orbit with another star, with a period of 7.75 hours. The pulsar provides an exceedingly precise clock, allowing us to measure the spin-down of the binary system due to the emission of gravitational waves (using the same quadrupole formula mentioned in the previous post). Theory and observation agree spectacularly well, and Hulse and Taylor were awarded the Nobel prize for this indirect detection of gravitational waves. The community is now breathlessly awaiting the first &lt;strong&gt;direct&lt;/strong&gt; detection of gravitational waves. So why am I nattering on about all this? Because of this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/07/ligo_noise_s5.jpg" title="LIGO noise curve"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/07/ligo_noise_s5.jpg" alt="LIGO noise curve" width="600"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a sensitivity plot of LIGO, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligo"&gt;Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. LIGO is composed of two power-recycled Michelson interferometers with 4-km long Fabry-Perot arms, located in Hanford, Washington and Livingston, Louisiana. Each curve shows the noise floor, with LIGO sensitive to sources falling above the curve. The curves represent official science runs, and the steady progression shows the improvement since 2002 (1st science run). LIGO has been in development for decades, and has in the last few years (the red curve) reached its original design sensitivity (the solid black curve). LIGO has finished a year-long science run (S5), which constitutes by far the deepest look we’ve ever had at the gravitational wave Universe. It hasn’t seen anything yet; only upper limits. (At least, that is the public stance. Given the convoluted history detailed above, there will be a long period of double and triple checking before any sort of public announcement is made. Although it’s hard to imagine rumors of a first detection won’t leak out, and my rumor well is dry.)  At the moment LIGO is being “Enhanced” (a factor of 2 improvement), with the installation of more powerful lasers. It should be back up and running within the year, will run for a year, and then will undergo a major upgrade. By 2014 LIGO will come back online at “Advanced” sensitivity (another factor of 5, which translates into a factor of 1000 in volume compared to today), at which point the first direct detection of gravitational waves is widely anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is lots to say about LIGO, but I’d like to focus on one point: the scale on the y-axis of the plot above (which represents strain, the fractional change in the length of the LIGO arms). LIGO is sensitive, over a wide range of frequency, to a strain of better than 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, it measures changes in the relative length of its 4km arms to better than a thousandth of the size of a proton. This plot should absolutely blow your mind. If not, perhaps I’m being too abstract? This is the equivalent of monitoring changes in the distance between New York and San Francisco to better than one ten billionth the width of a human hair. LIGO is a technical tour-de-force. It is one of the most amazing instruments humankind has ever built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N.B.: In the comments, Brian137 points out that LIGO will be back on starting tomorrow (7/7/09) for a month-long run! (From the &lt;a href="http://ligonews.blogspot.com/2009/06/firm-date-set-for-start-of-s6.html"&gt;LIGO blog&lt;/a&gt;.) And nicolas points out that I was remiss in neglecting to mention &lt;a href="http://www.ego-gw.it/index.aspx"&gt;Virgo&lt;/a&gt;, which is a French/Italian GW detector currently operating in Italy. It is easily as impressive as LIGO, since it achieves similar sensitivity with 3km arms (instead of 4km for LIGO).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>daniel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246838111760"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fb238b4ceea8bb8f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">All You Need is Love.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Recently, I was working out of the JREF offices in Ft. Lauderdale. Sean McCabe, Randi’s personal assistant, volunteered to drive me to the airport when my weekend of sandy beaches was over, and it was time to return to my home – land of sandy deserts (Las Vegas). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;We had some time to kill before heading to the airport, and drove around in circles for a while. We passed a sign outside a building that said, simply, “Please Give Peanut Butter. Thank You,” and decided there was no better way to kill time than giving peanut butter to random people who asked for it. We drove to a gas station, picked up peanut butter, and headed back to the building to find someone to hand it to – not knowing what the building was, or what the peanut butter was even for. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;I mean, perhaps it was like asking your neighbor for a cup of sugar when you’re baking cookies. Just more elaborate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;But, in fact, we found ourselves donating peanut butter to a Christian outreach group benefitting the homeless and impoverished in Ft. Lauderdale.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</summary><author><name>alison@randi.org (Alison Smith)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246836557429"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/lindau_nobel_interview_-_jan_w.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8c6f0cc1d54a6923</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Lindau09"/><title type="html">Lindau Nobel interview - Jan Wedekind</title><published>2009-07-06T00:23:05Z</published><updated>2009-07-06T00:23:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/nvHQEjMo9O4/lindau_nobel_interview_-_jan_w.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/lindau_nobel_interview_-_jan_w.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A brief interview with one of the young researchers attending the Lindau Nobel conference - Jan Wedekind, formerly of University of Barcelona, Spain, and now with &lt;a href="http://www.iris.cat" title=""&gt;IRIS&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

Bex has written an &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/07/02/queensland-digs-yield-three-new-kings-of-the-cretaceous/" title=""&gt;introduction&lt;/a&gt; and will post a Media/Blog coverage (of which there was a lot!) summary probably tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fossils were discovered, cleaned and analyzed by the &lt;a href="http://www.australianageofdinosaurs.com/" title=""&gt;Australian Age Of Dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt; non-profit organization, with a help of thousands of volunteers - the 'citizen scientists'. You can learn more from their &lt;a href="http://www.australianageofdinosaurs.com/news-new-dinosaurs.php" title=""&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of the publication of this paper from the angle of its scientific significance has been covered by several bloggers already. Also, several notice how good it is that the paper was published in an Open Access online-only journal. For example, Andy Farke &lt;a href="http://openpaleo.blogspot.com/2009/07/australian-dinosaur-extravaganza.html" title=""&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This paper is a fantastic example of the real benefits of an on-line, open access journal like PLoS ONE. Without page limitations, the authors were allowed to truly monograph the heck out of the bones. Virtually every element is illustrated from multiple angles (with high resolution photos downloadable from the website!) and accompanied by thorough text descriptions and measurements. The editors of most journals would freak out over such a "waste" of precious space - but I have a feeling that future researchers are going to thank the authors for their thoroughness. As a PDF, the paper weighs in at 51 pages - and this doesn't include the supplementary information!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lead author Scott Hocknull, in an interview for us, &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/07/02/queensland-digs-yield-three-new-kings-of-the-cretaceous/" title=""&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One of my major motivations for submitting to PLoS ONE was the fact that my research will reach a much wider community, including the hundreds of volunteers and public who gave their time and money to the development of natural history collections. They are the backbone of our work (excuse the pun) and they usually never get to see their final product because they rarely subscribe to scientific journals."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the comment on the post at Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week, Scott Hocknull &lt;a href="http://svpow.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/new-thunder-from-down-under/#comment-3667" title=""&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This project is almost a 100% volunteer effort, with thousands of volunteer preppers working endlessly to get the bones ready for publication. This was one of my main reasons for choosing PLoS ONE to publish in. One of my others was the opportunity to provide detail images and descriptions (as best I can).

&lt;p&gt;Most of our volunteers have no access to scientific journal subscriptions, therefore having it online and free for them to look at meant that they could see for themselves the fruits of their labours. They need more credit for the beautiful bones than I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all of you can read it for free as well - all 51 pages of it, plus all the great images and supplemental information. And you can add ratings, notes, comments and trackbacks on the paper as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/waltzing_matilda_-_why_were_th.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/0MMTW33gG7c" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246836284832"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13351">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6c2262d1012ff287</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Atheist Nexus Turns 1</title><published>2009-07-05T23:00:48Z</published><updated>2009-07-05T23:00:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/05/atheist-nexus-turns-1/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week marks the first anniversary of &lt;a href="http://www.atheistnexus.org/"&gt;Atheist Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, an online social networking site.

If you’re a member, please consider &lt;a href="http://atheistnexus.org/main/invitation/new"&gt;inviting your friends&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joining A|N is free and I can attest to the great networking potential it has.  I have a &lt;a href="http://www.atheistnexus.org/profile/Hemant"&gt;personal page&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://www.atheistnexus.org/group/friendlyatheist"&gt;Friendly Atheist page&lt;/a&gt; on it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need any more convincing, there are nearly 500 groups for atheists with more specific interests — photography, Shakespeare, parenting, GLBT issues, etc.  It’s a nice way to meet other atheists in your area, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So join up and wish A|N a happy birthday.  It’ll only get bigger next year!&lt;br&gt;

It is the fulfilment of this test which is the key battleground of almost all obscenity trials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so I thought it was on this point that the prosecution for obscenity against Darryn Walker, who put his vile fantasies online about the band Girls Aloud, was &lt;a href="http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2009/06/girls-aloud-obscenity-case-dropped/"&gt; dropped this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had blogged in &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2008/10/on-expressing-nasty-fantasies-about.html"&gt;October 2008&lt;/a&gt; on this case being brought, adopting a general "free speech" position. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since then, I had wondered about the implications of the case. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Indeed, in a couple of days of inspiration, I wrote out the draft of a play about a hapless public intellectual facing a similar obscenity prosecution.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the newspaper reports, the key feature - the real &lt;em&gt;yuck&lt;/em&gt; factor - seemed to be that the subjects of the nasty fantasies were real people. Had the fantasies been, say, about fictional characters, or had it been a straight non-fiction account of a disgusting incident, it appeared to me that the case would not have been brought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I was still surprised that the case had been brought at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was because it was conventional wisdom that the &lt;a href="http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1128038"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obscene Publications Act 1959&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was no longer used for publications of the &lt;em&gt;written word&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The general view among lawyers was that the failure of the 1975 &lt;em&gt;Inside Linda Lovelace&lt;/em&gt; trial meant that it was pointless to try and bring prosecutions where there was any - even spurious - argument of literary merit. (The Act has a "&lt;em&gt;public good&lt;/em&gt;" defence.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I heard that the case was dropped I assumed that the prosecutors had revisited their decision to prosecute, and that they had sensibly realised that the publication of such vile works was an unfortunate implication of a society with free expression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then I read the press release of the Crown Prosecution Service (hat tip to the estimable Padraig Reidy of &lt;em&gt;Index on Censorship&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The Crown Prosecution Service has today offered no evidence at Newcastle Crown Court against Darryn Walker, accused of one offence under the Obscene Publications Act, 1959. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The court was told by David Perry, QC, for the Crown, that there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. This followed the defence serving new evidence on the prosecution on 12 June 2009, just over two weeks before the trial was due to start. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The case was reviewed again and in the light of the evidence, it was decided it could no longer go ahead. We notified the defence and the court of our decision as soon as we were able. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The court was told the prosecution had received a number of expert reports, one of which cast doubt over the accessibility of the article to people searching the internet and that it could only be found by those determined to find it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The prosecution was unable to provide sufficient evidence to contradict this and so took the decision there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the technical basis for the decision to drop the prosecution was &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; whether the material tended to deprave or corrupt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Looking again at the relevant wording in the Act, but now with different emphasis added:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"an article shall be deemed to be obscene if its effect...is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons &lt;strong&gt;who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read,&lt;/strong&gt; see or hear &lt;strong&gt;the matter contained or embodied in it&lt;/strong&gt;".&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It appears that the legal requirement which was not met was that there was no likelihood that the obscene material would be readily available to a class of people who could be depraved and corrupted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the material was (I understand) available on an internet archive and was found without difficulty by an British tabloid newspaper journalist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If my understandings here are correct, then the Crown Prosecution Service seem to be suggesting that publication on the internet is not necessarily publication to the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John Ozimek and Julian Petley in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jul/01/obscenity-law-darryn-walker"&gt;The Guardian yesterday&lt;/a&gt; suggested that there had been deep internal disputes about this case in the Crown Prosecution Service. The decision to prosecute was taken locally, but it seems the national leadership took a far more liberal and sensible view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In view of this, it appears to me that the Crown Prosecution Service's stated reason for dropping the case may well reflect some internal compromise, leaving open the question of whether the material met the key test of obscenity in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have often stated that litigation is an inefficient means of addressing certain wider issues. These wider issues can be about science or, as here, about normative standards in a free society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The law of obscenity is currently misconceived: the Court's view of the effect on the readers or viewers should be irrelevant. And the decisions to prosecute should not be so easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even where the law of obscenity still performs a useful function - prohibiting various "philia" materials for example - the law should be recast as addressing the creation or possession of such materials, and not on the supposed effects of the materials on an audience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the approval of the Director of Public Prosecutions should now be required for any prosecution in respect of content, as it certainly should not be left to local prosecutors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This has been a most unfortunate case, from beginning to end; but perhaps it can now lead to long required reform of English obscenity law.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-268775870942423541?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246832053757"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/a_not-at-all-pointless_poll.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6ff9257a533f3160</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">A not-at-all-pointless poll</title><published>2009-07-05T22:55:39Z</published><updated>2009-07-05T22:55:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/uWdLqtaEa1g/a_not-at-all-pointless_poll.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/a_not-at-all-pointless_poll.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A young man with muscular dystrophy, who by all accounts is of good character and even exceptional attitude, is in a contest to win a beach vacation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm an atheist, but I'm very relaxed about it. I don't preach my atheism, but I have a huge amount of respect for people like Richard Dawkins who do. Anything he does on television, I will watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that this same segment of society has also found a heightened interest in the works of playwrights like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equus_(play)"&gt;Peter Schaffer&lt;/a&gt;, so we know the Harry Potter effect can help. If only Radcliffe had an excuse to take his clothes off for atheism…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there is also the complementary effect that the people who were convinced that both Harry Potter and atheism were the demon-spawned products of Hell have now had their suspicions confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a chubby, smiling baby boy, Marlon Barton delighted everyone around him. Now that he is a strapping young man who flaps his hands and makes odd noises, no one knows quite what to do with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..."Being large, African American and autistic does not work in his favor," either socially or in programs designed to help people with disabilities, she [Barton's mother] said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've long observed that I can get away with a ton of stuff most people would never dream of getting away with socially at my age because I am a small (5'1", thin), white, moderately attractive female.  Someone like me can continue to delight others with "odd" behavior throughout their entire lives--"cute" at any age.  I make odd noises and jump up and down and do the happy hand thing and everyone says, "oh how cute!" and "boy do I wish I still had your enthusiasm for things!"  This is not because my behavior is necessarily any different from a large male my same age, but because of how society filters its judgement of my behavior due to my appearance: more often as something "delightful" rather than as something "dangerous."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would be nice if people were better able to separate out their reactions to an appearance from their reactions to a person.  Sometimes how we are treated and the opportunities we are given in life, especially what opportunities others will make available to us, seem, unfortunately, to be based on surface appearances that have little to do with our true motivations, actions, or abilities as human beings.  This not only goes for autistics who are seen as "cute" vs. "dangerous" but for people who are autistic vs. people who aren't and even among people who aren't on the spectrum at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair and civil?  No, not at all.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246824366460"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13322">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/403ea3e67fece97e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Advice"/><category term="General"/><category term="Richard Wade"/><title type="html">Ask Richard:  Tried to Stop an Anti-Religious Rant Among Friends</title><published>2009-07-05T20:00:14Z</published><updated>2009-07-05T20:00:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/05/ask-richard-the-reckless-ranter/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dear Richard,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently found myself in an awkward, social situation. I was sitting  in a public place with a small group of people who all knew each  other, at least well enough to match names to faces. Some around the  table were theists and some were not. One person mentioned a news  story about suicide bombers, and another began to rant about how all  the world’s ills were caused by religion. No one else at the table  wanted to argue about religion, but this one individual needed no  encouragement to continue in this vein for some minutes. Feelings  began to run high. I tried to stop the rant short by pointing out the  simple fact that not all ills are caused by religion, and not all that  is done in the name of religion is an ill, but this just encouraged  the ranter to get louder and start repeating himself. Two of my  theistic friends started arguing back, forcefully. Afterwards, I took a few moments to try to speak to the ranting individual one on one,  asking him why he felt so strongly that he had to override our  conversation like that. He responded by repeating his rant a third  time. What else should I have done?    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quester
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Quester,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it’s all over, this is one of those situations where all you can do is to find a lesson, and then try to apply it the next time.  What else you should have done depends on what you wanted to accomplish.  It sounds like you wanted the ranter to just stop talking, and I can understand that, because perhaps you felt embarrassed by his loud anti-religious rant in front of your theist friends as well as others outside your group, and perhaps you were uncomfortable with the tension as “feelings began to run high.” That is very understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You said that no one else wanted to argue about religion, and so you tried to stop the rant short by… &lt;em&gt;arguing&lt;/em&gt; with him.  He simply repeated his rant which provoked others into arguing forcefully, and so your attempt backfired.  We’ve all had the frustration of getting the opposite of what we intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups of friends, as they continue to meet over time, begin to have unspoken rules, expectations and boundaries called norms.  For instance, the members begin to subconsciously sense what topics are welcome and what levels of tension are tolerable in the group.   Each member tries to adjust as the norms become firmer, but if they cannot adjust, they leave the group.  Sometimes certain individuals take on roles in response to those norms.  Some are leaders, some are followers, some are provocateurs, and some are peacemakers, to name just a few.  They are all important roles, and can be very positive.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you wanted to be the peacemaker, to protect the group’s overall mood from building up too much tension about a topic that might be divisive, delivered in a rant that might be too strident. Your group’s norms may not be firmly established yet, and with the mixture of theists and atheists, this subject might eventually become something they can comfortably discuss, or something everyone tacitly agrees to avoid.  Which way it goes remains to be seen.  The tension might have been created only by the tone and volume of the rant, or it might have been the topic itself, no matter how softly and politely it is ever discussed.  Each group can have very different norms about such things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups of friends talk about many things, but those few groups that can also occasionally talk about &lt;em&gt;how they talk&lt;/em&gt; are the ones that can mature and become more satisfying, more tolerant of differences, and more beneficial to the members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you could experiment with talking to the whole group about this incident. Starting with yourself, encourage the others to be frank but still respectful about their feelings as it had played out.  That way, your role as peacemaker will not just be about squelching discussions that might bring up tension, but instead can be about promoting good-natured honesty within the group. That will create a much more healthy atmosphere than simply avoiding or disallowing tension-provoking topics.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope your group of friends can continue to meet, even including the provocative ranter.  It sounds like it has the potential of becoming a fulfilling and enjoyable resource for all the members if they can sometimes talk about how they talk, and how that affects them.&lt;/p&gt;

that there are more thoughts in a skeptic’s mind at any one point than
can ever be written about, with the aid of a blog or not, as evidenced
by the apparent ability for a skeptic to write about two completely
different topics: &lt;a href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/06/steorn.html"&gt;perpetual motion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/06/trade-journal-editorials.html"&gt;Cap-and-Trade&lt;/a&gt;.
As such, only a few of the topics that a skeptic wants to write about
ever will be. Hence, there is a clear bias in the reproductive nature
of writing about science and critical thinking. But what determines
which topics are chosen? And how is the medium of the writing affected
by this bias?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246822133664"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7951">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/53424b0874861374</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">AI: shit happens</title><published>2009-07-05T19:00:08Z</published><updated>2009-07-05T19:00:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7951" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5fbe618e00e7572fe179f8952e0d6d2a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I chatted with a fellow recently who shared some tragic personal stories. These lead to a severe rift between him and his father. Happily, he eventually made amends with his father who pardoned his son with, “It’s okay son, shit happens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This modern maxim was of great comfort to him. To rationalize and cope with life’s hassles he often thinks, “Oh well, shit happens.”&lt;/p&gt;

Dalrymple’s perspective is best summarized by the following quote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Though I am not religious, I have come to the conclusion that it is impossible for us to live decently without the aid of religion. That is the ambiguity of the Enlightenment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I appreciate Dalrymple’s call for personal responsibility, but it strikes me as patronizing for an atheist to say that society needs religion to be decent. Does Dalrymple not consider himself to be decent? If so, how has he managed to maintain his own decency without religion? Does he feel that he has somehow managed to rise above the need for religion while the masses still require it? If so, can they not benefit from the same insights that have allowed him to live morally without religion? He does seem to have a high estimation of the &lt;a href="http://www.cis.org.au/POLICY/winter02/polwin02-5.htm"&gt;intelligence of the underclasses&lt;/a&gt;; why not leverage that intelligence to lead them to an understanding of the benefits of morality without supernaturalism?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m writing this post primarily to elicit feedback from believers concerning Dalyrmple’s approach. For which kind of atheist do you have the lesser respect: one who sings the practical benefits of religion or one who advocates putting religion behind us? Before answering this question, perhaps imagine temporarily for the sake of argument that there really are no gods. Also take into consideration Paul’s thoughts in 1 Corinthians 15:17-19:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short, do you appreciate being told by an atheist like Dalrymple that, even if your religion is untrue, you should go ahead and maintain your faith because of its contribution to your sense of meaning and morality? Or would you prefer that atheists encourage you to leave your religion if God does not exist?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-1486347465284931062?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When I think about family and friends, I will often think to myself, “God bless ’em” when I am worried about them.  This is not said out loud; it is just a personal thought toward the person I am thinking of, a long ingrained habit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an atheist I certainly don’t think it actually does anything. But am I planning on stopping?  No.  Old thought patterns are hard to change.  I have just been laughing lately when I catch myself doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do other atheists do the same thing?  How do they deal with it?  What are suggestions on other ways to phrase these thoughts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems like I need to train myself to think “Be safe, I care about you” instead…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t see any problem with thinking the way Bob does, since it’s more out of habit than belief.  I’m hard-pressed to think of examples of God coming into my thoughts, even though I say “religious” phrases out loud all the time (”Dear Lord,” “Bless you” (after someone sneezes), and “Oh God” come to mind).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; religious thoughts as an atheist?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This much I can say with certainty: I have years of experience successfully teaching in collegiate classrooms, and online teaching doesn't compare. So I'll just chalk up my first and only venture to experience and make my way back to the traditional academy. Here are five reasons why.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I have taken one online class and one "hybrid" (some lecture, mostly online) class and I must say I do not get as much out of them as a live, face-to-face class.

I haven't done a teleconferencing class.  I'll let you know when I do.

&lt;i&gt;Update&lt;/i&gt;:

&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/amyb88"&gt;Amy Williams&lt;/a&gt; tweeted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amyb88"&gt;these comments &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ha. I maintain that ftf teaching and online teaching are two different skill sets. Some instructors have both; some don't. I might add I've taught ftf for 20 years, and online and hybrid for 13 years. :)

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that Star Trek is now old news, but just in case there are still some fellow nerds out there hungry for more info, some interesting stuff just popped up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;a href="http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/StarTrek09.htm"&gt; Another science review of the movie&lt;/a&gt;, making mostly the same points &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/08/ba-review-star-trek/"&gt;I did in my review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;a href="http://www.tnmc.org/The-Blog/star-trek-what-you-missed.html"&gt;Here’s an inside look at some of the things in the original script&lt;/a&gt; that didn’t make it into the movie. It’s an interesting peek at some of the things the writers were thinking that may give you insight into the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is for Mark Carbanaro, who thinks that calling this holiday &amp;quot;The Fourth of July&amp;quot; means a lack of patriotism.  He said in the &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/special_packages/summer_guide/14963834.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp"&gt;Merc this morning: &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We lose a certain acknowlegement as to what the meaning of the Declaration of Independence is and why our nation was founded when we just say "Happy Fourth of July."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbonaro speculates that the growing use of ``Fourth of July'' is
the result of a language prone to shy away from multisyllabic words and
an increasingly commercial culture.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/hurrah.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hurrah" title="Hurrah" src="http://lizditz.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/hurrah.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this business of referring to &amp;quot;the Fourth&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;Independence Day&amp;quot; has a long history, it seems.   James R. Heintze of American University. Washington, D.C. of has a &lt;a href="http://gurukul.american.edu/heintze/postcards.htm"&gt;whole page of late nineteenth and early twentieth century postcards --Fourth of July greetings.&lt;/a&gt;  Heintze maintains a database of &lt;a href="http://gurukul.american.edu/heintze/fourth.htm"&gt;Fourth of July celebrations&lt;/a&gt; and will shortly publish  &lt;a href="http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?isbn=0-7864-2777-9"&gt;The Encyclopedia of Fourth of July Celebrations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any rate, Independence Day or the Glorious Fourth, wishing you and yours a day of joy and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture may be Photoshopped, but the mobile does really exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Rob did indeed drive it around.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction wasn’t very pleasant.  You can hear the boos… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless he was running over cute puppies with the RV, the boos aren’t his fault.  All he’s doing is saying he’s “godless and proud.”  He’s arrogant as hell about it, yes, but no more so than a Christian who truly believes people are going to Hell if they don’t believe in the divinity of Jesus.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was entitled “OUR RELATIONS WITH HOMEOPATHY”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and was in response to speeches previously published regarding &lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“..prevailing professional laxity and charlatanry, in connection with the homeopathic quackery”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr McCormack had some pretty scathing things to say about homeopathy and its use by&lt;em&gt; “…shallow men and women…able to lure lucre by every imaginable wile from the sick and the silly”. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went on to say;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When patients are once secured, they are, ….retained by the combination of every current medical novelty which may at the time be most in favour with the &lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moneyed throng of quack-fanciers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“..&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;homoeopathy…is truly a combination of any and every available charlatanic trick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,…..and therefore all that remains for us, as men of science and men of integrity, is to give notice, that we exclude from all professional intercourse practitioners who are in any way engaged in using or upholding &lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a system which we think bears upon its very face fraud as well as absurdity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, pretty serious stuff. One might imagine you could now get sued for saying things like this, ala, the BCA and Simon Singh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But McCormack went further than this by listing a series of guidelines desscribing how clinicians who used or practiced homeopathy should be received by their medical colleagues;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333399"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;“1. That it is the opinion of this (Provincial) Association, that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;homoeopathy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;as propounded by Hahnemann, and practised by his followers, is so&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;utterly opposed to science and common sense&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;as well as so completely at variance with the experience of the Medical Profession, that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it ought to be in no way or degree practised&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;or countenanced &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;by any regularly educated medical practitioner&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333399"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;2. That&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;homoeopathic practitioners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;through the press, the platform, and the pulpit,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;have endeavoured to heap contempt upon the practice of Medicine and Surgery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;as followed by members of this Association, and by the profession at large.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;3. That for these reasons it is derogatory to the honour of members of this Association to hold any kind of professional intercourse with homoeopathic practitioners.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;4. That there are three classes of practitioners who ought not to be members of this Association, viz.-lst, real homeopathic practitioners; 2nd, those who practise homoeopathy in combination with other systems of treatment; and 3rd, those who under various pretences meet in consultation, or hold professional intercourse with those who practise homoeopathy”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To adopt resolutions setting forth that the &lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;homeopathic dogma and the doctrine of infinitesimal doses have no truthful basis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and are, in fact, mere &lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nonsensical delusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;…The worst part of homeopathy, is in my opinion, the DISHONESTY of the majority of those who live by it”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you go, homoeopathy, declared bullshit as early as 1851.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the full reference &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2544196"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#808080"&gt;Tip o’the hat to Jo Benhamu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Blogging has been very hard for me lately.  I love writing, but due to work and family mishegos it's been hard to keep up with the posting.  I'm hoping a stint up in the woods providing medical supervision to 400 souls will be rejuvenating.  While I'm gone, I'll leave you with some of my favorite posts about the human side of medicine.  I hope you enjoy reading them again, or for the first time.  --PalMD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love fountain pens,  but I'm far to busy for the regular ritual of cleaning, filling, etc.  Most of my day is spent scrawling notes or typing on a keyboard.  But there is one task for which only a fountain pen will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've lost a number of patients lately.  Most were in hospice, all were elderly, but it's always tough.  I take care of my patients until they die, including hospice care, so I often get to follow them on the journey from health to death.  Sometimes, great debility and dementia is a step on that journey. I've taken to writing short notes to the spouse of the deceased, to acknowledge the death, let them know I'm available, and remind them that I knew the patient on a personal level and appreciate the loss of a person, rather than just a patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just can't type a letter like that, and using some plastic throw-away pen doesn't seem appropriate.  I take a nice piece of office stationary, dip my pen, and write.  After signing the letter, I turn it and blot it on another sheet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subtle smears that are left by my mediocre penmanship create a clearly personal document, separating it from a generic communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There really aren't many more important tasks.  I don't mind brushing off my quirky 1957 Pelican once in a while.  One must always use the proper tool for the occasion.  While a patient lives, a stethoscope, clean hands, and a penlight are indispensable.  After they are gone, only a fountain pen will do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/fountain_pens.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/zdUpllfv6HI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246799157834"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=858">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f0020fab0656a837</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="homeopathy"/><title type="html">Homeopathy and Humor in Skepticism</title><published>2009-07-05T12:50:02Z</published><updated>2009-07-05T12:50:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=858" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had never heard of That Mitchell and Webb Look before - it’s a British comedy skit show featuring the comedy team of David Mitchell and Robert Webb. Fortunately we now have the wonders of the intertubes and we Americans can view their skits on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skit that is likely to go viral and vastly increase their profile in the US is this one - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMGIbOGu8q0&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;Homeopathy A&amp;amp;E&lt;/a&gt; (A&amp;amp;E does not stand for the Arts and Entertainment network, but Accident and Emergency - what we would call the ER or ED in the US).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They manage to pack a lot of wit and sarcasm into just a few minutes. They show homeopathy and related woo for what it is - a silly fiction, not worthy of  anything but ridicule. Here is the money quote - one physician comforting the other for killing all of his patients with serious diseases, says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“…when someone comes in with a vague﻿ sense of unease or a touch of the nerves, or even just more money than sense, we’ll be there for them, bottle of basically just water in one hand, and a huge invoice in the other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That just about sums up a huge chunk of so-called alternative medicine - the more benign part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skit also highlights for me the power of satire. It has the power to crystalize the essense of an argument or situation better than more straightforward forms of communication.  It can bring into clear focus the core hypocracy or absurdity of a situation. It also removes from claims that are silly at their core the cloak of legitimacy and respectability. That is a cloak that proponents of homeopathy desperately want, but don’t deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeopathy is a 200 year old pre-scientific notion that is derived from superstitious sympathetic magic - that “like cures like” because things have an “essence” that can be imbued. It also violates physics and chemistry by claiming that the more a substance is diluted the more powerful it becomes, even when diluted beyond the point where there is any difference between the solution and pure water (”bottle of basically just water”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to marshall rational and scientific arguments against homeopathy, to counter the claims of its proponents. But doing so also unintentionally grants homeopathy a patina of scientific legitimacy - it appears to the public as if it is something about which scientists can and do debate. So if some of these “scientists” say it works, maybe they’re the ones who are right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a conundrum in which scientific skeptics often find ourselves, and mostly we just ignore the researh that suggests that by engaging with pseudoscientists we legitamize them. One solution is to balance the serious scientific discussion with a bit of satire - to put the pseudoscience into perspective. We need to make it clear that we do not take things like homeopathy seriously. We look at it more as a menace to public health that needs to e dealt with, like a scientific curiosity - a cautionary tale about how horribly wrong human reasoning can go, and a “teaching moment” about logic and legitimate scientific methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some skeptics bristle at sarcasm and ridicule - they argue that it is off-putting and counterproductive. They have a point, but one that I think is often over-sold and misses the legitimate use of satire in dealing with the absurd. I prefer balance - say that homeopathy is absurd pre-scientific superstition, even make fun of those promoting it (not the average user, but the prominant promoters), but then explain in careful and thoughtful terms why homeopathy is implausible and that the clinical evidence shows it does not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of what is the most effective approach for skeptics to take in dealing with true-believers, promoters of nonsense, and pseudoscience in general is an admittedly complex one, and I don’t pretend to have definitive answers. That is why I’m OK with my skeptical colleagues taking different approaches to their skepticism. I don’t think there is one proven way to go about it, and various approaches seem to have their strengths and weaknesses. I am comfortable with the balance I and the SGU currently take - but we are also constantly monitoring feedback and listening to arguments on all sides so that perhaps we can improve our approach going forward. I also think the internal debate on this question is healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual skeptics should feel comfortable going with their strengths. Mitchell and Webb are professional comedians, and they have pulled of this bit of satire better than I ever could. Penn and Teller are also professional performers and excel at the “in your face” approach to skepticism. Tim Minchin uses music to spread reason. Others take a deliberately soft approach. I tend to take a somewhat academic approach (being an academic), while the Rogues each have their own style that we blend together on the SGU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all good.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246797910160"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/05/the-sunday-snog/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0d6ab1e58834a062</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="science of kissing"/><category term="The Sunday Snog"/><title type="html">The Sunday Snog</title><published>2009-07-05T12:18:09Z</published><updated>2009-07-05T12:18:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/05/the-sunday-snog/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2009/07/childkiss.jpg" title="childkiss.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2009/07/childkiss.jpg" alt="childkiss.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sheril Kirshenbaum</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246795587468"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/todays_carnivals_389.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/20082de0749f04dc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2009-07-05T12:04:27Z</published><updated>2009-07-05T12:04:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/ElKu9eQrUco/todays_carnivals_389.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/todays_carnivals_389.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Berry-Go-Round #18 is up on &lt;a href="http://foothillsfancies.blogspot.com/2009/06/summer-feast-at-berry-go-round.html" title=""&gt;Foothills Fancies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The official program was over but, instead of letting us all go home, the organizers did something better - a day trip on a boat to the island of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainau" title=""&gt;Mainau&lt;/a&gt; where, while still under the influence of the proceedings, the participants had a chance to relax and walk and chat and enjoy the nature. What a great way to finish the event!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lindau 015.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Lindau%20015.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the underlying theme of the meeting was the worry about Climate Change and sustainable development, it is quite fitting that the trip was on board of &lt;a href="http://www.sonnenkoenigin.com/" title=""&gt;MS Sonnenkönigin&lt;/a&gt;, a solar-powered ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lindau 016.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Lindau%20016.jpg" width="336" height="448"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was also an opportunity for some friendly rivalry between the province of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria" title=""&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;, where Lindau is, and &lt;a href="http://www.baden-wuerttemberg.de/" title=""&gt;Baden-Württemburg&lt;/a&gt; where the island of Mainau is located (the griffin and the elk are the provincial symbols).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lindau 017.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Lindau%20017.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boat trip was the opportunity for the province of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg" title=""&gt;Baden-Württemburg&lt;/a&gt; to showcase their own investments into science and technology, as well as their efforts towards a more sustainable and ecologically friendly economy. The second deck of the ship had a number of computer stations, each highlighting one of their universities, institutes or companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lindau 018.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Lindau%20018.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The province's minister for science and arts gave a brief note to the passengers, explaining the geological history of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Constance" title=""&gt;Lake Constance&lt;/a&gt;, a little bit of history of the province and the highlights of their investment into science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lindau 021.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Lindau%20021.jpg" width="336" height="448"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we boarded the ship at 8am, the champagne and beer were served immediately. I stuck to coffee on the morning ride. And sausages, of course. The trip is about an hour and half long, so there was plenty of time for me to go to all three decks and the roof, to catch a few more "victims" for my minute-long video interviews, to catch and have a few minutes of relaxed conversations with a couple of Nobel laureates, and to enjoy the music program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lindau 023.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Lindau%20023.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lindau 019.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Lindau%20019.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lindau 020.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Lindau%20020.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The most gratuitous error was the headline for the main article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dawkins sets up kids’ camp to groom atheists&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only was &lt;strong&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; running the camp (he only made a small donation to it), it most certainly does not “groom atheists.”  It encourages them to think for themselves and does not guide them toward a godless conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, today, they finally &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article6637768.ece"&gt;published a rebuttal letter&lt;/a&gt; from Dawkins himself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Your article &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article6591236.ece"&gt;Dawkins Sets Up Kids’ Camp to Groom Atheists&lt;/a&gt; (News, last week) begins with the Jesuitical opening line: “Give Richard Dawkins a child for a week’s summer camp and he will try to give you an atheist for life.” Camp Quest, is not inspired by me or influenced by me. The British version, run by Samantha Stein, follows the American model founded by Edwin and Helen Kagin, of Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave the following quote to Lois Rogers: “Camp Quest encourages children to think for themselves, sceptically and rationally. There is no indoctrination, just encouragement to be open-minded, while having fun.” Isn’t that about as far from Jesuitical grooming as you could imagine? One of my dominant motivations is an abhorrence of childhood indoctrination, of atheism just as much as of religion. It is in this spirit that the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science has made very modest contributions to Camp Quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;br&gt;
Oxford
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the other letters appear to have been written by people who took the articles at face value and assume Camp Quest is some sort of atheist-indoctrination camp.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least Dawkins corrected the record.  If the paper issued a public apology, that’d be even better.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If extradited to the US, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/whats_going_to_happen_to_gary_mckinnon"&gt;McKinnon&lt;/a&gt; faces a trial of eight counts of computer fraud. He could potentially serve 60 years in jail in New Jersey and pay a $250,000 fine. McKinnon has been fighting his &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/gary_mckinnon_to_be_tried_in_the_us"&gt;extradition&lt;/a&gt;, in the hopes that, if he remains in the UK, he might receive a lighter sentence. In August of 2008, he was &lt;a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/28/aspergers-added-to-british-hackers-defense/?scp=4&amp;amp;sq=gary%20mckinnon&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. Experts including Professor &lt;a href="http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/arc/staff_member.asp?id=33"&gt;Simon Baron-Cohen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/"&gt;Autism Research Centre&lt;/a&gt; have stated that extraditing and imprisoning McKinnon in the US will "&lt;a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2009/06/08/236334/pentagon-hacker-mckinnon-launches-legal-challenge.htm"&gt;exacerbate his autism, leading to psychosis and even suicide&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A July 3rd &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1197190/They-let-terrorists-stay-send-boy--whos-timid-use-Tube--terrible-U-S-jail-ALLISON-PEARSON-meets-McKinnons.html?ITO=1490"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt; interview with McKinnon and his mother, Janis Sharp, makes a strong case for keeping him in his own country. McKinnon was arrested in March of 2002 by the UK's High-Tech Crime Unit and "confessed to everything," without asking for a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Janis is the first to admit her son has done wrong. 'I think he was incredibly stupid and he should be tried in a British court for his crimes,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also believes that Gary unwittingly did the Americans a good turn. 'What if a real terrorist had got into those military systems? What if Gary hadn't alerted them? To be honest, I think the people who were in charge of security should be arrested, not Gary.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What no one could have foreseen was that Gary would become a casualty of the controversial 2005 UK-U.S. extradition treaty. Signed by David Blunkett, the treaty was, quite outrageously, never debated in Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms, American prosecutors do not have to show any evidence to get the UK to hand over one of its people. Americans who Britain wants to extradite get far more protection from their government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While McKinnon's Asperger diagnosis is recent, his mother notes that he was &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; .....talking by ten months. Aged two, he liked to have conversations about the stars and the planets. When he was eight, Janis came home to find Gary playing the Moonlight Sonata. He had taught himself the piano while she was out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary was always fanatical about order and being logical. If there were mushrooms for tea, he would cut each one into 12 (he still does). But he was expelled from junior school because he would wander home whenever he felt like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a normal household, Gary's behaviour would have rung alarm bells. In the Sharps' easy-going setup, he was just accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'He had so many good qualities - gentle, kind and sort of innocent,' Janis says. 'Neighbours thought he was wonderful because he'd carry old ladies' shopping.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In case you think his mother's faith in his innocence is misplaced, the police who took away Gary's computer said it was the only one they had ever confiscated that didn't contain pornography.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say, that detail about McKinnon being expelled from school because he "would wander home whenever he felt like it" strikes a resonant chord in me. There's no way that Charlie could wander out of his middle school---there is always an aide with him---but &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_time_of_perpetual_transitions_adolescence"&gt;adolescence&lt;/a&gt; being the tough time it has been for him, I have a feeling there are times when he might wish he could just wander rather than being &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/still_a_long_way_to_go_with_idea"&gt;cooped up in a classroom&lt;/a&gt;. The main thing that comes through in the &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1197190/They-let-terrorists-stay-send-boy--whos-timid-use-Tube--terrible-U-S-jail-ALLISON-PEARSON-meets-McKinnons.html?ITO=1490"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt; interview (granted it is a paper like the &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1197190/They-let-terrorists-stay-send-boy--whos-timid-use-Tube--terrible-U-S-jail-ALLISON-PEARSON-meets-McKinnons.html?ITO=1490"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;) is Janis Sharp's unwavering support and love for her son, now and throughout his life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/03/mail_mckinnon_campaign/"&gt;Daily Mail has indeed launched a campaign&lt;/a&gt; in support of McKinnon; details &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1165337/Stop-MPs-Gravy-Train---Sign-Mail-Sunday-petition.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246785146843"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_quotes_342.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3822bb40583f789e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-07-05T09:05:04Z</published><updated>2009-07-05T09:05:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/F7QKlSYjIK4/clock_quotes_342.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_quotes_342.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes you gotta create what you want to be a part of. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NECSS (pronounced “nexus”) was born out of the desire to hold a major skeptical gathering on the East Coast of the United States, specifically in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://www.necsscon.org/about.htm"&gt;NECSS website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As its name suggests, NECSS seeks to explore the intersection of science, media, education, politics, and popular culture, and examine how we may best utilize that understanding to promote a more rational world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NECSS is produced by the New England Skeptical Society and New York City Skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2009 line-up of speakers and panelists includes:&lt;/p&gt;

And why do some people turn to God for help while others take comfort in drugs and alcohol?&lt;br&gt;"These are just some of the questions I wanted to consider... And I wasn't looking for answers."&lt;br&gt;The research also found 55 per cent of young people are not bothered about religion and 60 per cent only go to church for a wedding or christening.&lt;br&gt;Only three out of 10 teenagers believe in an afterlife and 41 per cent believe that nothing happens to your body when you die, but one in 10 reckon they come back as an animal or another human being.&lt;br&gt;A Church of England spokesman said: "Many teenagers aren't sure what they believe at that stage of their lives, as is clear from the number who said they don't know whether they believe in God.&lt;br&gt;"On the other hand many of these results point to the great spirituality of young people today that the Church is seeking to respond to through new forms of worship alongside tradition ones."&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanne Stinson, chief executive of The British Humanist Association, said: "It confirms that young people - like adults - do not need a religion to have positive values.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;"The 'golden rule', which is often claimed by religions as a religious value, is in reality a shared human value - shared by all the major religions and the non-religious and almost every culture - that predates all the major world religions." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Telegraph Media Group Limited 2009]&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-8919066600942827608?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an interview with Simon about his upcoming Australian tour, listen to the Skeptic zone episode 37, available on the &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.tv/"&gt;website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction by Professor David Day, Dean of the Faculty of Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prince Charles is a staunch defender and millions of people swear by it, but most doctors consider alternative medicine to be little more than superstition and a waste of money. And whilst much of this ‘medicine’ is sold on the High Street and on the internet, does it really work and is it safe? Indeed, does it even matter as long as patients are satisfied with the end results? Welcome to the world of alternative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presenting the conclusions of his book &lt;em&gt;Trick or Treatment?&lt;/em&gt;, co-authored with Professor Edzard Ernst, the world’s first professor of complementary medicine, Singh relies on the large amount of scientific evidence that has been accumulated to investigate which alternative therapies are safe and effective, and which are useless and even downright dangerous. From acupuncture to homeopathy, from herbal medicine to Hopi ear candling, Singh will also look at the origins of these therapies, their rapid growth in popularity and their supposed modes of action. Singh’s conclusions about effectiveness vary from good to bad (including downright dangerous), so he will discuss why so many ineffective alternative therapies have become so popular, and will consider how those that have been shown to be effective can be incorporated within conventional medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simon Singh&lt;/strong&gt; received his PhD in particle physics from the University of Cambridge before embarking on a career as a science journalist. He joined the BBC in 1991 and worked as a director and producer on programmes such as &lt;em&gt;Tomorrow’s world&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Horizon.&lt;/em&gt; His documentary about Fermat’s last theorem won a BAFTA, and this also became the subject of his first book. He has also written &lt;em&gt;The Code Book&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Big Bang&lt;/em&gt;. He has presented &lt;em&gt;The Science of Secrecy&lt;/em&gt; on Channel 4, &lt;em&gt;Mind Games&lt;/em&gt; on BBC 4 and &lt;em&gt;Five Numbers&lt;/em&gt; on Radio 4. His most recent book is &lt;em&gt;Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial.&lt;/em&gt; Singh is currently being sued for libel by the British Chiropractic Association for an article published in the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; newspaper about the use of chiropractic to treat childhood conditions. (You can read the full article &lt;a href="http://svetlana14s.narod.ru/Simon_Singhs_silenced_paper.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Singh is in Australia as a guest of the &lt;a href="http://www.adelaidefestivalofideas.com.au/"&gt;Adelaide Festival of Ideas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.riaustralia.org.au/centric/home.jsp"&gt;The Royal Institution of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, and his visit to Sydney is supported by the &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.tv/"&gt;Skeptic Zone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/index.html"&gt;Australian Skeptics.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A to pt. B serving in the US Navy as a Quartermaster.  I was drawn to the navigation when I joined.  In my opinion, it is the only job in the military that is both a science and an art  Celestial navigation has been something I have become profoundly interested in since I joined ten years ago.  In this age of GPS, it is, in my opinion  more important now than ever for Navigators to remain proficient in the old ways to fix a ship’s position using a sextant and trigonometry.  My tattoo is the visual depiction of how to plot a line of position from a celestial body using the altitude intercept method, a method which has been time tested for more than a century.  For me it serves as a reminder that while technology improves, the sea remains an unpredictable place and it is up to the older generation to teach the younger the old school ways of doing business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it was a spirit. I was  a young teen, maybe 13.  In the dark of night, something caused  me to waken.   Moonlight poured through a window covered only by  thin yellow curtains, giving the room a honey-colored glow.  The  house was built in the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, and like many  small houses of that time, the room had doorways on either side, one  leading into a living area and the other into an adjacent bedroom. My little brother was gently snoring on the adjacent bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother stood near the foot of the  bed, wearing the simple cotton housecoats that she preferred in hot  summers.  Her hand on her chest, she was muttering, or perhaps  moaning. I could not tell if she was speaking words, but I sensed  she was in distress, or pain.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jrefmail@randi.org (Naomi Baker)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246769184810"><id gr:original-id="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/?p=1809">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/96fb8c85dcc1c5c0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><category term="Insects &amp; Arachnids"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">First on the Scene</title><published>2009-07-05T04:25:23Z</published><updated>2009-07-05T04:25:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/07/05/first-on-the-scene/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/" type="html">The other day I was out in the garden taking pictures when a shiny green fly caught my attention.  Green bottle flies (Diptera, family Calliphoridae, genus Lucilia) are a bit larger than the ordinary house fly.  The adults feed on nectar and are pollinators, but because of their life histories, they fill some really interesting [...]&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=qw88nb88.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=240321&amp;amp;post=1809&amp;amp;subd=qw88nb88&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1"&gt;</summary><author><name>andrea</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/feed/</id><title type="html">Andrea&amp;#39;s Buzzing About:</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246762911217"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/the_lark-mouse_and_the_prometh.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6291aef1a7a51e87</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Tutorials"/><title type="html">The Lark-Mouse and the Prometheus-Mouse</title><published>2009-07-05T02:05:31Z</published><updated>2009-07-05T02:05:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/sI5_7P95x7s/the_lark-mouse_and_the_prometh.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/the_lark-mouse_and_the_prometh.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;div style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://bpr3.org/?p=52"&gt;&lt;img alt="Blogging on Peer-Reviewed Research" src="http://bpr3.org/images/rbicons/ResearchBlogging-Medium-White.png" width="80" height="50"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/02/the_larkmouse_and_the_promethe.php" title="The Lark-Mouse and the Prometheus-Mouse"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Lark-Mouse and the Prometheus-Mouse" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2006/06/ClockWeb%20logo2.JPG" width="104" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Two interesting papers came out last week [&lt;em&gt;from the Archives - click on the clock logo to see the original post&lt;/em&gt;], both using transgenic mice to ask important questions about circadian organization in mammals.

&lt;p&gt;Each group receives a plaque and a cash reward.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/node/2557"&gt;Here are this year’s winners&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Service Project&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.sffosu.org/"&gt;Students for Freethought&lt;/a&gt; at The Ohio State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… They took the idea to their own group and immediately started planning a similar, week-long trip to help rebuilding efforts in New Orleans.  But they weren’t content to stop there!  They organized their trip to line up with the [University of Illinois&amp;#39;] trip in the spring of 2009, and the groups met up in New Orleans!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the success of their spring break trip, SFF leaders then organized a second service project: a three-day camping trip to help improve and maintain the Pine Mountain Trail: putting up trail markers, installing bear poles (to keep bears from eating campers’ food!), and generally cleaning and maintaining the trail through the Appalachians.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Website&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://saneatberkeley.org/"&gt;Students for A Nonreligious Ethos (SANE)&lt;/a&gt; at Berkeley University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… The overall design is simple and uncluttered, making it easy to zero in on the information you need and navigate the site at a glance.  The blog-style main feed features upcoming events and reviews of recent activities, updated almost once a week.  From the front page, it’s easy to find upcoming events, get information about meeting times and locations, and quickly navigate to other areas of the site.  Contacting the group is handled by a spam-filtering webform, and there’s an easy link to subscribe to their mailing list.  The FAQ handles common questions in a light-hearted, fun manner.  The site features pictures of the group’s recent activities and links to other organizations, information about the group and more — all while maintaining organization and ease of use.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Media Coverage/Letter to the Editor&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://guelphskeptics.freethoughtassociation.ca/"&gt;Pastafarians&lt;/a&gt; at the University of South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Pastafarians @ USC have received a wide range of media attention this year.  They began with their school newspaper, which covered president Andrew Cederdahl’s &lt;a href="http://media.www.dailygamecock.com/media/storage/paper247/news/2009/03/30/News/Student.Receives.Atheism.Scholarship-3686930.shtml"&gt;Founder’s Scholarship&lt;/a&gt;  from American Atheists, &lt;a href="http://media.www.dailygamecock.com/media/storage/paper247/news/2009/02/13/News/Darwin.Day.Debate.Attracts.Large.Crowd-3629040.shtml"&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://media.www.dailygamecock.com/media/storage/paper247/news/2009/02/13/Viewpoints/Pastafarians.Make.Impact.With.Debate-3628589.shtml"&gt;praised&lt;/a&gt;  the group’s Darwin Day debate (Dan Barker v. Kyle Butt), and included several &lt;a href="http://media.www.dailygamecock.com/media/storage/paper247/news/2009/01/22/Viewpoints/In.Your.Opinion-3592371.shtml"&gt;opinion pieces&lt;/a&gt;  regarding the group, its &lt;a href="http://media.www.dailygamecock.com/media/storage/paper247/news/2009/02/16/Viewpoints/To.Change.A.Life.First.Change.Tactics-3630877.shtml"&gt;message&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://media.www.dailygamecock.com/media/storage/paper247/news/2008/11/20/Viewpoints/Evolution.Creationism.Should.Share.Class.Exposure-3553319.shtml"&gt;tactics&lt;/a&gt;, both supportive and critical.  Their media attention spread beyond campus when local news station WISTV featured the group’s sold-out &lt;a href="http://www.wistv.com/Global/story.asp?s=9838569"&gt;Darwin Day debate&lt;/a&gt;.  Another local channel &lt;a href="http://www.wltx.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=73632&amp;amp;catid=35"&gt;featured the group&lt;/a&gt; while discussing the recent ARIS survey results.  ABC Columbia focused on the group in a series called &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.abccolumbia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=4008:hidden-atheists&amp;amp;catid=56:hidden-columbia&amp;amp;Itemid=75"&gt;Hidden Columbia&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; and group leader Andrew Cederdahl was interviewed on &lt;a href="http://cdn2.libsyn.com/ffrf/FTradio_156_041809.mp3?nvb=20090515174252&amp;amp;nva=20090516175252&amp;amp;t=0c5763403ab029b193c7e"&gt;Freethought Radio&lt;/a&gt;.  Last — but certainly not least — the group was featured in a front page story in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, “&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/us/27atheist.html?_r=1&amp;amp;scp=2&amp;amp;sq=atheists&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;More Atheists Shout It From the Rooftops&lt;/a&gt;“…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best New Affiliate&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=34367344446"&gt;American University Rationalists &amp;amp; Atheists&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The American Univereity Rationalists &amp;amp; Atheists (AURA) kicked off its first year with a call-out meeting with over 30 students in attendance.  They’ve taken a field trip to see Bill Maher’s Religulous, hosted a well-attended dialogue with a christian student organization, welcomed speakers Dan Barker and Ellery Schempp, fed students at a Flying Spaghetti Monster Dinner and hosted a free comedy show on their campus.  They were featured in their school’s student newspaper when they challenged their university’s commencement invocation.  These activities, combined with student-led presentations and discussion meetings, are the components of a great year for AURA!…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Overall Affiliate&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://saiu.org/"&gt;Secular Alliance of Indiana University&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Secular Alliance at Indiana University started just over a year ago, but you’d never guess it from their numbers.  They started their semester with a visit from atheist author John Loftus.  They then organized a group field trip to the Creation Museum in Petersburg, KY, and collaborated to make a video of their trip, which you can see on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/ext/share.php?sid=39236398929&amp;amp;h=-2Mrn&amp;amp;u=pXHgC"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.  This semester they met with other freethought groups in Indiana and have spearheaded the &lt;a href="http://inatheistbus.org/"&gt;Indiana Atheist Bus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which already has “You can be good without God” ads on buses in several cities across the state.  They have garnered 200 members in just one school year, have built an effective and eye-catching &lt;a href="http://saiu.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, and have applied for office space for their group in the fall!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not too late to support the SSA; your donations will be matched by the Vital Spark Foundation!&lt;/p&gt;

Bring all of them.” Into the backpack tumbled the detailed plastic zebra, gorilla, giraffe, lions (male and female), and tiger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/07/animals.jpg" alt="animals" width="107" height="127"&gt;These hard plastic figures about four or five inches long or tall (except the giraffe), with detailed painted faces and molded texture. Alex has all the animals mentioned above, plus a butterfly, a couple of chickens, assorted less-detailed barnyard critters from cheaper sets, and elephants in three sizes (and three different moods, judging from the open roaring mouths and raging tusks). Sometimes the makers of these toys will sell the same animal in several poses; you can, for instance, buy a cougar merely walking or a cougar with one paw raised and claws extended. They go for about $8 a pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex almost got the cougar a few weeks ago in a hobby store, except on the way to the registers he ripped off the tag and anyway he’d gotten a giraffe or something just a day before. “Bear? Bear?” Alex kept calling the cougar. We would correct him. “Bear? Bear?” he’d say again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex has had buying jags before (no, now that you mention it: jaguars has never been one of the animals he buys). Books in bookstores, chocolate bars in grocery stores. He’s also had jags of lining up the stuff he buys, such as Scrabble letters. Once he lined up the Scrabble letters to spell “L-I-Q-U-O-R-S”, and another time he lined them up to spell “B-R-O-N-X Z-O-O.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alex, bring your animals! Bring them all!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured, what a chance! Hold the realistic plastic animal up to the glass and see the real thing right behind it! Don’t tell me I’m not a good autism dad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t, however, ignite as I thought it might. He liked Tiger Mountain — amazing how BIG those cats are — but the gorillas and the elephants and the giraffes weren’t nearly as interesting to Alex as the “Paper! Paper!” he kept wanting. Turns out this was a zoo map, as I learned when we passed an information booth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how deep does Alex’s animal attraction run? He did select only the plastic tiger from his backpack to hold with the map on the subway ride home. And in the coffee shop, he insisted on every animal on the table, with the map, over his chicken fingers. How deep does Alex’s animal attraction run? Who can say, as usual?&lt;/p&gt;

Having noted that we're &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_fireworks_for_our_4th"&gt;skipping the fireworks&lt;/a&gt;, I thought I'd sound a more Fourth of July-y note. Today is the last day to sign the action to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/tell_president_obama_to_fully_fund_idea"&gt;Tell President Obama to Fully Fund IDEA&lt;/a&gt;. There are currently 1203 signatures----I had set the signature goal originally at 500 and it's been something beyond marvelous to see how many people have signed the petition. Actually, I have to say that knowing so many people support the right to students with disabilities for an appropriate education calls for some........&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Virtual (and therefore &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_fireworks_for_our_4th"&gt;quiet and not excessively over-stimulating&lt;/a&gt;) fireworks!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before putting your feet up to watch the parades and celebrations with a glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done: Have you &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/ask_your_congressperson_to_support_the_idea_fairness_restoration_act"&gt;asked your Congressperson to support the IDEA Fairness Restoration Act&lt;/a&gt;?  Or told the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/tell_the_st_lucie_county_school_district_to_respect_the_rights_of_students_with_disabilities"&gt;St. Lucie County School District to respect the rights of students with disabilities&lt;/a&gt;?  If not yet, pleased &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/ask_your_congressperson_to_support_the_idea_fairness_restoration_act"&gt;do&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/tell_the_st_lucie_county_school_district_to_respect_the_rights_of_students_with_disabilities"&gt;it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've still a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/still_a_long_way_to_go_with_idea"&gt;long way to go&lt;/a&gt; to provide students with disabilities with the education they need to help them learn, grow, and achieve and be all that they can; we've still a long long way to go to support individuals with disabilities of all ages (though Dora noted &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/cil_budget_cuts_reversed--victory_in_nj"&gt;one victory&lt;/a&gt; this week and in my own home in the Garden State). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the Fourth of July today; it's Independence Day. Teaching Charlie to talk, to take care of his own needs, and so much more----these are how we've tried to set down the roots of independence for him. We're not at all sure how "independent" Charlie will be able to be as far as his living situation and even his ability to communicate his needs and thoughts. It also should be noted that our "&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_the_autismfront"&gt;tight team of three&lt;/a&gt;" 's life with autism has as much a lesson about interdependence. From something I wrote &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/the-meaning-of-independence/"&gt;last Fourth of July&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How independent are many of us, anyways? My mother-in-law has long feared to do anything on her own; she doesn’t even pick up the phone, but waits for someone else to do it, and rarely ventures outside the house without her husband. My 102-year-old grandmother, Ngin Ngin, has always lived among others, many others; after her children had grown up and moved out and my grandfather, Yeh Yeh, had died in 1975, there were always families newly arrived from China in her house, always elderly women—”old friends,” really distant relatives by marriage—sitting at the table with us. I can’t say that Ngin Ngin was “totally independent”: Not knowing English, or how to read and write any language, she was limited and has lived all of her life (since she came to the US in the 1920’s) in Oakland’s Chinatown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s not independence we need to be thinking and planning so much for, as about acknowledging how dependent we are on each other, how we need to live in community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly I'm glad to be spending my Independence Day with my favorite little community, our little family---that tight team of three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's something to celebrate with (quiet) fireworks (in soothing hues of blue and grey) every single day!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246751437353"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/lindau_nobel_conference_-_thur.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fddfcae63689dd0f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Lindau09"/><title type="html">Lindau Nobel conference - Thursday</title><published>2009-07-05T00:16:38Z</published><updated>2009-07-05T00:16:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/SyU5cbJmlWE/lindau_nobel_conference_-_thur.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/lindau_nobel_conference_-_thur.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thursday morning was the Biofluorescence morning, with lectures by the three most recent Nobelists who received their prize for the discovery and first uses of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and its derivatives that glow in other colors. It's hard to think of an animal that is as non-model in the lab as jellyfish and a discovery as important and useful for modern biological research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike PZ who was a diligent liveblogger in the conference hall, I watched all three lectures from the press room, livestreamed on my laptop, while multitasking and generally enjoying the perks of being "Press" (continuous supplies of coffee, juices and fresh fruit, in addition to multitudes of power cords and good wifi). I am happy to report that all three talks were very good, exciting and thought-provoking. &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.de/lindaunobel/2009/07/a-manycolored-glass-the-glow-of-life-and-the-joy-of-discovery.php" title=""&gt;Ashutosh&lt;/a&gt; covered all three talks in great detail in his post.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Firts to go was &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/LaureateDetails.AxCMS?UserID=10891" title=""&gt;Prof. Dr. Osamu Shimomura&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://eurovision3.feedroom.com/index.jsp?auto_band=x&amp;amp;rf=sv&amp;amp;fr_story=cf6aabfa38beda8d27515a35928b9a1f9836046d&amp;amp;skin=showcase" title=""&gt;watch the video&lt;/a&gt;. Then came &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/LaureateDetails.AxCMS?UserID=10342" title=""&gt;Prof. Dr. Martin Chalfie&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://eurovision3.feedroom.com/index.jsp?auto_band=x&amp;amp;rf=sv&amp;amp;fr_story=2e8fd65bc9c559660259217d14eb52d8776831a3&amp;amp;skin=showcase" title=""&gt;watch the video&lt;/a&gt; and read &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/martin_chalfie_gfp_and_after.php" title=""&gt;PZ's post&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, it was the turn for &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/LaureateDetails.AxCMS?UserID=10341" title=""&gt;Prof. Dr. Roger Y. Tsien&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://eurovision3.feedroom.com/index.jsp?auto_band=x&amp;amp;rf=sv&amp;amp;fr_story=b93f0e3acf454a238de7b158b59a1695661944c2&amp;amp;skin=showcase" title=""&gt;watch the video&lt;/a&gt; and see &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/roger_y_tsien_building_and_bre.php" title=""&gt;PZ's post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were the most biological talks, thus I could understand them in full. On the other hand, the next talk by Richard Schrock was so technical that I did not understand a word (and gave up listening after a couple of minutes). As someone &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/olchemist/statuses/2434831718" title=""&gt;noted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;: "Schrock gives the same talk to the broad audience in Lindau that he also presented at the EuCOMC to organometallic specialists". I bet even some of the chemistry students in the audience had trouble understanding the talk, let alone the non-chemists there, e.g., the press, bloggers, dignitaries, guests, politicos, local aristocracy, etc. I could see that he is a really nice guy, and that he is a super-star of chemistry, and that his discoveries are really, truly innovative and useful, but I was hoping he would adopt his talk to his audience a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last talk of the meeting was the only real disappointment for me. It was a talk with a provocative title (and Abstract) of &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/AbstractDetails.AxCMS?AbstractID=329" title=""&gt;Molecular Darwinism&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/LaureateDetails.AxCMS?UserID=6752" title=""&gt;Prof. Dr. Werner Arber&lt;/a&gt;. This time I think PZ was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/werner_arber_molecular_darwini.php" title=""&gt;too nice&lt;/a&gt; to the guy (beer, sausages and strudel will do that you, soften you, here in Bavaria).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what was the talk about? It was an undergraduate-level introduction to evolution. And that would be fine if it was a good undergraduate-level introduction to evolution. But...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simplifying things is a good thing. Oversimplifying makes it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Arber was doing was "inventing" terms. Or, to be precise, he was reinventing and mixing up terms. He was using existing terminology in biological science and applying it to wrong concepts. Confusion ensues. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Acquired" has a meaning in biology - but not the one he is using. The word "acquired" is used when discussing acquired characteristics, in Lamarckian sense. But he was using it to describe a process that has a perfectly good name already: "horizontal transfer".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Molecular evolution" is also a term that has a specific meaning - use of the molecular clock to measure philogenetic relationships and distances between species. Not all evolution is molecular evolution. Phenotypes evolve, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, evolution does not equal natural selection. Natural selection is one of the important processes of evolution, but not the only one (random drift, neutral evolution, sexual selection...are all very important and wide-spread). If &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Larry&lt;/a&gt; was there, his head would explode in the face of such raw display of selectionism and adaptationism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, "evolution genes" have nothing to do with "genes for evolution". There is a large and vibrant literature on Evolution of Evolvability, but it does not appear Arber is familiar with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no, your work that you got your Nobel for is NOT the central piece in the evolutionary theory no matter how hard you are trying to make the case for it, sorry. Restriction enzymes are the awesomest and even I used them as much as I never really did any molecular biology. They are an indispensable tool for the entire discipline. But they are not an important factor in evolution itself - just the part of the machinery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, please do not ever use the word "Darwinism". It is only used by Creationists (and journalists who don't know any better) to imply that we are all some kind of idol-worshippers, memorizing the Origin as if it was a bible. What I am trying to say is that a careful use of words is essential for communicating science. Careless use of one term to denote something else that already has a different name is confusing, misleading and irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That one poor lecture, of course, did not put a blemish on the rest of the meeting, all the amazing talks, panels and social events.I just re-read a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/10/the_nobel_prize_conundrum.php" title=""&gt;very interesting post of mine&lt;/a&gt; about the whole "Nobel conundrum" - the pros and cons and effects of Nobel Prizes, and I muse on various aspects of it. This meeting made me rethink some of those same questions again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At many meetings, scientific superstars of that stature fly in, give a talk, have the dinner with the organizers, and fly out. This meeting is different - it is specifically designed to get superstars to mix and mingle with young researchers. While the talks are uber-traditional lectures in format - not even followed by Q &amp;amp; A sessions! - there were plenty of organized sessions for young people to spend time talking to the laureates, ask questions, discuss things (those meetings were closed to the press, to give them complete feeling of freedom). While the youngsters may have come in wide-eyed and idol-worshipping, they must have left with a different feeling: that Nobelists are humans, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another take-home lesson from every laureate was that one needs to be a complete human. Not just a scientist. Not just a self-slave-driver in the lab. But also to have other interests and hobbies, and perhaps be involved in some kind of activism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it was noted many times this week that these people made their discoveries while in very small labs, struggling with funding, working on highly unusual things. They did not come out of large expensive research labs (though many of them run such places now) doing regular science. Perhaps there is something structurally different about a small lab that gives a young student freedom to follow one's hunches that is made difficult by the complexity and hierarchy in a large, well-funded place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobel prizes did not get awarded for science that had to be done incrementaly over many years. Most discoveries were made during brief bursts of activity - 2-3 years perhaps. A young researcher had to be at a right place, at a right time, to see what everyone's seen before but, for a change, actually notice it, and to come to it with a prepared mind. Luck and creativity and thinking outside the box produce the prizes, not many years of slogging in the lab. But most of the science that has to be done includes slogging in the lab. It's just there should be joy in doing it without an expectation that a Prize may come your way one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events done, we went out to relax, have some famous Bavarian beer (again) - a couple of pictures under the fold:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/lindau_nobel_conference_-_thur.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/lindau_nobel_conference_-_thur.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/SyU5cbJmlWE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246751437352"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_44.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b2619124ffc7fa5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">New and Exciting in PLoS this week</title><published>2009-07-04T22:18:54Z</published><updated>2009-07-04T22:18:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/b99_rk_cPMY/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_44.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_44.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Just trying to catch up with the publicartions in various PLoS Journals this past week. Here are some interesting titles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, you should &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/04/28/rating-articles-in-plos-one/" title=""&gt;rate the articles&lt;/a&gt;, post &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/04/07/why-post-comments-on-plos-one/" title=""&gt;notes and comments&lt;/a&gt; and send &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/05/04/the-how-and-why-of-trackbacks/" title=""&gt;trackbacks&lt;/a&gt; when you blog about the papers.  You can now also easily place articles on various social services (CiteULike, Mendeley, Connotea, Stumbleupon, Facebook and Digg) with just one click. Here are my own picks for the week - you go and look for your own favourites:&lt;br&gt;

I was an ardent atheist for a number of years, but gradually came to believe that the theistic worldview and the arguments for it are more consistent with my experience of the world and my philosophic intuitions (which we all rely upon when thinking these things through). I've changed my mind in the past, and I'm certainly open to doing it again in the future. I don't think that my position is rationally coercive, but I do think that it's rational, just as I would say (and I presume John would agree) that the arguments for atheism aren't rationally coercive, but atheism is rational. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/07/christian-faith-makes-person-stupid_02.html?showComment=1246732373806#c5647210530545246700"&gt;LINK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;First off I really appreciate Eric's honesty and willingness to consider his faith to be in error. Not many believers will say what he did, and for that I find it a joy to discuss these issues with him, even if we both think the other person is wrong. &lt;strong&gt;Kudos to him!&lt;/strong&gt; Can I say the same thing? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Am I open to the possibility that I'm wrong? Well, it depends on the question. If the question is whether there was a supernatural force or being who may have created a quantum wave fluctuation which caused this universe to spring into existence as his last act before dying, then yes, I could be wrong. Such a being might have existed. Nor am I 100% sure no supernatural force or being exists now. But if the question is whether evangelical Christianity is true or many other moderate to liberal versions of that faith, then yes, I am very sure. Do I think there is a slightest chance that I might be wrong about Christianity? No. In fact, I am so sure I'm right that I'm willing to risk being thrown into hell for all of eternity. I think this says a lot about how assured I am that I'm correct.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being said, do I think arguments for atheism aren't rationally coercive? Yes, that's what I think. Let me explain by defining the words &lt;em&gt;"atheism"&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;"rationally"&lt;/em&gt; as well as what it means for something to be &lt;em&gt;"coercive"&lt;/em&gt;. These distinctions need to be fleshed out to see why I say this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the word “atheism” means “metaphysical naturalism,” as Eric and many Christian theists equate the terms, then I do not think “metaphysical naturalism” is “coercive” in the sense that the evidence compels people to accept it. One could affirm deism, or the philosopher’s god. If the word "atheism" is defined as simply "the lack of a belief in God," then that too is not rationally coercive, if for no other reason but that rational people disagree (as I'll explain later when it comes to the word "rationally"). I do think that &lt;em&gt;agnosticism&lt;/em&gt; is rationally coercive, if by that we mean a skeptical method for assessing truth claims. We should all be agnostics in the Huxleyan sense. I also think &lt;em&gt;agnosticism&lt;/em&gt; is rationally coercive if by that we mean the view that we just don't know why the universe exists (known as "soft-agnosticism"). We must all admit this is the default positon before making any positive claims about the origins of existence. I just happen to think this kind of agnosticism leads us to atheism though, as defined in either sense above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to what it is that makes a person reasonable or “rational,” this is a complex topic. If people can only be considered rational if they are correct, then there are a few serious problems to be dealt with which cannot be satisfactorily answered. For one, how is it possible for a rational person to change his mind and still be considered a rational person both before and after changing his mind? Did he all of a sudden become rational because he changed his mind for the truth, or did he become irrational because he changed his mind and is now wrong? Besides, how do we describe what it means to be rational when all of us are surely right about some things and yet wrong about other things? Are we just rationally schizophrenic human beings? Furthermore, how can we tell when someone is rational if being rational means being correct, since everyone is influenced by non-rational emotional factors having to do with what William James described as our &lt;em&gt;passionate natures&lt;/em&gt;? If we are to judge whether someone is wrong about an issue and hence irrational, then how sure can we be that we are not wrong and therefore irrational ourselves?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If instead we think being rational means following the rules of logic, then rational people can be dead wrong and still be rational. All they have to do is follow the rules of logic to be rational. Rational people can be dead wrong simply because they start with a false assumption. If they take a false assumption as their starting point then they may be perfectly rational to follow that assumption with good logic to its logical conclusion, even though their conclusion is wrong. They would be wrong not because they are irrational, but because they started with a wrong assumption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To people who think we should have no assumptions I merely say that we must all assume some things if for no other reason than that we can never examine everything we accept to be true all at once. Ideas which are not subject to conscious scrutiny form a set of background beliefs which are used in assessing a given issue at hand. Our conclusions on these other issues are our accumulated set of assumptions. Yes, we must try to examine everything we accept one at a time, but we can never examine all of that which we accept as true. Just as Michael Polanyi effectively argued that we know more than we can tell, we also accept more than we can justify. Have you, for instance, ever serious examined whether or not communication is even possible between two people? Some philosophers have, and at least one ancient Greek philosopher named Cratylus concluded this was impossible. Given that conclusion of his, Cratylus merely wiggled his finger whenever he was asked a question, which, if he was correct, was the logical thing to do even if it might seem irrational. Your assumption that we do communicate is just that, an assumption, until you actually examine the arguments to the contrary. Was Cratylus correct? I don’t think so. But even if he was wrong he was still being rational. In the same sense I think George Berkeley was wrong for arguing there was no physical universe even if I think he was rational in doing so, and I do.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As another example, I personally think the logic of the Inquisition was impeccable, but absolutely wrong because it assumed God was the author of certain Biblical texts that justified it. As another example, if a believer assumes God exists then this might lead him to logically conclude God is the author of morality and that there is a life after death. The logic is probably there, at least for believers. It’s just that their starting assumption is false. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-6706526302494669301?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I don’t know how much expertise you have when it comes to Islam and the Middle East, but here goes.  I’m in the very beginning stages of what I suspect will develop into a relationship with a guy from Saudi Arabia. He spent some time in the U.S. as a child, seems pretty westernized, isn’t super-religious, and is aware of my stance on religion, my feminism, and my Jewish heritage. I’m not going to lie, though.  The whole thing still seems like dangerous ground.  Am I being insanely naïve by even considering a relationship with this man?  And, given how intertwined culture and religion are, even if he professes to be fairly non-religious, am I in for a nasty shock? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Feminist Jewish Atheist with an irresistible attraction to Middle Eastern men
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Feminist Jewish atheist, etc.,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also dangerous ground for me to characterize all people in a category from the few examples with whom I am familiar, because that would be bigotry.  So I’ll have to speak about general precautions and the virtue of being circumspect and slow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many scary stories about the outcomes of some cross-cultural relationships.  It may be unfair to assume that those stories are typical, but we should not ignore them either.  Most of us have heard the story portrayed in the book and movie, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312925883?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0312925883"&gt;Not Without My Daughter&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; written by Betty Mahmoody, where the American wife of an “Americanized” Iranian traveled with him to Iran for a family celebration, only to find that she would be required to adhere to the dress and customs of the country, and that neither she nor her daughter would be allowed to leave Iran.  After an extremely arduous and dangerous journey of many months, she eventually escaped to the West with her daughter.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost the exact same thing happened to a friend of mine, who met a man from Saudi Arabia and married him in the United States. Shortly after giving birth to their son, she accompanied him to Saudi Arabia to meet his family.  Once there, her husband, who seemed suddenly changed, told her that neither she nor her young son would be allowed to return to the U.S.  She immediately fled with her son to the American Embassy, and after some difficulties, returned to the States.  She spent the next several years hiding from her husband, who, being from a wealthy family, might have been able to gain custody of their son, one way or another.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, enough of the scary stories, whether they are typical or not.  The point is that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; new relationships, even those within a single culture, have the potential for disappointment, danger and even disaster.  Most of those hazards would be avoidable if the people involved would go into them slowly, with their eyes open, talking and talking and talking about all the issues that will affect their lives as they become more established and committed to each other.  They should know well ahead of time their partner’s attitudes and habits around money, sex, religion, children, in-laws, cultural customs, expected roles within a marriage, where they are going to live, diet issues, drug and alcohol issues, their past relationships, how and why those ended and many other things.  And they should watch the behaviors, not just listen to the reassurances.  There’s nothing wrong with a discreet background check. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most new couples, their eyes glazed over in their infatuation for each other, make little or no effort to check such matters out early, and only discover the serious problems after they are deeply stuck in the middle of things.  Newlyweds often know far more about the personal details of celebrities than their own partners.  Many states require “conciliation counseling” before granting a divorce, seeing if there is any way the marriage can be repaired. It would save a lot of money and heartbreak if those states required PRE-marital counseling before granting the marriage in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing for you to see is if he is even open to such frank discussion.  If not, then I would not predict much satisfaction coming from the relationship.  Even if you and he are able to talk exhaustively about all those things, there are still at least two possible snags: One, could he be lying, shining you on, telling you whatever you want to hear because he wants something from you?  For instance, is immigration status or citizenship a motive that might be behind his pursuing a relationship?  Two, even if all that is worked out and he is genuinely sincere about his motives and expectations, and if perchance you end up marrying him, be extremely cautious about going to his native country with him.  Even if he is very “Americanized” while in America, the culture and family expectations when he is back in his native land are very powerful.  All that westernization can suddenly evaporate. When in Rome, do as the Romans do.  When in Arabia…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Shakespeare wrote in &lt;em&gt;A Midsummer Night’s Dream,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Love and reason keep little company together.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, somehow, try to keep some blood flowing to your brain when most of it is flowing to your loins. Men are most notorious for their foolishness in this way, but women do it too. Somehow, somehow, keep your eyes and ears open even when your heart is full. Women are most notorious for their foolishness in this way, but men do it too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope your life goes well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard&lt;/p&gt;

It was a watershed moment for me, as I had conjectured about what his position on the believer spectrum would be for years.  Knowing about the world of woo that circulates around anything that looks even slightly ghostly, I had expected to hear long-winded tales of confrontations with ghosts and all manner of newageness that I felt would be put up onstage during his talk, even if he didn’t actually believe in the existence of spirits.  We all know (at least in America) that’s how to sell books. And Simon has sold a ton of them. A casual look at his archive &lt;a href="http://www.marsdenarchive.com"&gt;www.marsdenarchive.com&lt;/a&gt; reveals a world few people can compete with for dark shivery images. His work has a haunted quality that’s impossible to deny. But what does he really think about ghosts? &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first exposure to Simon’s work was through an article in &lt;em&gt;“All Hallows,” &lt;/em&gt;the now lamented official organ of Barbara and Christopher Roden’s &lt;em&gt;Ghost Story Society&lt;/em&gt;. I quickly rounded up the necessary funds to be able to buy a copy of one of his first collections, &lt;em&gt;“Visions of Poe.” &lt;/em&gt;I was transfixed. Here was a collection of cobwebbed gargoyles and creaky old houses like I had never seen anywhere except in my darkest dreams. I immediately wondered the obvious: was this man a believer or a skeptic …or what? In the last ten or so years since his Internet website made it possible to acquire his books on line, I have studiously collected everything I could get my hands on and kept up with first editions as they were released. Over the years we corresponded about various ethereal subjects, but I still never got a clue where he really stood on all this spook stuff. When I watched his incredibly beautiful DVD &lt;em&gt;“The Twilight Hour – Visions of Ireland’s Haunted Past,”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;* &lt;/strong&gt;I thought for sure he was hopelessly lost in a world of woo. Just the same, I also knew how media and agents know how to sell a product. The words “skeptic” and “ghost hunter” don’t sit well together in the public eye. So when Simon emailed to let me know he was coming to L.A., I jumped at the chance to hear him speak in person. Would he be a dyed-in-the-wool shut-eye believer? I couldn’t wait to find out. &lt;img title="simoniv" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/simoniv.jpg" alt="simoniv" width="174" height="260"&gt;So Susan Gerbic-Forsyth and I traveled out to Burbank, California to find out for ourselves just where the self-described “Ghost Hunter” stood on the subject of ghosts and hauntings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foyer of the Burbank Public Library was packed with an odd assortment of people who ran the gamut from bored looking housewives and backpackers to professorial types and the obligatory Goth couples in funereal black. I was a bit surprised that there weren’t more of the punk-vampire persuasion, knowing Simon’s tracts on Dracula’s Castle and the profusion of crypts and graveyards that rise out of the mists in his books. One cherubic woman who stood in the center of the throng awaiting entrance was heard to loudly proclaim to everyone within earshot about the tremendous size of the “orbs” she had recently seen hovering on her front porch. This was delivered as she feverishly clutched a dogeared copy of some &lt;em&gt;“Ghost Homes of Los Angeles” &lt;/em&gt;paperback. I could see Susan’s barely restrained skeptical mouth ready to go into full Guerrilla mode, but she managed to keep a lid on her emotions long enough to get into the lecture hall and sit down without exploding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="simonIII" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/simonIII2.jpg" alt="simonIII" width="112" height="166"&gt;Simon talked of his childhood and his father who brought his children up on ghost stories and who inherited a huge family home filled with his own father’s collection of occult books. Clearly, Simon was a child steeped in the darkest of woo.  Of course, he was told that the house he lived in was haunted and that the room he slept in was particularly possessed by a ghost with a well-known family heritage. His father was himself a photographer who encouraged him to take up photography at an early age.  These two influences were bound to collide and after working as a developer in several London darkrooms over a period of years in the early 60’s, he struck out on his own and began a series of photographic adventures which have taken him to “over 5, 000 haunted places.”  Hmmmm. We wondered when the other shoe would fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily throughout his lecture, Simon peppered his monologue with dry British humor which was well received by the group. He skillfully set the tone of a tongue-in-cheek adventurer who hadn’t made up his mind one way or the other on the reality of ghosts. This was a wise move on Simon’s part. He knows where his bread is buttered and didn’t rock the boat of the believers by taking any negative stand right away. His lecture style was a balanced look at the art of photography, not spiritualism or woo. He scrupulously avoided making references to personal beliefs, preferring to stick to references of established cultural folklore or local superstitions he has encountered while briskly clicking through a collection of his favorite images. He used the adverb “unnerving” several times. In his deep London bass voice, this word had the effect of either underscoring the severity of his experiences to the believer, or for those not so inclined; adding to the humorous timbre of the whole presentation. Unnerving has now become a word of choice in my vocabulary. One can apply it to ghosts, traffic jams or almost anything and it sounds great. I remember relaxing in my chair at one point when I finally realized that I was listening to a man of science and not another loony, albeit a man of great artistic temperment and a romantic of the deepest speculative muse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things were made abundantly clear to all when he told the group that, “&lt;em&gt;In over 5,000 photo sessions all over the world from France to Russia and the US, there were perhaps five places that I seriously thought I would never want to return to, and only one time did I ever &lt;strong&gt;think I might have seen&lt;/strong&gt; or experienced something I couldn’t put my finger on.”  &lt;/em&gt;He then related one story of how he had spent several hours in a dank castle ruin setting up a shot and trying to get the lighting just right, when he turned around and thought he saw an image standing in the back of the room watching him. He didn’t say it was a ghost, just something out of the corner of his eye that disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have all had that kind of experience. After pouring over Simon’s books for many years, I can easily understand how there would be many unpleasant places that were extremely cold, dark, damp and dirty that I would not want to ever return to. His voyage to Vlad Dracul’s (the tyrant Dracula was based on)  grave site on a remote island in Romania where he was caught in a torrential thunderstorm and nearly drowned with only an old woman at the oars of a small fishing boat bears testimony to what real fears and dangers he has braved to bring back his striking emotional images. It’s not really his fault if  book publishers and agents whose job it is to hype sales with popular pseudo-scientific bias choose to pump-up his work into the stuff of modern myth and legend. In the realm of contemporary photography, Simon Marsden is the go-to man if you are looking for the finest in high- end atmospheric spookiness. He’s the king of the darkest mountain around and all this magically happens despite the fact that there’s no tricky Photoshop hooey or phony double exposures added in for effect. His work stands on its own and invites the viewer to step across the threshold into a world where things look surreal and unearthly, but are only haunted &lt;em&gt;if you want them to be&lt;/em&gt;. There’s not a ghost or a sheet-wrapped spook on view in any of his catalogue. He doesn’t have to go that route.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon swiftly tackled the media’s blitz of paranormal dreck in one foul swoop when he told the audience, &lt;em&gt;“…I have sought out ghosts and hauntings for over thirty years and haven’t yet captured a single image of one. This really bothers me, because I can’t understand how every paranormal ghost hunter or psychic seems to be able to find one on every reality show, week after week.”&lt;/em&gt;  Well put Simon! &lt;img title="Simoni" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Simoni.jpg" alt="Simoni" width="112" height="166"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to report that I came away with even more respect for a man who has obviously spent his life enjoying the thrills of actually investigating close-up the places most of us can only dream about seeing and must remain content to visit vicariously through his images. With Simon’s work it’s like reading a good ghost story: We don’t have to stand out in the rain waiting for the right light for hours or descend a rotting stairway to glimpse an open grave. We can open the book, have a look and close it back up again when we have had enough. It’s a comfortable terror and global storytelling at its best. Now when I sit back in front of a roaring fire and dip into his dark delicacies, I can rest safe in the knowledge that Simon Marsden has kept his feet firmly planted on scientific ground, where his manipulation of infrared film, clever darkroom techniques and a keen eye for the bizarre had little to do with believing in any reality of what he might tempt us to imagine in his work. When it came time for questions from the group. There was a profound silence. I think the believers who came to have their beliefs validated by another newage charlatan might have been stunned into reality. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="TEXT-ALIGN:left"&gt;* Simon’s DVD is my best bet recommendation for a cold winter’s night. Get ahold of a copy and wait for that night when the window shutters are banging, the wind is howling under the eaves of your roof and you just might be willing to drop yout skeptical defences long enough to listen for awhile to a man who knows where the bodies are truly buried – and came back with the photos to prove it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the many international CV readers, today is the US’s Independence Day celebration, which is in large part an excuse to bar-b-que meat products, blow up fireworks, and drink beer.  If you’re tuning in from abroad, you are probable sober enough to read Daniel’s upcoming post on gravitational waves.  For the rest of the drunken US crew, you can probably handle the Muppets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bob” finds a wallet on the ground.  He looks at the license and finds the address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bob” returns the wallet to its rightful owner.  No money is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner is stunned… and thankful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner tells his wife.  Now, both are thankful.  &lt;em&gt;Praise God&lt;/em&gt; they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A child comes in the room.  Both parents point to the man, telling their child there are still kind, decent, honest people in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Praise God&lt;/em&gt; they all say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bob” doesn’t praise God.  The family doesn’t understand.  “Bob” tells them he’s an atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything gets weird and silent and awkward.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of us have been additionally diagnosed with &lt;a href="http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/auditory.asp"&gt;auditory processing disorder&lt;/a&gt; (sorry about the "in children" insistence in that article--it's otherwise a good article and the info is true of adults as well).  Difficulty separating foreground from background noise is commonly reported.  Earlier this year I posted on &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/mono-sensing_and_understanding_speech"&gt;mono-sensing and understanding speech&lt;/a&gt; and questioned whether difficulty integrating vision and hearing might contribute to auditory processing issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it seems like there's some &lt;a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/156405.php"&gt;science backing up our experiences&lt;/a&gt; from City College of New York's &lt;a href="http://cogneuro-nki.rfmh.org/CNL_Foxe.htm"&gt;Dr. John J. Foxe&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sensory integration dysfunction has long been speculated to be a core component of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but there has been precious little hard empirical evidence to support this notion. Viewing a speaker's articulatory movements can greatly improve a listener's ability to understand spoken words, and this is especially the case under noisy environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results are the first of their kind to verify that children with autism have substantial difficulties in these situations..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foxe goes on to describe the implications this has for classrooms--that smaller, quieter classrooms that are more accommodating of auditory processing difficulties are a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Being able to detect speech in noise plays a vital role in how we communicate with each other because our listening environments are almost never quiet. Even the hum of air conditioners or fans that we can easily ignore may adversely impact these children's ability to understand speech in the classroom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, children children children, but these issues are definitely not limited to children!  The science doesn't generalize, but the concepts likely do (at least they do in my experience as an N of 1).  Environmental system hums, lighting hums, the shuffling of papers and clattering of pens and shifting in seats--all things that as a graduate student I fight through in order to make out what the instructor is saying.  And background noise is always there--it does not "turn off."  This makes listening to speech something that is exhausting, fades in and out, and is deeply unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism may be less "mysterious" when our experience of the world, such as our experience of others' speech, is better understood.  This can pave the way to more accommodating environments which may lead to more opportunities and a higher quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

In essence, Harkin has slipped a provision into the Senate version of the 600+ page health care reform bill that is currently taking shape in Congress that included funding for "community wellness programs," which, if science-based, would be a good thing, but which, when sponsored by a quackery supporter like Tom Harkin, is usually woo-speak for including all manner of unscientific "alternative" medical modalities and dubious dietary advice, usually with supplements. As I've characterized it before, you can look at it as a "bait and switch," in which CAM advocates appropriate sensible, science-based modalities like diet and exercise as being "alternative" (the bait) and then use that to argue that the woo they associate with such modalities (up to even pure woo like &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt; or homeopathy) is effective (the switch).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another provision that laid bare Harkin's true plans, however, was the one he also slipped into the bill that includes "alternative" medicine practitioners as part of the bill's definition of the "health care workforce." That's part of the Trojan Horse aspect of what Harkin's trying to do. In the belly of a sturdy-looking offering lurks a whole lot of pseudoscience. It doesn't take too much consideration to realize that the reason for this provision is almost certainly to lay the groundwork for requiring the government to pay for "alternative" medicine services, and, as the government goes, so too goes the private health insurance industry, at least when it comes to what health care services will be funded. As you might imagine, I was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/senator_tom_harkin_pulls_a_fast_one_alte.php"&gt;not too happy about this&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, I was a bit snarky. Probably no more snarky than usual on this topic, but entertainingly snarky enough.&lt;/p&gt;

Blogging has been very hard for me lately.  I love writing, but due to work and family mishegos it's been hard to keep up with the posting.  I'm hoping a stint up in the woods providing medical supervision to 400 souls will be rejuvenating.  While I'm gone, I'll leave you with some of my favorite posts about the human side of medicine.  I hope you enjoy reading them again, or for the first time.  --PalMD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I am often the bearer of bad news.  I don't think I've ever been formally taught how to deliver bad news, but I've developed a style over the years, and I'm pretty good at it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work with medical residents every day in their outpatient clinics.  Most of them have never had to deliver bad news.  Some people are natural communicators, and some aren't.  Often, one of my residents just "gets it"---they have a great deal of empathy, can "read" the patient from moment to moment, and without any help from me, they can successfully give the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to give bad news "successfully"?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In medicine, it means giving complex information in a short period of time, with proper emotional content, and in such a way that the patient takes it seriously, but doesn't become so frightened that they forget the entire discussion.  Once the word "cancer" comes out, little after that is retained.  Over and over, I hear people say, "what was that thing you said I have?"  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no substitute for young doctors giving bad news to their own patients, but it's good to model behaviors and to pass along tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if I have to tell someone they have HIV, I usually make sure to shake their hand, put a hand on their shoulder, sit near them, and keep my arms uncrossed.  These signals set the tone for how they will view their illness.  If you, as a doctor, seem physically distant, the patient will sense that, and may end up feeling stigmatized, isolated, and more afraid.  Also, they may disappear out of fear, delaying further treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving bad news has to be a flexible skill.  All patients are different, and need to hear news differently.  For example, I had a patient with a breast lump.  She is a bright and straight-forward person, so I asked her, "Do you prefer a good surgeon who is warm and fuzzy and will hold your hand, or who will just get the job done?"  She chose the latter.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only hope that my skills keep improving and that my residents keep learning.  Unfortunately, there will always be people to give the news to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Living alternately in the worlds of med school and grad school has prompted me to reflect on differences between these training programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Obvious disclaimer: I have studied at a single institution, and only for five years.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am enrolled in a dual-degree MD/PhD program. About 120 US medical schools have such programs, and the National Institutes of Health funds a third of them (&lt;a href="http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Training/InstPredoc/PredocOverview-MSTP.htm"&gt;MSTP&lt;/a&gt;). The schedule of such programs is generally: 2 years of medical school (culminating in &lt;a href="http://www.usmle.org/Examinations/st"&gt;USMLE Step 1&lt;/a&gt;), 3+ years of graduate school (culminating in dissertation and PhD), and then the last 2 years of medical school (which I begin this month). The most popular residency choices for MD/PhD graduates are internal medicine, pediatrics, and pathology (&lt;a href="http://homepage.uab.edu/paik/match.html"&gt;match data&lt;/a&gt;). Other residencies that attract these graduates include dermatology, neurology, ophthamology, and radiology (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.libproxy3.umdnj.edu/pubmed/18780845"&gt;survey data&lt;/a&gt;). The hopes of those funding the MD/PhD training programs and of those accepting the graduates is that these individuals will become physician-scientists, bridging the divide between lab bench and patient bedside with insights from both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Note that the majority of physician-scientists do not receive dual degrees but rather are MD physicians who began conducting research after residency. Degrees are imperfect signals of scientific acumen, as SBM readers surely know.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tricky bit during MD/PhD training (and presumably also during the career of a physician-scientist) is transitioning between lab and clinic. One of the feared jumps is what I am facing right now: after years of focus on my thesis project, I will begin clerkships with third-year med students fresh from their USMLE board exam. Of course I forget much of the detailed knowledge about drugs and diseases that I accumulated for the board exam, which I took in 2006. My clinical skills, rudimentary as they ever were, are undoubtedly quite rusty. Just to top it off, all my friends who shared first and second year with me are now residents, so I know few of my new classmates!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I transition back to med school, I am reflecting on my grad school experiences and how they will support my further training. The details of my research project will not likely lead to any breakthrough cures, but by participating in the endeavor of science I am beginning to truly appreciate the painstaking process by which scientific knowledge is generated. My experiences in the lab have taught me the risk of relying on a transitory positive finding before it is replicated. From designing my own experiments, basic they may have been, I can recognize how challenging it must be to properly study a complex intervention in human subjects by asking focused questions and adhering to rigorous methodology. In graduate school, students are trained to ask not just “what do you know?” but more importantly “how do you know it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, first and second year of medical school are largely concerned with teaching the basic facts and models that undergird modern medicine. Courses such as the biochemistry and physiology are often referred to as “science” courses, but in general these courses teach the &lt;em&gt;results&lt;/em&gt; of science without dwelling much on the &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; of science. This focus on facts is understandable; physicians cannot function without knowing the languages of genetics, anatomy, pharmacology, and the like. But I wonder if an adverse effect of these years of rapid fact accumulation is an overly trusting attitude towards authorities. Most of the curriculum in years 1 and 2 of med school represents the consensus that forms the knowledge base of medicine. It can be learned not just from textbooks and lectures but from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/High-Yield-Physiology-Ronald-W-Dudek/dp/078174587X"&gt;review books&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; at times. A lecturing professor is not challenged; rather, her words are dutifully transcribed and memorized for the test. And safely so! Lectures rarely focus on controversy or uncertainty. Therefore, the first half of medical school imparts a great amount of requisite knowledge, but it does not do much to encourage scientific skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[CAM tie-in: Some training programs for alternative practitioners describe similar “science classes” to those taught in medical school. Even assuming high quality, such classes (in medical school, naturopathy school, whatever) are more about teaching dogma than critical thinking. Physiology dogma is more useful than homeopathy dogma, to be sure, but such coursework is nothing like the training of a scientist.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that third year looks designed to begin fostering independent learning and critical thinking in a clinical setting. My new med school classmates and I were advised, “Don’t complain that ‘no one is teaching me.’ The physicians’ top priority is the patient, not you. Take charge of your own learning.” Of course there are still a lot of new facts to learn (and in my case, old facts to remember), so I’ve already bought a ponderous textbook for my first clerkship. But the book-learning is supplemented with apprentice-style participation in care for patients. Ultimately, it seems to me, the challenge of medicine is the thoughtful application of population data to the care of the individual, and I expect that third year will begin my training in this art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recognize that we neither need nor can afford to train all medical students to be physician-scientists. I also recognize that the pre-clinical years of undergraduate medical education have little room for learning goals beyond mastery of basic facts. But I wonder, particularly as I read SBM reports of sloppy thinking and bad science permeating medicine and academia, if a shift of focus from “what we know” to “how we know” might be in order. In the age of smart phones and handheld computers, instant recall of obscure facts by human brains may be slightly less important than it once was. Web-savvy patients come to the doctor with facts and myths and worries. The physician of the future surely cannot &lt;em&gt;know &lt;/em&gt;everything but must be able to &lt;em&gt;evaluate&lt;/em&gt; anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am halfway through &lt;em&gt;Snake Oil Science &lt;/em&gt;by R. Barker Bausell (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-trackback.php?p=4"&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Hall). The lessons of this terrific book are what I wish I had found more of in med school so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on who is doing the asking, and what their motivation might be, you may end up giving 10 different stories to 10 different people.  You’re never lying, but you may focus on different elements of the story for each person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SarahH&lt;/strong&gt; mentioned the &lt;a href="http://forum.friendlyatheist.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;amp;t=1685"&gt;one common thread&lt;/a&gt; that she tells during each “Testimonial”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… The only thing I always share, for sure, is my “breaking point” that essentially made the different between “theist” and “atheist” for me… which was finding out about all the different world religions that other people believe so fervently and realizing that I didn’t have any more proof for my own religion than I did for the ones I’d never heard of.

I decided to leave all my electronical gear behind at the hotel and venture out for the last session with a stark naked brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day began with a walk down to the harbor to board the &lt;a href="http://www.sonnenkoenigin.com/"&gt;Sonnenkönigin&lt;/a&gt;, a very impressive ship that can only be inadequately be called a ferry. We were welcomed aboard with a glass of wine or a glass of juice if you felt 8 am was a little early to begin, and tables heaped with food. One thing I&amp;#39;m going to miss a great deal when I get back to Minnesota is good bread — the stuff that is chewy and substantial and has all this flavor. Bread back  home is a kind of glorified aerogel, a pale and puffy spongy substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also got some musical entertainment, and a lot of hard sell for the German province of &lt;a href="http://www.baden-wuerttemberg.de/"&gt;Baden-Württemburg&lt;/a&gt;. They can do everything, except speak proper German (really, it&amp;#39;s their motto: &amp;quot;Wir können alles. Außer Hoch-Deutsch.&amp;quot;) They put on a good show with lots of exhibits touting their support for basic research and industry — if nothing else, I&amp;#39;m convinced they value the practical benefits of science enough to heavily recruit mobs of graduate students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/07/auf_wiedersehen_lindau/mainau_schloss.jpeg" width="400" height="300" alt="mainau_schloss.jpeg" title="Manau Schloss"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainau is a lovely island in Lake Constance, topped with an old baroque Schloss and filled with gardens and walking paths. We were there for a final panel on sustainability. The panel consisted of four nobelists, Pachauri, Molina, Schrock, and Stocker, one government minister, whose name I&amp;#39;ve probably misspelled since her tag was turned away from me — Quellen-Thielen, I believe — and one annoying crackpot, Bjorn Lomborg, who really didn&amp;#39;t belong up on the stage. Even as insubstantial as he was, though, Lomborg did agree, along with every one else, that climate change and global warming are real phenomena. Here&amp;#39;s a short summary of what they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pachauri: Our big problem is unsustainable growth. It's inevitable and desirable that third-world economies expand, but the old strategies of exploiting fossil fuels aren't going to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lomborg: While global warming is real, it's not a crucial problem, since it will only cost 0.5% of world GDP to cope with it. He's pro-development, and thinks, for example, that while global warming may increase the incidence of malaria by 3% more, we ought to be focusing on the 100% of malaria cases occurring now rather than trying to reduce the 3%. We need to invest in better technology, but imposing limitations on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions now is fruitless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Molina: We aren&amp;#39;t taking the right path in growing economies — we need to convince the world that building sustainable energy supplies and limiting environmental damage now is the best viable long-term strategy. He had to take a poke at Lomborg, too: putting a dollar value on irreversible changes is inappropriate and misleading. Focusing on one aspect of the problem and calling the cost increases and human losses manageable hides the risks of passing a tipping point. He favors, as an important early step, incorporating the costs of externalities such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission into the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quellen-Thielen (sp?): Germany takes climate change seriously, and the government sets policies and targets for emissions. They also materially support  new technologies, like photovoltaics. These actions have not harmed the economy but instead have created new jobs and positioned Germany as a global leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prompted one of the more obnoxious jabs from Lomborg, who literally sneered at German environmental efforts, pointing out that all the photocells Germany has built are already obsolete, and that it was just money thrown down the drain. Throughout, Lomborg took the attitude that direct action now is inefficient, and that we're better off waiting for new technologies to emerge, at which time the magic of the market will kick in and our problems will go away. Quellen-Thielen reasonably pointed out that their development now means they've got a leg up, that they're obtaining a reasonable fraction of their energy directly from the sun right now, and they are also building the industrial infrastructure to build on new ideas quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schrock: He was a bit out of place here; I think the presence of Lomborg effectively derailed the whole panel away from a discussion of a diversity of solutions to the global warming and into a wasted defense of the rightness of taking any policy action at all. Schrock clearly wanted to talk about catalysis and the importance of chemistry in generating technical solutions, and advocated  more investment in basic as well as applied research — he fears that we could lose the potential for long-term improvements in a frantic search for solutions we can implement right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocker: he also spoke against the bean-counter on the panel, pointing out that the 2003 heat wave killed thousands, and within 30 years, that kind of event will likely have a frequency of every other year. He thinks global warming is a misnomer: it's more than just a temperature shift, but it's going to lead to a sea level rise, changes in the availability of water resources in some of the most heavily populated areas of the world, and is going to trigger resource wars that will be devastating. He pointed out that this really is an anomalous event in our history, that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is 29% higher than at any time in the last 850,000 years. He believes we need a globally binding emissions target set right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was a mildly interesting discussion, but it could have been so much better — I suspect someone noticed it was hard to find a strong contrarian among Nobel prize winners, and decided to bring in a last-minute alternative view. Unfortunately, Lomborg&amp;#39;s basically an advocate for do-nothingness and did nothing but distract the others from wrestling with more substantial ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sitting in the sun for this outdoor panel, I got a sunburn and a strong desire to escape, so I spent the time afterwards wandering about in the gardens. Then the best part, getting back on the &lt;i&gt;Sonnenkönigin&lt;/i&gt; and being handed a big mug of cold beer as I boarded.  I&amp;#39;m beginning to get the impression that all bier in Deutschland ist frei. That can&amp;#39;t be true, but empirically it seems to be the case. Or maybe it&amp;#39;s just Baden-Württemburg&amp;#39;s cunning plan to persuade us that southwestern Germany is paradise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had more entertainment on the trip back — Stuart Pivar was aboard, doing tricks with balloons! No, actually it was some other guy who made &lt;a href="http://www.balloonmolecules.com/"&gt;balloon molecules&lt;/a&gt;, as well as strange hats. I guess the guy just looked at me and decided I needed more tentacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/coturnix/3684760265/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/07/auf_wiedersehen_lindau/my_hat.jpeg" width="375" height="500" alt="my_hat.jpeg" title="Stylish!"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you want this to be the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/framing-science/2008/08/two_images_of_atheism_hate_ver.php"&gt;dominant image of atheism&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also made a buckyball out of balloons, and guess who ended up wearing that on his head?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/07/auf_wiedersehen_lindau/kroto.jpeg" width="400" height="517" alt="kroto.jpeg" title="Sir Harold Kroto in a buckyball balloon hat"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sir Harold Kroto&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's all there was. A great meeting overall, lots of fun, and lots of networking. The majority of the attendees are graduate students who are brought over to hob-nob with the biggest of the big-wigs of science, and most importantly, make international connections with their peers. Any graduate student readers of this post: ask around in your department if anyone knows about nominations for the &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/"&gt;Lindau meetings&lt;/a&gt;. They are definitely worth attending for young people wanting to get involved in this global enterprise called science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One evening after the talks, when we were hanging about in a gasthof enjoying some good food and beer, the Countess Bettina Bernadotte stopped by our table (Yes! You also get to meet European nobility!), and we all talked a bit about the meetings. She's the president of the council for the meetings, and puts a tremendous amount of effort and fund-raising to get them off the ground. When asked why she was doing it, the answer was simple: that while she gets no direct personal or material gain from the meetings, as a citizen of the world she feels an obligation to make a contribution to bettering the world's knowledge, and this is an opportunity to foster a positive benefit to science. The whole meeting is built around giving young investigators connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I'm on my long, slow way home. It was worth it, and hope I can go again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight I'm in the city of Friedrichshafen, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/8129358.stm"&gt;home of the zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; (I asked if there were any connecting flights by zeppelin, but I&amp;#39;m out of luck and will have to take an Airbus tomorrow, instead.) Then I&amp;#39;m off to Frankfurt, Philadelphia, and finally, Minneapolis. All should be smooth this time — I don&amp;#39;t have any too-short layovers on this trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m going to stroll about and use the Fourth of July to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the first transatlantic zeppelin flight — I noticed that there was a big brass band down by the harbor, with fellows in bright green uniforms and tall hats with tassels. It should be fun!&lt;/p&gt;

What next, a show with healthy contestants competing for the chance to be infected with a disease, and the winner gets a long hospital stay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game show producers give their bias away when they announce &lt;span&gt;"We don't approve of anyone being an atheist"&lt;/span&gt;. They're also planning to have  a team of theologians to screen out religious people pretending to be godless so they can get a free trip to the holy site of their choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm not a fake atheist, but I'm wondering what they're offering to people like me. We go on the program, we get non-stop harangues from crazy imams, priests, rabbis, and monks, and if we don't fall for their foolishness, we &lt;i&gt;lose&lt;/i&gt;? I'd be tempted to just say "yes!" to the rabbi to really piss off the Muslim hosts, get a trip to Jerusalem, and then annoy the rabbi when I tell him I lied. Or would the theologians also have to confer to determine that your conversion was sincere?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/why_would_i_go_on_a_game_show.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/z_BwiUDcmSc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246710580838"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/04/fire-works/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/25ac2ba0819719bb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><title type="html">Fire works</title><published>2009-07-04T12:15:57Z</published><updated>2009-07-04T12:15:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/04/fire-works/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This weekend, I present to you a heartbreaking song, &lt;a href="http://www.cowboylyrics.com/tabs/cleaves-slaid/lydia-7054.html"&gt;Lydia&lt;/a&gt;, about a kind, wise old woman who can't quite pull her life together after the death of her son.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Oh, Lydie, let him go.  The boy is gone.&lt;br&gt;
Her mother struggled as she tore him from her arms.&lt;br&gt;
Oh, Lydia, your tears are heaven's rain.&lt;br&gt;
But she never was the same.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He hasn't hit it big yet, but his music is good enough that I think he ought to.  Listen for yourself:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.odeo.com/flash/audio_player_standard_gray.swf&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=52&amp;amp;flashVars=valid_sample_rate%3Dtrue%26external_url%3Dhttp://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/weekend_diversion_a_new_kind_o/07%2520Lydia%25201.mp3" width="300" height="52"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's something else -- that's also wonderful -- that &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; hitting it big, which you've probably never heard of.  It's a comic book called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_99"&gt;the 99&lt;/a&gt; that's quickly becoming a huge success &lt;i&gt;in the Muslim world&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/weekend_diversion_a_new_kind_o/99s-muslim-comic-books-vl-vertical.JPG" width="300" height="461" alt="99s-muslim-comic-books-vl-vertical.JPG"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comic is based on a legend of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God_in_the_Qur%27an"&gt;the 99 names of God&lt;/a&gt;, which is a list of 99 virtues of Allah in Islamic culture.  These are, as far as I can tell, universally accepted good human behaviors, such as being graceful, merciful, protective, just, and nourishing.  The BBC &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8127699.stm"&gt;has a great article on the creator of this comic&lt;/a&gt;, who says the following about creating the comics for his children in the aftermath of 9/11:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I had already made a decision that I needed to find a way to take back Islam from its hostage takers, but I did not known how. The answer was staring me in the face. It was a[s] simple, and as difficult, as the multiplication of 9 by 11: 99.
&lt;br&gt;
So, at the age of 32, I uncapped my pen to create a concept that could be popular in the East and the West. I would go back to the very sources from which others took violent and hateful messages and offer messages of tolerance and peace in their place. I would give my heroes a Trojan horse in the form of THE 99. Islam was my Helen. I wanted her back.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
What has been created looks amazing, and is partly based in actual history.  In 1258, the Mongols invaded and destroyed much of Baghdad, leaving its great library in ruins, and littering the Tigris River with its books.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in this comic, the librarians placed 99 special stones in the river to absorb some of the wisdom.  Now, in modern times, the 99 stones have made it into the hands of 99 normal teenagers and young adults from around the globe, giving them each one of the 99 virtues and/or powers of Allah.

&lt;p&gt;The comics now sell about 1,000,000 copies &lt;i&gt;per month&lt;/i&gt; worldwide, in many different languages.  A movie is being created based on it, theme parks have opened in Kuwait based on it, but best of all, &lt;a href="http://www.the99.org/"&gt;you can download an issue &lt;i&gt;in English&lt;/i&gt; for free&lt;/a&gt; if you're curious to check it out!  I think it's a wonderful way to spend some time this July 4th weekend, and I hope you enjoy it, too!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/weekend_diversion_a_new_kind_o.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246698205243"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_quotes_341.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/81365ef97b9c518d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-07-04T09:04:14Z</published><updated>2009-07-04T09:04:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/bR4f9gFEb6k/clock_quotes_341.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_quotes_341.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No man was ever endowed with a right without being at the same time saddled with a responsibility. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/polls/obamas-decision-to-extend-benefits-to-gay-partners/"&gt;Do you agree with President Obama's decision to extend certain benefits to gay partners of federal employees?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;51.38% Yes&lt;br&gt;
48.62% No&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes further, too. We atheists tend to strongly favor women's rights and equality in the marketplace, yet only about half of us are female. I could bring up an article like this one, in which &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/god-and-country/2009/07/01/conservative-democrats-warn-against-funding-abortion-in-healthcare-reform.html"&gt;conservative democrats &lt;i&gt;demand&lt;/i&gt; that abortion services not be provided under universal healthcare&lt;/a&gt;, and I know how most of the progressive godless readers here will respond: with anger. You won't be voting for Reps. Dan Boren (D-OK); Bart Stupak (D-MI); Colin Peterson (D-MN); Tim Holden (D-PA); Travis Childers (D-MS); Lincoln Davis (D-TN); Heath Shuler (D-NC) Solomon Ortiz (D-TX); Mike McIntyre (D-NC); Jerry Costello (D-IL); Gene Taylor (D-MS); James Oberstar (D-MN); Bobby Bright (D-AL); Steve Driehaus (D-OH); Marcy Kaptur (D-OH); Charlie Melancon (D-LA); John Murtha (D-PA); Paul Kanjorski (D-PA); and Kathleen Dahlkemper (D-PA) in the next election. Hey, Colin Peterson is my state representative; I'll be writing him a pissed-off letter when I get home, and he has lost my vote.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's not just a selective reading on my part. Other sources, like &lt;a href="http://www.lavendermagazine.com/this-issue/arts-and-entertainment/on-the-townsend-37/"&gt;Lavender Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, have noticed that the atheists in their communities have a rather reliable political and social position. Here's a review of Atheists Talk radio (which is no more, I'm sorry to say).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many radio programs broadcast locally are queer-inclusive. But aside from KFAI's Fresh Fruit, which is total queer content, no program is as fully queer-supportive as Atheists Talk. Large time chunks have been devoted to Wayne Besen, the Fagbug, and Project 515. Plus, an organic queer sensitivity weaves throughout other segments, because of the atheist and democratic value that separates religion and state.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Host Mike Haubrich thinks "religious institutions that suppress the rights of GLBT folks are using their beliefs as justification for an underlying homophobia. By using the Bible as an absolute moral guide in legislating issues related to marriage and other societal benefits that should be recognized as being granted by such a basic document as the Declaration of Independence, they are demonstrating precisely the effects of church-state entanglement that James Madison was warning against. The state should not be used as a sledgehammer to enforce a particular religious code, and an individual's sexuality should not be subject to the whims of religious interpretation."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Contributor August Berkshire observes, "Americans are proud of our ideals of liberty and equality. Why then are some people shocked when these ideals are applied to people of color, women, and sexual minorities? Are some citizens 'more equal' than others?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People dependent on religion like to claim that atheism is just another religion, and they argue that we can't know that we'd have a better society if we got rid of god (and usually go the other way and claim we'd be immoral without our imaginary cosmic policeman in the sky), but you know, I look around at all the atheist communities springing up around the country, and I see the people who are most committed to tolerance and equality joining them, and I am convinced. A godless America would be a better America, one more committed to the Enlightenment ideals that accompanied its founding, one that would actually have some ideals and principles that would make it a better place to live for everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/what_is_it_with_atheists_and_g.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/1VFSswCMUwI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246694947470"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_fireworks_for_our_4th">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0e830b02046b1292</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">No Fireworks For Our 4th</title><published>2009-07-04T07:39:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-04T07:39:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_fireworks_for_our_4th" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.home-owners-assoc.com/upld_files/hoa0521//f0854_no-fireworks-logo-from-jay.jpg" height="170" alt="No Fireworks symbol from http://www.home-owners-assoc.com/upld_files/hoa0521//f0854_no-fireworks-logo-from-jay.jpg" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-right:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="170"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Lately my son Charlie has been overwhelmed by sounds. This is still a fairly new development: When he was younger, while other autistic children were putting their hands over their ears and crying at barking dogs, Charlie would be unrattled. It's been in the past year that Charlie has clearly become highly, and painfully, attuned to sounds. Certain sounds---those barks, a metal object hitting the floor, someone's loud voice---has evoked a more extreme response, leading us to think, something literally hurts when Charlie hears those sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim and I have been listening very closely to the sounds around us and, with Charlie, cringing at every Harley that passes the black car on the Garden State Parkway and tuning in carefully to the volume and pitch of our own voices. Seeing Charlie bow his head and cover his ears when no one is talking, we've realized that he's hearing everything in the background: Fluorescent lights, air-conditioners and fans, the pool filtering system. Charlie sometimes puts on his iPod and noise-canceling headphones, but sometimes just listening to even preferred sounds seems too much. I've been shopping around for noise-canceling headphones of all types (like the kind you use to mow the lawn with) and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/not_the_good_goods"&gt;stuff&lt;/a&gt; like a summer-weight hoodie (Charlie always liked having a heavier fleece one in winter). (Suggestions for dealing with this are quite welcome.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, we can keep things quiet, but none of us (Charlie in particular) could hardly stand just to stay in here: &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_principle_of_doubt"&gt;Out we must go&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to put a little control on the situation with pictures and schedules, explanations and stories. Still, we can't control every single sound. Ambulances will go screeching by and motorcycles, especially because it's summer, it's gotten hot after a rainy June, and, here in the US, it's the Fourth of July weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the subject of fireworks. The Fourth of July falls on a Saturday this year so it's become the reason for a long weekend, with celebrating starting yesterday (and I heard fireworks even on &lt;i&gt;Thursday&lt;/i&gt; night). We won't be seeking out any fireworks displays tonight, but some thunderous noises from the sky are going to be inevitable. Charlie's been curious to see the bright displays in the past, but I'm suspecting he'll have his head down and hands over his ears this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in everything with Charlie, we've been trying to figure out the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_same_old_same_old"&gt;proper balance between changing and accommodating&lt;/a&gt;, and gently seeking to desensitize him to some of the sounds out there. A balancing act it is and one also requiring us to (like any parents) measure out how much to protect Charlie from what irks him, and to coax him into learning to live with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm still glad fireworks are pretty much a one-time-a-year thing. It's a noisy enough place out there already.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246692295762"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3703">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5ded25c383b79d0c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment"/><category term="atheism"/><category term="Bajoran"/><category term="Deep Space 9"/><category term="Devil's Due"/><category term="god"/><category term="Star Trek"/><category term="Who Watches The Watchers"/><title type="html">Star Trek made him an atheist</title><published>2009-07-04T06:25:24Z</published><updated>2009-07-04T06:25:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/star-trek-made-him-an-atheist/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.multileggedcreature.info/Trekker/images/adonis_couple.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.multileggedcreature.info/Trekker/images/adonis_couple.jpg" alt="" width="206" height="164"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I came across &lt;a href="http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/09_jul_aug/Farrantello.html"&gt;this great article&lt;/a&gt; that was linked to by Friendly Atheist and thought it was worth sharing. The writer discusses the atheist and humanist messages that have almost always been a huge part of Star Trek, and how Star Trek influenced his own atheism. In the article, he largely focuses on the common Star Trek theme of gods turning out to be just deeply flawed aliens. Two particular TNG episodes that I think were left out of the article were “Who Watches The Watchers” and “Devil’s Due.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I do disagree on a few points. Namely, I think Voyager sucked, that DS9 &lt;a href="http://faustasblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/stadonis.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://faustasblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/stadonis.jpg" alt="" width="231" height="173"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;wasn’t always easy on religion, and I can’t believe there was no mention of Star Trek V, which is CRIMINALLY UNDERRATED, especially within the context of a discussion about Star Trek and religion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let me take a moment to defend Deep Space 9. First of all, the main religious leader of the Bajoran people (basically their pope) was almost always treated as an opportunistic villain throughout the series. Second, like with the “gods” of previous Star Trek series, the Bajoran Prophets were nothing but an advanced alien race. And in the first season finale of that series, religious fanatics blew up a school because they thought their beliefs were being threatened when the teacher taught the secular, scientific interpretation that “The Prophets” were just “warm hole aliens.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/80/347250926_3606788154_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/80/347250926_3606788154_o.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="144"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And with regards to Star Trek V, I frequently cite 3 quotes when debating with the religious. The first is:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What does God need with a starship?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though I usually replace the word “starship” with something more appropriate to the discussion like, “What does God need with a blood sacrifice, etc?” Borrowing from IMDB, here’s the entire context of the excerpt, which concludes with my second favorite quote from the movie, uttered by Dr. McCoy:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000638/"&gt;Kirk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: What does God need with a starship?  &lt;a href="http://img2.timeinc.net/ew/dynamic/imgs/081016/james-t-kirk-moments/asking-god_l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img2.timeinc.net/ew/dynamic/imgs/081016/james-t-kirk-moments/asking-god_l.jpg" alt="" width="272" height="272"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001420/"&gt;McCoy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Jim, what are you doing?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000638/"&gt;Kirk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m asking a question.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0613787/"&gt;“God”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Who is this creature?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000638/"&gt;Kirk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Who am I? Don’t you know? Aren’t you God?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0524743/"&gt;Sybok&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: He has his doubts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0613787/"&gt;“God”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: You doubt me?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000638/"&gt;Kirk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: I seek proof.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001420/"&gt;McCoy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Jim! You don’t ask the Almighty for his ID!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0613787/"&gt;“God”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Then here is the proof you seek.&lt;br&gt;
[&lt;em&gt;Hits Kirk with lightning&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000638/"&gt;Kirk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Why is God angry?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0524743/"&gt;Sybok&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Why? Why have you done this to my friend?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0613787/"&gt;“God”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: He doubts me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000559/"&gt;Spock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: You have not answered his question. What does God need with a starship?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0613787/"&gt;“God”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: [&lt;em&gt;hits Spock with lightning; then addresses McCoy&lt;/em&gt;] Do you doubt me?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001420/"&gt;McCoy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: I doubt any God who inflicts pain for his own pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the last quote I often use from this film is uttered by Captain Kirk within this exchange:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001420/"&gt;McCoy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: We were speculating. Is God really out there?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000638/"&gt;Kirk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Maybe he’s not out there, Bones. Maybe he’s right here.&lt;br&gt;
[&lt;em&gt;points to his heart&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000638/"&gt;Kirk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Human heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always had sort of an ironic view of life,” the 75-year-old Shatner said. “My belief system is that when this is over, it’s over. That you don’t look down from heaven and wait for your loved ones to join you. There may be some soul activity, but I’m not sure about that.

Instead, I received a &lt;a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Ghost-Writer/Amy-Zerner/e/9780979943324/?itm=14"&gt;Ghost Writer Automatic Writing Kit&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested a "Spirit Writer" years ago and concluded that the practitioner's pages of "channeled" scrawl were a stream-of-consciousness style of writing that was about as paranormal as James Joyce's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnegans_Wake"&gt;Finnegans Wake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;I should explain that there are two types of "spirit writing". One kind is where an uninvited spirit supposedly leaves a message on your wall, a threat written in lipstick on your mirror, or a rude word on your post-it notes. A classic claim is the infamous story of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borley_Rectory"&gt;Borley Rectory&lt;/a&gt; the original "Most Haunted Home in England", as researched by the early paranormal investigator &lt;a href="http://www.harryprice.co.uk/"&gt;Harry Price&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, ‘victim' Marianne Foyster was supposedly haunted by ghosts and poltergeists, and received spirit writing pleas for "light mass prayers" and "please get help". It's now believed that Mrs Reverend Foyster faked the phenomena to divert attention away from her extra-marital affairs.</summary><author><name>jrefmail@randi.org (Karen Stollznow)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246676122676"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/a_pacemaker_is_a_network_3.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f506a3d82347706e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Tutorials"/><title type="html">A Pacemaker is a Network</title><published>2009-07-04T02:04:05Z</published><updated>2009-07-04T02:04:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/2x0S5qXv5eI/a_pacemaker_is_a_network_3.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/a_pacemaker_is_a_network_3.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/05/a_pacemaker_is_a_network.php" title="A Pacemaker is a Network"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Pacemaker is a Network" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2006/06/ClockWeb%20logo2.JPG" width="104" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is going to be a challenging post to write for several reasons.  How do I explain that a paper that does not show too much new stuff is actually a seminal paper?  How do I condense a 12-page Cell paper describing a gazillion experiments without spending too much time on details of each experiment (as much as I'd love to do exactly that)?  How do I review it calmly and critically without gushing all over it and waxing poetically about its authors?  How do I put it in proper theoretical and historical perspective without unnecessarily insulting someone?  I'll give it a try and we'll see how it turns out (if you follow me under the fold).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clock Genes - a brief history of discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late 1990s were a period of amazing activity and rate of discovery in chronobiology, specifically in molecular basis of circadian rhythms.  Sure, a few mutations resulting in period changes or arrhythmicity &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/08/clock_genetics_a_short_history.php" title="short history of clock genetics"&gt;were known before&lt;/a&gt;, notably &lt;i&gt;period&lt;/i&gt; in fruitflies, &lt;i&gt;frequency&lt;/i&gt; in the fungus &lt;i&gt;Neurospora crassa&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;tau&lt;/i&gt; mutation in hamsters and some unidentified mutations in a couple of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/07/biological_clocks_in_protista.php" title=""&gt;Protista&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in 1995, as the molecular techniques came of age, flood-gates opened and new clock genes were discovered almost every week (or so it appeared).  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/a_pacemaker_is_a_network_3.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt;

Here is &lt;a href="http://www.thedailynewsonline.com/articles/2009/06/25/entertainment/5660603.txt"&gt;local news of it&lt;/a&gt;.  The film maker is Adrian Esposito.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Office of MR &amp;amp; DD has a &lt;a href="http://www.omr.state.ny.us/autism/hp_autism_storiesofsuccess.jsp"&gt;profile of Esposito&lt;/a&gt;, who found his expression through the medium of film.  Esposito has been actively engaged in film making since the age of 12, and he currently has his own film company &lt;a href="http://espocinema.wordpress.com/"&gt;Espocinema&lt;/a&gt;.  An interest he is hoping to turn into a career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the trailer for an AS-related film he made at 16. (not captioned, sorry)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/9TkrrcLgrMs%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esposito's focus seems to be on history and human rights issues.  A new film is planned "We Can Shine - From Institutions to Independence, will focus on the positive changes that have occurred in the treatment of people with disabilities and on self determination in their lives."  The documentary is intended to focus on Willowbrook.  Sounds like a project that is needed.  Much looking forward to Esposito's work in the future!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246662295243"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1557">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8d77d7087bf24240</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linguistics in the comics"/><title type="html">No word for bribery</title><published>2009-07-03T22:42:09Z</published><updated>2009-07-03T22:42:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1557" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In today's Doonesbury, Zonker riffs on the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1081"&gt;"no word for X" meme&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday in West Virginia, Governor Joe Manchin signed into law new legislation that is designed to encourage the creation of trust funds for the future support of children on the autism spectrum. As reported in &lt;a href="http://www.wvmetronews.com/index.cfm?func=displayfullstory&amp;amp;storyid=31065"&gt;Metro News&lt;/a&gt;, under the new legislation,  families with autistic children will be given a tax credit of up to $2,000 a year for contributions made to trust funds which are to be used when the children become adults; this new legislation is the "first of its kind in the country." Says Barbara Becker-Cottrill, &lt;a href="http://www.marshall.edu/coe/ATC/about.htm"&gt;Executive Director of the Autism Training Center&lt;/a&gt; which is located at &lt;a href="http://www.marshall.edu/"&gt;Marshall University&lt;/a&gt; in Huntington:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you have a child with autism, you've got, really, constant worry about what's going to happen to your child when they become an adult......It's 24/7 concern and, then, the true worry is what will happen to them if you're not there to care for them and love them?"&lt;br&gt;
....&lt;br&gt;
"This bill will provide, not just the tax credit for families in the here and now, but I really think it's going to give our families a sense of security, a sense that the future is a little brighter for their child when they become adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the kind of forward-thinking legislation one hopes to see more of, for the times when children become &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/an_artificial_distinction_services_for_children_and_for_adults"&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/when_everything_isnt_shiny_anymore"&gt;everything isn't shiny anymore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246657827423"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-836392116318258288">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f5a90af75b1fa779</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Meet My New Neighbors</title><published>2009-07-03T18:49:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-03T19:42:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/IaqdYa1vPvI/meet-my-new-neighbors.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/836392116318258288/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=836392116318258288" title="3 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/07/meet-my-new-neighbors.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_eJQiRrfoU4I/Sk5TbBPoQaI/AAAAAAAAAJk/ueGxkvDhq9g/s1600-h/MINISTRY.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="FLOAT:left;MARGIN:0px 10px 10px 0px;WIDTH:121px;HEIGHT:75px" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_eJQiRrfoU4I/Sk5TbBPoQaI/AAAAAAAAAJk/ueGxkvDhq9g/s320/MINISTRY.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The late Rev.

So far, we haven’t heard back from them. But those who know Cerullo said people are developing opinions before they know the facts.&lt;br&gt;Nick Rubio’s parent’s own the company building Cerullo’s home and he said he is working there during construction. He stresses that Cerullo has been involved in many businesses, other than the ministry.&lt;br&gt;Cerullo’s bio on the ministry website does state he’s worked internationally and had founded a successful advertising and public relations firm, a construction company and a management consulting firm.&lt;br&gt;“He was a businessman in real estate and he got into that, and developed that company up,“ said Rubio. “He’s a real genuine, sincere guy who loves God and loves the people that he’s helping.“&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-836392116318258288?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of teenagers misunderstood a woman's screams during sex and, thinking they were stopping an assault, beat a 25-year-old man in her bedroom, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I couldn’t see the screen clearly, but the segment was about unusual clouds in New York… and how some people saw Michael Jackson’s face in them. At the time I thought the segment was serious, but in fact it was Jeanne Moos doing her gag schtick, as &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoYTxwesSBU"&gt;you can see on You Tube&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/JoYTxwesSBU%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering about the actual MJ shot, here you go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/07/mjclouds.jpg" alt="Jacko in the clouds?"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a screen grab from the video. I suppose it looks a bit like Jackson, though, like most examples of faces in the clouds, it looks more like Lou Ferrigno. Or maybe a zombie. Take your pick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitpic.com/7hgix" title="Mammatus clouds on Twitpic"&gt;&lt;img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/twitpic/photos/full/12571881.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=0ZRYP5X5F6FSMBCCSE82&amp;amp;Expires=1246648428&amp;amp;Signature=Rr4OKTvoBW6g69wj4JEX6zdO0Mo%3D" width="150" height="150" alt="Mammatus clouds on Twitpic"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, the clouds in question here are called mammatus, and are actually quite common here in Colorado, and I’ve taken a lot of pictures of them, like the one shown here. I remember the first time I ever saw mammatus clouds; I was in Maryland and the remnants of a hurricane had swept through. The clouds were like little bulbs hanging down, and I had never seen anything like it before… so I’m not surprised that people freaked out a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I wonder, just how many people really &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; think this was a sign of some sort? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sham-on!&lt;/p&gt;

She doesn't give a good reason why; in an annoyingly chipper speech, she whines about the way she was being scrutinized for ethics violations, and the fact that she was currently an ineffective lame duck governor, and then announces that she's stepping down from office. It makes no sense at all, and it does say something about the weakness of her character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brave Dame Sarah ran away. &lt;br&gt;
("No!") &lt;br&gt;
Bravely ran away away. &lt;br&gt;
("I didn't!") &lt;br&gt;
When danger reared it's ugly shead, &lt;br&gt;
She bravely turned her tail and fled. &lt;br&gt;
("no!") &lt;br&gt;
Yes, brave Dame Sarah turned about &lt;br&gt;
("I didn't!") &lt;br&gt;
And gallantly she chickened out. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Bravely taking ("I never did!") to her feet, &lt;br&gt;
She beat a very brave retreat. &lt;br&gt;
("all lies!") &lt;br&gt;
Bravest of the braaaave, Dame Sarah! &lt;br&gt;
("I never!")&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember this if (when) she runs for president in 2012.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked my SciBling GrrrlScientist of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/" title=""&gt;Living the Scientific Life&lt;/a&gt; blog to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="GrrlScientistElektra.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/GrrlScientistElektra.jpg" width="336" height="448" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I write the blog, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/" title=""&gt;Living the Scientific Life (Scientist, Interrupted)&lt;/a&gt;, under the pseudonym, GrrlScientist. I held a Postdoctoral Fellowship in the molecular evolution of parrots, a PhD in Zoology (Ornithology) and a bachelor's degree in Microbiology and Immunology (emphasis: Virology). I have bred, worked with and lived with a variety of parrot species for most of my life, specializing in the lories (loriinae), which are brightly-colored nectar-feeding parrots of the south Pacific islands. I also have worked as a research technician in cancer research and in HIV/AIDS research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good question. Until quite recently, I made many career plans and worked very very hard to achieve them. However, since I have been unemployed for so long, I no longer have the luxury of making any sort of plans at all, or striving to accomplish them. Now, I am quite preoccupied with simply paying my rent. I often feel as though I am writing for my life (sort of like "running for my life").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I met a friend for coffee a few weeks back, and she said that my career is writing a blog. Professional blogger. Ugh, I hate that word, "blogger". Until she mentioned that, I had never thought about writing a blog as being a career, nor as an especially respectable career. But her observation does make sense because I work on my blog every day of the week, for 6-15 hours per day -- just like when I was working on my postdoc research. My devotion to my blog keeps me from becoming overwhelmed by the worries and realities of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I no longer know what I want to do when I grow up. Except for my blog, I feel quite disillusioned and disenfranchised, and often&lt;br&gt;
alienated from society. But I would like to be happy and healthy at some point in the future, though. Just to prove it is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet is an amazing way for an intellectual to be exposed to a tremendous amount of new information and different ways of thinking, for communicating this information to others, and for testing new ideas in a public forum. I've always enjoyed learning new ideas and sharing this information with others. For me, part of learning includes making new information "mine" by writing about it in my own words. I've written for most of my life and had my articles published in a variety of magazines, newsletters and other print sources, but I've never before enjoyed the reach and power that I have on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;At the Conference, you led a session about Nature blogging. Is there a distinction between Science blogging and Nature blogging? What did you learn from that session?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some audience members thought of science blogging as a subcategory of Nature blogging, while others thought the reverse. My own opinion is that science and nature blog writing are separate, but often overlapping, topic areas. My conference co-host, Kevin, and I worked out a series of questions in advance, posted them on my blog and asked my readers as well as the conference participants to write responses to those questions in comments or on a piece of paper, which we later summarized and published on our blogs. After everyone had finished writing their answers, we discussed each question. But the level of passion was unexpected, and the depth and thoughtfulness with which everyone addressed these questions was really inspirational. The&lt;br&gt;
seminar hour flew by, and we did not manage to get even halfway through these questions, but everyone really enjoyed this discussion, and Kevin and I certainly did, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the days when I had a real job, I never wrote while working. Instead, I wrote during the time when I could have been hanging out in pubs. But that all changed when my postdoc funding ended before I managed to find another paying position. But five years out, if you believe that writing a blog can be a full-time job, then I'd say that blogging IS my work, since that is the one constant in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rely on social networks for two things; rapidly spreading the word about interesting blog entries and as news feeds that provide material for me to write about. Some of you may have noticed that my blogging style has changed somewhat recently -- a change that I am not altogether happy about. Currently, I am learning how to balance my need to read and learn about "everything" that pops up on those social networks with my desire to write about such things for others. When I finally manage to establish this balance, my readers will no doubt be the first to know because my blog writing style will once again change to reflect this, it will become something that I am happier with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started writing a science blog in 2004 in complete ignorance of the existence of any other blogs on this subject area. However, I quickly found other science and medical blogs and bloggers and made a tremendous effort to join the community by commenting on other blogs and hosting science blog carnivals, and keeping up an extensive private email correspondence with other science and medical blog writers. That said, I don't feel comfortable "playing favorites", especially since there are so many high-quality science and medical blogs out there that I read and enjoy. (I have stopped being a prolific commenter). I did not discover new science blogs while at the conference since I am fairly well-acquainted with most of them, but I DID discover many wonderful people "out there" who write blogs about science and other topics. In my opinion, this is the real gift of conferences like this: fleetingly rare and wonderful face time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your work, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spent years hiding my blog's existence from everyone, and denying that I was the author in those rare circumstances when asked about my blog. This created a huge disconnect between my online life and my "real" life. The overall gestalt of the conference transformed me because I met so many readers -- mine and other blog readers -- and found that they are so astute and intelligent. This experience added depth to my perception about blog readers in general from being "people" in an abstract sense to being warm and caring individuals -- friends I have not met (face to face) --  yet. That was the single most positive aspect among many about this conference that daily affects how I think about blog reading and writing and about my readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the interview. One of my goals for 2010 is to return to North Carolina to share in the fun and the discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

However, it's important not to mislead about what an assistive technology really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost passed up &lt;a href="http://www.ivanhoe.com/channels/p_channelstory.cfm?storyid=21511"&gt;Weighted Belt for Autism? -- Research Summary&lt;/a&gt; because, well, it's not, in fact, anything resembling a "research summary" (or even a well written or interesting article).  But then it is pretty illustrative of this theme.  Why would anyone think the application of a piece of assistive technology--a weighted belt--would be a "cure" for anything?  Any more than a car is a "cure" for not being able to run really fast?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes unrealistic expectations get put on a device.  Once a man observed me use my speech device--something I have high levels of skill in.  "I want one just like that," the man told others, and VR purchased him one.  Then I was asked to help show him how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I touch-type 80 - 90 words a minute, have been using typing-as-conversation for decades, my communication processes function natively in writing far better than they do in speech, and I've had benefit of working with an SLP who specializes in assistive technology.  Unfortunately, the man is an exceptionally slow hunt-and-peck typer with a preference for speech over writing.  And I am no SLP.  This lead to some disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, here's a second story:  My state has a lovely &lt;a href="http://www.puc.state.or.us/PUC/rspf/tdap.shtml"&gt;program&lt;/a&gt; to enable all individuals to have telephone access.  I have a speaker phone through this program, and my speech device right next to it.  However, I don't use the telephone any more than I did before I had this system.  Because, well, I don't have any better phone skills than I did before I had this system.  I still have no clue when it's my turn to speak, can't understand most of what an unfamiliar voice is saying, and any number of other things that make using the telephone functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-parter key point here is that, one, assistive technology can make a HUGE difference in the types of activities that are available to a person.  I can do things with AT that I could never dream of doing without.  But, two, this is not because of the device itself.  A device is just a device.  What makes a device truly functional is the individual who uses it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it's technology for sensory needs like a weighted belt (or my beloved extra heavy, knee-high boots), or a speech device, or a telephone, or anything all else, the usefulness of the item is going to depend on the skill, needs, and personality of the person using it as much as it is on the device.  And successful use of a device is akin to successful use of a car or a computer--it's not a cure for anything, it's technology that enables us to do things we could not do otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246639296184"><id gr:original-id="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/?p=1788">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8d4e35f4899f4e40</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="ADD/ADHD"/><category term="Arthritis"/><category term="Coping strategies"/><category term="Pain"/><category term="Random Thoughts"/><title type="html">What she said was, “Aquacise”</title><published>2009-07-03T15:33:39Z</published><updated>2009-07-03T15:33:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/what-she-said-was-aquacise/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/" type="html">Random thought:

It’s an alternative way to get back to the Moon, and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOnlAUpYWoc"&gt;they made a video for it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/xOnlAUpYWoc%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some obvious advantages with taking Shuttle parts and using them in a new program. For one, the technology already exists and has been tested in well over 100 launches. For another, the machinery and manpower already exist as well, which would save billions of dollars in new development and training. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m a little nervous seeing things like the same external tank being used that sheds foam on launch (in the video, the hardware mounted on the ET is protected by a fairing, but still, that doesn’t thrill me), and is prone to hydrogen vent leaks, like the leak that has delayed &lt;em&gt;Endeavour’s&lt;/em&gt; launch for weeks. Second, the solid rocket boosters as they exist now are not the best tech; they are expensive and cost a lot to refurbish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s easy for me to poopoo this; it’s always easier to cast stones after the fact. Maybe this is a better idea than Constellation, and maybe not. I’ve never liked the Shuttle Orbiters; they are hugely overbuilt and extremely expensive. They are exquisite and amazing and all that, but from a cost/benefit point of view they’re a colossal waste of money. We need cheaper access to space! So not having an Orbiter on this Plan B Moonship is a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest: I have not been able to follow all the intrigue going on with Constellation right now because it’s complex and there are machinations afoot that are complicated. But I find it extremely odd that — with only a handful of Shuttle launches left before an at least four year gap in being able to get people into space — NASA is still presenting plans for a Shuttle substitute. Seriously, NASA: this should’ve been in the bag five years ago. &lt;em&gt;Ten&lt;/em&gt;. Then we wouldn’t be facing a lengthy gap where we have to rely on foreign partners to get to space, and domestic companies that, while their futures are very bright, do not have the capacity to launch people into space and won’t for several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I’d rather have alternatives discussed now rather than build an expensive and untested rocket that might prove to be another ISS or Shuttle program: bloated and unable to do most of what was initially promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let me say that this very fact ticks me off. I want access to space, and I don’t want a lot of corporate maneuvering and political sideshowing. But with hundreds of billions of dollars at stake and a government agency in charge, it’s what we get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still support a return to the Moon… if done correctly. But it’s things like this that make me wonder if this whole thing is a good idea on paper, but an impossibility in reality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246637918258"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8001">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e8f14b21e750790a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="YouTube"/><category term="alternative medicine"/><category term="Homeopathy"/><category term="mitchell and webb"/><category term="sexist ads"/><title type="html">That Mitchell and Webb Look: Homeopathy</title><published>2009-07-03T16:00:53Z</published><updated>2009-07-03T16:00:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8001" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of people sent this one in, and for good reason (Patrick, Chris, and Sean, thanks!).

Patterson described his cryptosystem in detail, and boasted that without the key — which he didn&amp;#39;t provide — decryption of his message would &amp;quot;defy the united ingenuity of the whole human race&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After more than 200 years, the code was finally broken by Dr. Lawren Smithline, a mathematician at the Center for Communications Research in Princeton, N.J., using a technique originally developed for biological sequence comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be the premise for a new Dan Brown novel, if Patterson's message were sufficiently bizarre and consequential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, his sample encryption turned out to be simply the preamble to the Declaration of Independence. You can read more about the code in an article by Rachel Emma Silverman, "&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124648494429082661.html"&gt;Two Centuries On, a Cryptologist Cracks a Presidential Code&lt;/a&gt;", WSJ, 7/2/2009, which also a nice &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124648494429082661.html#articleTabs%3Dinteractive%26project%3DCIPHER0907"&gt;flash animation of the ciphering method&lt;/a&gt;. Details of the crytanalysis can be found in Lawren M. Smithline, "&lt;a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/2009/2/a-cipher-to-thomas-jefferson"&gt;A Cipher to Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;", American Scientist, March-April 2009 (subscription required).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing in Patterson's letter was his list of desiderata for a system of "secret writing":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Patterson.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Patterson.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;1. It should be equally adapted to all languages.&lt;br&gt;
2. It should be easily learned and retained in memory.&lt;br&gt;
3. It should be written and read with facility &amp;amp; dispatch.&lt;br&gt;
4. (Which is the most essential property) it should be absolutely inscrutable to all unacquainted with the particular key or secret for decyphering.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patterson's system certainly scores well on points 1-3, but as Smithline showed, it fails on point 4.  I'm not sure how it compares in strength to some of the better alternatives available in 1801, for example &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher"&gt;Vigenère ciphers&lt;/a&gt;, either in principle or in the cryptanalytic practice of the time. If Patterson's method were combined with a Vigenère cipher, neither Smithline's method nor the standard methods for solving Vigenère ciphers would work, and perhaps the result would have been effectively unbreakable with the methods available in 1801, I'm not sure. In comparison, Bruce Schneier's low-tech &lt;a href="http://www.schneier.com/solitaire.html"&gt;Solitaire&lt;/a&gt; algorithm is said to be effectively unbreakable even with modern techniques and machinery, but it's a good deal more troublesome on points 2 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, Patterson's system seems never to have been used in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange between Patterson and Jefferson reinforces what we already know about Jefferson&amp;#39;s intellectual breadth. In 1801, Jefferson was president of the American Philosophical Society as well as of the United States, and Patterson was the A.P.S. vice-president.  For another window on their relationship — and on Jefferson&amp;#39;s intellect — see his letter to Patterson of Nov. 10, 1811, on &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/P/tj3/writings/brf/jefl212.htm"&gt;the subject of a fixed standard of measures, weights and coins&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But reading the &lt;a href="http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1700s/patterson_robert.html"&gt;biographical sketch of Robert Patterson&lt;/a&gt; in Penn's archives reminded me of some other important characteristics of American culture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Robert Patterson, the son of Robert Patterson and Jane Walkers, was born on May 30, 1743 on a lease-held farm near Hillsborough, County Down, Ireland. His family was respectable, though not affluent. Patterson attended school at an early age and soon became distinguished for his love of learning. He excelled in mathematics, but his family could not afford to pay for a university education. In 1759, when the French invaded Ireland, Patterson enlisted in the militia, and after serving for a year, rose to the rank of sergeant. He devoted himself to his military exercises, and soon became distinguished enough for his skill and good conduct to attract the attention of the officers of a British regiment stationed near Hillsborough, who offered him a commission in the regular army. Patterson refused this commission, choosing instead to return home to work on the family farm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In October of 1768, determined to try his fortune in America, Patterson embarked for Philadelphia, arriving there almost penniless. After spending a week in Philadelphia, Patterson set out on foot for Bucks County in order to seek employment as a schoolmaster. He was immediately hired at a school in Buckingham.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Although Patterson had a natural talent for teaching, he decided to make more use of his mathematical talents, especially his knowledge of determining longitude through the use of lunar observations, and moved back to Philadelphia to teach navigation. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In 1772, with his finances vastly improved, Patterson was persuaded by a friend to invest his money in merchandise and open a country store in New Jersey. However, since he was unsuccessful as a shopkeeper, he was happy to accept a position as Principal of the Wilmington Academy in Delaware in 1774.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, his duties as Principal were suspended due to the fact that many of the students at the Wilmington Academy were called home. After removing his family to a small farm near Roadstown, New Jersey, Patterson enlisted as a military instructor in the Delaware militia, then under the command of Colonel John Haslet. He later served under Colonel David Hall, first in the medical corps and then as a brigade major. He remained in the militia until the British army evacuated Philadelphia and New Jersey in 1778, when his brigade was disbanded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In 1779, after the College and Academy were reorganized into the University [of Pennsylvania], Patterson successfully applied to Dr. Ewing, the Provost, for employment as Professor of Mathematics. He was Professor of Mathematics from 1779 to 1810, Professor of Natural Philosophy and Mathematics from 1810 to 1813 and Vice-Provost from 1810 to 1813.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that it happens anymore, in the U.S. or elsewhere, that someone becomes a university professor without ever having attended a college or university as a student.  But America is still a place where immigrants can find opportunities denied to them in their homeland. And it's also a place where people often have second and third chances to find their calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other note in Patterson's bio resonated with me in a personal way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Patterson resided at nine different locations in Philadelphia, beginning            at 148 South Fourth and ending at 285 Chestnut Street. It was said that            he only remembered the latter address because the second digit was the            cube of the first and the third was the mean of the first two. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always had a terrible memory for numbers, and this is exactly the sort of mnemonic that I've always resorted to. For example, after all these years, I still remember the standard Philadelphia telephone area code, 215, by keeping in mind that the second digit is half the first, and the third is the sum of the second and the square of the first.  It seems illogical that this sort of thing should help, but it does!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[By the way, I note that determining &lt;a href="http://www.historicalatlas.com/lunars/"&gt;longitude by lunars&lt;/a&gt; was apparently only described as a practical method in 1767 (at least, that was the date when the &lt;em&gt;Theoria lunae juxta systema Newtonianum&lt;/em&gt; was published). So for Patterson to start teaching it in 1769 or so was fast work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder whether he learned about it from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Mason"&gt;Charles Mason&lt;/a&gt;, of Mason-Dixon fame, who seems to have spent parts of 1767-68 in the Philadelphia area.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246636627950"><id gr:original-id="http://themaroon.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/how-are-we-cooking-the-goose/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/24479b82f4fcd83e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">How Are We Cooking The Goose?</title><published>2009-07-03T13:22:42Z</published><updated>2009-07-03T13:22:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com/2009/07/03/how-are-we-cooking-the-goose/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://mattmaroon.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/statshot/how_are_we_cooking_the_goose?utm_source=onion_rss_daily"&gt;&lt;img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/themaroon/rJkwoGsFxiDIJxmlFseyrunHwBlzrEGHljybhxlqgHxzEJtuEfxbxGjauErp/media_httpwwwtheonioncomcontentfilesimagesonionimagearticle2023jpg_fHxEeDdshsydcge.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="350"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chairman: “I would like to call this emergency meeting to order and thank you all for coming under short notice.  If there are no objections, I will dispense with the usual formalities and get right to the business at hand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murmur of approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman: Ladies, Gentleman and Demons of all kinds, we have been, to use the vernacular of the day, outed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murmur of consternation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voice from the crowd: “I am most certainly not gay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman: “Not gay.  We have been outed as a society. The Evil Society of the Evil Medical Industrial Complex, our beloved ESEMIC,  is no longer secret.  Our works have been discovered.  The true meaning of the Caduceus has been published for all to see.  And by your fruits you shall be known.  Sorry demons”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louder murmur of consternation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loud voice from the crowd: “I demand to know how this occurred.  This is impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shouts of agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman:  “If you will please all remain calm, I will explain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman: “As you know, our symbol is the Caduceus, two snakes entwined on a staff with wings on the top.  For years we have been promulgating the story that this became a symbol of medicine on accident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most of the world uses the single serpent entwined staff of Asklepios, the ancient Greco-Roman God of medicine, as the symbol of medicine. Not, however, the US. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We like to say it was due to the ignorance of one Captain Frederick Reynolds of the United States Army Medical Core, who, in 1902, as part of a uniform redesign, suggested the Caduceus as the symbol of the medical Corps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We spent a not small amount of time and money fabricating correspondence between Captain Reynolds and the Surgeon General demonstrating that Captain Reynolds did not know the difference between a Caduceus and the staff of Asklepios.  Captain Reynolds assured the Surgeon General that the Caduceus was the universal symbol of medicine, when in fact is was a printers mark, a branding, found on medical texts of the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We managed to make it look like it was an accident that a printers branding mark became the symbol of US medicine.  We even had to change Surgeon Generals to make sure the Caduceus was accepted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voice in the crowd: “Er, if the correspondence had to be manufactured then why did we have to change the Surgeon General?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pause&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman: ” I wasn’t there at the time.  But you can’t be too careful.  For the last century, as a result of its widespread adoption, the Caduceus has been furthering our agenda by powerful subconscious mind control due to its subliminal iconography.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another voice in the crowd: “I have been meaning to ask this for years.  Since virtually no one in the US has any knowledge of Greek history, how can the Caduceus, or any symbol, exert any subconscious influence.  If a staff or a snake or a wing are just those to the observer, how can have any effect? Isn’t a  cigar sometimes just a cigar?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman:  “That is the power of symbols.  Even if the observer has zero understanding of the symbolic significance of the symbol, it still transmits the information into the brain.  Symbols have memory, unlike water.  It is, as I understand these things, a quantum mechanical effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Be that as it may, we have been found out.  The true nature and use of the Caduceus has been revealed on the interwebs for all to see and we need to decide what to do about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voice in the audience: “So exactly what happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman:  “It was, of course, the Natural News.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loud hub bub of anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman. “Yes the Natural News.  Only the Weekly World News has been a greater thorn in our side in our quest for world medical domination. How they continue to find and publish the truth that we don’t want them to know I cannot understand.  I wonder if we have a traitor in out midst.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But that is a topic for another meeting. We are investigating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Natural news published expose on the Caduceus entitled “The Caduceus Decoded: Secret Symbols Reveal Dark Agenda of Western Medicine ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our greatest secret laid bare.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quote&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That the two snakes representing evil would encircle the staff of public announcement could be an indication that the purpose of the staff is to announce evil (the propaganda of western medicine). At the same time, the mythological carrier of the staff is the protector of liars and thieves (the drug promoters and drug companies).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fortunately they fail to realize that we have to power to see into the future.  Thats how we knew that 100 years before the rise of the medical industrial complex and our beloved society, that we would need a symbol to demonstrate our mission to spread evil and protect big pharma.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let me continue quoting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That the two snakes representing evil would encircle the staff of public announcement could be an indication that the purpose of the staff is to announce evil (the propaganda of western medicine). At the same time, the mythological carrier of the staff is the protector of liars and thieves (the drug promoters and drug companies).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fortunately they fail to realize that we have to power to see into the future.  Thats how we knew that 100 years before the rise of the medical industrial complex and our beloved society, that we would need a symbol to demonstrate our mission to spread evil and protect big pharma.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let me continue quoting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once you understand the symbology, it becomes quite evident that this prominent symbol of western medicine was not chosen by chance: It sends a powerful subconscious message, much like the symbols of secret societies used on dollar bills, for example (the all-seeing eye floating above the pyramid on the back of the dollar bill). It might even be said that, through the repetition of this symbol which adorns the most important documents and texts used in the medical schools, doctors are, in a very true sense, being continuously indoctrinated with the powerful symbols of evil and death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are on to us.  They have discovered our true purpose.  Years ago, at the first convocation of the The Evil Society of the Evil Medical Industrial Complex wise heads suggested it would be foolish to broadcast out intent, even in an obscure symbol.  It was voted down.   Such arrogance and hubris on our part, that such power would go unnoticed.  I quote further:”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And all the while, they sit in their offices, with a dozen diplomas on the walls, many containing the Caduceus symbol that is effectively broadcasting a message into the office space of that doctor, further imprinting his mind with the death agenda of modern medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I cannot tell you how upset we are at this revelation.  Our supreme weapon, emanating death and evil and brainwashing all who gaze upon it, revealed to everyone.  We had thought it impossible.  We even had the Caduceus evaluated by Harvard symbolist Robert Langdon, who assured us that the symbology was impenetrable to all but the most brilliant minds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voice from the crowd:  “Um, isn’t Robert Langdon a fictional character?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman:  “That’s what we want you to believe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murmurs of surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And our links to our demon brethren are also at risk for exposure.  I quote:”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If all this sounds a bit odd to you, it might be worth asking yourself this question: Why are all the institutions of power in modern society obsessed with the secret use of such symbols? The entire layout of Washington D.C., for example, is based on Satanic and Masonic symbology…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are such symbols printed on our currency? A floating all-seeing eye above a pyramid… Isn’t that a little spooky? But check your own dollars right now: It’s there, keeping an eye on YOU. (It looks similar to the Eye of Sauron from the Lord of the Rings…) Why is the Pentagon, the building occupied by creators of war and death, shaped like a pentagon? The five-sided geometric structure is, of course, closely related to Satanism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voice: Um, doesn’t the dollar predate the Lord of the Rings and isn’t Sauron a fictional character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman;  “Ask that of our demon brethren.  There really is no such thing as ‘fiction’. Soon they will find our links to Masons, the Trilateral commission, the Iluminatii and  eventually to our Lizard overlords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voice: “We can never be traced to our Lizard overlords.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman:  “Our symbology will lead them right to us. They mention it in the article.  quote If you really want to delve into the bizarre world of symbols and secret societies, read books by David Icke. end quote. Icke is the one who discovered the hidden existence of our lizard overlords, who, by the way, I of course welcome.  It is now just a matter of time before the news is worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voice:  “So what are we to do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman “Deny it, of course,  Phrase it right and it will look like the imaginings of a conspiracy theorist.  Stick with the story that the Caduceus is a clerical error with no understood significance beyond branding.  It has no more deeper significance than Golden Arches.  We need to have a uniform front.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But we have one card up our sleeve. We managed to get one of our symbolists into the offices of the Natural News.  Our man chose their symbol.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A circle of green with swirling leaves.  The hidden message is clear.  The circle is the mouth of a vortex, the leaves are that of death that occurs in the fall, the green the color of putrefaction.  It is a powerful symbol radiating the message that natural medicine will pull you into a vortex of death and disease.  And they do not suspect a thing.  Our symbols are more powerful than theirs and in the end, we will triumph.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Be ready my friends.  We have will have further battles to fight. I turn the meeting over to our brother representing pharma…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the tape mysteriously ends with a short yelp followed by what sounds oddly like a komodo  dragons eating a piece of meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there any way you could do some legwork and verify this story?&lt;a href="http://current.com/items/90301786_scientists-make-radio-waves-travel-faster-than-light.htm?xid=ch60"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://current.com/items/90301786_scientists-make-radio-waves-travel-faster-than-light.htm?xid=ch60"&gt;Scientists Make Radio Waves Travel Faster Than Light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to be a rather extraordinary claim….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike D. Seattle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the question Mike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxymoronic claims of light traveling faster than light happen every 2.4 years so I knew we were due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the gist of the linked article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main claim is that John Singleton and his buddies from Los Alamos National Laboratory can make radio waves travel faster than light. He does this using a device called a polarization synchrotron which emits radio waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How superluminal speed is accomplished is left to the imagination except for this quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Singleton has created a gadget that abuses radio waves so severely that they finally give in and travel faster than light.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooookay,….Is light abuse a crime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:252px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogimages/synchrotron.jpg" alt="Polarization Synchrotron " width="242" height="373"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polarization Synchrotron &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course Einstein is brought up in the article. Everyone knows he proved that the speed of light is not just a good idea…it’s the law, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I read this quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Einstein predicted that particles and information can’t travel faster than the speed of light — but phenomenon like radio waves? That’s a different story, said Singleton, a Los Alamos National Laboratory Fellow”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;br&gt;
Aren’t radio waves light? Aren’t they composed of photons that carry information? This has to be a mis-quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article then mentions how pulsars emit pulses of radio waves that are so powerful that scientists are “baffled”. Yes, they used the B word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tie-in to nature then is the idea that this machine emits radio waves that are similar to how pulsars do it and this somehow explains why they are so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then explore some of the possible applications of this technology like cell phones that can connect directly to satellites with no need for relay towers. Another potential use is targeted chemotherapy in which the radiation activates a special drug that is delivered near a tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, there is a quote from someone named “Perez”. The problem is, there is no mention of a  first name or what  connection this person has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a weird &lt;a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/HealthandScience/LANL_scientist_makes_radio_waves_travel_faster_than_light"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; under the title of the article to a  SantaFeNewMexican.com article with almost the same title. Once you read that, it’s clear much of this article was taken from that article and the writer forgot to clarify who Perez is in an apparently rushed cut &amp;amp; paste. (He is a colleague of Singleton)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty much it for that article. It was very vague and pretty much lazy, crappy, sensationalistic journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s what my research turned up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may think that the confusion stems from the difference  between the phase velocity of light and group velocity. These describe the various ways light waves can move which can give the  illusion of superluminal travel. This is usually the ultimate reason behind claims of light going faster than light. I don’t think this distinction is the reason behind the confusion this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found an article commenter (&lt;a href="http://digg.com/general_sciences/Scientists_Make_Radio_Waves_Travel_Faster_Than_Light"&gt;ianhiggs&lt;/a&gt;) who claims to be  an undergraduate of Los Alamos and works on this project. I know, I know….this is the internet we’re talking about. He did sound knowledgeable to me though and he supplied a host of technical links that no one else did. Anyway…Here’s some of his key quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“John Singleton was horribly, horribly misquoted in this article”&lt;br&gt;
‘Please, do not think poorly of John; this article is a travesty, and he is one of the most intelligent people I know’&lt;br&gt;
“He was not allowed to review this article before its publishing, so it contains a number of incorrect assertions”&lt;br&gt;
“I assure you, no radio waves are traveling faster than light.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what the hell is really happening then???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the Polarization Synchrontron with all the electrodes? A computer controlled voltages is sent across these electrodes which  makes a changing polarization pattern that moves along the device creating  radio waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that is where the superluminal confusion  comes in. This polarization pattern can move faster than light without anything physical doing it. Imagine a series of light bulbs being lit one after the other in super-rapid succession. If you do it fast enough, they can be turned on in a pattern that moves faster than light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=GR/M52205/01"&gt;words&lt;/a&gt; of the researchers themselves:&lt;br&gt;
“The use of polarization charge, which is massless, also enables the device to be used to investigate superluminal sources”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the key. We’re talking about superluminal sources of light… not superluminal photons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that the real claim these scientists are making is not about an FTL breakthrough. They claim their light (and hence pulsar light) does not attenuate or decay like regular light does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the inverse square law of light? The intensity of light is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) from the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 divided by [r squared].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogimages/inversesquarelaw.jpg" alt="" width="385" height="256"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, move the sun to twice its current distance and we’d receive one fourth the intensity we do now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scientists claim that the light they make decays more slowly:  1/r instead of 1/[r squared].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They claim this happens  because light gets piled up on top of itself since the source is moving faster than the light itself. This creates a laser-like collimated beam of energy which would explain why the pulsars apparently don’t follow the inverse square law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the true story here. People hear superluminal though and they go all crazy and miss the entire point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even this decay-rate claim however may have problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretical physicist John Hannay &lt;a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/19957"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that even conventional sources of radio light can produce slowly decaying light over very short distances. He believes if the scientists change their experiment to test the light after it has traveled tens of kilometres rather than hundreds of meters, then the effect would go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there you have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light does not go faster than light. It may decay more slowly in some instances but then again, it might not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bob Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246632671296"><id gr:original-id="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1864">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b27886fdaf917b0c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Accident and Emergency: alternative style</title><published>2009-07-03T14:28:20Z</published><updated>2009-07-03T14:28:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1864" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Hilarious.</summary><author><name>David Colquhoun</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246632671295"><id gr:original-id="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1848">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/438b339641f7ab6c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Schizophrenia: hoopla, disappointment and science journalism</title><published>2009-07-03T10:43:20Z</published><updated>2009-07-03T10:43:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1848" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">On July 1st. the journal Nature, published three reports that described genetic differences between people with schizophrenia and the rest of us.

Linking to a &lt;a href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/578/how-the-public-resolves-conflicts-between-faith-and-science"&gt;Pew essay&lt;/a&gt; relating many important public opinion stats on science and religion in America, Dr. Coyne observes that these data show science and religion aren’t really compatible, “but Chris Mooney tweaks them a bit to claim the opposite.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not aware of having “tweaked” any survey data. At issue is &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/06/22/how-can-we-rouse-the-silent-majority/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; of mine, which doesn’t even directly report any of the data–it merely links the Pew essay, quotes its conclusion, and broadly interprets the data therein differently than Dr. Coyne now interprets them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us assume that Dr. Coyne actually disagrees with my &lt;em&gt;interpretation&lt;/em&gt; of the data, and is not really accusing me of data manipulation. Indeed, so far as I can tell the data themselves are completely uncontested by both of us. What is very contested, though, is what these data &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; for the debate we are having over accommodationism. So let’s dig into that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coyne quotes the following passage from Pew’s David Masci, and suggests that it demonstrates science-religion incompatibility (Coyne’s emphasis included):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite SNL skits was &lt;a href="http://snltranscripts.jt.org/93/93fsmalley.phtml"&gt;Daily Affirmation with Stuart Smalley&lt;/a&gt;, played by Minnesota’s new junior senator.  The humor of the skit, as is often the case, was in the fact that it was just a slight exaggeration of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smalley was a self-help guru whose schtick was the daily affirmation – psychotherapy through simple-minded positive self statements. His catch phrase was, “Because I’m good enough, I’m smart enough, and, doggonit, people like me!”He was a caricature of every insipid simple-minded pop psychologist peddling easy answers to people with problems for the entertainment of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smalley was also an indictment of the self-help industry, which is all about substituting easy gimicks for real problem solving.  For a good overview, listen to &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/archive/podcastinfo.aspx?mid=1&amp;amp;pid=55"&gt;our interview with Steve Salerno&lt;/a&gt;, author of SHAM – How the self-help movement made America helpless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologist &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/archive/podcastinfo.aspx?mid=1&amp;amp;pid=204"&gt;Richard Wiseman’s&lt;/a&gt; latest book, 59 Seconds, also contains a harsh criticism of the self-help industry, focusing on the fact that it is not evidence-based. Mainly, self-help gurus just make stuff up. Meanwhile, there is a vast literature of psychological research that contains actually useful information that offers practical knowledge. For example, telling children that they have done a good job turns out to be a bad idea. This just makes them anxious about their future performance and fearful of failure. However, if you praise them for working hard they will encourage them to work hard the next time – because they have absolute control over how hard they work, but not the final outcome. This is one of those notions that seems counter-intuitive at first, but them makes complete sense once it is explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same, it turns out, is true of daily affirmations. A &lt;a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/media/releases/2009/wood.cfm"&gt;recent study published in Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt; finds that for people with low self esteem saying positive self-affirmations actually lowered their self-esteem. For people with high self-esteem at baseline, affirmations has only a slightly positive effect.  Seem counter-intuitive at first, but researchers Wood, Lee, and Perunovic believe that for people with low self-esteem the self-affirmation just makes them consider how untrue the contrived statement is, lowering their self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They liken this to excessive praise. If a parent tells a child that that they are the most wonderful child in the world, they are likely to just role their eyes. Unrealistic praise is not as effective as more targeted and realistic praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19491331?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;Other research&lt;/a&gt; shows that self-affirmation can be counterproductive in that it encourages confirmation bias in dismissing negative information about ourselves – information threatening to our self-esteem. In other words, people recently exposed to affirming statements were more likely to rationalize away information that potentially had negative implications for their self-esteem.  The authors conclude: “By ameliorating the threat, self-affirmations can elicit less effective reasoning strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the story about self-affirmation is much more complicated than I have covered so far, and the information is not all bad. There is evidence that affirming statements may promote good behaviors, like &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19025270?ordinalpos=7&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;more healthy eating habits&lt;/a&gt;.  Self-affirmation also seems to make people less defensive and more open to health information, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17605563?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=1&amp;amp;log$=relatedarticles&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;such as the dangers of smoking&lt;/a&gt;. However, at the same time (except for the study on eating above) most of the evidence shows that there is no positive effect on actual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other affirmation may make people &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17723057?ordinalpos=15&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;more open to compromise&lt;/a&gt;. This one makes sense – if you butter people up (but don’t overdo it) they will be less defensive and more open to negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most psychological questions, the effects of self-affirmation are complex and not completely understood. It seems that they have a negative effect on people with low self-esteem. For people with average to high self-esteem, there is a slightly positive effect which can make people less defensive and more open, but also more likely to use confirmation bias to dismiss esteem-threatening information. And, the effects of self-affirmation on actual behavior seems debatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t confuse self-help gurus with the facts. It’s difficult to market complexity and uncertainty, so the self-help industry takes the Stuart Smalley approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer the evidence-based approach, and the interesting thing is that there is a wealth of useful evidence in the psychological literature. The problem is that there is a disconnect between this information and the public, and the self-help industry is filling the gulf with misinformation. That is why I applaud the efforts of &lt;a href="http://www.richardwiseman.com/"&gt;Richard Wiseman&lt;/a&gt; and others to connect actual research evidence to the public in easy-to-digest nuggets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is generally the goal of the skeptical movement – to connect the public with actual science rather than the “cheap imitation.”  And we are succeeding – because we are good enough, we are smart enough, and doggonit people like us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, there is no simple genetic basis for schizophrenia. The pooled results of the three studies gave 8,014 cases and 19,090 controls.  A huge amount of genetic analysis was involved. Many thousands of small genetic differences were found between the schizophrenics and the controls, but no single mutation alone had much effect.  There could be even more, because it is still not possible to sequence the entire genome of so many people.  . In total, the effects of the many small differences might account for 30 percent of the disease risk. That’s more than the few percent that could be predicted before, though it’s still well short of the 70 or 80 percent figure that is often quoted for the genetic component of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is observed is a &lt;em&gt;correlation&lt;/em&gt; between differences in the genome and having schizophrenia. The results don’t tell us directly about the &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; of schizophrenia, and they don’t even (so far anyway) tell us much about the mechanisms that give rise to schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The reporting of this event makes a fascinating contrast in styles of scientific journalism. I’ll compare only two of the reports. One is by Steve Connor &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/unlocked-the-secrets-of-schizophrenia-1727987.html"&gt;in the Independent&lt;/a&gt; (he of the &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/07/steve-connor-is-getting-eggy/"&gt;recent contretemps&lt;/a&gt;).  The other is by Nicholas Wade in &lt;a href="http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/hoopla-and-disappointment-in-schizophrenia-research/?em"&gt;the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/indie1.jpg" alt="Independent science"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/indie2.jpg" alt="Independent schizophrenia headline"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headline sounds pretty hyped up to me, but headlines are often written by sub-editors, not by the author of the article.  The article itself seems to be a pretty straight account that uses mostly quotations from  the &lt;a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2009/07/the_genes_behind_schizophrenia.html" title="Links to press releases"&gt;press releases&lt;/a&gt;.  And it is accompanied by an irrelevant picture of a brain image, that’s alleged to show areas of the brain that contain dopamine receptors, though the work being discussed shows exactly that It’s not just a matter of a disorder in a transmitter system.. So the article is OK but it doesn’t contribute anything itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is that the results of the gargantuan effort put into this study is to show how enormously complicated the problem is and just how little we understand,    The prospect of inventing ‘cures’ looks almost hopeless in the face of such complexity.  Nobody said it would be easy, but it has turned&lt;br&gt;
  out to be even harder than pessimists guessed. I would prefer a report that conveyed this reality better than the press releases do, and better than most of the hundreds of newspaper reports based on the press releases.  There is one such report, that in  &lt;a href="http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/hoopla-and-disappointment-in-schizophrenia-research/?em"&gt;the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journal Nature held a big press conference in London Wednesday, at the World Conference of Science Journalists, to unveil three large studies of the genetics of schizophrenia. Press releases from five American and European institutions celebrated the findings, one using epithets like “landmark,” “major step forward,” and “real scientific breakthrough.” It was the kind of hoopla you’d expect for an actual scientific advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me the reports represent more of a historic defeat, a Pearl Harbor of schizophrenia research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defeat points solely to the daunting nature of the adversary, not to any failing on the part of the researchers, who were using the most advanced tools available. Still, who is helped by dressing&lt;br&gt;
  up a severely disappointing setback as a “major step forward”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal news from the three studies is that schizophrenia is caused by a very large number of errant genes, not a manageable and meaningful handful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rationale behind the long search for schizophrenia genes was entirely justifiable. Since schizophrenia is highly heritable, it must have a strong genetic component. And it has long seemed possible that the responsible genetic variants underlying most common diseases would also be common. Natural selection gives us strong protection against diseases that strike before the age of reproduction. But its power to eliminate harmful genes is thought to wane sharply thereafter. So bad versions of genes that are bad only late in life could build up in the population, explaining why the common diseases that strike later in life are so common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if researchers could identify the few major variants assumed to underlie each of these common diseases, from schizophrenia to heart disease to cancer, they could devise drugs to offset the genes’ effects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nature is often a lot more complex than assumed. It now seems that the arm of natural selection is far longer than thought. It has reached way beyond our reproductive years and zapped most harmful genetic variants before they could get to be common in the population. That leaves relatively uncommon variants, lots and lots of them in each case, as the genetic cause of each common disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few years gene hunters in one common disease after another have turned up a few causative variant genes, after vast effort, but the variants generally account for a small percentage of the overall burden of illness. With most common diseases, it turns out, the disease is caused not by ten very common variant genes but by 10,000 relatively rare ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today it’s the turn of schizophrenia researchers to make the same discovery, though one perhaps more to be expected since schizophrenia is not good for reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia too seems to be not a single disease, but the end point of 10,000 different disruptions to the delicate architecture of the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that discovery is a landmark. The kind that says you have 10,000 miles yet to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The march of science is not direct but two steps forward, one step back. This was the step back. But it was a completely necessary one. So the press release writers could have cast it as a noble defeat, were words like defeat a part of their vocabulary, or frankness their masters’ priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This account may sound a bit pessimistic, but it also seems to me to be the most realistic of the lot.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is not alone in proving to be a lot more complicated than one would have hoped.  One of the most interesting outcomes of the genomic age has been to show that far simpler conditions than schizophrenia turn out to be not so simple after all. The simplest genetically transmitted diseases are those caused by mutation of a single amino acid in a single protein of known function. For example, one of the best understood receptors is the type of acetylcholine receptor that is responsible for transmitting an impulse from a motor nerve to a muscle cell, Curare blocks them and so paralyses voluntary movement, A rare form of muscle weakness, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=601462"&gt;slow channel congenital myasthenic syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (SCCMS), is caused when one of the amino acids in the protein mutates. But it has turned out that there is not just one mutation. It would be nearer to the truth to say that each family that suffers from the disease has its own mutation. Each of the mutations has a rather similar effect on the function of the protein, but there is not just one SCCMS but dozens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true of mutations in the glycine receptor that cause the rare congenital condition, ’startle disease’ (posh name, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperekplexia"&gt;hyperekplexia&lt;/a&gt;), The glycine receptor mediates inhibitory actions in the spinal cord. It is blocked by strychine, Strychnine causes exaggerated reflexes and eventually tonic convulsions: your muscles tighten so you die with the &lt;em&gt;risus sardonicus&lt;/em&gt;. Mutations in the glycine receptor that stop it working so well have an effect rather like strychnine. But rare though the disease is, at least 15 different mutations, each in a different family, have been found to produce similar effects. There is just one startle disease, but many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cystic fibrosis is even more complicated. Mutations in a single protein, with a function that is now quite well understood, can cause the disease. But every patient does not have the same mutation. Around 1500 mutations have been found in the 20 years since the gene was sequenced. And to make it still more complicated, the symptoms shown by two patients with the same mutation may not be identical. The effects depend, it seems, on the rest of the genetic make-up of the individual. There is a nice account in &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/cystic-fibrosis-09.pdf"&gt;‘The promise of a cure: 20 years and counting’.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same pattern is repeated again and again. Schizophrenia is just a very extreme example of a common phenomenon Not so long ago it was the dogma was that the future of drug discovery lay in genomics and high-throughput screening, Richard Sykes, when head of GSK, put the vast resources of GSK into this approach. It did not really work (which might explain why he left GSK to become rector of Imperial College). Now we know why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out to be a bit more complicated than anyone had foreseen, and one suspects it will take a long time to sort it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="follow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some comment on the reports on the &lt;a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2009/07/the_genes_behind_schizophrenia.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; web site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/could_we_garden_on_mars/moon.jpg" width="500" alt="moon.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been, pretty much, a slam-dunk since &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1969_and_th.php"&gt;Apollo 11&lt;/a&gt;.  Why?  Because we've brought moonrocks back to Earth, and we've analyzed them thoroughly.  What did we find?  That &lt;i&gt;they're made of the same stuff that Earth-rocks are made of!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/could_we_garden_on_mars/moonrocks.jpg" width="500" alt="moonrocks.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, not that that isn't interesting.  None of the other rocky bodies in our Solar System have the same composition as Earth, which helped lead us to the understanding that the Moon was made out of the same stuff that made Earth.  In fact, one of the coolest biological things (to an astrophysicist) that was done recently was the crushing of moonrocks into a sandy dust, followed by planting seeds in them and watering them.  The result?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://startswithabang.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/laun.jpg" alt="marigolds" width="452" height="340" border="3px"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2008/04/you-can-grow-marigolds-on-the-moon.php"&gt;Marigolds!&lt;/a&gt;  You can grow certain hardy plants in the soil on the Moon; just add air and water!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, my question is this: what about other worlds?  Say, this one:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/could_we_garden_on_mars/mars.jpeg" width="500" alt="mars.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We land stuff there.  We land highly advanced, mostly autonomous robots there.  Mars has some atmosphere; is that enough to grow things?  Anything?  Mars may be able to support water for short periods of time.  If not, we could always bring a pressurized terrarium, and use the Martian soil:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/could_we_garden_on_mars/atla103107_terrarium1.jpg" width="500" alt="atla103107_terrarium1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be such a curious thing to do, to simply test, firsthand, whether Mars can sustain life or not.  Furthermore, it seems &lt;i&gt;easy&lt;/i&gt; to do, like this could be a small, standalone thing to piggy-back on the next Mars mission.

Anyway. . .&lt;/p&gt;

Oh yeah, &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/01/autism-speaks-loses-another-one/"&gt;I did&lt;/a&gt;. So what tactic did they go with? They latched onto the Autism Science Foundation’s (ASF) unwillingness to blindly promote the long disproven vaccine/autism hypothesis in order to create a straw man that paints him and the ASF as dogmatically opposed to researching vaccines. Of course, &lt;a href="http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/aboutasf.html"&gt;the ASF is not dogmatically opposed to vaccine research&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;color:black;line-height:115%"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vaccine safety research should continue to be conducted by the public health system in order to ensure vaccine safety and maintain confidence in our national vaccine program, but further investment of limited autism research dollars is not warranted at this time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And nothing in Katie Wright’s smear piece makes a convincing argument for a link between vaccines and autism, just the standard collecting of cherry-picked anecdotal accounts. And rather amusingly she accuses him of being soooooo dogmatic in his certainty that vaccines were not responsible for her child’s condition in the same article where she states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have always accepted that London’s belief that vaccines had nothing to do with his son’s autism, but no one is going to tell me that they “know” what happened or did not happen to my child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, except yourself. Pot. Kettle. Black.&lt;/p&gt;

How can you exorcise a ghost that has possessed your womb? Or how can you remove a ghost from your rectum? (After you’ve finished with it, presumably.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look no further! Maryanna Chatelaine  Moresby has treated these common problems in her article&lt;a href="http://www.hauntedamericatours.com/ghosthunting/ParanomalSex.php"&gt;&lt;span&gt; Sex after ghost hunting – exorcisms of a womb or anal ghosts: And when is the right time to have sex afterwards?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For today, let’s focus on “Anomalous Anal Ghost Phenomena”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Moresby, when a person dies, their physical body ceases to exist, although a “ghost body” remains, consisting of the “mind, intellect, ego and soul”. Sometimes, these ghost bodies seek refuge in a human host, entering via a vulnerable cavity. Generally, they prefer to enter through the woman’s, um, birth canal, or the man’s rectum. Moresby says that the ass is an “open portal” for spirits. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why enter through a boring old ear or a mouth when you can invade a genital orifice?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ghost hunting is to blame for this anal affliction:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My husband was plagued with anal ghost 4 times since he started Ghost Hunting. We went to many doctors to find out what his problem was until a psychic from Japan told him what was going on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your uninvited tenant may be the ghost of a loved one, an intimate stranger, or a dirty demon.  But how do you know if your buttocks are haunted? Rectal ghost symptoms include severe constipation, diarrhea and flatulence. Moresby claims: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can certainly attest to this as it has happened to my husband on more then one occasion. And Felching out ghosts is usually a bigger fear and reality then one might think.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next time you suffer from these demonic digestive system symptoms, you might want to reach for your Priest, rather than your &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepto_Bismol"&gt;Pepto-Bismol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colon Cleanse Products wull not help you if you have an anal or colon ghost!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Laxatives won’t work either. The most effective method for removing a troublesome rectal ghost is to perform a magical enema. &lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In some cultures spicy hot Enemas are said to chase a ghosts from a persons bowels in many cultures wine or beer enemas are used to get the ghost drunk so he will just fall out of the person and it then can be captured and put into a bottle or container for safe keeping. My husband keeps his in a pickle jar in the garage and has gotten several intriguing EVP’s from it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one tale that TAPS won’t touch. For more challenging guests, try a “blessed lubricant”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A quicker form of the dry enema ghost removal utilizes the injection of a small amount of water-based lubricant such as K-Y that is blessed and administered directly into the rectum via a non-hypodermic syringe, such as an oral syringe, or from some other source. My husband usually does this for 5 days after any ghost encounter he has as a precaution. The usual amount of blessed lubricant applied is about 2 tsp (10 cc), which will produce a movement in 30 minutes or less. The movement will be produced in a compact body, rather than in the more copious liquid form produced by a wet enema; and since no water is used, none will be retained higher up in the colon, to be expelled at a later, and possibly inconvenient, time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it just me, or is this one kinky couple?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moresby shares with us the touching story of her husband Riley’s rectal misadventures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img style="margin:5px" title="Randy_with_anal_ghost" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/randy_with_anal_ghost.jpg?w=260&amp;amp;h=300" alt="Randy_with_anal_ghost" width="260" height="300"&gt;My husband Riley has had an anal ghost infection on several occasions in the past few years. The phenomena can be very disturbing and unnerving. And the word frightening does not equate to the level of panic it caused me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At night laying inn bed after a ghost hunt with his group he would begin to let out gas. The stench was horrible. It smelt like something dead and raw sewerage. It even formed word with the sounds of his flatulence. And it went as far as cursing out individuals in restuarants, Church and a funeral of a close relative. The intense passing gas attacks my husband had actually produced audible words that clearly sounded like a man speaking with a gruff or raspy voice. It would say ” You Are F——g Doomed!” in a farty sounding voice like sound. Or, “Mutha F__K, He Is mine until the day he dies!” at first I thought it was Riley just playing games with me, throwing his voice like a ventriloquist, until the black diarrhea started while he was still asleep in his favorite chair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dunno. Riley looks pretty fucking happy to me!&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the voice from his anus was not enough when it grabbed the sheets and starting pulling it inside him! I was petrified and chilled to the bone, ready to run for the hills.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just when you were thinking that rectal ghosts were full of shit, Moreseby produces this proof positive – a photograph &lt;img style="margin:5px" title="anal__ghost" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/anal__ghost1.jpg?w=216&amp;amp;h=300" alt="anal__ghost" width="216" height="300"&gt;of Riley’s sphinctal specter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In photos a strange white mass began to appear when a full body shot of him was taken. usually it appeared like a large head protruding out of his buttocks. This ghost was very nasty and would felch out horrible profane words.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Besides suffering from intense pain my husband would feel it move inside him like a clawing animal. Once it even blew out the candles on my mothers birthday cake from across the room. And the stench was like a dead skunk and a refrigerator that had lost power for two weeks and was full of food.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If enemas make you queasy, Moresby also recommends the use of a good psychic medium, paranormal investigator, or a specialist in voodoo, hoodoo or santeria. If you can’t access these professionals, there is one last remedy…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A prayer  to St. Michael To remove a Anal Ghost:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh great Angel St. Michael hear my prayer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please in your divine justice and wisdom remove this ghost that infest my bowels and anus. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remove this foul ghost from me as you did the Devil from Heaven. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In your wisdom bless me and free me from this evil affliction now and forever. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never knew that St Michael was the patron saint of the anus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moresby and her husband suffered terribly during his orifice ordeal. It was like Queen Elizabeth’s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_horribilis"&gt;annus horribilis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was a happy ending after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After his anal ghost removal our sex life was very poor to say the least. But in time all was rectified through patience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next time we will discuss post-ghost hunting sex in &lt;em&gt;No Sex Please, We’re Ghost Hunters! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I haven't yet written here about &lt;a href="http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/thehumancondition/archive/2009/07/01/claudia-kalb-another-resignation-at-autism-speaks.aspx"&gt;Dr. Eric London resigning from Autism Speaks&lt;/a&gt;. So here goes....... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Getting ready for being given numerous links to numerous articles, websites, studies studies studies pointing to a "link" between autism and vaccines (there is no link), informing me I'm wrong, and so forth.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. London was a member of Autism Speaks' Scientific Affairs Committee. In his &lt;a href="http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/ericlondon.html"&gt;resignation letter&lt;/a&gt; posted on the &lt;a href="http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org"&gt;Autism Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;'s website, Dr. London specifically noted that Autism Speaks' position that "there might be rare cases of ‘biologically-plausible’ vaccine involvement" is "misleading and disingenuous." As has been pointed out 'round the internet (here is &lt;a href="http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/thehumancondition/archive/2009/07/01/claudia-kalb-another-resignation-at-autism-speaks.aspx"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;'s coverage), earlier this year, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_curious_incident_of_the_iacc_vaccines_and_autism_speaks"&gt;Alison Singer resigned&lt;/a&gt; from her position as Executive Vice President of Autism Speaks; she specifically cited "concerns about Autism Speaks’ policy on vaccine research" as one reason for her decision. Singer is one of the co-founders of the &lt;a href="http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/leadership.html"&gt;Autism Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, along with Karen Margulis London. And, Karen Margulis Longdon and Dr. London were co-founders of the National Alliance for Autism Research (NAAR) which announced it would be "partnering" with Autism Speaks back in February of 2006; a year later, another autism organization, Cure Autism Now (CAN) also went &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/can-to-be-under-the-aegis-of-autism-speaks/"&gt;under the aegis of Autism Speaks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside conspiracy theorizing and attendant &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/pattern-read_errors_and_superstition"&gt;superstitious&lt;/a&gt; musings, I wanted to reflect on Dr. London's resignation by picking up on a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/division_again_but_of_a_different_sort"&gt;topic&lt;/a&gt; that Dora has been writing about, that of the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/divisions"&gt;divisions&lt;/a&gt; among the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/professionals_parents_self-advocates_and_social_movements"&gt;professional, parent, and self-advocacy communities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many autism groups, &lt;a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org"&gt;Autism Speaks&lt;/a&gt; is an organization with a focus on research and science and the more amorphous concepts of "autism awareness" and "autism advocacy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Autism Speaks (like many autism organizations) is run by the parents of children on the spectrum. The topic of vaccines and autism highlights the divisions Dora has noted. Vaccines in particular are a topic among parents of autistic children and of children these days more generally. It is a topic that is divisive in itself, and it is a topic that is not about autism. It's a topic about a hypothetical cause of autism that some feel very passionately about, and perhaps all the more so as it becomes clearer that there is no link between vaccines and autism. Indeed, at times "there is no link" seems to be a stimulus for a full-barreled response about how those who say "there is no link" are simply wrong, wrong, wrong; are wilfully ignorant; aren't listening to what "real parents of real autistic children" have to say; and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject of vaccines and autism has certainly received a great deal of attention in the autism community and also from the mass media and it seems that this will continue to be the case (as Mike Stanton notes in a post entitled &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2542"&gt;Wakefield, distortion and the Sunday Times&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2542"&gt;Left Brain/Right Brain&lt;/a&gt;). This attention, while understandable, is misplaced and ultimately to the detriment of everyone in the autism community. There's plenty of uncertainty about what &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/knowing_about_autism_earlier_earlier_earlier"&gt;exactly causes&lt;/a&gt; autism; it is most likely genetic in origin. But, as I &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autism_vaccines_and_what_the_words_say"&gt;wrote back in February&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dora's and my first action on this sight----&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/promote_respectful_language"&gt;Promote Respectful Language&lt;/a&gt;---asked people to think at least twice about the language they use when talking about autism and when talking to individuals on the autism spectrum. One reason that the alleged "link" of vaccines to autism is turning out to be so detrimental is that this hypothesis of autism causation suggests that having autism means an individual is "damaged" or has been "injured," or even "poisoned"; that autism is something that an individual can "get." Autism, it's implied, is analogous to some sort of external agent, some thing "outside" a child, that somehow "gets into" him or her and "makes" him or her "become" autistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often I've wondered if the energy and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/vaccines_and_autism_a_matter_of_the_heart"&gt;emotion&lt;/a&gt; that gets put into the "vaccine issue" is displaced from worries and anxiety about the real issues at hand: The lack of supports and services, the paucity of schools, the painful attitudes and misperceptions about individuals on the spectrum---I could go on and on. If one-tenth of that "antivax/pro-vaccine safety" energy were directed to advocating for services and supports for individuals on the spectrum; for training more teachers and therapists; for creating more classrooms and schools and group homes and supported living environments for individuals on the spectrum.......&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of hard to imagine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we can try. Doing so may not patch up the divisions and I don't know if they ever can be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do know, as my son has gotten older, it's become more and more clear how he always was as he is, autistic; how he's always been Charlie. A shot didn't make him who he is: One could only wish that it were all that simple. But it isn't and it's been a good thing, a great project, for Jim and me to devote our energies, emotions and passions to making this world here and today a place that he can &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; in; to try to change the world for a boy and individuals like him who are too often excluded---divided---left out---forgotten. And we should be wary lest we get ourselves too wound up in theories, conspiracies, and "let's find someone/thing to blame for autism!" kind of thinking, and lest we forget about what really matters.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246605387128"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3691">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8d0105df174ae22e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Paranormal"/><category term="What's The Harm"/><category term="religion"/><category term="Ava Worthington"/><category term="Daniel Hauser"/><category term="Faith Healing"/><category term="Followers of Christ"/><category term="Hector Ayala"/><category term="Lena Taylor"/><category term="Madeline Kara Neumann"/><category term="rape"/><category term="Silence is the Enemy"/><category term="statutory rape"/><category term="tarot"/><category term="Terese Berceau"/><category term="Wisconsin"/><title type="html">Several more cases of harm from woo</title><published>2009-07-03T07:08:45Z</published><updated>2009-07-03T07:08:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/several-more-cases-of-harm-from-woo/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/02/tarot-cards-tricked-them/"&gt;&lt;img title="astrology - the fool" src="http://skepacabra.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/astrology-the-fool.jpg?w=124&amp;amp;h=218" alt="astrology - the fool" width="124" height="218"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/02/tarot-cards-tricked-them/"&gt;Tarot card reader rapes 15-year-old girl under pretense of removing her bad luck and helping her wishes come true&lt;/a&gt; – Reminiscent of the “putting the devil back into Hell” story from &lt;em&gt;The Decameron&lt;/em&gt;, Hector Ayala used his svengali-like influence to coerce this girl into willingly sleeping with him. This is beyond sick, and I disagree with Friendly Atheist (in the link above) who suggests that the victim possibly bares some responsibility because she was gullible enough to fall for it. Everyone is capable of being fooled, and while most of us are confident we wouldn’t have fallen for this, mere gullibility doesn’t mean this poor girl brought it upon herself or bares some responsibility for her own victimization, especially considering that she is only 15. This reminds me to also once again plug the &lt;a href="http://www.stopsilence.com/)."&gt;Silence Is The Enemy&lt;/a&gt; campaign, which bares a link to Skepacabra on its home page because I promoted it previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/02/eliminating-the-faith-healing-exemptions-in-wisconsin/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://whoyoucallingaskeptic.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/healing.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://whoyoucallingaskeptic.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/healing.jpg?w=232&amp;amp;h=172" alt="" width="232" height="172"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/02/eliminating-the-faith-healing-exemptions-in-wisconsin/"&gt;Wisconsin considering removing faith-healing exemptions&lt;/a&gt; – Wisconsin currently accepts medical exemptions from parents who opt to instead kill their child by relying on a faith healer. This exemption might be single-handedly blamed for the death of young &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/05/18/madeline-neumann-died-because-her-parents-prayed-instead-of-getting-help-heres-the-irony/"&gt;Madeline Kara Neumann&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;And Christian Science is primarily to blame for the law. But now 2 senators are fighting this law:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sen. Lena Taylor&lt;/strong&gt; (D-Milwaukee) has proposed a measure that would allow Prayer Parents to essentially present a criminal defense — their actions could be considered &lt;em&gt;reasonable&lt;/em&gt; depending on “whether the parent should have known the condition was life-threatening, the risks and side effects of medical treatment and the family’s prior experiences with spiritual healing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s better than the current law, but it would be *really* tough to prosecute Prayer Parents with this measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rep. Terese Berceau&lt;/strong&gt; (D-Madison) has proposed a measure that would omit the current exemption I mentioned above. Child welfare workers could cite faith healing as an example of abuse/neglect. The court could intervene in cases like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/05/16/minnesota-judge-may-end-up-saving-daniel-hausers-life/"&gt;Daniel Hauser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; medical treatment in certain situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berceau’s bill (LRB-2190) is stronger and allows for necessary intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you know any Wisconsin residents, &lt;a href="http://www.legis.state.wi.us/w3asp/waml/waml.aspx"&gt;ask them to support LRB-2190&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://a401.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/91/l_1e0d82916b6d7fd7362b0264bf7a9388.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://a401.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/91/l_1e0d82916b6d7fd7362b0264bf7a9388.jpg" alt="" width="156" height="229"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3.&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/02/she-died-because-her-dad-didnt-believe-in-doctors/"&gt; 15-month-old Ava Worthington is the latest fatality of Christianity&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As she died&lt;/em&gt;, dozens of members of the Followers of Christ Church — maybe even a hundred — were watching. None of them called a doctor. If any of them had, she would probably &lt;a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/clackamascounty/index.ssf/2009/07/jury_hears_father_recount_fait.html"&gt;have been saved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in that blog, I proposed what I thought would probably be the best solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because I don’t want to just use this platform to bitch, I’ll propose the best of both worlds. Obama has already publicly embraced the message of multi-culturalism in numerous speeches, even including atheists. Obama should pull a Ben Franklin and instead of picking one church, he should join them all. And I don’t mean just the Christian churchs but also the Jewish temples, etc. The president of the United States doesn’t just represent Christians, but every American. So why should he choose? If attending a religious ceremony instead of doing something actually useful is so important to the religious, Obama should declare that he’ll make time to visit every place of worship in Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out that according to the Catholic publication that interviewed him,&lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles_of_faith/2009/07/obama_meets_wit_1.html"&gt; Obama is considering doing something similar&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no major news, but Obama revealed a couple things I had not previously known about his faith life — first, that he is considering choosing a group of churches in Washington, rather than a single congregation, to reduce the impact of his presence on any one community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I still prefer my proposal but this is at least in the right direction. But another piece of information to come out of this recent interview is a little more troubling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And second, the president said that Joshua DuBois, the president’s faith adviser, sends Obama’s BlackBerry a devotional prayer each morning for the president to reflect on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this were my administration, DuBois would be fired. Either that or I’d retaliate by sending him footage from a donkey show every morning. But then there was another great piece of information that came out of this interview. Obama commented on the effect of  religious intolerance on the LGBT community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the gay and lesbian community in this country, I think it’s clear that they feel victimized in fairly powerful ways and they’re often hurt by not just certain teachings of the Catholic Church, but the Christian faith generally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well said, Mr. President.&lt;/p&gt;

Generally, findings show that people who attend religious services once or more per week have fewer physical and mental illnesses, recover more quickly from illness, and have lower mortality rates than individuals who attend less frequently or not at all. [1-3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, it is easy to infer from the abundance of literature linking religion to positive health outcomes that people who are less religious or nonreligious are less healthy and more mentally and physically ill, I.E. -that there is something wrong with us.

However, blog bud &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/bad_ads.php"&gt;PalMD&lt;/a&gt; rubbed my nose into a little kerfuffle that's been going on here the last couple of days. Basically, some really, really bad advertisements have been popping up. Ads for quackery like this popped up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/upload/2009/07/scienceblogs_ads_are_going_to_be_the_dea/chelation.JPG" width="500" height="238" alt="chelation.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lovely. Here I am pointing out why the NIH Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy is an &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/they_dont_call_it_cheat-lation_for_nothi.php"&gt;unethical boondoggle of a quackfest&lt;/a&gt;, full of violations of the most basic protections for human subjects, and what's appearing above my post?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ads for chelation therapy! And I saw an ad for chelation therapy on the sidebar again a mere couple of hours ago. I haven't seen any since then, but having seen them so recently, I have to assume that these ads are still popping up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's even worse, though. As &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/naughty_ads_and_why_im_on_hiat.php"&gt;Isis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2009/07/following_isiss_lead.php"&gt;Zuska&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2009/07/what_is_the_difference_between.php"&gt;GrrlScientist&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, there were ads for Russian mail order brides. Ads for quackery are bad enough, but ads that can contribute to human trafficking are even worse than that. Apparently they came about when a new ad service was hired. Obviously, there was a failure to communicate or implement proper guidelines and filtering for these ads. Whatever the case, they've riled both our readers and many of us bloggers, and rightly so! How can Orac, scourge of quacks, tolerate having his peerless prose seen next to ads for chelation therapy? I've been castigating chelation therapy since my days back on Blogspot, long before I even joined ScienceBlogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Seed Overlords are aware of this and assure us that these ads will be eliminated. I certainly hope so. When I first joined ScienceBlogs, one thing that I made very clear is that I couldn't be associated with ads for pseudoscience or quackery. I'm willing to take our Overlords at their word and give them some time to make things right. They've been benevolent Overlords thus far. I also understand that times are tough, and ScienceBlogs is ad-supported. That's why I am generally not excessively picky about the advertising that supports this blog. There are limits, though, and even in these touh economic times ads for quackery and mail order brides are not acceptable.. However, if these ads persist, I may be forced into a decision that I don't want to have to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's hope that doesn't happen. Certainly I am. I just hope the ad staff and techies haven't taken off for the 4th of July weekend. My tolerance will be zero by Monday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/scienceblogs_ads_are_going_to_be_the_dea.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/dEvIaYaTLCI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246594646943"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-5554051826214264924">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a7edcdb0793e68e1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Some Interesting Sites</title><published>2009-07-03T03:50:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-03T14:44:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/kAylM7EsUYY/four-interesting-sites.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/5554051826214264924/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=5554051826214264924" title="4 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/07/four-interesting-sites.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">Check these out: &lt;a href="http://atheismblog.blogspot.com/"&gt;Atheism: Proving the Negative&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/"&gt;Religious Tolerance&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jesuspolice.com/"&gt;The Jesus Police&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.messiahtruth.com/response.html"&gt;The Messiah Truth Project&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://thechristiancentral.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Christian Central-the Antithesis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-5554051826214264924?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Given how many of our Founding Fathers were freethinkers, I like to think now is a perfect time for a shot of skeptical blogging. And our host this week has just the thing: &lt;a href="http://www.naontiotami.com/?p=653"&gt;On the Tendency of Skeptics to form Circles; and on the Perpetuation of Circles and Skeptics by Natural Means of Selection&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Next up in two weeks is &lt;a href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/"&gt;Effort Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to start firing up your keyboards to provide the raw material, namely great skeptical blogging, to make next week's carnival as good as this week or even better. The contact information is here, and guidelines can be found &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2005/10/skeptics-circle-archive-and-schedule.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you're a skeptical blogger, maybe you'd like to have a go at hosting one of these puppies. You won't regret it.

I always felt it was more, much more.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am no molecular biologist, but I have run a few gels in my life.  The biggest problem was to find a control gene - one that does not cycle - to make the comparisons to.  Actin, which is often used in such studies as control, cycled in our samples.  In the end, we settled on one of the subunits of the ribosome as we could not detect a rhythm in its expression.  The operative word is "could not detect".  My sampling rate was every 3 hours over a 24-hour period, so it is possible that we could have missed circadian expression of a gene that has multiple peaks, or a single very narrow peak, or a very low amplitude of cycling (it still worked as a control in our case, for different reasons). Thus, my feeling is that everything or almost everything that is expressed in a cell will be expressed in a rhythmic pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have heard me talk about clocks (e.g., in the classroom), or have read some of my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/chronobiology/clock_tutorials/" title=""&gt;Clock Tutorials&lt;/a&gt;, you know that I tend to say something like "All the genes that code for proteins that are important for the core function of a cell type are expressed in a circadian fashion".  So, genes important for liver function will cycle in the liver cells, genes important for muscle function will cycle in muscle cells, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I omit to note that all such genes that are important for the function of the cell type are all the genes that are expressed in that cell.  The genes not used by that cell are not expressed.  But I could not go straight out and say "all the genes that are expressed in a cell are expressed in a circadian pattern", because I had no data to support such a notion.  Until yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596516499/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://covers.oreilly.com/images/9780596516499/lrg.jpg" alt="Cover of Natural Language Processing with Python" width="200" height="262"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This book is here to help you get your job done.&amp;quot; I love that line (from the preface). It captures the spirit of the book. Right from the start, readers/users get to do  advanced things with large corpora, including information-rich visualizations and sophisticated theory implementation. If you&amp;#39;ve started to see that your research would benefit from some computational power, but you have limited (or no) programming experience, don&amp;#39;t despair — install &lt;a href="http://www.nltk.org/"&gt;NLTK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://nltk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/nltk_data/index.xml"&gt;its data sets&lt;/a&gt; (it's &lt;a href="http://www.nltk.org/download"&gt;a snap&lt;/a&gt;), then work through this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be careful to distinguish &lt;a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596516499/"&gt;Natural Language Processing with Python&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://www.nltk.org/"&gt;Natural Language Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;. The book has pedagogical aims, and NLTK is its technological centerpiece and main testing ground. However, NLTK is for advanced researchers as well. It is a scientific programming library, akin to &lt;a href="http://www.scipy.org/"&gt;SciPy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.octave.org/"&gt;Octave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/"&gt;Praat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.r-project.org/"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; (and their for-profit counterparts). It provides lots of high-level functions for doing advanced things with linguistic data and theory. Slurp up a bunch of novels and explore their lexical statistics; traverse the WordNet; annotate your own data; prove logical theorems; and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, &lt;a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596516499/colophon.html"&gt;the colophon&lt;/a&gt; explains that the whale on the cover is &amp;quot;a right whale, the rarest of all large whales&amp;quot;, and that such whales &amp;quot;are not sexually mature until 10 years of age&amp;quot;, which is, according to Steven Bird, the time from this book&amp;#39;s birth (at Penn) to its publication. Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to the book and to NLTK!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Potts</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246579942504"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7992">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e9d03bf21f9b4bcf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Psychics"/><category term="philadelphia"/><category term="tarot"/><title type="html">Tarot Reader Accused of Raping Teen Girls</title><published>2009-07-02T23:39:54Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T23:39:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7992" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31704728/ns/local_news-philadelphia_pa/"&gt;A Philadelphia man named Hector Ayala&lt;/a&gt; is on trial for raping one 15-year old and two 16-year old girls, allegedly tricking them into performing/receiving oral and vaginal sex in order to lift curses and avoid predicted misfortunes. The 15-year old has testified that the rapes began when she was just 13 and her home life was “getting complicated.” Ayala, age 59, was a family friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, obviously horrifying. Sadly, it’s also expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not all psychics (or even most, I hope) rape children. But, this horrific case does fit in with the usual modus operandi of the average psychic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Identify a vulnerable person&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This could be someone who has recently lost a close relative (hello, John Edward) or a young girl with a turbulent home life. Someone who is vulnerable will be looking for any kind of attention and validation, and will be more likely to buy whatever you’re selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Gain their trust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Get a TV show, dress up like a gypsy seer, offer a sympathetic ear, or just be a family friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Pretend to have supernatural powers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No psychic has ever proven under scientific scrutiny to have anything near to supernatural powers. Never. Ever. Therefore, it is perfectly safe to assume they are knowingly or unknowingly &lt;em&gt;making it up&lt;/em&gt;. Ayala used tarot cards, but others have used crystal balls, “talking to the dead” acts, or faith healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Get what you want&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For many professional psychics, the end goal is money, pure and simple. For others, they may just be seeking attention (like many of their victims, in fact). For Ayala, the end goal was sex and power over teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Ayala is found guilty, I hope he goes to jail for a very long time. Because of the MO listed above, I’ve always been disturbed by psychics and their complete lack of humanity. In this case, it’s particularly frightening.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246579455846"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/as_valedictorian_be_true_to_yourself">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3defad9a3c33966f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">AS Valedictorian: Be True To Yourself</title><published>2009-07-02T23:14:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T23:14:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/as_valedictorian_be_true_to_yourself" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shannonarchuleta/2338242828/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2415/2338242828_f4f175c920_m.jpg" alt="close up of a woman&amp;#39;s belly with a tattoo of five different snowflakes across it" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The feeds are full of graduation stories this time of year, and Littleton (NH) had a &lt;a href="http://www.winnisquamecho.net/Articles-c-2009-06-16-148805.113119_Graduates_urged_to_be_true_to_themselves.html"&gt;graduation with a message about labels&lt;/a&gt;.  The Valedictorian referenced his AS in his speech,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was born with Asperger's Syndrome," said Valedictorian Christopher Beaulieu during his address. "Being labeled as having Asperger's, I was told I couldn't do things such as telling jokes or giving speeches. Despite those assumptions, I have earned the opportunity to speak here today. I'm saying this because I'd like to make a point about labeling." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He advised his classmates and those in the audience to be true to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Don't be a lemming. Follow your own path, even if it means some of your so-called friends might not approve of it," Beaulieu said. He received a standing ovation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Salutatorian sent the message in another way--instead of a spoken communication to the audience, she played a song on her clarinet; a medium that was more comfortable for her personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assumptions, labels, and stereotypes are destructive after a point.  There are so many benefits to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/be_yourself"&gt;being true to one's self&lt;/a&gt; (like an innovative way of giving a speech!).

A lot of books are coming out right now to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11. One of the best, called &lt;em&gt;Voices from the Moon&lt;/em&gt;, is by my friends Andy Chaikin and Victoria Kohl. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy is familiar to Apollonuts: he wrote &lt;em&gt;A Man on the Moon&lt;/em&gt;, considered by many (including me) to be the bible of Apollo, and he knows all the Apollo astronauts and their stories. I have a copy of &lt;em&gt;Voices&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s a GORGEOUS book, loaded with extremely high-quality images of the missions, punctuated with wonderful stories from the astronauts themselves (hence the title).&lt;/p&gt;

This idea of “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel_%28biology%29"&gt;spandrels&lt;/a&gt;” arising from evolutionary characteristics is not unheard of. Since evolution acts upon the entire organism and not specific traits, what can arise as a result can be something which was never selected for in the first place.  It is not very long; only two pages.

It's also the buzz over on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know about the mail order bride ads and the naughty singles ads.  As &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey"&gt;DrugMonkey&lt;/a&gt; echoes in his preceding post, I think it is a shame that these ads showed up after our month long Silence is the Enemy campaign.  I think all of the bloggers at ScienceBlogs agree that advertising the sexual exploitation of vulnerable women of limited economic means is disgusting.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the ads were first brought to my attention I contacted the management of ScienceBlogs.  They assured me (and the other bloggers here) that the ads would be removed.  I hope that they are sincere and have no reason to believe that they are not.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, even today when I went over to Drugmonkey's site to get the link for his mail order bride post, I saw this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/07/naughty_ads_and_why_im_headed_back_to_blogspot/7-2-09%20copy.jpg" alt="7-2-09 copy.jpg" height="231" width="515"&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes me feel sad, and if you've been visiting me for any length of time then you know how I feel about the exploitation of women, especially racial minorities and women from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.  That's the entire point of the Letters to Our Daughters Project and the Silence is the Enemy Project, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I cannot in good faith continue to contribute content here while these ads remain visible.  This also makes me sad because I love being at ScienceBlogs.  I love my Sciblings (well, most of them) and I believe in the establishment of community for the promotion of science.  But, it would not be right for my page views to generate revenue that funds individuals who exploit women.  The morality in this matter seems pretty black and white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the management here at ScienceBlogs when they tell me that they are working to have their ad agency remove the ads, but the traffic generated in the meantime while those ads still appear still puts money in the pockets of those who exploit women.  So, until I receive confirmation from the Overlords here at ScienceBlogs that these ads are gone, I&amp;#39;m taking a hiatus.  If the hiatus becomes extended and I feel an urge to blog in the interim, I may retreat to my old home at &lt;a href="http://isisthescientist.blogspot.com/"&gt;Blogspot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="http://isisthescientist.blogspot.com/"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pray that my hiatus is brief and wish all of you a very happy 4th of July weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;All my love,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isis&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/naughty_ads_and_why_im_on_hiat.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/mDxs0J8wMFE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246572244193"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/will_work_need_jobs_that_fit">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/79bcb60818bfd17f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Will Work, Need Jobs That Fit</title><published>2009-07-02T21:26:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T21:26:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/will_work_need_jobs_that_fit" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Lock and Key" src="http://www.change.org/photos/wordpress_copies/img_2312-300x225.jpg" height="225" alt="" width="300"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A recent &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106119247"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt; story recounts the quest of 55-year-old Michael Medina for a job. Medina had worked as janitor at Stacey's Bookstore in San Francisco until it went out of business in March. &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106119247"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt; makes it clear, the economic crisis affects both individuals with disabilities and those like job coaches who help them. Medina's job coach, Nina Asay, accompanies him on interviews, helps him learn what to do in a new job, and is here to "'help [him] out,'" as she herself says. But the San Francisco chapter of The Arc---the largest nonprofit helping individuals with developmental disabilities find general employment---is in danger of losing $3 million in state funding come September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that said, &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106119247"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt; reports emphasizes that the greatest hurdle for individuals like Medina are people's attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; ......the biggest obstacle to placing people in jobs is negative stereotypes, says John Kemp of the &lt;a href="http://www.usbln.org/"&gt;U.S. Business Leadership Network&lt;/a&gt;, a national organization that assists with hiring and retaining employees with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The first response of the unenlightened employer is, 'No way. We have too many complex issues here, too many business processes that they will not be able to understand and execute,'" he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Kemp says there are bright spots. Large national chains including Walgreens, McDonald's and Safeway continue to create opportunities for people with developmental disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And certainly more people seeing individuals with disabilities in jobs in the community is crucial to changing attitudes. To reiterate a question asked by Dora: &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/changing_people_to_fit_jobs_or_finding_jobs_to_fit_people"&gt;Do we change people to fit jobs or find jobs to fit people&lt;/a&gt;? Can we change jobs and workplaces to fit people? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we craft locks and keyholes that will fit the keys, those who are ready to work like Michael Medina?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246570074987"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4321">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b837adfbefeaf6f7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Steve Steve" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="antarctica" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="antarctica"/><category term="blogging" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="blogging"/><category term="contest" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="contest"/><category term="voting" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="voting"/><title type="html">Send Prof. Steve Steve to Antarctica!</title><published>2009-07-02T20:28:04Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T23:07:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/07/send-prof-steve.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://echothis.info/V0" rel="external "&gt;&lt;img src="http://austringer.net/images/pss/pss_freeze_me_320h.gif" alt="" style="float:left"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The marketing people at &lt;a href="http://www.quarkexpeditions.com/" rel="external "&gt;Quark Expeditions&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="http://www.blogyourwaytoantarctica.com/blogs" rel="external "&gt;a contest going to send a blogger&lt;/a&gt; on one of their Antarctic expeditions next year.

We did well working together at the 2005 &lt;em&gt;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&lt;/em&gt; trial, and I’m looking forward to some more, er, collaboration in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, they missed each other to the tune of more than 60 million years.  The first Tyrannosaurus likely terrorized its first &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrosaur"&gt;Duck-Bill&lt;/a&gt; about 70 million years ago. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabertooth_tiger"&gt; Saber-Toothed&lt;/a&gt; cats came on the scene about 40 million years later – though excavations at the &lt;a href="http://www.tarpits.org/"&gt;La Brea Tar Pits&lt;/a&gt; have revealed that big cats lived on the strip where The Walk of Fame resides today, so Saber-Tooths in Hollywood actually do have factual underpinnings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/Sk0QWfJ8bFI/AAAAAAAAACc/hSuSN_qr7ok/s1600-h/250px-Palais_de_la_Decouverte_Tyrannosaurus_rex_p1050042.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:200px;height:130px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/Sk0QWfJ8bFI/AAAAAAAAACc/hSuSN_qr7ok/s200/250px-Palais_de_la_Decouverte_Tyrannosaurus_rex_p1050042.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There may be little actual accurate science in the premise of ICE AGE: DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS, however, in personifying these ancient creatures with identifiable characters, parents and children can start a rare fun and educational discussion.  Is it possible that some Jurassic Dinosaurs might have survived long enough to share wacky misadventures with Saber-Toothed cats and Mammoths?  Um, probably not – though it’s fun to imagine what that might have looked like.  And why not turn an entertaining summer movie into a conversation starter?  Maybe swinging by the La Brea Tar Pits or your local Natural History Museum on the way home from the theater could start a life-long passion in a little one close to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/rhskSbh6EbA%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-6728120972275914903?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Tonight on Showtime, Penn &amp;amp; Teller take on astrology! &lt;a href="http://www.sho.com/site/video/brightcove/series/title.do?bcpid=14033851001&amp;amp;bclid=26288375001&amp;amp;bctid=26497558001"&gt;You can take a peek at the show online here&lt;/a&gt; (with the bad words edited out), or you can watch the show at 10:00 p.m. Eastern time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I happen to know that a certain Beloved Internet Personality who blogs about astronomy and Doctor Who is on the show briefly as well. Well, it’s probably a good episode anyway, so you should order Showtime and watch it, and buy the DVDs as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus ironic pun: the episode is directed by Star Price. Siriusly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you are totally convinced that astrology actually works, despite an entire Universe of evidence stomping on your face telling you you’re wrong, then you can give P&amp;amp;T a piece of your mind personally, &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;since they’ll be at TAM 7&lt;/a&gt;. You can yell at them then… but be prepared to have Penn enthusiastically join that Universe of evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don’t forget:&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Oz's smiling face has been showing up above mine, you may have just won $59, your teeth can be whiter than white, and last but not least human trafficking in "Russian brides".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, might I point out that I have nothing to do with the ads other than appearing on the same page as them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, that's stupid.  I might not choose the ads, but I choose to write for ScienceBlogs, so I am culpable.  Normally, I don't care much about ads that show up on my page.  After all, someone has to pay for the bandwidth.  But when something is dangerous, I have to draw the line.  Quackery ads are potentially dangerous, fake lotto ads can rip people off, any questionable click can infect your computer---but it's the "Russian brides" that is the most distressing.  There is a real problem with trafficking of women in the world, often very young, always impoverished, and more often than not, in addition to being deprived of their freedom, beaten, raped, starved, and sold as chattel.  It's not OK to be seen on the same page as these ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, once the Sb Overlords were notified, they promised to immediately pull the ads, allowing me to continue here rather than go back to wordpress.  As of now, I no longer see the Russian bride ads, but I still see the ads for fake penis growth pills and other dangerous nonsense.  Hopefully these will be gone soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In tough economic times, I'm willing to make certain compromises.  I can live with crappy ads as long as they aren't a rip-off and aren't dangerous.  But some lines cannot be crossed.

Here’s what we’re hearing back so far…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Tangled Bank&lt;/em&gt; is the best written and best illustrated introduction to evolution of the Darwin centennial decade, and also the most conversant with ongoing research. It is excellent for students, the general public, and even other biologists.” –&lt;a href="http://www.eowilson.org/"&gt;Edward O. Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, Harvard University, author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067976867X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=067976867X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consilience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Carl Zimmer’s excursion through the evolutionary epic is without equal.  His gift for the scientific narrative is on full display through &lt;em&gt;The Tangled Bank&lt;/em&gt;, and he leads his readers onward with an energy and delight that never disappoints. This marvelous text is an extraordinary introduction to the depth and richness of evolutionary science.” –&lt;a href="http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/"&gt;Kenneth Miller&lt;/a&gt;, Brown University, author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KVZ6RU?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B001KVZ6RU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only a Theory: Evolution and the Battle for America’s Soul&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and co-author of Miller &amp;amp; Levine’s &lt;a href="http://www.biology.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Zimmer has produced a wonderfully thorough introduction to evolutionary biology. With his prose and color diagrams by leading artists produced specially for this volume, &lt;em&gt;The Tangled Bank&lt;/em&gt; will be a powerful tool to introduce students to the explanatory power of evolution and the way that it integrates different fields of knowledge. I have no doubt that this important volume will find its way into diverse courses in the curriculum.” –&lt;a href="http://pondside.uchicago.edu/oba/faculty/shubin_n.html"&gt;Neil Shubin&lt;/a&gt;, University of Chicago, author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307277453?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0307277453"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Inner Fish&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One rarely says of a textbook, ‘I couldn’t put it down,’ but that was how I felt reading Carl Zimmer’s &lt;em&gt;Tangled Bank&lt;/em&gt;. Zimmer has applied his award-winning communication skills to producing a readable yet up-to-date and thorough treatment of evolutionary biology. Were I teaching evolution, this is the book I would use.” — &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/about/speakers#scott"&gt;Eugenie Scott&lt;/a&gt;, Executive Director of the National Center For Science Education and winner of the 2009 &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionsociety.org/awards.asp#gouldprize"&gt;Stephen Jay Gould Prize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Carl Zimmer’s &lt;em&gt;The Tangled Bank&lt;/em&gt; is a joy to read. He draws readers into the excitement of the rapidly expanding science of evolutionary biology, as he explains why life on earth is so diverse and how the web of life evolved to be so entangled.  He explains, through elegant prose and beautiful illustrations, the remarkable progress that has been made in recent years in understanding the evolutionary process.” –&lt;a href="http://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/faculty/thompson.html"&gt;John Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, University of California, Santa Cruz, author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226797627?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0226797627"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Geographic Mosaic of Coevolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This engagingly written and well-organized book is a wonderful introduction to evolutionary biology.  It beautifully synthesizes the conceptual basis of evolutionary theory with the empirical evidence that evolution has occurred.  The book is remarkably up-to-date, seamlessly moving from discussion of fossils to genomes, and nicely illustrates that evolutionary biology is a vigorous field that increasingly takes an experimental approach.” — &lt;a href="http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/losos/jblosos/"&gt;Jonathan Losos&lt;/a&gt;, Harvard University&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In clear, accessible prose, Carl Zimmer explains how 21st century science confirms the 19th century’s most radical idea. If you want to understand life’s remarkable past and uncertain future, read &lt;em&gt;The Tangled Bank&lt;/em&gt;.” –&lt;a href="http://www.eps.harvard.edu/people/faculty/knoll/"&gt;Andrew Knoll&lt;/a&gt;, Harvard University, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691120293?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0691120293"&gt;Life on a Young Planet: The First Three Billion Years of Evolution on Earth &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Zimmer weaves cutting-edge findings and essential concepts around the personalities and adventures of the biologists themselves. The result is superb: an up-to-date, articulate, and gorgeously illustrated introduction to modern evolutionary biology. We sorely needed a text aimed at the nonmajor undergraduate, and Zimmer was exactly the right person to write it.” –&lt;a href="http://dbs.umt.edu/research_labs/emlenlab/personal.htm"&gt;Douglas J. Emlen&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Biology, University of Montana&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To all of these biologists, many thanks from this old English major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And, by the way, that is the final cover. Thanks to the 1018 people who &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/05/08/a-request-for-the-design-hive-mind-vote-for-a-tangled-bank-book-cover/"&gt;cast votes&lt;/a&gt; on their favorite mock-ups, as well as to the many who didn’t like any of them and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/05/08/a-request-for-the-design-hive-mind-vote-for-a-tangled-bank-book-cover/#comment-18001"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;, “Where’s the tangled bank?”  You spoke, I listened. In the end, I decided to go with &lt;em&gt;Tiktaalik&lt;/em&gt;, but give it some extra company–both animal and vegetable–based on fossils that also date back to this sort of ecosystem 370 million years ago. Thanks to Carl Buell, as ever, for making that idea into a cover.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Carl Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/</id><title type="html">The Loom</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246562813452"><id gr:original-id="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/?p=773">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2aa901c275358c80</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">The farce is strong with this one</title><published>2009-07-02T19:00:14Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T19:00:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/07/02/the-farce-is-strong-with-this-one/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will first state that I am not trying to be condescending, it just comes out that way.

&lt;p&gt;“Holistic medicine”=”Holistic medicine is a system of health care which fosters a cooperative relationship among all those involved, leading towards optimal attainment of the physical, mental emotional, social and spiritual aspects of health. It emphasizes the need to look at the whole person, including analysis of physical, nutritional, environmental, emotional, social, spiritual and lifestyle values.

Holistic medicine focuses on education and responsibility for personal efforts to achieve balance and well being.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than just argue against this whole thing, I’m going to put some fun examples of this stuff out in the open, read, laugh, enjoy; you’re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not advocating binge drinking, a glass of (I prefer red) wine at dinner or (perhaps) a martini or two per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the same author, we find she also &lt;a href="http://evolvingwellness.com/posts/675/10-ways-to-protect-yourself-against-the-swine-flu/"&gt;doesn’t&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://evolvingwellness.com/posts/663/15-reasons-why-you-may-want-to-reconsider-eating-meat/"&gt;understand&lt;/a&gt; immunity and neural development at all.

If HDL is low, your neurons &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/1me3n5tdwjtr15td/"&gt;don’t work properly&lt;/a&gt;. Do YOU want a stronger immune system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From another author, she &lt;a href="http://www.shirleys-wellness-cafe.com/vaccines.htm"&gt;didn’t get the memo&lt;/a&gt; that thimerosal &lt;a href="http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/abstract/98/2/244"&gt;isn’t used in vaccines&lt;/a&gt; anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second author &lt;a href="http://www.shirleys-wellness-cafe.com/urine.htm"&gt;also&lt;/a&gt; seems to be an apologetic for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urophagia"&gt;urophagia&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll let wikipedia explain that one to you.&lt;/p&gt;

In a perfect world, we’ll make the dark matter particle &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/08/04/what-will-the-lhc-find/"&gt;at the LHC&lt;/a&gt;, observe gamma rays produced when &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/05/04/fermi-waffles-on-dark-matter/"&gt;dark matter annihilates in the galaxy&lt;/a&gt;, and detect it directly in &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/04/21/guest-post-juan-collar-on-dark-matter-detection/"&gt;experiments here on Earth&lt;/a&gt;.  The world isn’t always perfect, but sometimes it’s even better, so everyone is sitting on the edges of their seats waiting to hear what the experiments tell us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the direct-detection strategy here on Earth, we build giant detectors and wait for ambient dark-matter particles to interact with something in the detector.  If the dark matter is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP), that’s not so hard; the difficult part is distinguishing a purported signal from various backgrounds.  To know what the signal should be, of course, we need to know how many dark matter particles are zipping through the laboratory.  It should be a good number:  roughly speaking, there would be about one weak-scale-sized dark matter particle per coffee-cup-volume in the universe, and in our galaxy these particles will typically be trucking along at around 300 kilometers per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, you’d like an accurate estimate of how much dark matter there is supposed to be in your detector.  That’s what Riccardo Catena and Piero Ullio claim to have provided:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0018"&gt;A novel determination of the local dark matter density&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Authors: Riccardo Catena, Piero Ullio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    Abstract: We present a novel study on the problem of constructing mass models for the Milky Way, concentrating on features regarding the dark matter halo component. We have considered a variegated sample of dynamical observables for the Galaxy, including several results which have appeared recently, and studied a 7- or 8-dimensional parameter space - defining the Galaxy model - by implementing a Bayesian approach to the parameter estimation based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The main result of this analysis is a novel determination of the local dark matter halo density which, assuming spherical symmetry and either an Einasto or an NFW density profile is found to be around 0.39 GeV cm$^{-3}$ with a 1-$\sigma$ error bar of about 7%; more precisely we find a $\rho_{DM}(R_0) = 0.385 \pm 0.027 \rm GeV cm^{-3}$ for the Einasto profile and $\rho_{DM}(R_0) = 0.389 \pm 0.025 \rm GeV cm^{-3}$ for the NFW. This is in contrast to the standard assumption that $\rho_{DM}(R_0)$ is about 0.3 GeV cm$^{-3}$ with an uncertainty of a factor of 2 to 3. A very precise determination of the local halo density is very important for interpreting direct dark matter detection experiments. Indeed the results we produced, together with the recent accurate determination of the local circular velocity, should be very useful to considerably narrow astrophysical uncertainties on direct dark matter detection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they’re claiming the density is about .39 GeV per cubic centimeter (where one GeV is about the mass of the proton), whereas the standard figure is something closer to .30 GeV per cubic centimeter.  More importantly, they claim to trust their estimate to a precision of about 7%, while the usual number is supposed to be uncertain by a factor of 2 or 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I’m not expert enough to judge whether they are right, but it would certainly be very impressive to pin down the density to such high precision.  They do assume spherical symmetry, however, which I suspect is not a very good assumption.  There are ongoing arguments about how lumpy the distribution of galactic dark matter really is, and I can easily imagine that lumpiness can distort the local density by much more than 7%.  But work like this is going to be very important in interpreting the results, if (when?) we do directly detect the dark matter.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246562053612"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-1508499415353381116">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a0a5ae76d017b1d3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biochemistry" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Monday's Molecule #127: Winner</title><published>2009-07-02T18:34:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T18:49:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/07/mondays-molecule-127-winner.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/1508499415353381116/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=1508499415353381116" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The molecule is muscone or [R]-3-methyl-cyclopenta-decanone.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Update: Ken Bowley on Facebook clued me in that the LRO camera &lt;a href="http://wms.lroc.asu.edu/lroc_browse"&gt;has a page&lt;/a&gt; where you can see the raw images, and zoom in — &lt;a href="http://wms.lroc.asu.edu/lroc_browse/view/nacl000000fd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WAY&lt;/strong&gt; in&lt;/a&gt; — on the image strips. They have 73 cm resolution, folks. Yikes.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/lroc_20090702_a.html"&gt;has returned its first images from the Moon&lt;/a&gt;! Woohoo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check. It. Out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoaaaa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image, taken in the Mare Nubium region of the Moon, shows a heavily cratered area. The scale here is amazing: the whole image is 1400 meters across, or &lt;em&gt;just under a mile&lt;/em&gt;. That’s like looking out your airplane window… if you were over the frakking Moon! Even in this compressed image (click to embiggen) features just a few meters across are distinguishable. See that perfectly circular crater just to the right and a tad below the middle of the picture? It’s about 60 meters across, just a bit bigger than two tennis courts end-to-end. It would easily fit in a football stadium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy Haleakala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a little difficult to interpret the image; for example, near the bottom in the middle I thought for a moment I saw a crater chain. I don’t think that’s real; our eyes tend to pick out linear features even when they aren’t there. Too bad, because that would be cool; crater chains form when an asteroid or comet breaks up before it hits, and we do see them on pretty much every cratered object in the solar system. You can also get them near a larger impact, when junk ejected from the crater splashes out and lands nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guarantee we’ll see lots of such chains as LRO snaps more pictures. Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check this one too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This image has the same scale as the other, and shows a region of low hummocks undulating across the Moon. I don’t have much to say scientifically about this particular picture, but I will say that it is eerily beautiful, and completely enthralling. I wouldn’t mind having that framed over my desk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you go, folks. If you want to explore the Moon, all you have to do is sit back and wait for the images to roll in. And remember: when it settles into its final orbit, the pictures LRO takes will have a resolution of &lt;em&gt;0.5 meters&lt;/em&gt;, or 18 inches!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. I cannot wait to see more. &lt;/p&gt;

Well today, for the first time ever, I'm going to blow the lid off the whole skeptical blogging scene, and expose the secret cabal that runs the "Bad Science Community."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, the folk at JABS were well ahead of the game, cottoning on quickly after the Jeni Barnett blog storm that something sinister was afoot. As three of their top investigative members &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
http://www.jabs.org.uk/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=3643&amp;amp;SearchTerms=jeni&amp;quot;&amp;gt;noted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squib: A little bird has told me Bad Science will be seeding the blog-sphere with this story. It would be interesting to find out if this has been at the suggestion of a PR Consultant. If he has employed a consultant, the email will probably included dangling carrots so as to deflect the blogger from independently checking the facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jabba: There is no way all of this could have happened so quickly without Pharma backing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have to prove that what they do, keeps the pharma donors happy....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story began back in 2003. With the MMR controversy in full swing, vaccine manufacturers like Merck were facing the terrifying prospect of plummeting orders from their sinister Health Ministry collaborators. If things didn't turn around soon, they were going to have to release a new brand of painkiller, or create a new type of flu to keep their profits going. In order to avert the crisis, they employed top PR specialists &lt;i&gt;BS Communications&lt;/i&gt; an agency with a long and distinguished history of influencing public health policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency had a plan - to leverage the increasing power of bloggers and create an 'astroturf' movement - but they needed a charismatic leader to inspire others to follow. Step forward &lt;i&gt;Keeping up Appearances&lt;/i&gt; actress Patricia Routledge. After the BBC cancelled her popular series &lt;i&gt;Hetty Wainthropp Investigates&lt;/i&gt;, the actress was out of work and looking for cash to supplement her pension. BS Communications approached her, and quickly established that a thirty-something male doctor was well within the range of the veteran thespian's abilities. Routledge signed, and the fake character "Ben Goldacre" was born. Some claim that you can see the resemblance in the following publicity photo from the mid-90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/ben.png" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the fake 'Ben' character in place, the next step was to recruit a number of sycophantic followers to, well, follow him. I was a freelancer when I was approached, selling bad jokes to comedy birthday card manufacturers. Work had dried up owing to the catastrophic collapse of the comedy card industry as the increasing age of the population meant that most people just wanted cards with flowers and trains and cricket bats on them. In that climate, I was more than happy to oblige. 'Zeno' was an obvious choice, with his &lt;a href="http://myzeno.com/"&gt;Acne Treatment Device&lt;/a&gt; sitting in direct competition to many of the qua..., sorry, &lt;i&gt;professionals&lt;/i&gt; targetted. Frank Swain came from the militant anti-science wing of the BNP, explaining his almost fanatical campaigning on their behalf ahead of the European Elections, while Gimpy is in fact nothing more than a modified chat bot regurgitating material from a Merck PR library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this crack team in place it's easy to see how BS Communications are able to dominate the blogosphere so effectively. Every couple of months, a random-number generator linked to a database of alternative health qua..., sorry, &lt;i&gt;professionals&lt;/i&gt; is used to generate a target, technology first used in a more primitive form by the Bush administration's defence staff (they used a dart and a blindfold, although latterly &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Cheney_hunting_incident"&gt;unsuccessful trials&lt;/a&gt; with a hunting rifle were conducted). Frank "No-Greens" Swain takes the result and sends an e-mail around telling everyone what to write; BSC make payments to us all via PayPal, Routledge dons her Goldacre wig and visits a pub to talk to drunk people in a sinister brain-washing exercise; and within 24 hours a media storm is created.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, you probably should have worked it out all along. I mean, the idea that a diverse and disordered bunch of people around the world passionate about politics and science would actually write these stories of their own free will is just nuts.

Reminds me of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/late_night_at_the_aquarium"&gt;ASD night&lt;/a&gt; for both kids and adults at the Long Beach Aquarium.  And also, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/dancing_and_arts_education"&gt;some recent dances&lt;/a&gt;.  What all these activities have in common is that they are exclusive to people with a specific set of needs.  Is this a problem with "inclusion?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts of inclusion have always been hard for me to come to terms with.  On one hand, I do not (obviously!) want to be discriminated against, denied an education, or denied any sort of opportunity I may want to seize.  On the other hand, I frankly do not want to be included in most "community activities" and often resent the insistence of others that I be included.  Good grief, the last thing I want to do, for example, is go shopping at a mall (or as I call it "maul")!  Include me in a quiet afternoon hike instead, please!  I often feel like that the word "inclusion" is used to mean "participate with all the others in all the same activities" which has never sat well with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/megaconference_special_6_of_6_ada_sections_ii_and_iii"&gt;ADA Section II and III talk&lt;/a&gt;, the speaker gave a fascinating example of inclusion.  &lt;em&gt;People with disabilities are to be included in the same activities as non-disabled people, except in the situation where in order to enable equal access, the activity needs to be modified.  For example, a museum tour for people who are not blind would involve not touching the art; however, a special museum tour for people who are blind might involve people being allowed to touch the art.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the rush to include include include, its important to not loose sight of what inclusion is supposed to be doing.  It is not meant to simply fill a seat, to say, yes, this autistic person is in the same setting as non-autistic people of the same age.  It is meant to actually &lt;em&gt;include&lt;/em&gt;--to enable us to participate effectively in activities that are also open to others.  Should we want to participate! (Never lose sight of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/self-determination"&gt;self-determination&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may mean that, like the blind people at the museum, activities need to be created just for us.  This isn't bad--it's good.  It's the reason why some civil rights laws were created.  For us at times, being included does not mean being forced to do the same things in the same way as others, but to do the things we actually want to do in the way that works best for us.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246557536082"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=569">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a995be4191e3bf36</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Your Baby Can Read – Not!</title><published>2009-07-02T17:14:43Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T17:14:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=569" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have received numerous questions recently regarding the latest infomercial craze called Your Baby Can Read. This is a program that promises to teach infants and toddlers how to read, giving them a jump start on their education. &lt;a href="http://www.yourbabycanread.com/ce-y-how.aspx"&gt;Their website&lt;/a&gt; claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A baby’s brain thrives on stimulation and develops at a phenomenal pace…nearly 90% during the first five years of life! The best and easiest time to learn a language is during the infant and toddler years, when the brain is creating thousands of synapses every second – allowing a child to learn both the written word and spoken word simultaneously, and with much more ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mostly true – in fact the first four years of life is not only the best time to learn a language, it is the only time that language itself can be acquired. If a child is completely deprived of exposure to language during this time the neuro-developmental window will close.  People can still, of course, learn second languages after the age of four, but it is more difficult and their brains will never be as hard-wired for those second languages as they are for a primary language learned before age four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the company goes off the rails of evidence when it conflates language with reading. There is no window of opportunity for reading like there is with language – adults who have never read can learn how to read. And while our brains are pre-programmed to absorb language, reading is more of a cultural adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site also abuses evidence when it claims that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies prove that the earlier a child learns to read, the better they perform in school and later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes – but this might have something to do with smarter kids being able to learn to read earlier. Also, smarter parents, or just parents in a more stable and nurturing environment, may be more likely to read to their children early. What we have is correlational data with lots of variables. None of this necessarily means that forcing kids to learn to read early has any advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general studies of neurological development and education show that forcing kids to learn some task before their brains are naturally ready does not have any advantage. You cannot force the brain to develop quicker or better. In fact, it seems that children need only a minimally stimulating environment for their brain development program to unfold as it is destined to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This further means that the whole “baby genius” industry for anxious parents is misguided. This is just the latest incarnation of this fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another layer to this debate, however – that between phonics and whole word or whole language reading.  One school of thought believes that children learn to read by first mastering the sounds that letters make then putting them together (ala hooked on phonics). The second school of thought believes the children read whole works, and therefore can be taught to memorize whole words and the phonemic understanding will come later in its own time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years the phonics side of this debate has been dominant in the education community. But the whole word group is a vocal minority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However it also seems that there is an emerging third group who combine the two methods in a practical way. People read by both constructing words from their phonetic parts, an also by memorizing and reading whole words. Have you ever  received this e-mail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arocdnicg to rsceearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn’t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoatnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer are in the rghit pcale. The rset can be a toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit pobelrm. Tihs is buseace the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would seem to support the whole word school of thought. However, we also learn new words by sounding them out, and still have to do this for uncommon words. So a blended approach seems practical and is gaining acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Your Baby Can Read program is an extreme whole word appraoch. Infants and toddlers are taught to memorize words, which they can then recognize and name from memory, even before they can understand what they are reading. Critics of this approach claim that this is not really reading, just memorization and association. Some even caution that by taking an extreme whole word approach, phonic understanding can be delayed and the net result can be negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others are critical of this entire approach of forced learning at a very young age. It is more productive, they argue, to give the child a loving supportive environement and let their brain develop as it will.  You are far better off spending your time playing with and bonding with your child than engaged in drills or having them sit in front of a video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also does not appear to be any evidence that programs like Your Baby Can Read have any long term advantage. Their website does not provide links to any pulished studies to support their claims. Regarding the founder it declares:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Titzer’s research has been published in scientific journals, including the prestigious Psychological Review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True – but misleading as a &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&amp;amp;cmd=DetailsSearch&amp;amp;term=titzer+R&amp;amp;log$=activity"&gt;Pubmed search on Titzer R&lt;/a&gt; came up with only two publications, neither of which have anything to do with learning to read.  His &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Titzer"&gt;Wikipedia page &lt;/a&gt;claims that he has published no scholarly work on infant reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the background concepts are quite interesting, the bottom line is that we have another product being marketed to the public with amazing claims and no rigorous scientific evidence to back them up. This product also falls into the broader category of gimicky products claiming to make children smarter or more successful academically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxious parents wanting to give their kids every advantage is a great marketing demographic, in that they are easily exploited. But like all gimicky schemes promising easy answers to complex or difficult problems (weight loss, relationships, or academic success) in the end it is likely to be nothing but a costly distraction from more common sense approaches – like just spending quality time with your kids and giving them a rich and save environment.  What such products often really provide is a false sense of control.&lt;/p&gt;

A couple things that I failed to point out in that post: first, the version of the film on Babelgum is the &lt;a href="http://thelinguists.com/dvd/"&gt;DVD version&lt;/a&gt;, not the slightly shorter cut that has aired on &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt;; second, there are several additional clips that you can watch separately on Babelgum that are on the DVD. &lt;a href="http://www.babelgum.com/browser.php#grid%7CSEARCH,queryString:the%20linguists,order:MOST_RELEVANT"&gt;Search for "the linguists" on Babelgum&lt;/a&gt; and you'll find links to the trailer, the film, and the additional clips. These are all available for some unspecified limited period, so watch 'em now if you're interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm really following up on here, though, is &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1377#comment-30585"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt; by Jesse Tseng.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was struck by this sentence &lt;i&gt;[in the film, spoken by David Harrison–eb]&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't see how you can justify devoting your research career to the syntax of French (a language with millions of speakers), when the skills that you possess could help document a language that is going to go extinct within your lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm. The fieldwork skills I possess would make me go extinct long before any tribal language I helped to document. And good luck doing any syntax at all with your 15 sentences of Kallawaya…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, I was disappointed to hear this gratuitous swipe at the colleagues down the hall. I would like to believe that we are all engaged in a common endeavor, with the same justifications. And when linguistics departments get cut, all the sub-fields of linguistics go down together. Or are they hoping that the money then gets funneled into Anthropology?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ni:v] &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1377#comment-30593"&gt;replied thusly&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
@ Jesse Tseng: I think this is a matter of what angle you're looking at it from. When he said that it really struck me because I feel the same way. I am hoping to go into research of undocumented languages, so that line completely falls into place with how I feel.&lt;br&gt;
However, I don't think it was said maliciously; I interpreted it as Gregory (I think it was he who said it?) simply expressing his passion for what he does, and that he couldn't work on any language that has so much work done on it and no immediate chances of going extinct.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the spirit in which I took the comment, too, although unlike [ni:v] I have no particular aspirations to research on un(der)documented languages. But of course Jesse Tseng is justified in having been struck by this &amp;quot;gratuitous swipe at the colleagues down the hall&amp;quot; — there are certainly better ways to express one&amp;#39;s personal passion than to say &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t see how you can justify [doing something other than what I do]&amp;quot;. But in the context of the film — which is, after all, about endangered languages and the plight of their speakers — is there really a better (or even &amp;quot;good&amp;quot;) way to express the relevant sentiment? When David &lt;a href="http://ling.ucsd.edu/events/thelinguists/"&gt;screened the film here in San Diego&lt;/a&gt;, he turned to me during the relevant part of the film and whispered, smiling: "I hope there are no French syntacticians here." Clearly, David understands that the comment is inflammatory, and perhaps unnecessarily so, but would those of us linguists who don't work to document endangered languages feel any differently if David had instead said either one of the following?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I couldn't work on any language that has so much work done on it and no immediate chances of going extinct."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel an obligation to use my skills to help document languages that are going to go extinct within my lifetime."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real issue appears to be the specific reference David made in his comment: "the syntax of French", which in academic-linguistics-speak might be interpreted as code for something like, "abstract theoretical mental masturbation work on a major, standardized European language". [Full disclosure: &lt;a href="http://idiom.ucsd.edu/~bakovic/research.html"&gt;my own work&lt;/a&gt; could easily be categorized in this way.] David's expressing a personal value judgment on linguistic research; to the extent that we feel fine about what we do, we shouldn't take offense, and to the extent that we feel that such documentation work is also important, we should be glad that there are people like David out there doing (and promoting) it.&lt;/p&gt;

Many thoughtful alternative medicine practitioners and anti-vaccination activists have speculated that there might be more behind some of our blogs than meets the eye... drug company funding perhaps, or a network of sock puppets created by Ben Goldacre. Well today, for the first time ever, I'm going to blow the lid off the whole skeptical blogging scene, and expose the secret cabal that runs the "Bad Science Community."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, the folk at JABS were well ahead of the game, cottoning on quickly after the Jeni Barnett blog storm that something sinister was afoot. As three of their top investigative members &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squib: A little bird has told me Bad Science will be seeding the blog-sphere with this story. It would be interesting to find out if this has been at the suggestion of a PR Consultant. If he has employed a consultant, the email will probably included dangling carrots so as to deflect the blogger from independently checking the facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jabba: There is no way all of this could have happened so quickly without Pharma backing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have to prove that what they do, keeps the pharma donors happy....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story began back in 2003. With the MMR controversy in full swing, vaccine manufacturers like Merck were facing the terrifying prospect of plummeting orders from their sinister Health Ministry collaborators. If things didn't turn around soon, they were going to have to release a new brand of painkiller, or create a new type of flu to keep their profits going. In order to avert the crisis, they employed top PR specialists &lt;i&gt;BS Communications&lt;/i&gt; an agency with a long and distinguished history of influencing public health policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency had a plan - to leverage the increasing power of bloggers and create an 'astroturf' movement - but they needed a charismatic leader to inspire others to follow. Step forward &lt;i&gt;Keeping up Appearances&lt;/i&gt; actress Patricia Routledge. After the BBC cancelled her popular series &lt;i&gt;Hetty Wainthropp Investigates&lt;/i&gt;, the actress was out of work and looking for cash to supplement her pension. BS Communications approached her, and quickly established that a thirty-something male doctor was well within the range of the veteran thespian's abilities. Routledge signed, and the fake character "Ben Goldacre" was born. Some claim that you can see the resemblance in the following publicity photo from the mid-90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/ben.png" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the fake 'Ben' character in place, the next step was to recruit a number of sycophantic followers to, well, follow him. I was a freelancer when I was approached, selling bad jokes to comedy birthday card manufacturers. Work had dried up owing to the catastrophic collapse of the comedy card industry as the increasing age of the population meant that most people just wanted cards with flowers and trains and cricket bats on them. In that climate, I was more than happy to oblige. 'Zeno' was an obvious choice, with his &lt;a href="http://myzeno.com/"&gt;Acne Treatment Device&lt;/a&gt; sitting in direct competition to many of the qua..., sorry, &lt;i&gt;professionals&lt;/i&gt; targetted. Frank Swain came from the militant anti-science wing of the BNP, explaining his almost fanatical campaigning on their behalf ahead of the European Elections, while Gimpy is in fact nothing more than a modified chat bot regurgitating material from a Merck PR library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this crack team in place it's easy to see how BS Communications are able to dominate the blogosphere so effectively. Every couple of months, a random-number generator linked to a database of alternative health qua..., sorry, &lt;i&gt;professionals&lt;/i&gt; is used to generate a target, technology first used in a more primitive form by the Bush administration's defence staff (they used a dart and a blindfold, although latterly &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Cheney_hunting_incident"&gt;unsuccessful trials&lt;/a&gt; with a hunting rifle were conducted). Frank "No-Greens" Swain takes the result and sends an e-mail around telling everyone what to write; BSC make payments to us all via PayPal, Routledge dons her Goldacre wig and visits a pub to talk to drunk people in a sinister brain-washing exercise; and within 24 hours a media storm is created.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, you probably should have worked it out all along. I mean, the idea that a diverse and disordered bunch of people around the world passionate about politics and science would actually write these stories of their own free will is just nuts. I'll no doubt be expelled from the collective, but at least now you know The Truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one more thing - we set up the British Chiropractic Association as an elaborate parody. I mean, come on, did you really think such a daft organization could be real?!  &lt;/p&gt;

The good news is that this weekend promises to offer a metric ass-ton of fun and skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we got some bad news this morning: PZ Myers will not be joining us.  After the vigorous discussion on Skepchick about the impact of air travel on the environment, he has decided to swim back from Germany (where he was attending a conference).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just kidding.  Actually, his flights have been screwed up and he can’t fly out until Sunday evening, and will therefore miss the entire event.  Which makes us very sad, but, well, shit happens.  Nothing to be done about it but party even harder this weekend to make up for it (unless one of our brilliant readers has figured out the teleport–what’s taking you guys so long, anyway?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I hope you’ll still come out to hang with 5 Skepchicks, Pamela Gay, and Greg Laden.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246553983765"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/02/online-tam-registration-closes-tonight/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b5c352fb912bdc1f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="JREF"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Online TAM registration closes tonight</title><published>2009-07-02T16:35:07Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T16:35:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/02/online-tam-registration-closes-tonight/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’re still sitting on the fence about going to The Amaz!ng Meeting — and it starts one week from right now — it’s time to jump off: &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/618-tam-7-if-you-havent-registered-please-read.html"&gt;online registration closes tonight&lt;/a&gt; at 17:00 Eastern time (21:00 GMT). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re in the final prep stages for the meeting, and it’s looking fantastic. I don’t know which part I’m most excited about, because honestly there’s so much good stuff going on. But actually, even with the talks, workshops, demos, and everything else, I know what the best part will be: the community. Getting together with old friends, meeting new ones, and being surrounded by a thousand other critical thinkers. It’s like breathing fresh air after a year of being locked up on a stifling planet.&lt;/p&gt;

He cannot even fathom what God could've said differently about rapists, even to the point of thinking that his "Put up or shut up" demand is a debate stopper when asking me to suggest something else.

Given that your God is barbaric I am better than God, and you can quote me on that!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sheesh. Faith seems to go hand in hand with not being able to think.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/eva/blog" title=""&gt;Eva Amsen&lt;/a&gt;, a participant at the 2007 and 2009 meetings, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello readers of Bora's blog! I'm Eva, nice to meet you. I finished a PhD in Biochemistry at the University of Toronto in December, and before that I studied Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="EvaAmsen pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/EvaAmsen%20pic.jpg" width="448" height="336" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That depends... At the time I'm typing out these answers, I still have a few days left at my job at an undergraduate biology program, where I created/developed/ran a new website and did some other education support tasks. But by the time this goes live, I probably won't be there anymore, and depending on when Bora posts this, I might even be traveling. Traveling's not a job, though, although I do tend to plan my trips as meticulously as if I was a travel agent. But I am also doing some part-time freelance writing, so I guess that is my only consistent Real Life job at the moment. I'm also currently in the process of searching for a new full-time job. I would like to find a job in which I can coordinate communication between scientists, rather than a job doing research itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm fascinated by the huge shift from offline to online communication in research that happened in the 1990s. The very first people to communicate online *were* scientists: the first internet connection was between research groups! I'm of the very narrowly defined generation who got their first e-mail address as they entered university: e-mail already existed in academia, but high school students weren't using it yet. At the time, not all journal articles were online yet, but by the time I graduated, I only *rarely* needed to physically visit a library. The web has made searching the literature so much more simple than it was before. But now, it seems to have come to a point where the web is making things *more* complicated. Should you blog? If so, who should blog? Do you publish your data online or not? Are people blurring personal lives with professional lives, and is that inevitable or do we need to separate the two again? Why are some people completely obsessed with all that has the suffix 2.0, while others just want to sit back and quietly read a paper? These are the things that I like to think about, and why I fly out to events like ScienceOnline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that depends which "work" we're talking about. It has always been entirely separate from my work in research - blogging was just a hobby. It still is. I blog because I like doing it, and meanwhile ended up with three science blogs. (&lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/eva/blog" title=""&gt;Expression Patterns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://science.easternblot.net" title=""&gt;Easternblot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scientistmusicians.wordpress.com" title=""&gt;Musicians and Scientists&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the job I just finished, I implemented a content management system that lets the staff update the website in a really simple way, very much *like* a blog, although we don't allow comments on the news posts because moderation would be too much a of a time commitment. We have talked about ways to use Twitter in the classroom, but I haven't used that in an education setting myself. For freelance writing, my blog has been crucial. I don't think I've ever had a paid writing job that wasn't directly or indirectly related to my blogging. I tend to not explicitly recommend blogging as a career move unless someone says they want a career in science writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for FriendFeed and Facebook, I am very skeptical about their use in a work setting. Once you start to mix your work network with your private network, things get confusing and messy. But as I said, I'd like to find a job where I can think more about how scientists interact online, and what is *best* for them, so my opinion shouldn't matter so much. I'm more interested in the *facts* - are researchers getting more or less work done when they use a particular service? Are they better for it, and how do you define "better"? There are a lot of factors involved in this, and I think the scientific community is starting to wonder these things more and more. I can talk about this for hours, and sometimes blog about it, so lets just move on...(related blog posts: &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/eva/blog/2009/04/27/scientists-and-web-2-0" title=""&gt;Scientists and Web 2.0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/eva/blog/2009/06/26/from-the-vault-the-friendfeed-attitude" title=""&gt;From the Vault - The FriendFeed Attitude&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are some of the similarities and differences between ScienceOnline and the conference you organized in Toronto?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scibarcamp.org" title=""&gt;SciBarCamp&lt;/a&gt;, which I organized twice in Toronto, is based on the BarCamp/SciFoo model, where participants create the schedule on the opening night. Since we had a lot of guests who were very interested in new, web-based ways to communicate science, we did have some topics (and participants!) that also came by at ScienceOnline. But we've also had broader sessions, about using science to save the environment, or science in poetry, or &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZbpDGw8eA8" title=""&gt;demonstrations of Mars Rovers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kaythaney/3520418093/" title=""&gt;hydraulic music instruments&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever the participants want to talk about on the first day, that ends up on the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to see you again and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bye! And I hope to see *you* at the next SciBarCamp!&lt;/p&gt;

I am very aware of my limitations. I wish I had time to  be expert on a great many things, but we must pick and choose. I have an idea that I think will enhance many skeptical debates, but I need help. If you answer yes to all of the following questions, maybe you can send me an email?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Can you program websites? I don't mean modify templates, I can do that. I mean could you, with time, create a website like reddit or recovery.org? Can you create code that would be generated for people to place on their websites that would direct people to particular links on this website? Similar to digg buttons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Are you truly skeptical? Would you really change your mind about something given a standard of evidence that you use for other things you agree with? If it could be shown the gun ownership reduces crime without increasing accidental death, would you change your gun control stance? Is there ever enough evidence that could be assembled that would lead you to believe in a designer?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Do you have time to make a website? I have no idea how long this would take, there may be tools available around to make implementation faster. I’m not looking for a lot of graphics or flash. Just functionality. I don’t think its pure html, i suspect there is java involved. But I am not sure. These is not a static site and will require a database and account creation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Would you want to work with an anonymous skeptic?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well those are my big questions. I’m sure more may crop up.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I really think this idea could attract a lot of traffic and I really think it would help a lot in skeptical debates and getting information out there. I can’t offer money, who has any? I can offer some part of any sort of google ad revenue, but some of that money would have to go towards maintaining the site.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Any takers?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/26613182-8354541494133005159?l=techskeptic.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Techskeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Effort Sisyphus</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246547816568"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1553">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0933fe8bb02c128a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and culture"/><title type="html">The sociolinguistics of English middle names</title><published>2009-07-02T14:55:50Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T14:55:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1553" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A note from Bob Ladd:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I just picked up and put away a book I'd bought in a second-hand bookstore  before going to Romania in 1978, called "The Balkans in our Time", by  Robert Lee Wolff, a mid-century Harvard historian.  I realized that he's  yet another example of a generalization that must somehow tell us  something about how language works: Anglo-elite American academic  historians often use their full middle name.  Samuel Eliot Morrison and  Henry Steele Commager come readily to mind, but Robert Lee Wolff fits the  pattern, as does another more recent writer, Walter Russell Mead.  And  Andrew Dickson White, the first president of Cornell, was a historian.  It's hard to search for these on Google, but I'm pretty sure I've noticed  others, and I can't think of people who use their middle name and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;aren't&lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; American academic historians, except for good ol' boys like Billy Bob  Thornton and Jerry Lee Lewis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Actually, as I wrote the above I wondered about the Anglo-elite Harvard  connection, and I realize I may be underestimating that factor and  overestimating the historian factor.  A look at the Harvard presidents  website throws up James Bryant Conant (who was a chemist, apparently), and  a further search of the mental lexicon produces John Maynard Keynes, who  was certainly Anglo-elite but not American.  Similar websites from  other Ivy League-ish places suggest other such names, mostly from about  1850-1950, though they aren't people I've heard of so it's hard to be sure  if they were really know by all three names.  (The Cornell president  website seems to list middle names for everyone, including people who I  know didn't regularly use them.  Penn seems to do the same.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Obviously I need a vacation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that Billy Bob Thornton and Jerry Lee Lewis are instances of a different pattern, namely compound first names, where friends would call them "Billy Bob" or "Jerry Lee". I doubt that Samuel Eliot Morison's intimates called him "Samuel Eliot".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conforming to the original pattern, there are also writers like Percy Bysshe Shelley, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Robert Louis Stevenson; and politicians like William Jennings Bryan. There are also women, like Elizabeth Barrett Browning, whose middle name may have been retained out of deference to their name before marriage — EBB was born Elizabeth Barrett Moulton-Barrett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are quite different multiple-name patterns in other cultures: French compound first names, Russian patronymics, Spanish &lt;em&gt;apellido paterno &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;apellido materno&lt;/em&gt;, etc.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there's the maybe-related pattern of using a first initial and a middle name: E. Digby Baltzell, J. Fred Muggs. Or two initials, like E.E. Cummings, J.R. Ewing, or A.A. Milne. Or the occasional explosion of names exemplified in Milne's immortal lines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;James James&lt;br&gt;
Morrison Morrison&lt;br&gt;
Weatherby George Dupree&lt;br&gt;
Took great&lt;br&gt;
Care of his mother&lt;br&gt;
Though he was only three.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, other LL readers in need of a vacation may be able to help us understand why certain English-speaking subcultures use middle names more adhesively than others. I imagine that there's even a scholarly literature on this subject, though I don't have time to look for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — We shouldn&amp;#39;t neglect the recent famous case of name recycling: our 41st president, George Herbert Walker Bush, and our 43rd president, George Walker Bush.

It began when Kimball C. Atwood IV, MD; Elizabeth Woeckner, AB, MA; Robert S. Baratz, MD, DDS, PhD; and Wallace I. Sampson, MD published a &lt;a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570625"&gt;lengthy criticism of the NIH Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT)&lt;/a&gt; in Medscape, pointing out that it was a boondoggle that was not only not based on sound science but was in fact risky to patients and riddled with conflicts of interest and administered by highly dubious practitioners. If you want to know just how bad the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) could go in terms of studying quackery and doing a very poor job of it, it's really worth reading the entire article. Of course, I will concede that TACT wasn't entirely NCCAM's fault. Its scientific advisory board voted against funding it because, it concluded, there was an insufficient scientific basis. Unfortunately, quackery fan and antivaccine zealot Representative Dan Burton applied pressure, and suddenly NCCAM did have $30 million after all to fund this study. The article by Atwood et al is really, really long, but worth reading, as is, I would humbly posit, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/05/they_dont_call_it_cheatlation_for_nothin.php?utm_source=sbhomepage&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_content=channellink"&gt;my discussion of the issue&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, in September the NIH decided to suspend TACT until the allegations in the article could be more carefully investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, woo-meisters everywhere mounted a counterattack against the Medscape article. Perhaps most hilarious of these was an article published in, so very appropriately, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_journal_of_american_physicians_and_s.php"&gt;Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons&lt;/a&gt; by Beth Clay entitled &lt;a href="http://www.jpands.org/vol14no2/clay.pdf"&gt;Study of Chelation Therapy Should Not Be Abandoned&lt;/a&gt;. Harriet Hall did a comprehensive takedown of the misinformation contained in this article; so I won't go into detail. Suffice it to say that it was a perfect article to publish in JPANDS. Indeed, it went beyond the normally high level of crankery that JPANDS promotes. I can boil down Ms. Clay's points very easily:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/they_dont_call_it_cheat-lation_for_nothi.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/they_dont_call_it_cheat-lation_for_nothi.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/_pxft1J41cY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246543101543"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_sorry_state_of_the_public.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/790de050f846c7fe</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">The sorry state of the public mind</title><published>2009-07-02T14:06:19Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T14:06:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/he9-XnPeozU/the_sorry_state_of_the_public.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_sorry_state_of_the_public.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The British Council has carried out an &lt;a href="http://www.britishcouncil.org/new/en/press-office/press-releases/Darwin-survey-shows-international-consensus-on-acceptance-of-evolution/"&gt;international survey on people's opinions about evolution&lt;/a&gt;. I cringe at these sorts of things; they so rarely give me an opportunity to put on a big foam rubber hand and chant "WE'RE #1!". There aren't really any surprises here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that the majority of people polled have heard of Charles Darwin with the highest levels of awareness in Russia (93%), Mexico (91%), Great Britain (91%), and China (90%) whilst less than half of people polled in Egypt (38%) and South Africa (27%) saying they had not heard of him. Overall, the majority (70%) of people surveyed have heard of the British naturalist.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Adults in the United States (84%) showed the highest levels of awareness and understanding of evolution and Darwin's theories followed by Great Britain (80%) saying they had a 'good or some knowledge' of the theory of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so fast there — the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect"&gt;Dunning-Kruger effect&lt;/a&gt; comes into play here. People in the United States do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; have a high level of understanding of evolution, and this survey did not measure actual competence. I&amp;#39;ve found that the people most likely to declare that they have a thorough knowledge of evolution are the creationists…but that a brief conversation is always sufficient to discover that all they&amp;#39;ve really got is a confused welter of misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's pretty easy to see in this next sad result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Russia (48%), USA (42%), South Africa (41%) and Egypt (25%) remained sceptical about the scientific evidence that exists to support Darwin's theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So more than half disbelieve evolution, but more than 80% think they're knowledgeable about it. There's a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have a number for the accommodationists: 53% of Americans are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all countries polled more people agreed than disagreed that it is possible to believe in a God and hold the view that life evolved on Earth by means of natural selection at the same time, with those in India most likely (85%) to be of this opinion, followed by Mexico (65%), Argentina (63%), South Africa, Great Britain (54%), USA, Russia (53%), Egypt, Spain (45%), and China (39%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Daniels&lt;/a&gt; reviewed my book on Amazon. Among some minor criticisms he wrote:&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;As a former evangelical missionary who lost my faith nearly a decade ago, I am struck by how closely Loftus' arguments against Christianity match those that drove me independently out of the fold. My journey was long and painful; I discovered the flaws of my faith in bits and pieces until the weight of them all tipped the scales against my former position. In retrospect I believe the process could have been cut significantly shorter if John's book had been available to me years before my crisis finally came to a head. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The value of this volume lies not so much in its development of unique arguments as in its bringing together in a single accessible package most of the important criticisms that have been advanced against the Christian faith (and theism in general) since the Enlightenment. To be sure, there are individual books that delve into each topic more deeply than John's, but few if any cover as many bases as &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/06/why-i-became-atheist.html"&gt;Why I Became an Atheist&lt;/a&gt;, while at the same time digging as deeply as can be expected for a general audience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though I have read many books arguing for and against the reasonableness of the Christian faith, I was rewarded with a number of helpful insights sprinkled throughout the text.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I found Loftus' treatment of the Atonement to be particularly incisive. I have not read a more succinct and effective rejoinder to the penal substitution theory than his...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[It is] an unremitting battery of helpfully organized arguments against orthodox Christianity. There is no denying that Loftus is well read and gifted at consolidating the arguments of a wide variety authors, tying them together with his own thoughtful analysis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loftus is superb at anticipating and preempting the counter-arguments of believers. Well done, John! &lt;/blockquote&gt;To read the whole review &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Became-Atheist-Preacher-Christianity/product-reviews/1591025923/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;showViewpoints=0&amp;amp;sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending#R2UZJ1221Z4J1Y"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FYI: You can find my book as a Kindle Book on Amazon: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FL3T8W?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002FL3T8W"&gt;Why I Became an Atheist: A Former Preacher Rejects Christianity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B002FL3T8W" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ken Daniels just informed me he wrote his own book soon to be available on amazon.

Dr. Collins is a world-renowned scientist and geneticist, and also a committed Christian. In his recent best-selling book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Language-God-Scientist-Presents-Evidence/dp/0743286391"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Language Of God&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Collins attempts to harmonize his commitment to both science and religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some critics (such as &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/60-second-science/post.cfm?id=dawkins-says-francis-collins-is-not"&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;) have expressed reservations about Dr. Collins’ faith, wondering if it might cloud his scientific judgment. Since Collins is rumored to be the most likely candidate for directorship of the NIH, and because I wanted to know if Dawkins et al. had any reason for concern, I decided to read &lt;em&gt;The Language Of God.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, Christians are a rather heterogeneous group - with a range of viewpoints on evolution, science, and the interpretation of Biblical texts. On one extreme there are Christians (often referred to as “young earth creationists” or simply “creationists”) who believe in an absolutely literal interpretation of the Genesis story, and see evolution as antithetical to true faith. Dr. Collins suggests that as many as 45% of Christians may actually be in this camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum are Christians who embrace evolution, accept and promote scientific thinking, and understand the Bible to be a blend of poetry, allegory, and historical literature. While they see the Genesis account of creation as poetic, the Gospel accounts of Jesus’ life and teachings are considered to be more literal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Collins’ views are very representative of the scientific end of the Christian spectrum. In fact, he spends several chapters attempting to help creationists embrace evolution. He takes great pains to explain how irrational it is to deny the evidence we have (both from a genetic, and an archeological/basic science perspective) for evolution. He argues that evolution is not an enemy of faith, but rather an enlightening look at how God’s creative process works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collins also takes on “Intelligent Design (ID),” exposing it as a PR play, not a true scientific theory. He suggests that ID is an “argument from personal incredulity” expressed in the language of mathematics, biochemistry, and genetics. Furthermore, Collins explains that ID proponents have confused the unknown with the unknowable - there is no current “irreducible complexity” that cannot be explained by evolutionary theory. We don’t need a “God of the gaps” to explain what we’ve yet to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting parts of the book is Dr. Collins’ mathematical review of the incredibly low odds of the right blend of atoms/elements and the correct rate of expansion of the universe to occur by chance. He argues that certain atomic particles needed to be present in unequal and varying amounts at the earliest moment of the Big Bang to produce - eventually - the right conditions for life as we know it. He uses this analogy: it’s possible that a poker player could randomly obtain a straight flush in 50 consecutive hands. However, a more plausible explanation is that he’s cheating. In the same way, the universe could have come into being by coincidence, but it’s more likely that it was a coordinated event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collins’ argument for the existence of God is compelling to me. His explanation of why he chose to become a Christian is a little less so. Collins often resorts to lengthy quotes of &lt;a href="http://www.cslewis.org/"&gt;C.S. Lewis&lt;/a&gt; in lieu of his own theological rationale - but I suppose we can forgive him for this. He is first and foremost a scientist, not a theologian, and his book simply reflects that fact. [Those interested in a more compelling theological rationale for Christianity might try Timothy Keller’s, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://thereasonforgod.com/"&gt;The Reason For God: Belief In An Age Of Skepticism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Collins claims to believe in “theistic evolution.” He says that few people have heard of it because it harmonizes science and religion - and “harmony is boring” and doesn’t have a PR agenda. Nonetheless, he finds it internally consistent and intellectually satisfying. The material world is best understood through scientific inquiry, the spiritual world cannot be tested or understood by science. Matters of conscience, morality, and a yearning for answers to questions that may not be resolved empirically (What happens to us after death? What existed before the Big Bang? Is there a soul?) are matters best left for religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;em&gt;The Language Of God&lt;/em&gt;, I feel confident that Collins is a reasonable person. He embraces science more successfully than many people of faith, and I didn’t notice anything about his beliefs that would make me question his ability to lead the NIH in true, scientific inquiry. In fact, &lt;em&gt;The Language Of God&lt;/em&gt; may embolden other Christians to join the Science-Based Medicine movement by offering them a rational way to allow faith and science to co-exist. I hope that  scientists who hold atheist or agnostic religious views will embrace this small group of evolutionary theists as religious moderates who fully support scientific orthodoxy.&lt;/p&gt;

But he started out in a shaky moral position, and he got his facts wrong, so it didn't turn out well for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Ben Goldacre started the whole thing ("&lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/06/world-conference-of-science-journalists-troublemakers-fringe-penderels-oak-pub-holborn-1st-july-8pm-midnight/"&gt;World Conference of Science Journalists – Troublemakers Fringe, Penderel’s Oak Pub, Holborn, 1st July 8pm – Midnight&lt;/a&gt;", Bad Science, 6/24/2009):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Next week the World Conference of Science Journalists will be coming to London. A few of us felt they were might not adequately address some of the key problems in their profession, which has deteriorated to the point where they present a serious danger to public health, fail to keep geeks well nourished, and actively undermine the publics’ understanding of what it means for there to be evidence for a claim.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;More importantly we fancied some troublemaking and a night in the pub.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;As a result, you have the opportunity to come and see three angry nerds explain how and why mainstream media’s science coverage is broken, misleading, dangerous, lazy, venal, and silly. Join our angry rabble, and tell the world of science journalists exactly what you think about their work. All are welcome, admission is free. They may not come.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;After the presentations (with powerpoint and everything, in a pub) we will attempt to collaboratively and drunkenly derive some best practise guidelines for health and science journalists, with your kind assistance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on the wrong side of the Atlantic last night, but I drank an IPA in sympathy — and if you&amp;#39;ll look at the bottom of this post, you&amp;#39;ll find a link to my contribution towards those &amp;quot;best practise guidelines&amp;quot; — which features Mr. Connor himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Steve Connor struck back ("&lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/steve-connor-lofty-medics-should-stick-to-their-day-job-1724485.html"&gt;Lofty medics should stick to their day job&lt;/a&gt;", The Independent, 6/30/2009):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#3366ff"&gt;The sixth World Conference of Science Journalists is underway in London. I can’t say it’s going to change my life, as I missed out on the previous five, but I did notice that it has attracted the attention of a bunch of medics with strong views on the state of science journalism today. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#3366ff"&gt;The medics met in a pub in London last night to explain why the "mainstream media's science coverage is broken, misleading, dangerous, lazy, venal and silly". All three speakers are gainfully employed by the public sector so they don't actually have to worry too much about the sort of pressures and financial constraints the mainstream media are under. But they nevertheless condescended to offer some advice on the sort of "best practice guidelines" I should be following, for which I suppose I should be eternally grateful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#3366ff"&gt;But their arrogance is not new. Medical doctors in particular have always had a lofty attitude to the media's coverage of their profession, stemming no doubt from the God-like stance they take towards their patients. Although I wouldn't go as far as to say their profession is broken, dangerous, lazy, venal and silly – not yet anyway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Goldacre and his two fellow trouble-makers responded yesterday with a letter to The Independent, which may or may not get published there. But who reads letters to the editor in newspapers, anyhow? So more usefully, Ben reproduced the letter on his weblog ("&lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/07/steve-connor-is-getting-eggy/"&gt;Steve Connor is an angry man&lt;/a&gt;", Bad Science, 7/1/2009):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Your science journalist Steve Connor is furious that we are holding a small public meeting in a pub to discuss the problem that science journalists are often lazy and inaccurate. He gets the date wrong, claiming the meeting has already happened (it has not). He says we are three medics (only one of us is). He then invokes some stereotypes about arrogant doctors, which we hope are becoming outdated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In fact, all three of us believe passionately in empowering patients, with good quality information, so they can make their own decisions about their health. People often rely on the media for this kind of information. Sadly, in the field of science and medicine, on subjects as diverse as MMR, sexual health, and cancer prevention, the public have been repeatedly and systematically misled by journalists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;We now believe this poses a serious threat to public health, and it is sad to see the problem belittled in a serious newspaper. Steve Connor is very welcome to attend our meeting, which is free and open to all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, now for my small contribution to "best practice guidelines" for science journalism, which is also relevant because Steve Connor wrote one of the featured Bad Examples.  "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/004767.html"&gt;Thou shalt not report odds ratios&lt;/a&gt;", 7/30/2007:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;This is a second in a series of posts aimed at improving the rhetoric (and logic) of science journalism. Last time ("&lt;a href="http://158.130.17.5/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/004736.html"&gt;Two simple numbers&lt;/a&gt;", 7/22/2007), I asked for something positive: stories on "the genetic basis of X" should tell us how frequent the genomic variant is among people with X and among people without X. This time, I've got a related, but negative, request.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;No, let's make it a commandment: Thou Shalt Not Report Odds Ratios. In fact, I'd like to suggest that any journalist who reports an odds ratio as if it were a relative risk should be &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;fired&lt;/span&gt; sent back to school.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s where Steve Connor comes into it — You should really &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/004767.html"&gt;follow the link and read the whole discussion of &lt;em&gt;odds ratios&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;risk ratios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but for those of you who don't follow links, I'll reproduce part of my discussion of his contribution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;Find any piece of reporting that talks about "raising the risk of X by Y%", or any of the many other ways of putting this same concept into English, and the chances are that you've found a violation of this commandment. Let me give two recent examples, among &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;amp;ned=us&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=%22percent+more+likely%22%7C%22per+cent+more+likely%22&amp;amp;btnG=Search"&gt;thousands&lt;/a&gt; lurking in the past month's news archive.
&lt;p&gt;According to Steve Connor, "&lt;a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/sci_tech/article2737124.ece"&gt;Childhood asthma gene identified by scientists&lt;/a&gt;", The Independent, 7/5/2007&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;A gene that significantly increases the risk of asthma in children has been discovered by scientists who described it as the strongest link yet in the search to find a genetic basis for the condition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Inheriting &lt;strong&gt;the gene&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;raises the risk of developing asthma by between 60 and 70 per cent&lt;/strong&gt; - enough for researchers to believe that the discovery may eventually open the way to new treatments for the condition.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;[emphasis added]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study in question (I believe — the article doesn&amp;#39;t give any specific reference, as usual for the genre of science journalism) is Miriam F. Moffatt et al., &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v448/n7152/abs/nature06014.html"&gt;Genetic variants regulating ORMDL3 expression contribute to the risk of childhood asthma&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, Nature 448, 470-473 (26 July 2007). This is another big genome-wide association study — roughly 300,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were scanned in several populations in the UK and in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, general information about allele frequencies is not provided (and perhaps was not available). However, this information is given in one crucial case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In the subset of individuals for whom expression data are available, the T nucleotide allele at rs7216389 (the marker most strongly associated with disease in the combined GWA analysis) has a frequency of 62% amongst asthmatics compared to 52% in non-asthmatics (P = 0.005 in this sample).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Steve Connor is not a sports columnist trying his hand at a science piece. (That's a plausible excuse for Denis Campbell's disastrously botched autism/MMR story in the Observer, memorably vivisected by Ben Goldacre in &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/index.php?s=observer%2Bmmr"&gt;many Bad Science posts&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/?p=458"&gt;BMJ article&lt;/a&gt;.) Connor is listed as the "Science Editor" of the Independent, and he ought to know better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;Looking this over, I think that I may have been wrong on one point. When I wrote it, the many  recent news articles that discussed "raising the risk of X by Y%" or similar formulations were mostly talking about odds ratios, at least in the sample that I checked. When I look today, I also find many such articles (though perhaps not as many as I found then), but of the first few I checked, several were talking about risk ratios rather than odds ratios.
&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#39;t believe that this is because science journalists have taken my advice — I imagine that most of them are unaware that it was ever given. It&amp;#39;s because some scientists&amp;#39; press releases cite risk ratios, while others cite odds ratios, and the science writers just go with what they&amp;#39;re given. In July of 2007, I happened to check a number of studies where the culturally-standard methodology yields estimates of odds ratios; today, there are a larger number from subdisciplines where risk ratios seem to be the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if science writers knew the difference, asked questions in each case so as to sort out what the provided numbers really mean, and expressed them in a way that wouldn't mislead their readers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246540591897"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/02/binary-planetary-systems-caught-in-the-act-of-forming/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/36438ec123d8856c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><title type="html">Binary planetary systems caught in the act of forming!</title><published>2009-07-02T13:00:57Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T13:00:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/02/binary-planetary-systems-caught-in-the-act-of-forming/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Astronomers have discovered a young binary system where both stars are surrounded by thick disks of material that are in the process of forming planets! And it’s a near thing, too — this system almost didn’t exist at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/press-releases/2solarSystems/2solarSystemsJun09.shtml"&gt;the cool image&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/press-releases/2solarSystems/2solarSystemsJun09.shtml"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/07/sma_hst_253-1536.jpg" alt="SMA and HST view of 253-1536"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the right is a Hubble Space Telescope image of the two stars (collectively called, weirdly, 253-1536). In the optical, the disk enveloping the star on the left (called 253-53 a, so I’ll just call it Star A) is obvious. It’s dark because it blocks most of the light from the star, which is deeply embedded in the disk and can barely be seen. The star on the right (Star B) has a disk as well, but it’s far smaller than the other star’s disk, and swamped by the light of the star. So the components of this binary are like Jekyll and Hyde: one star is blocked by the dark disk, and in the other the disk is outglared by the bright star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image on the left was made using the Submillimeter Array, or SMA. At this wavelength (almost out in the radio part of the spectrum) the warm dust in the disks is bright, and the stars are almost completely dark. The disk on the right becomes obvious. Using some relatively simple math, the mass of the disks can be calculated (basically by measuring the size and brightness of the disks): Star A’s disk on the left has a mass of about 70 times that of Jupiter, and Star B’s disk is about 20 times Jupiter’s mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our entire solar system of planets (that is, everything except the Sun) has roughly twice the mass of Jupiter. So what we’re seeing here is easily enough material to make a fully-fledged system of planets! In fact, this is the very first time a binary star, where both stars are detected in visible light, has been seen where &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; has a disk capable of making planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.1400"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/07/scuba_orion.jpg" alt="SCUBA Orion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Very cool. And, actually, rather lucky for these stars. They are located inside the vast Orion Nebula, a star-making factory about 1300 light years from Earth. In the heart of the nebula is a cluster of stars containing extremely massive, hot, and bright stars. The starlight from those beacons is so fierce that it actually disrupts disks around nearby young stars; the ultraviolet light boils away the dust in a process called photoevaporation. As you can see in this image (which I took from &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.1400"&gt;the scientific journal paper about these observations&lt;/a&gt;) 253-1536 is located about a parsec away (more than 3 light years) from the center of the nebula, sparing it from the harshest effects of those bright stars. Had it been much closer, the disks around the two stars would have boiled away by now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few million years, both these stars may have actual planets orbiting them. Star B is a red dwarf, cool and dim, and it’s not clear what type of star A is. Probably not terribly massive, and I’m guessing somewhat less massive than the Sun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine what the sky would look like from such a planet! From Star A’s planets, for example, Star B would be an intense red glare in the sky, far far brighter than Venus appears from Earth. The position of the other star in the sky would change slowly as the two stars complete their 4500 year long orbit. And if you look away from the other star, you’d be looking deep into the heart of the nebula, where a dozen or more stars would shine almost as brightly as the Moon does from Earth! And, of course, you’d see the nebula itself stretched across half your sky, glowing red, green, and white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would sorely love to see such a thing. Wow. Whatever life that eventually evolves there would be very lucky to get such a view… and they’d have another advantage over us. The two stars of 253-1563 are separated by only about 400 times the Earth-Sun distance, about ten times the distance of Pluto from the Earth. If they really had the will, life there could visit the other system! It would be a technical achievement and difficult to be sure, but we’re almost there ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmph. I do believe I’m jealous of a hypothetical life form that won’t even exist for billions of years, if it ever does! Come to think of it, though, by the time any life there has the tech savvy to build rockets, all those bright stars in the nebula will have long since exploded as supernovae… and worse, at a distance of only a few light years, those titanic explosions will do serious damage to any planets, and in fact could blow away those disks long before planets could form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe planets never will get a chance to exist there. Wow, again: I went from jealous to sad awfully quickly. But such is life in the Universe. I suppose I should just be glad that we here on Earth are clever enough to create telescopes to give us a view of such a remarkable system, and that allows us to appreciate what we see… and what we’ve got already.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246540427073"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clocktutorial_3a_-_clock_evolu.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/03acbf3a7e5f9018</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Tutorials"/><title type="html">ClockTutorial #3a - Clock Evolution</title><published>2009-07-02T11:28:22Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T11:28:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/4s1v_9GnlDY/clocktutorial_3a_-_clock_evolu.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clocktutorial_3a_-_clock_evolu.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://circadiana.blogspot.com/2005/01/clocktutorial-3-clock-evolution.html" title="ClockTutorial #3a - Clock Evolution"&gt;&lt;img alt="ClockTutorial #3a - Clock Evolution" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2006/06/ClockWeb%20logo2.JPG" width="104" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://circadiana.blogspot.com/2005/01/clocktutorial-3-clock-evolution.html" title=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This post, originally published on January 16, 2005, was modified from one of my written prelims questions from early 2000.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clocktutorial_3a_-_clock_evolu.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clocktutorial_3a_-_clock_evolu.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/4s1v_9GnlDY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246540207168"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7977">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f06c9615afe3313f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 7.2</title><published>2009-07-02T13:00:08Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T13:00:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7977" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

Here's the relevant portion of his &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/AbstractDetails.AxCMS?AbstractID=329"&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theory of molecular evolution that we also call "Molecular Darwinism" is based on the acquired knowledge on genetic variation. In genetic variation, products of evolution genes are involved as variation generators and/or as modulators of the rates of genetic variation. These evolution gene products act together with several non-genetic elements that can be assigned to intrinsic properties of matter, to environmental mutagens and to random encounter. We conclude that natural reality takes actively care of biological evolution. The evolution genes must have been fine-tuned for their functions by second-order selection, so that spontaneous genetic variation with different evolutionary qualities occurs at quite low rates. This ensures a relatively high genetic stability to individuals, as well as an evolutionary progress at the level of populations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The presence of evolution genes points to a duality of the genome: while many genes act to the benefit of the individuals for the fulfillment of their lives, the evolution genes act to the benefit of an evolutionary development, for a slow, but steady expansion of life and biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;You see the problem, I hope. These hypothetical genes that do not necessarily directly affect the fitness of the individual are assumed to be promoted in lineages by a higher level of selection. This is not easily supported by evolutionary theory: there isn&amp;#39;t a mechanism given for individuals to maintain a gene that will only help its many-times-great-grandchildren. It is inferring a kind of foresight to evolution that is doesn&amp;#39;t have a mechanism…unless, perhaps, Arber is going to give use one. We&amp;#39;ll see. This talk will start in about 15 minutes, and I&amp;#39;ll update this post as he fills us in.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple history lesson: modern evolutionary biology is the convergence of work that began with Miescher (1874: nucleic acids) which led to molecular biology, Mendel (1876) which led to genetics, and Darwin (1859) that approached the problem at the level of organisms and species. The neo-Darwinian synthesis fused the genetic and Darwinian line, molecular genetics brought together genetics and biochemistry/molecular biology, and molecular evolution brings all three together—he seems to claim some kind of intellectual ownership of the last concept, which is what he calls molecular darwinism.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do bacteria generate new variants? By transformation, conjugation, or transduction. All are mechanisms that transfer genes from an external source to the bacterium. Work in the 1940s demonstrated that DNA was the carrier of genetic information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arber gave a little summary of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; gene structure, which I suppose would be helpful to all the chemists here. He defines mutation as an alteration of the nucleotide sequence; in classical genetics, it's defined differently, as an altered phenotype that is transmitted to progeny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutations are rarely favorable; often unfavorable, and very often silent or neutral. &lt;b&gt;There is no good evidence for directedness of spontaneous mutations.&lt;/b&gt; Mutations do not appear in response to a need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He argues that there are three elements to evolution: evolution is driven by genetic variation (mutation), directed by natural selection, and modulated by isolation as a mechanism for speciation. There are multiple mechanisms generating genetic variation: spontaneous DNA sequence alteration, DNA rearrangement or recombination, and DNA acquisition (horizontal gene transfer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, this is all very unchallenging and basic, at least for someone with any background in genetics and cell biology. After sitting through one talk that completely lost me with a failure to explain the basic terms of the work, I can't complain, but I confess, I'm having trouble staying alert through all this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some genes can affect the rate of occurence of mutations — these are modulators of the frequency of genetic variation.  He calls these evolution genes. He says neatral reality actively takes care of biological evolution, and that this is an expansion of the biological theory of evolution. This leads to an expansion of biological diversity, and, he argues, higher complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not very impressed. This is a combination of the commonplace and some odd interpretations. Of course there is variation in fidelity of replication that is influenced by genetic variation. Some of it is simply thermodynamically necessary: perfect fidelity is impossible to achieve, and greater fidelity has a metabolic cost, so some of that variation is utterly unsurprising. Some is; when we have organisms that have specializations to directly generate greater genetic variation — and sex is the first to come to my mind — we have a problem to explain. I don&amp;#39;t see that Arber has proposed anything to explain the real problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, what Arber said here does not make him a friend to intelligent design creationism, or creationism of any kind, &lt;a href="http://www.icr.org/article/werner-arber-nobel-laureate-darwin-skeptic/"&gt;despite the claims of some unreliable creationist sources&lt;/a&gt;, a claim that &lt;a href="http://www.icr.org/article/4620/"&gt;Arber has directly rejected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd have to say it was a nice enough overview, but didn't really propose anything novel, and definitely didn't demonstrate anything that can't be explained in the context of modern evolutionary theory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/werner_arber_molecular_darwini.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/KFboldkiLI0" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246529852437"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/richard_royce_schrock_recent_a.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d2f851e128b36a8b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Lindau"/><title type="html">Richard Royce Schrock: Recent Advances in Olefin Metathesis Catalyzed by Molybdenum and Tungsten Alkylidene Complexes</title><published>2009-07-02T10:32:39Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T10:32:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/OrclYGHalZk/richard_royce_schrock_recent_a.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/richard_royce_schrock_recent_a.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Uh-oh.

Tsien favors a synthetic approach, asking hwo to build new molecules that will perform amusing and useful functions in biology. He compares it to architecture on a molecular scale that is also a rigorous test of one's understanding of molecular function. &lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He thinks biology has the most interesting grand questions in all of science (hooray!). He also likes pretty colors. However, he thinks that interdisciplinary barriers prevent most biologists from knowing how to manipulate molecules other than nucleotides and proteins. Anyone who knows how to make non-linear molecules has an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His first target was intracellular Ca++, which we all know is central to cellular signaling. He gave a quick overview of Ca++ properties and functions, as a rationale for why he began looking at Ca++ indicators like aequorin. He started looking for something new, started with something selective for calcium, the calcium chelator EGTA, which lacks any chromophore. One way would be to add benzene rings (chromophores) to EGTA, which led to BAPTA, basically EGTA with two benzene rings. It has high calcium sensitivity and did exhibit a color shift, but a poor one. This work led to Fura-2 synthesis, in which you can still see the EGTA ancestor, but has a much more complex set of rings attached to it. Fura-2 requires microinjection, which Tsien wasn't good at, so he synthesized a protected form of the molecule with a methyl ester protecting group that would be stripped by enzymes in the cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He showed a gorgeous image of the Ca++ wave in sea urchin fertilization, visualized with pseudo-colored images of calcium concentration visualized with Fura-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step: Tsien wanted to visualize cAMP, an important second messenger in cell processes. They needed a non-destructive way to assay the dynamics of cAMP, which is present at very low concentration in the presence of many other nucleotides. The idea again was to find a specific binding agent and coupling it to a chromophore. He chose to use a specific PKA subunit that binds to cAMP, and use fluorescence resonance with a pair of adjacent chromophores. It worked, and they built proteins with rhodamine and fluorescein that did the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They wanted a general means to fluorescently label designated proteins. This led to the discovery of Douglas Prasher's work on cloning GFP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was wrong with wild-type GFP? It's main excitation was at 395nm (UV), and only minor excitation peak at 475 (blue). We don't like to zap cells with UV. He puzzled out which components of the molecule were responsible for particular peaks in the spectrum (which he got wrong), but by empirically juggling in different amino acids, he came up with a variant that emphasized suitable peaks in the spectrum. This work was done without the aid of knowing the 3D structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They worked out the crystal structure, and then with rational design, made more variants with different colors. The work was rejected by Science for amusing reasons: reviewers didn't understand the significance. They got it published by sending a brief note to &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; that announced the imminent publication of the crystal structure of wild-type GFP in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tsien wanted to make a red version. A Russion group found a red GFP variant in a coral, which they then analyzed and found the structure. This work has led to lots of fluroescent proteins with colors from blue to red.

&lt;p&gt;Problems: Sometimes FPs are too big, the excitation wavelengths are hard to get through mammalian tissues, and a few others I was too slow to get down. Darn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are now developing an infrared fluorescent protein based on biliverdin, and are also studying the role of proteases in cancer. They are using polycationic proteins sequences as tools to transport payload proteins into cells, with  some clever tricks to regulate accessibility and make it chemically triggerable by enzymes present in tumors. They have a probe that selectively labels tumor cells, which can be a very useful guide for surgical removal of tumors. He also combines it with in vivo labeling of nerves, which surgeons don't want to cut, making it a way to color-code living tissue for tumor resection, a technique called molecular fluorescence imaging guidance, MFIG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was another excellent talk — Tsien  has an entertaining sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;

Whenever the mood strikes them, they eject members regardless of their performance and their service record, for anything from being gay to being something other than Christian; and they make no excuse for it, happily citing religious discrimination as the reason. And still they continue to &lt;a href="http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?contentType=GSA_OVERVIEW&amp;amp;contentId=20498"&gt;rake in Federal donations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received the following email from reader Neil Polzin:&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have received information that has compelled us to revoke your registration. You must immediately sever any relationship you may have with the Boy Scouts of America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I received a letter from Marcus Mack at the San Gabriel Valley Council that started this way.  What was my offense that makes me so inappropriate to be around children?  Before your mind fills with thoughts of violence, violations of youth protection or any other deplorable action, it is simply because I am an atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the only reason for the revoking of my membership.  I am being kicked out of the BSA because they feel that I am not a capable role model for children.  Regardless of the 15 years I have spent in the scouts, any achievements or recognitions along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not only that I can’t ever go to my home troop growing up and visit.  Along with making it impossible to volunteer for the scouts in any capacity, It also eliminates me from my current paid position as Aquatics Director at Camp Cherry Valley.  I am being kicked out AND fired for being an atheist by my employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been the policy of the BSA for years, to discriminate against homosexuals and the godless.  It is an easy policy to look past, because most do not know anyone it has affected.  It keeps people in the closet about their personal beliefs or habits, and gives an example of discrimination being ok to the many children in scouts.  It is now directly affecting me, along with the hundreds of cubs I was set to swim, kayak and snorkel with this summer.  Just as it has effected so many others in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an appeals process in the scouts, one that I plan on following over the upcoming weeks.  I know that over the years I have had a great effect on my peers and youth in the scouts and in life, as they have had on me.  Any examples of this I would be very grateful for you to write about (scout related or not).  I do not know if it will be enough to have any change in outcome, but I want the executives to see how this policy negatively affects scouters and scouting.   If you feel this is wrong as I do, send your letters to Marcus Mack (Scout Executive/CEO SGVC 3450 East Sierra Madre Blvd Pasadena, CA 91107), and also make a point to express your viewpoint to him if you are at the council offices.  Please also send me a copy (digital or print) so I may include it in my appeal to national.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to say that without scouts I would not be who I am today.  It has given me so much, and so I have tried to give back over the last 7 years as an adult.  That looks to be no longer possible due to blatant discrimination on the behalf of the BSA.&lt;/p&gt;

Examples are touch, hearing, balance, and proprioception, and (hooray!) he references development: sidedness in mammals is defined by mechanical forces in early development. He studies this problem in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, in which 6 of 302 nerve cells detect touch. It's easy to screen for mutants in touch pathways just by tickling animals and seeing if they move away. They've identified various genes, in particular a protein that's involved in transducing touch into a cellular signal.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ve localized where this gene is expressed. Most of these techniques involved killing, fixing, and staining the animals. He was inspired by work of Shimomura, as described by Paul Brehm that showed that Aequorin + Ca++ + GFP produces light, and got in touch with Douglas Prasher, who was cloning GFP, and got to work making a probe that would allow him to visualize the expression of interesting genes. It was a gamble — no one knew if there were additional proteins required to turn the sequence into a glowing final product…but they discovered that they could get functional product in bacteria within a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They published a paper describing GFP as a new marker for gene expression, which &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; disliked because of the simple title, and so they had to give it a cumbersome title for the reviewers, which got changed back for publication. They had a beautiful cover photo of a glowing neuron in the living animal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantages of GFP: heritable, relatively non-invasive, small and monomeric, and visible in living tissues. Roger Tsien worked to improve the protein and produce variants that fluroesced at different wavelengths. There are currently at least 30,000 papers published that use fluroescent proteins, in all kinds of organisms, from bunnies to tobacco plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He showed some spectacular movies from Silverman-Gavrila of dividing cells with tubulin/GFP, and another of GFP/nuclear localization signal in which nuclei glowed as they condensed after division, and then disappeared during mitosis. Sanes and Lichtman's brainbow work was shown. Also cute: he showed the opening sequence of the Hulk movie, which is illustrated with jellyfish fluorescence (he does not think the Hulk is a legitimate example of a human transgenic.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, he returned to his mechanoreceptor work and showed the transducing cells in the worm. One of the possibilities this opened up was visual screening for new mutants: either looking for missing or morphologically aberrant cells, or even more subtle things, like tagging expression of synaptic proteins so you can visually scan for changes in synaptic function or organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had a number of questions he could address: how are mechanotransducers generated, how is touch transduced, what is the role of membrane lipids, can they identify other genes important in touch, and what turns off these genes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They traced the genes involved in turning on the mec-3 gene; the pathway, it turned out, was also expressed in other cells, but they thought they identified other genes involved in selectively regulating touch sensitivity. One curious thing: the mec genes are transcribed in other cells that aren't sensitive, but somehow are not translated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are searching for other touch genes. The touch screen misses some relevant genes because they have redundant alternatives, or are pleiotropic so other phenotypes (like lethality) obscure the effect. One technique is RNAi, and they made an interesting observation. Trying about 17000 RNAis, they discovered that 600 had interesting and specific effects, 1100 were lethal, and about 15,000 had no effect at all.  The majority of genes are complete mysteries to us. They've developed some techniques to get selective incorporation of RNAis into just neurons of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, so they&amp;#39;re hoping to uncover more specific neural effects. One focus is on the integrin signaling pathway in the nervous system, which they&amp;#39;ve knocked out and found that it demolishes touch sensitivity — a new target!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are now using a short-lived form of GFP that shuts down quickly, so they've got a sharper picture of temporal patterns of gene activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chalfie's summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific progress is cumulative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students and post-docs are the lab innovators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basic research is essential. Who would have thought working on jellyfish would lead to such powerful tools?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All life should be studied; not just model organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chalfie is an excellent speaker and combined a lot of data with an engaging presentation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/martin_chalfie_gfp_and_after.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/7emky5bKhB0" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246522616019"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/osamu_shimomura_chemistry_of_b.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/313a40fc821eafbf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Osamu Shimomura: Chemistry of Bioluminescence</title><published>2009-07-02T08:28:31Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T08:28:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/a_Y3-sC4sDw/osamu_shimomura_chemistry_of_b.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/osamu_shimomura_chemistry_of_b.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bioluminescence is common, especially in marine organisms. Shimomura classified thes into a couple of types: luciferain, photoprotein, and an undefined &amp;quot;other&amp;quot;. Luciferin requires an enzymatic (luciferase) reaction, and luminescence is proportional to the concentration of the substrate. The photoprotein type requires a single molecule — aequorin, symplectin, pholasin, etc.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He summarized how D-Luciferin is converted to Oxyluciferin in the presence of O2 and ATP, catalyzed by luciferase, to produce light, either red light in acidic media or yellow green in alkaline media. There is also a variant of this reaction called coelenterazine-luciferase luminaescence, found in many marine organisms, like &lt;i&gt;Periphylla&lt;/i&gt;, a ellyfish, and &lt;i&gt;Chiroteuthis&lt;/i&gt;, a squid. Coelenterazine is converted to coelenteramide in the presence of O2 to produce light and CO2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another organism is &lt;i&gt;Cyprodana&lt;/i&gt;, a crustacean that uses a luciferin variant — produces a very pretty blue glow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luminiscent bacteria convert luciferin into a fattye acid, FMN, to produce light, which is also luciferase-catalyzed. Luciferase seems to be popping up all over the place — unfortunately, Shimomura doesn&amp;#39;t talk much at all about variations in the enzyme, but is more focused on giving us the chemical intermediates produced in the reaction. Typical chemist!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially unfortunate since the luciferase reaction in different organisms seems to produce very different reaction products…it&amp;#39;s getting me very curious about how these different forms of the protein must differ to be yielding such different outcomes, all only similar in that they also produce light as a byproduct. And then we see that some very different phyla, such as krill and dinoflagellates, use nearly identical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photoproteins: he talks about &lt;i&gt;Aequorea aequorea&lt;/i&gt;, which produces green light with a protein called aequorin that binds a complex molecule that resembles coelenterazine, that undergoes a conformational change in the presence of calcium ions to produce green light. If GFP is used, it produces green light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A squid, &lt;i&gt;Symplectoteuthis&lt;/i&gt;, converts dehydrocoelenterazine to symplectin which then produces light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he switches to talking about fungal biolominescence in &lt;i&gt;Mycena&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Panellus&lt;/i&gt;, mushrooms that glow green. The precursor is decanoylpanal is conferted to luciferin, which produces light in the presence of superoxides, O2, and tetradecanoylcholine. The reaction can take place in the absence of any enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shimomura is not exactly a dynamic speaker — he basically just read off his list of reactions — but at least he had lots of pretty pictures of glowing organisms. If only he&amp;#39;d said something about the relationships and evolutionary differences between them all!&lt;/p&gt;

Back in &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/why_we_need_to_fully_fund_idea"&gt;April&lt;/a&gt;, I put up an action to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/tell_president_obama_to_fully_fund_idea"&gt;Tell President Obama to Fully Fund IDEA&lt;/a&gt;. So far (as of writing this post) there are 1195 signatures. I had set the original goal at 500. The petition ends this Saturday, July 4th, so, please, one more push! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the parent of a child with disabilities, I'm thankful every day for the &lt;a href="http://idea.ed.gov"&gt;Individuals with Disabilities Education Act&lt;/a&gt;. i really cannot imagine what Charlie's and our lives would be like without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, school is a struggle for my son, like many students with disabilities. It is not that he does not like learning or is unwilling to learn, or, even, that he doesn't like school. Since the time he was 2 and a quarter years old and started in a home ABA program, Charlie has liked learning. He aims to please; he used to hover at the front window to watch for the therapists when they walked or drove up, and greet them with a big smile. (He didn't talk in those days.) And he likes to go to school, wants to be among other children his age; likes to be busy and doing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But public school holds many challenges for Charlie and some that aren't always immediately taken into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's some 1400 students at his middle school and (as far as I can tell; once upon a time I was a PTA co-president, but those days are long gone) the school is carefully, tightly run, with a big emphasis on academics and order. Apparently---Charlie's teacher has been asking---there is no room in the students' schedules to do some reverse inclusion with Charlie's class and the other special ed classroom at school; at his elementary school, students came in regularly during lunch and recess. Charlie is not mainstreamed in any subjects (his academics are far "behind" that of the students his age) and he and his classmates pretty much stay in one room all day, except for gym class first thing in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many accommodations and supports are in place for Charlie and things look good &lt;em&gt;on paper&lt;/em&gt;: His class has a 1:1 student to teacher ratio; his programs are individualized to his learning; he has picture schedules and much else made specifically for him. Public school is a challenging environment (and for students without "anything").&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This won't be news to any parents out there: Schools can provide the staff supports and teaching methodology for students with disabilities. But there's only so much that can be done with the physical environment and the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/its_all_part_of_the_design"&gt;design&lt;/a&gt; of school buildings; about what it's like to be in a building with 1400 students not to mention teachers, staff, and administrators, all of whom have their share of needs and concerns and jobs and aren't thinking about a few students with some extra-big challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie's  middle school seems to be the one school in the district that has yet to have extensive renovations to let go of its beige, brown, and stucco 70s-architecture-ness. The high school has a new auditorium, classroom, &lt;i&gt;et cetera&lt;/i&gt;; the middle school has neither a track nor basketball courts; the students run around the circle in front of the school as a "track." There are some fields with grass and soccer goals but, well, you get the picture. Charlie's classroom is located in whatever room was assigned to his teacher; its windows look out onto a hallway. There is a courtyard visible through windows, but it's not what I'd call a sensory-friendly place, with the fluorescent lights (I know Charlie is highly aware of their hum; when we're in grocery and other stores with those lights, he puts his head down and his fingers over his ears). For awhile, there was a room next door that Charlie's teacher could use, but it's not always available (and not during the week of testing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gym in the morning is great, but Charlie has a lot of energy. Unlike the other students, he doesn't switch rooms between classes. Often he goes on walks throughout the day, outside or in the halls. But these aren't options when it rains (as it did almost every day for much of June), or when &lt;i&gt;quiet&lt;/i&gt; is needed (as when the students had standardized testing during June). (I only figured out about the testing and how that changed Charlie's routine after the fact.) Add to this the fact that bells are constantly ringing and messages being relayed over the loudspeaker and you've got a lot of factors that need more than a 1:1 student-to-teacher ratio and ABA to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we keep making out schools more accessible? Create more accommodations? Factor in sensory sensitivities? I've only noted some concerns about the physical environment and classroom design, but what about accommodations to make some interactions between students with disabilities and "other" students possible? Somehow I don't think the best way to teach about diversity and acceptance of the differences of others is to keep students in effect segregated, in their classrooms or because of the demands of their academic curriculum---learning isn't only about being able to do advanced math, analyze literature, writes sentences in Spanish and French. There's a push in New Jersey to have more in-district programs for students on the spectrum. Such programs are more economical but for such programs to work, we need to keep in mind the full spectrum of accommodations needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Charlie has been attending public school since he was 4 years old has been no small feat. We've come a long with IDEA. The presence of Charlie and his classmates in the schools makes that very clear! But there is still such a long long way to go, and we have to keep reminding school districts that it takes everyone to make IDEA work, and just having the right things in place on paper is just the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246521640435"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/senator_tom_harkin_pulls_a_fast_one_alte.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/881a88f33f8b9e6e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Senator Tom Harkin pulls a fast one: Alternative medical practitioners will be part of the "healthcare workforce" under health care reform</title><published>2009-07-02T08:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T08:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/t1LSXPdWmrg/senator_tom_harkin_pulls_a_fast_one_alte.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/senator_tom_harkin_pulls_a_fast_one_alte.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I wrote about Senator Tom Harkin's attempt to hijack President Obama's health care reform plans in order to inject quackery in the form of "alternative" or "integrative" medicine into the effort. Specifically, he wants to legitimize quackery by including it in any federal plan under the guise of "preventative care." He even went so far as to invite the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/senator_tom_harkin.php"&gt;Four Horsement of the Woopocalypse&lt;/a&gt; into the Senate to testify and castigate the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine for being too scientific and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/maybe_nccam_isnt_so_bad_after_allnahhh.php"&gt;not proving that any of his favored woo works&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, his latest antics are merely the latest in a long line of his support for quackery. After all, he's the Senator who, more than anyone else, is &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html"&gt;responsible for the scientific atrocity that is NCCAM&lt;/a&gt;, starting with the Office of Unconventional Medicine 17 years ago, which he nurtured as it grew into the Office of Alternative Medicine and ultimately into the woo juggernaut that it is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We haven't heard much from Harkin lately, but, have no fear. He's still hard at work on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee pushing "wellness" and "prevention," which in Harkin-speak are codewords for everything from the reasonable (diet and exercise) to complete quackery, and he's doing it totally under the radar. For example, buried in a &lt;a href="http://www.medpagetoday.com/Washington-Watch/Reform/14886"&gt;news report&lt;/a&gt; on the Senate's work on the massive 600-page health care reform bill, along with measures on malpractice and other issues, is this little gem:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/senator_tom_harkin_pulls_a_fast_one_alte.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/senator_tom_harkin_pulls_a_fast_one_alte.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/t1LSXPdWmrg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246521130476"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=4036">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/201e80c156a87a96</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entomology"/><category term="Insects"/><category term="beautiful"/><category term="shiny"/><category term="wasp"/><title type="html">Pretty Picture Thursday (and Friday)</title><published>2009-07-02T06:51:54Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T06:51:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/07/02/pretty-picture-thursday-and-friday/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m on the road right now, so why not enjoy this beautiful photo of one of my favorite groups of insects!&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/deadmike/3605257413/"&gt;&lt;img title="cuckoo wasp" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2448/3605257413_302e944852.jpg" alt="" width="482" height="362"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/6946"&gt;Chrysididae&lt;/a&gt; are a group of parasitic wasps that are harmless to humans, and wonderfully beautiful with their punctate, shiny exoskeletons.  They are also sometimes called Emerald Wasps, for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Osamu Shimomura: Chemistry of Bioluminescence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Now while I strongly oppose the burqa, I expressed some doubts that banning it outright would be an appropriate course of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, rather predictably those &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/06/30/france.burkas.al.qaeda/index.html?eref=rss_world"&gt;Islamic fundamentalists in Al Qaeda have responded with threats of violence&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will not tolerate such provocations and injustices, and we will take our revenge from France,” said the statement, signed by Abu Musab Abdul Wadud, calling himself “commander of al Qaeda in North Africa [Islamic Maghreb].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when they go and do things like this or the riots over the Danish cartoons, I’m certainly more inclined to support France banning the burqa if for no other reason than to piss off these assholes. However, I do still support civil rights and am still a bit uncomfortable with the idea of governments dictating what wardrobes the people can and can’t wear even when that clothing is a symbol of slavery and the women only wear it  because they’ve been indoctrinated to go against their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I think I understand the manipulation that was required to keep these women in submission, many genuinely believe that wearing the burqa is actually giving them the freedom to reject the hyper-sexualization that is so often criticized in the West. Of course it’s mostly nonsense. Though a reasonable discussion can be had discussing how our culture may be manipulating women in the West to wear less clothing. But of course in the West, women have options. The pressures to wear less aren’t nearly as strong as the pressures in Islamic cultures to wear more. And many women in the West do freely choose to dress more conservatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, even with all the indoctrination, should government have the authority to tell a women they don’t believe that she sinserely in her heart of hearts wants to wear the burqu but only thinks she does and then legally require her to dress differently? Deluded as she may be, this girl seems to genuinely want to wear a burqa:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/01/al-qaeda-threatens-violence-in-france/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/_Nn7S9zcFSs/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal opinion is that we should be more focused on stopping the disease than the symptoms. We should be putting more effort into educating people in critical thinking. Then maybe they’ll choose to take off the burqas themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The probability of an outburst or  increase during [calm, mild] weather, I believed to be heightened on  holidays, Saturdays, Sundays, and any other occasions where opportunities  were afforded the lower classes for dissipation and debauchery"  - unattributed quote by ‘expert' regarding how cholera disproportionally  attacks the poor and other social underclasses, in Victorian London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As strange as this seems to modern  eyes, this statement was backed up by scientific evidence, or at least  what passed for such in England of the mid-19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.   During this time, the predominant theory for the spread of contagion  and sickness was &lt;em&gt;miasma&lt;/em&gt; (Greek for "pollution"), that is  bad smells and foul air were the causes of disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ghost Map: the Story of London's  Most Terrifying Epidemic - and How it Changed Science, Cities, and  the Modern World&lt;/em&gt;, by Steven Johnson (Riverhead Books) is the story  of Dr. John Snow and Rev. Henry Whitehead's discovery of the water-born  transmission of cholera, a disease which struck with terrifying regularity  in London and other large cities.  The popular folklore is that  Dr. Snow plotted cases of cholera deaths on a map, and deduced that  the outbreak's source was a particular well in a poor section of London,  and removed the handle to the pump, thereby halting the epidemic, and  was hailed as a hero.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Naomi Baker)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246514073214"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-20494433.post-2256072100699998916">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/be2a953d3b8937ca</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Metablogging" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Dumbassery" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Meatspace" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Fallacies" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Death" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">If you wrote me off, I&amp;#39;d understand it, &amp;#39;cause I&amp;#39;ve been on some other planet.</title><published>2009-07-02T04:30:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T05:25:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/2009/07/if-you-wrote-me-off-id-understand-it.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/2256072100699998916/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=20494433&amp;postID=2256072100699998916" title="3 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="html">Sure is quiet around here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay, so real life has intervened. Big time, actually. When I&amp;#39;m not working (which is becoming a smaller and smaller slice of the pie chart of my time), I&amp;#39;m filling out applications or driving to work or interviews for more work. When I&amp;#39;m not doing all that, I&amp;#39;m reading through Miller &amp;amp; Levine&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;Biology&lt;/i&gt; textbook, studying for a standardized test I'm taking in a few weeks (and I've only barely cracked the Chemistry textbook I &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; want to read for the same day of testing). My time for blogging has been almost nonexistent...I've got half-written posts in the wings that have sat dormant for a month or more, and I've got topical posts that won't be topical anymore by the time I decide to actually write them. That, and I'm trying to finish a review or three for the other blogs before I get to any other posts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and this blog got flagged as spam by Blogger's robots, which kept me from editing or posting anything for the last couple of days. Fun fun. I was going to do an "eat my ass out with a spork" post to whoever flagged me, but apparently it was automatic, so I guess I can just aim my ire at whoever designed the automated system so that it doesn't send an e-mail out to tell you when you can start posting again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of which has led to me not only failing to keep up with &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; blog, but also failing to keep up with the rest of the skeptical blogohedron. I read most of Pharyngula's output, but after that, it's kind of a crap shoot. I haven't done anything for the skeptics' panel, even though I've got ideas and I've gotten Akusai's recent request for assistance. My schedule will be opening up considerably (I think) after July 11th (a day which I have &lt;i&gt;quadruple&lt;/i&gt;-booked), so I hope to be on like Khan around that time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing I'd like to mention briefly before I go dormant for a week or so again--the recent spate of celebrity deaths have brought up the "these things happen in threes" canard into the public discourse again. It's a trivial bit of irrationality, and it probably doesn't do any harm, but it bugs me because it's a symptom of a lot of other forms of fallacious thinking. First, the idea is ill-defined: what constitutes a "celebrity death" or "tragedy" (depending on which statement is used) is completely arbitrary, and there's no time limit on the grouping. This is predictions 101: if you don't attach a time limit, it's much more likely to come true. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You know, I thought this string of deaths would be enough to dispel that myth altogether--as far as newsworthy celebrity deaths, Michael Jackson was the &lt;i&gt;fourth&lt;/i&gt; in a relatively short time, following David Carradine, Ed McMahon, and Farrah Fawcett. Billy Mays followed a day or three later. I was reminded of Monty Python's King Arthur--"These things come in fives--" "Three, sir!" "--threes!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I must remember never to underestimate the power of people to select and justify the patterns they find in random noise. Which is all this is, when you get right down to it. I mean, take a look at Wikipedia's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2009"&gt;list of recent deaths&lt;/a&gt;, and tell me exactly what pattern of threes you can find there. It's just a sort of pareidolia, tracing out familiar patterns where none really exist. It imposes a sort of control over the world, a sense that the believer understands the secret rules that govern traumatic events. It's compelling--I know &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; bought into it at one point--because it's ultimately comforting. As bad as it is to lose three beloved celebrities, if you know how many to expect, then you know when to stop worrying, stop mourning (inasmuch as anyone mourns celebrities). After the third one dies, you can breathe that little sigh of relief, knowing that no other famous people are going to die for awhile--and being &lt;i&gt;utterly wrong&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, that's it for now. Hopefully it won't be too long before the next post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and while I'm thinking about it, I want to give a hearty welcome back to &lt;a href="http://ninetyfivepercent.blogspot.com/"&gt;Rockstar Ryan&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/07/01/PSS%20at%20NAPC%20b.jpg" alt="PSS at NAPC b.jpg" width="600" height="450"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the excellent science, a highlight was the panel I sat on.  This session was held over lunch on Thursday, and the subject was “Countering Creationism”.  I was joined by Panda’s Thumb contributors Richard Hoppe, Jason Rosenhouse, and Art Hunt.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/07/01/PSS%20and%20panelists.jpg" alt="PSS and panelists.jpg" width="600" height="450"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also a most excellent series of talks on Thursday morning.  I never knew that rodent debris could be so informative (thanks, Felisa Smith!), and I learned that Jeremy Jackson really doesn’t like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" rel="external "&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;.  I was disappointed that I missed the steel cage match between Jeremy and PZ - I never found the announcement.  Maybe I can catch the rematch …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to catch up with old friends …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, of course, I accompanied a mob of unruly paleontologists on a field trip to some “museum”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/07/01/unruly%20mob.jpg" alt="unruly mob.jpg" width="600" height="450"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Looks like the sign got run over by an out-of-control ark.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were hints of PZ even in this museum …&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/07/01/ceph.jpg" alt="ceph.jpg" width="450" height="600"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I was accompanied by other luminaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a delightful time.  With some functional keepsakes to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

Mark Sanford story ever since he mysteriously went "out of pocket." (See: "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1526"&gt;Out of pocket&lt;/a&gt;," "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1537"&gt;The biggest self of self is indeed self&lt;/a&gt;," "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1549"&gt;Doing stupid&lt;/a&gt;," and "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1550"&gt;If I wanted to know that I knew that I knew&lt;/a&gt;.") But the lasting contribution of the Sanford saga to the English language may very well be the sudden spawning of a political euphemism: "hiking the Appalachian trail."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Peters is the resident euphemism expert on the Visual Thesaurus website, rounding up circumlocutions old and new for his monthly column, &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/evasive/"&gt;Evasive Maneuvers&lt;/a&gt;. His latest column, "&lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/evasive/1905/"&gt;Hiking the Euphemistic Trail&lt;/a&gt;," is a Sanford special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark's column begins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will the Appalachian trail ever be the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmentally, I think so. Linguistically? Not  a chance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't even look at websites like &lt;a href="http://www.experienceproject.com/groups/Want-To-Hike-The-Appalachian-Trail/42783"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://www.worldhum.com/travel-blog/item/recession-hiking-on-the-appalachian-trail-20090629/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;  without giggling like a schoolgirl who ate one of those four-foot-long Pixie  Stix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me put it this way… If you have a dog, and  that dog ever made a no-no on something precious, like an $800 carpet, then you  have some idea of the kind of impact South Carolina Governor (now known as &amp;quot;The  Luv Guv&amp;quot;) Mark Sanford has had on the Appalachian trail, specifically in the form  of the atomic-wing-hot new euphemism &lt;em&gt;hiking  the Appalachian trail, &lt;/em&gt;which refers to sexual shenanigans, especially the adulterous kind that waylays political careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark anoints Sanford our "euphemizer laureate" and looks at how "hiking the Appalachian trail" stacks up against other adultery euphemisms.

Since they come from a scientific colleague, we consider it worthwhile responding directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement Pielke considers “misinformation” is a single sentence from a &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/06/a-warning-from-copenhagen/"&gt;recent posting&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some aspects of climate change are progressing faster than was expected a few years ago – such as rising sea levels, the increase of heat stored in the ocean and the shrinking Arctic sea ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, we are surprised that Pielke levelled such strong allegations against RealClimate, since the statement above merely summarises some key findings of the &lt;a href="http://climatecongress.ku.dk/pdf/synthesisreport"&gt;Synthesis Report of the Copenhagen Climate Congress&lt;/a&gt;, which we &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/06/a-warning-from-copenhagen/"&gt;discussed last month&lt;/a&gt;. This is a peer-reviewed document authored by 12 leading scientists and “based on the 16 plenary talks given at the Congress as well as input of over 80 chairs and co-chairs of the 58 parallel sessions held at the Congress.” If Pielke disagrees with the findings of these scientists, you’d have thought he’d take it up with them rather than aiming shrill accusations at us. But in any case let us look at the three items of alleged misinformation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Sea level.&lt;/strong&gt; The Synthesis Report shows the graph below and concludes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, reports comparing the IPCC projections of 1990 with observations show that some climate indicators are changing near the upper end of the range indicated by the projections or, as in the case of sea level rise (Figure 1), at even greater rates than indicated by IPCC projections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/synthrepfig1.jpg" title="sea level graph"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/synthrepfig1.thumbnail.jpg" alt="sea level graph"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This graph is an update of &lt;a href="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/Publications/Nature/rahmstorf_etal_science_2007.pdf"&gt;Rahmstorf et al., Science 2007&lt;/a&gt;, with data through to the end of 2008. (Note the comparison is with IPCC TAR projections, but since AR4 projections are within 10% of the TAR models this makes little difference.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pielke claims this is “&lt;strong&gt;NOT TRUE&lt;/strong&gt;” (capitals and bold font are his), stating “sea level has actually flattened since 2006” and pointing to &lt;a href="http://sealevel.colorado.edu/current/sl_noib_ns_global.jpg"&gt;this graph&lt;/a&gt;. This graph shows a sea level trend over the full satellite period (starting 1993) of 3.2 +/- 0.4 mm/year and is very similar to an independent French analysis of those very same satellite data shown in the Synthesis Report (blue lines above). The best estimate of the IPCC models for the same time period is 1.9 mm/year (coloured dashed lines in the middle of the grey uncertainty range). Hence the conclusion of the Synthesis Report is entirely correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “flattening of sea level since 2006” that Pielke refers to is beside the point and deceptive for several reasons (note too that Anthony Watts has extended this &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2009/07/pielke_srs_new_statistical_tec.php"&gt;even further&lt;/a&gt; to declare that sea level from 2006 to present is actually “flat”!). First of all, trends over such a short sub-interval of a few years vary greatly due to short-term natural variations, and one could get any result one likes by cherry-picking a suitable interval (as Pielke and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/cif-green/2009/mar/09/climate-change-copenhagen"&gt;Lomborg&lt;/a&gt; both have). The absurdity of this approach is see by picking an even more recent trend, say starting in June 2007, which gives 5.3+/-2.2 mm/yr! Secondly, this short-term trend (1.6 +/- 0.9 mm/yr) is not even robust across data sets – the French analysis shown above has a trend since the beginning of 2006 of 2.9 mm/year, very similar to the long-term trend. Third, the image Pielke links to shows the data without the inverted barometer correction – the brief marked peak in late 2005, which makes the visual trend (always a poor choice of statistical methodology) almost flat since then, &lt;a href="http://sealevel.colorado.edu/current/sl_ib_ns_global.jpg"&gt;disappears when this effect is accounted for&lt;/a&gt;. This means the 2005 peak was simply due to air pressure fluctuations and has nothing to do with climatic ocean volume changes. The trend from 2006 in the data with the inverse barometer adjustment is 2.1 +/- 0.8 mm/yr. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Ocean heat content.&lt;/strong&gt; The Synthesis Report states: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current estimates indicate that ocean warming is about 50% greater than had been previously reported by the IPCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a conclusion of a revised analysis of ocean heat content data by Domingues et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 2008, and it applies to the period 1961-2003 also analysed in the IPCC report. Pielke claims this is “&lt;strong&gt;NOT TRUE&lt;/strong&gt;” and counters with the claim: “There has been no statistically significant warming of the upper ocean since 2003.” But again this is not relevant to the point the Synthesis Report actually makes and again, Pielke is referring to a 5-year period which is too short to obtain statistically robust trends in the presence of short-term variability and data accuracy problems (the interannual variability for instance differs greatly between different ocean heat content data sets):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/levitus_ohc_comp.jpg" title="Levitus et al comparison of Ocean heat content data"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/levitus_ohc_comp.jpg" alt="Levitus et al comparison of Ocean heat content data" width="60%"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For good reasons, the Synthesis Report discusses a time span that is sufficiently long to allow meaningful comparisons. But in any case, the trend in from 2003 to 2008 in the Levitus data (the Domingues et al data does not extend past 2003), is still positive but with an uncertainty (both in the trend calculation and systematically) that makes it impossible to state whether there has been a significant change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Arctic Sea Ice.&lt;/strong&gt; The Synthesis Report states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most dramatic developments since the last IPCC Report is the rapid reduction in the area of Arctic sea ice in summer. In 2007, the minimum area covered decreased by about 2 million square kilometres as compared to previous years. In 2008, the decrease was almost as dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This decline is clearly faster than expected by models, as the following graph indicates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/_45146192_ice_extent_466.gif" title="sea ice extent time series"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/_45146192_ice_extent_466.thumbnail.gif" alt="sea ice extent time series"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pielke’s claim that this is “&lt;strong&gt;NOT TRUE&lt;/strong&gt;” is merely based on the statement that “since 2008, the anomalies have actually decreased.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, same thing again: Pielke’s argument is beside the point, since the Synthesis Report is explicitly talking about the summer sea ice minimum reached each September in the Arctic, and we don’t even know yet what its value will be for 2009. And Pielke is again referring to a time span (&lt;em&gt;“since 2008&lt;/em&gt;”!) that is far too short to have much to do with climatic trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thus have to conclude that there are no grounds whatsoever for Pielke’s wild allegations against us and implicitly the Synthesis Report authors. The final sentence of his post ironically speaks for itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media and policymakers who blindly accept these claims are either naive or are deliberately slanting the science to promote their particular advocacy position.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is absolutely stupid.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We were discussing these two passages from the Bible:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Deuteronomy 22:23 If a man happens to meet in a town a virgin pledged to be married and he sleeps with her, 24 you shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death—the girl because she was in a town and did not scream for help, and the man because he violated another man's wife. You must purge the evil from among you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deuteronomy 22:28 If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered, 29 he shall pay the girl's father fifty shekels of silver. [c] He must marry the girl, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Okay so far? Now along comes Alan who writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;In some cultures today, once a virgin has been raped, she is shunned by society and remains unmarried all of her days. She pines away as an “untouchable”. This is really sad. In such societies, I would love to see action taken against such damnable perpetrators by having them pay money to the father and require at least an offer of marriage and make the law stick such that he can’t divorce her later. Wait a minute… isn’t this what the Biblical law provides? &lt;/blockquote&gt;This is an utterly stupid analogy. There is no thought in this analogy at all, NONE! Alan is trying to equate what some cultures do today with the command of a perfectly good God regarding such matters. Again, did &lt;em&gt;Yahweh &lt;/em&gt;shape the culture of the Israelites or not with his commands? If not, why not? If so, why wouldn't he have commanded them not to shun women who have been raped in the first place, idiot?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But we're not done yet. Next Alan writes this gem:&lt;blockquote&gt;If a law forces rapists to marry their victims, then perhaps the number of rapes will decline to near zero. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Hmmmm. Let's pick our wives this way okay? Whom would I choose to marry? Just rape her. This is fucking nonsense. ;-)&lt;blockquote&gt;What’s more, if the law requires rapists to pay fifty shekels of silver to the father, this could indeed equate to the death penalty if the rapist hasn’t saved toward his bride’s future. Thus, we have narrowed down the field of rapists who marry their victims to only those who have saved for their “brides” future. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Oh, the debtor’s prison, right? Let's have a show of hands in this economy whether people would prefer this barbaric practice? Alan wants to turn back the clock. He wants to live in the ancient world with Madelein Flannagan who likes being treated as women were treated in the Bible. How can I shock these idiots into their senses here? I just don't know, but with every utterly stupid comment they write it makes me more passionate than ever to keep them from getting more control of America. I will stand in the way of these barbaric people who must defend the Biblical ethics in order to continue believing in the barbaric Bible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Alan isn't done yet: &lt;blockquote&gt;If the girl happens to be ugly, he is required to marry her anyway. Again, this stipulation will help narrow the field further since potential rapists will be motivated to think before acting. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Naw. Only pretty women will fear being raped, that's all. But then these women might be forced into marrying some ugly bastard like Alan too, which Alan seems not to care for at all. Such idiocy I don't have the words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's Alan again: &lt;blockquote&gt;Thirdly, if one “selects” his wife through means of rape, then he’ll never be able to divorce her even if “she” turns out to be a transvestite.&lt;/blockquote&gt; What? Why do I waste my time here?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alan again: &lt;blockquote&gt;The law is putting so many roadblocks into the potential rapist’s path, and causing him to think, I would guess most potential rapists would opt for the easier path of waiting for a willing partner. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Here is exhibit "B" of just what it takes to defend Christianity (Madeleine was exhibit "A"). One must defend the indefensible. This is why I say believers are ignorant. Although some of them are also unintelligent, like Alan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alan's conclusion :&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, such a society could easily exceed the American society in quality by many fold. In America, if a woman is raped, often the rapist is nurtured in a prison and the possible resulting child is killed. Why not kill the rapist and let the child live? Often, another woman is victimized as soon as the rapist is released.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So here he is comparing what a perfectly good God commanded with what we do as an American society. Right. There should be no comparison at all if a perfectly good God is behind the laws in the Bible. What Alan wants is for rapists to be killed, for women not to have the right to choose, and for criminals to be flogged, put on chain gangs, or tarred and feathered. Those days are past and for good reasons. It’s just a good thing Alan was not framed for a crime, or a black man facing a white jury, or a woman facing an unwanted pregnancy. Alan, you are stupid! Oh, but what I really mean is that your faith makes you stupid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kinda reminds me of that commerical where an egg represents your brain. It's cracked open and thrown into a frying pan then we hear the words: "This is your brain on drugs." Well likewise, here's exhibit "B" of what the Christian drug does to your brains too!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To read what Alan said in the context of exhibit "A" &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/06/madeleine-flannagan-is-happy-to-be.html?showComment=1246482021466#c7366275417195036564"&gt;here's the link&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-6678572842248324163?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

There's another sort of divide though: the division between the "autism community" and the greater cross-disability community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Megaconference, there were mostly vendor booths from 1) disability rights organizations such as &lt;a href="http://www.oradvocacy.org/"&gt;Disability Rights Oregon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/vr/silc/index.shtm"&gt;State Independent Living Council&lt;/a&gt;, 2) disability-positive service or research organizations such as &lt;a href="http://www.arcoregon.org/"&gt;Oregon ARC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.ohsu.edu/oidd/"&gt;OIDD&lt;/a&gt;, 3) assistive technology companies, selling everything from ergonomic keyboards to telephones to toys.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and then there were the autism-related booths.  All about snake oil, pity, and panic.  A harsh reminder of what disability rights groups have rallied against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 65 presentations given over the course of three days, on topics from community weaving to the ADA.  Those which were not autism-specific included things like the joys of communication without speech, assistive technology, healthy lifestyles, empowerment, acceptance, and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...while the autism-specific presentations were about remediation, normalization, and intervention (remember what &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/megaconference_special_3_of_6_wherein_norman_kunc_rocks_my_world"&gt;Kunc had to say about that&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's as though autism has been left behind in a pre-1960's, pre-civil rights era.  Often I feel as though many people who work specifically with autism have no idea that we are part of a larger community--one that has fought and won some important civil rights battles, including initiating a cultural shift away from the attitudes that produce such demeaning treatment.  What's up with that?  And, way more importantly, how do we fix it?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246488149242"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/07/taliban_opium_haul_turns_out_t.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eb048a944d06e754</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Taliban “opium” haul turns out to be food crop</title><published>2009-07-01T14:37:32Z</published><updated>2009-07-01T14:37:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/07/taliban_opium_haul_turns_out_t.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence has been left with egg on its face after a much-vaunted seizure of 1.3 tonnes of poppy seed turned out to be mung beans.

I'd noticed that he's got a new book out, but strangely, I hadn't been sent a copy this time. I was wondering what was up with that, but now &lt;a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/notesarchive.php?id=2823"&gt;Ophelia Benson has read part of the book&lt;/a&gt;, and all is explained. He spends part of one chapter singling me out for criticism! Gosh, I guess he felt he wouldn't get a friendly review this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of his ire? &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/the_great_desecration.php"&gt;Crackergate&lt;/a&gt;. He regards destroying a sacred symbol to be inflammatory and obnoxious, completely ignoring the insanity it exposed. That insanity — and I am not using that word casually — is what Mooney thinks the spokespeople for science in our country ought to treat deferentially. Here&amp;#39;s why he thinks we need to do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;America is a very religious nation, and if forced to choose between faith and science, vast numbers of Americans will select the former. The New Atheists err in insisting that such a choice needs to be made. Atheism is not the logically inevitable outcome of scientific reasoning...A great many scientists believe in God with no sense of internal contradiction...[pp 97-98]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, yes, the policy of cowardice. We are weak, and the loons are numerous and strong, and therefore we must avoid telling them the truth. If the masses prefer their silly religion to science, well then, we shall give them a neutered science, a weak science, an inoffensive science that does not challenge anyone's beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If atheism is not the logical outcome of scientific reasoning, then let us pretend that gods that turn into a cracker that cures you of sin is logical and unquestionable and harmless…oh, wait, let&amp;#39;s pretend &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; belief doesn't exist, and doesn't poison minds. We'll blame the American problem of unreason on the atheists, instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheril Kirshenbaum assures me that I will be receiving a review copy of their book; I'm not being intentionally snubbed, it is merely a matter of timing, and the review copies are only now being sent out. I look forward to it with grim anticipation. I am hoping that the rest of the book isn't as &lt;a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/notesarchive.php?id=2824"&gt;awful as chapter 8&lt;/a&gt;, or I'll have to be brutal.&lt;/p&gt;

A review of 40 studies in the &lt;a href="http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/short/195/1/7?rss=1"&gt;British Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; examines over 50 prenatal factors for autism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; The factors associated with autism risk in the meta-analysis were advanced parental age at birth, maternal prenatal medication use, bleeding, gestational diabetes, being first born v. third or later, and having a mother born abroad. The factors with the strongest evidence against a role in autism risk included previous fetal loss and maternal hypertension, proteinuria, pre-eclampsia and swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For the record: I was 28 years old when Charlie was born and had pre-eclampsia.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8126574.stm"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; report on the study from yesterday is (rather misleadingly) headlined &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8126574.stm"&gt;Problem pregnancy 'autism risk'&lt;/a&gt; and quotes Richard Mills of Research Autism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Age is a very interesting line of inquiry, but it is very hard to tease out one clear factor. It is like trying to complete a huge jigsaw puzzle - we still just don't know how all the pieces fit together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed---just as as many as 100 &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/acceptance_and_genetics"&gt;genes&lt;/a&gt; have been linked to autism, so it seems that multiple factors are being identified and studied, and not one of them has been, it seems, taken off the table. One reason for such studies is to be able to detect autism at earlier and earlier stages of a child's life and, too, before a child is born. Another &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8126950.stm"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; news story reports that a "universal embryo test" is "'very near'":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test - which will cost around £2,500 - uses a technique called karyomapping which looks for the inheritance of sections of DNA or chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than knowing the exact gene mutation which is passed down the generations in an family affected by a condition such as cystic fibrosis, doctors can just look for the block of DNA containing a faulty gene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment genetic testing of embryos is generally limited to a few conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But karyomapping could in theory be used to test for any one of the 15,000 genetic defects known about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the same test doctors could also look at whether any chromosomes are missing or duplicated which suggests the embryo will not be viable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism is specifically cited as one condition--a "'major [disease]" that the test could be used for, by looking for genetic causes that occur in 5% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is currently no &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/simon_baron-cohen_on_the_prospect_of_a_prenatal_test_for_autism"&gt;prenatal test&lt;/a&gt; for autism, it is looking more and more inevitable. In view of the &lt;a href="http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/short/195/1/7?rss=1"&gt;British Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; study on the causes of autism and how various factors in pregnancy might affect this, autism is definitely going to be something that families expecting a baby hear about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the more reason to get the word out about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/not_a_large_child"&gt;older children&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autism_isnt_only_for_children"&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt; on the spectrum and how, while things are often not easy, it's a good life.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246482834328"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/happy_new_medical_year.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/36d918800a3e99cd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Happy New (Medical) Year!</title><published>2009-07-01T19:07:12Z</published><updated>2009-07-01T19:07:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/aHD-RIgAtvE/happy_new_medical_year.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/happy_new_medical_year.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The medical education calendar begins and ends on the first of July each year, and in the hospital, that means a brand spanking new crop of young doctors.  While this may sound a bit scary, the facts are a bit subtle (and not terrifying).  Some of the questions regarding the so-called July Phenomenon are:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are hospitals more dangerous in July?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is care more expensive in July?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are hospital stays longer in July?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data show that there does not appear to be an increase in poor outcomes in July vs. other months, but in some fields hospital stays may be longer and care may be more expensive due to increased utilization of tests. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the data that support a July phenomenon in hospitals aren't all that strong, indicating that it's unlikely hospital care is significantly different in July vs. other months.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July is fun though.  New doctors are excited to learn and to work, and soak it up like sponges, except in crisp white coats.&lt;/p&gt;

Mark Sanford continues to be a source of statements that are linguistically interesting on a variety of levels.  In the same AP interview where he confessed to having "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1549"&gt;done stupid"&lt;/a&gt;,  he &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/30/politics/main5125886.shtml"&gt;explained his value system&lt;/a&gt; in terms that raise several significant philosophical issues: "Everybody's got their own value system, but to me, even if it's a place that I could never go, if I wanted to know that I knew that I knew, if that's more important to me than running for president, that's my prerogative as a human being."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll leave to others such theological questions as whether the idea that "everybody's got their own value system" is consistent with whatever brand of Christianity the governor subscribes to. My interest here is what he meant by saying that he trashed his political career because "I wanted to know that I knew that I knew".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is his second puzzling triple morphemic repetition in recent days, following up on "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1537"&gt;the biggest self of self is self&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. That one seemed to have been a speech error, for something like &amp;quot;the biggest source of sin is self&amp;quot;. But I haven&amp;#39;t been able to come up with a plausible intention that might have been changed by anticipation or perseveration into &amp;quot;I wanted to know that I knew that I knew&amp;quot;. On the other hand, the only place I can recall seeing phrases like that, meant for real, is in philosophical discussions of certain kinds of meaning — which the governor was not then engaged in. For example, Delia Graff, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~graff/papers/torrente.pdf"&gt;An Anti-Epistemicist Consequence of Margin for Error Semantics for Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I don’t know how to find out whether I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that such and such holds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(It's true that making a trip to Argentina is not among the discovery methods that Prof. Graff considers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little web search teaches me that thinking about recursive knowledge (and recursive knowledge of the will to be happy! and the will not to be deceived!) goes back at least to St. Augustine's &lt;a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/130115.htm"&gt;De Trinitate&lt;/a&gt; 15:12:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Therefore he who says he knows he is alive, can neither be deceived nor lie. Let a thousand kinds, then, of deceitful objects of sight be presented to him who says, I know I am alive; yet he will fear none of them, for he who is deceived yet is alive. But if such things alone pertain to human knowledge, they are very few indeed; unless that they can be so multiplied in each kind, as not only not to be few, but to reach in the result to infinity. For he who says, I know I am alive, says that he knows one single thing. Further, if he says, I know that I know I am alive, now there are two; but that he knows these two is a third thing to know. And so he can add a fourth and a fifth, and innumerable others, if he holds out. But since he cannot either comprehend an innumerable number by additions of units, or say a thing innumerable times, he comprehends this at least, and with perfect certainty, viz. that this is both true and so innumerable that he cannot truly comprehend and say its infinite number. This same thing may be noticed also in the case of a will that is certain. For it would be an impudent answer to make to any one who should say, I will to be happy, that perhaps you are deceived. And if he should say, I know that I will this, and I know that I know it, he can add yet a third to these two, viz. that he knows these two; and a fourth, that he knows that he knows these two; and so on ad infinitum. Likewise, if any one were to say, I will not to be mistaken; will it not be true, whether he is mistaken or whether he is not, that nevertheless he does will not to be mistaken? Would it not be most impudent to say to him, Perhaps you are deceived? When beyond doubt, whereinsoever he may be deceived, he is nevertheless not deceived in thinking that he wills not to be deceived. And if he says he knows this, he adds any number he chooses of things known, and perceives that number to be infinite. For he who says, I will not to be deceived, and I know that I will not to be so, and I know that I know it, is able now to set forth an infinite number here also, however awkward may be the expression of it. And other things too are to be found capable of refuting the Academics, who contend that man can know nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps due to Augustine's influence, a general web search for patterns like&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=%22know+that+I+know+that+I+know%22&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search"&gt; "know that I know that I know"&lt;/a&gt; seems to turns up mainly religious discussions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I just want to know that I know that I know that I'm saved.&lt;br&gt;
This is how I know that I know that I know there is a God!&lt;br&gt;
I know that I know that I know that I know that I know my redeemer lives.&lt;br&gt;
Now I know, that I know, that I know, with every fiber in me, that He is real and lives inside every Christian.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this makes it plausible that Gov. Sanford, to whom religion is very important, might come up with a phrase like that. But still, I don't understand how wanting to know that he knew that he knew required him to make a trip to Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a recording and transcript of the context of the cited statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;If I- if I personally&lt;br&gt;
end up with some life questions&lt;br&gt;
that I need to get answered in my own way&lt;br&gt;
so that when &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; meet &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; maker and when I'm in that last dying breath&lt;br&gt;
and I s- and I weigh the cost and I say&lt;br&gt;
to &lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt; — and everybody&amp;#39;s got their own value system, but to &lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt; –&lt;br&gt;
even if it's a place I could never go&lt;br&gt;
if I wanted to know that I knew that I knew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;if that's more important to me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;than running for president&lt;br&gt;
that's my prerogative as a human being&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;uh&lt;br&gt;
[(interviewer) and it &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; more important]&lt;br&gt;
yeah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Again, did I want to pay the price?&lt;br&gt;
did I want the consequences? No.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;But I said this to her down there&lt;br&gt;
I said I am fully aware of the price&lt;br&gt;
I am fully aware of the cost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;and I- I- I- I- I'm willing to-&lt;br&gt;
to do that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — Commenter William Ockham offer a convincing exegesis &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1550#comment-35114"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.  Under that interpretation,  the governor's statement seems to me to validate Josh Marshall's advice: "J&lt;a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2009/07/just_go_be_with_her.php"&gt;ust Go Be With Her!&lt;/a&gt;":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;That isn't to understate all the damage and hurt he's caused to his family, his children and his supporters; let alone the breach of faith with his constituents, not over the affair but over the dereliction of duty. But notwithstanding his claims that he wants to stay in office and repair his marriage, Sanford's every action suggests overwhelmingly that he is desperate not only to get kicked out of office but to get kicked out of his marriage as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Everything he's said seems geared to reach back out to his mistress in Argentina (to perhaps re-cement the possibility of continuing the relationship?) and force a final breach with his wife. It is almost as if his upbringing, culture, religion and simply familial obligation require one thing but he's doing everything he can to make those requirements beyond his capacity to fulfill. Put simply, it's like he wants his wife to cut the cord for him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Of course, when you're a middle-aged man facing the collapse of your life's work and abandoning hope of being with the woman you call your 'soul mate' rational decision making or a clearly considered plan may be too much to expect. But it does seem like there are two guys here. One saying he wants to serve out his responsibility to his state and reconcile with his wife and another using the press to broadcast a free form love poem to the girlfriend in Argentina.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Discovery Institute is &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/06/in_darwin_anniversary_year_new.html" rel="external "&gt;touting&lt;/a&gt; a poll that they commissioned from Zogby which claims that 52% of the American public believe that “the development of life was guided by intelligent design.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/jul/01/evolution" rel="external "&gt;Ipsos/Mori poll&lt;/a&gt; in the UK shows that only 33% of the American public thinks that “scientific evidence for evolution exists”. This compares with 51% in Britain and 8% in Egypt. While the poll considered additional countries, over at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://jmlynch.wordpress.com/2009/07/01/new-polling-data-on-evolution/" rel="external "&gt;a simple prop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; I’ve tabulated results for Britain, the US and Eqypt (as a representative Muslim country) and made some comments on the issue of theistic evolution. Leave comments there or here (though I will  probably not be reading the thread here).&lt;/p&gt;

It’s an animation made up of single images taken by astronauts aboard the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/LESBxErmZ-U%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa. You really get a sense of how the plume is changing minute by minute, and the view of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow"&gt;pyroclastic flows&lt;/a&gt; is truly fantastic. A good way to see this is to let the video load, then use the controller to scroll back and forth in time along the footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I look at it, I realize just how amazing this sequence is… the ISS is always up there, so it’s bound to see just about any explosive volcanic event on Earth. But it just so happens that it flew very close to being directly over this one, so we’re looking straight down the plume.

Herschel is larger than the Hubble Space Telescope, but instead of measuring visible light, it measures far-infrared light.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/herschel_first_light_and_why_i/herscheltelescopefm4__id_pavo2008-867-410.JPG" width="500" border="3px"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that, when you look at any object in the Universe, the Hubble Space Telescope sees (mostly) visible light, or light between 400 and 700 nanometers.  What gives off visible light?  Stars, mostly, as well as some types of heated gas and dust.  On the other hand, the light that Herschel sees is much cooler, between 55,000 and 672,000 nanometers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/second_light_what_herschel_can/spectrum.gif" width="500" alt="spectrum.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longer wavelengths mean lower temperatures and lower energies.  So stars are practically invisible to Herschel, while cool gas shines very brightly.  The differences between what these two telescopes can see is striking.  They've both imaged the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlpool_Galaxy"&gt;Whirlpool galaxy (M51)&lt;/a&gt;, and Hubble shows us where the stars and very hot gas is:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/herschel_first_light_and_why_i/M51_visible.jpg" width="500" alt="Hubble M51"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Herschel shows us where the cooler gas is.  This is important, because this cooler gas appears most frequently where stars are forming.  Not just any stars, mind you, but &lt;i&gt;Sun-like&lt;/i&gt; stars, something we're particularly interested in:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/herschel_first_light_and_why_i/SP_M51composite_new_sm2_H.jpg" width="500" alt="Herschel M51"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Herschel image, above, was the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_light_(astronomy)"&gt;first light&lt;/a&gt; image, or the first image the telescope ever took.  Well, the science teams have had some time with it, and they've made some tremendous progress.  By taking some high-resolution images from the very far infrared (like the 160,000 nanometer image, below),
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/second_light_herschel_and_hubb/Herschel-Far-IR.jpg" width="500" alt="Herschel-Far-IR.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and &lt;b&gt;combining&lt;/b&gt; it with the Hubble data, they were able to produce this composite image of M51.  The image shows both visible light (in normal colors) and the cool gas and dust (in red), indicative of newly forming, lower-mass stars:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/second_light_herschel_and_hubb/1.jpg" width="500" alt="1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much more so than the "first light" picture near the top, this composite image gives you a sense of what Herschel is good for, and how spectacular its offerings are.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do we learn from this?  Well, for the first time, &lt;b&gt;we can see where spiral arms will create new stars&lt;/b&gt;, giving us a glimpse as to the future of this galaxy.  Amazing.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/second_light_herschel_and_hubb.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246478728260"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/a_jam_too_hot_even_for_isis.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6678d9b69ba6bea8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Ass Shaking Jams"/><title type="html">A Jam too Hot Even for Isis.....</title><published>2009-07-01T18:00:08Z</published><updated>2009-07-01T18:00:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/DE03nQAjhKE/a_jam_too_hot_even_for_isis.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/a_jam_too_hot_even_for_isis.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I saw this leaked on Monday and have had it on constant replay.

&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At heart I am a sports fanatic.  I listen to sports radio on my way to work, I play Fantasy Baseball and Fantasy Football (explained as RPGs for sports fans at the Chicago Drink Skeptically meetings). I love sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday, a question was posed on The Dan Patrick Show, which goes beyond the realm of sports.  It involves 2 icons and how they have impacted the global landscape. The icons are Michael Jackson and Michael Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think if I polled anyone age 25 to 50 (possibly even older), the majority of the people responding will have tried to Moon Walk at least once.  In the same respect, if I showed those people a red leather jacket and a diamond-studded, white glove, the response would come quickly as to whom they belong.  There is no doubt, Michael Jackson is a global icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Jordan is a global icon as well.  With the exception of possibly Tiger Woods, is there another more recognizable athlete globally?  Although, if you were to play name the logo, I guarantee more people know the Air Jordan logo than the Woods TW logo.  I would go as far to say the Air Jordan logo is more recognizable than the Nike Swoosh.  In addition to brand recognition, Jordan globalized the game of basketball.  The Euro leagues would be no where near the size if not for the influence of Jordan.  And without Jordan, do you think we Yao Ming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of the aforementioned said, I would like to pose the same question, which was posed to The Dan Patrick Show listeners Thursday, to the readers of Skepchick today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who has had more impact globally, Michael Jackson or Michael Jordan [ED: or the Michael of your choice]?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what I get for awarding COTW to a sports blogger. I added the ability to choose another Michael entirely, to open up the field a bit. Mwa ha.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246474761982"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/monday_autism_news_potpourri_on_wednesday">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/24bafc248f26259d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Monday Autism News Potpourri (on Wednesday)</title><published>2009-07-01T18:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-01T18:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/monday_autism_news_potpourri_on_wednesday" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ab4dd0n/3323173485/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3546/3323173485_ac3fec5806_m.jpg" alt="a bowl of random assorted items; recognizable: rubber band ball, spiderman head, large white flower, small white flower, shells, pine cone" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Clearing out a some news stuff I didn't get a chance to transmute into posts while I was offline, plus some shameless self-promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. A new &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/podcast/transcript060109.html"&gt;Medicare rehospitalization rate report&lt;/a&gt; states some alarming statistics (e.g., "almost one of every five [Medicare recipients] was rehospitalized within 30 days following discharge for an illness, or surgery").  This is why it's so very, very important to include long term supports and services in any &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/words_or_lack_thereof_from_obama_and_harkin_on_cca"&gt;health care reform&lt;/a&gt; that seeks to reduce emergency care and rehospitalization rates.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn't like this article as much--it's a bit overboard with the "overcoming" type language.  However, it does clearly illustrate the importance of self-awareness and self-advocacy in getting the kind of life you want.&lt;/p&gt;

The boys on one team don’t even need to mull it over: they automatically pick the token female on the opposing team – because everyone knows girls aren’t as good as boys at math. Right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wrong. A new report on “Gender, Culture and Mathematics Performance,” concludes that there is no innate difference in the mathematical ability of girls and boys. Authored by Janet Hyde and Janet Mertz of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, the report appeared in June in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Hyde and Mertz’s latest report builds on their 2008 study that appeared in Science, which examined the SAT results and math scores of 7 million students and found that the girls matched the performance of the boys from second grade all the way through to the eleventh grade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Granted, there were a few minor gender disparities, but Hyde and Mertz argue that these are not due to biological differences, but to socio-cultural factors. They point to the World Economic Forum’s measure of gender equality in various countries as evidence. “In countries where there is little or no measured gap between boys and girls in math performance, those are the countries with the greatest gender equality,” said Mertz. “That leads us to believe any math gender gap is cultural, not biological.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This prejudice against women in math and science dates back thousands of years and still pervades popular culture. History gives us the occasional rare exception to the rule. In 18th-century France, Emilie du Chatelet defied her father’s protests to pursue her interest in math and science. Fifty years later, Sophie Germain studied math in secret under the bedclothes at night, and masqueraded as a male student at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, eventually developing Germain primes – prime numbers where, if you double them and add 1, the answer is another prime number. Victorian England had Mary Somerville, another self-taught mathematician who defied the cultural stereotypes of her age. Her passion for math was so strong, she was revising a paper the day before she died at 92.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such figures are often dismissed as anomalies, which is why we need more researchers like Hyde and Mertz to collect more and more data on this topic. And it’s why we need skilled communicators to spread the word and erode all those lingering negative assumptions. “There is a persistent stereotype that girls and women are just not as good at math as boys and men,” Hyde said. “The data we have indicate that’s just not true. I really think it’s important to get that word out and to chip away at that myth.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s where Hollywood can help, bringing its consummate skill at communicating with mass audiences via an entertaining medium. People are inspired by what they see on the screen, and the images they see invariably color their perceptions. In the United States, for instance, skill in mathematics isn’t highly valued: both boys and girls who are good at math are labeled “nerds,” whereas in other cultures, proficiency with numbers is an admirable quality. The hit TV show Numb3rs counters that stereotype every week, by providing real-world contexts to demonstrate its tagline: “We all use math every day.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mean Girls perfectly captures those cultural factors – like peer pressure and social stereotypes – that traditionally have impeded the performance of girls in mathematics. Homeschooled in Africa for most of her early life by her anthropologist parents, Cady (played by Lindsay Lohan) didn’t absorb the subliminal message that women can’t do math – at least until she begins attending a regular high school. Then the inevitable peer pressure kicks in. She is urged by her peers not to join the high school math team, despite the fact that she has a gift for numbers. “It’s social suicide!” she is told. Within a few weeks, she is pretending to be bad at math to win over the cute boy in her calculus class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Hollywood gives us a happy ending. Cady embraces her gift for calculus, and also gets to be homecoming queen, proving that a girl can be pretty, popular, very smart, and even snag the cutest boy in school, just by being true to herself. It’s a message more young girls need to hear. Mean Girls is one tiny yet critical blow in the ongoing effort to shatter those lingering stereotypes. One day there won’t just be a token girl on high school math squads, there will be several, and they will match their male classmates in skill. That’s the kind of revolutionary long-term change that can happen when science and Hollywood combine forces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/QIMSC-RWvF8%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-5827606428837016079?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

As the International Space Station orbits the Earth every 90 minutes or so, the Earth is spinning underneath it… and not only that, the orbit of the ISS is tilted by about 50 degrees to the Equator. All of this means that any one spot on Earth doesn’t see the ISS every 90 minutes, and in fact it can be days or weeks between favorable overhead passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you figure all this out, &lt;a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/SSapplications/Post/JavaSSOP/JavaSSOP.html"&gt;NASA has created a nifty applet&lt;/a&gt; to help you determine when the ISS (and a handful of other satellites, including Hubble) are visible at your location. You can enter your country or zip code and it will tell you when the next visible pass of the ISS occurs. You may have to click &amp;quot;Next Sighting&amp;quot; a few times to get one that’s at a decent time, but keep at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/80464810@N00/573107872/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1385/573107872_805d01b314_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISS and the Shuttle rising over the trees.&lt;br&gt;I shot this picture in 2007.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, the next week or so yields many favorable overhead passages of the ISS in the US — think of it as a holiday celebration (even though there’s that pesky &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; in ISS). For me, in Boulder, the next good sighting is on Monday July 6, when it passes very close to directly overhead at 10:17 p.m. (there are a few sooner but they are early in the morning when I tend to be asleep). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This application also provides you with a map of the sky to help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while it’s nice and all, I still prefer to use &lt;a href="http://www.heavens-above.com"&gt;Heavens Above&lt;/a&gt;, a fantastic resource on the web for satellite passes, sky mapping, and tons more. All you need to do is put in your latitude and longitude as accurately as you can (Google Maps will help there) and it will give you a table of dozens of visible satellite passes, including ISS, Hubble, and a gazillion more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For you Americans out there, the Fourth of July is a great time for skygazing; even though the Sun doesn’t set until late, a lot of folks will be out after dark anyway.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Betul Kacar Arslan of the &lt;a href="http://www.counterminds.com/" title=""&gt;Counter Minds&lt;/a&gt; blog, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am Betul (Kacar) Arslan, originally from Istanbul, Turkey, living in the USA. I actually came here to get a PhD but now that I am graduating, I am starting to feel that I am here only to steal an American's job.  My doctoral studies structured around biochemical work on a teleost enzyme (MAO). Now I am getting ready for an exciting project for my post-doctoral work: "resurrecting and evolving 4-billion year old proteins". Interested? More can be  &lt;a href="http://www.allword-news.co.uk/2009/05/04/scientists-to-resurrect-ancient-gene-to-replay-evolution/" title=""&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="BetulKacar pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/BetulKacar%20pic.jpg" width="448" height="336" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't want to be a grown-up when I grow up. That said, I don't want to lose my ambition and passion for scientific research and I think that is possible if one has the curiosity and courage of a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you insist, I want to see the Earth from a space shuttle that is headed to Mars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well.. I spend my day time in the lab doing research but I guess people no longer consider academia as real life. Therefore, in my -other- life I dance &amp;amp; teach tango. I am also a volunteer for the IRC (International Refugee Committee). Many refugees come to the US and they need help in many ways, if you&amp;#39;d like to help see &lt;a href="http://www.theirc.org/where/northamerica.html" title=""&gt;this &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am learning. Nothing excites me more than new ideas and thoughts. Therefore through blogging I think I found the right place for me. Not that I get hundreds of hits everyday, but it is just nice to feel a part of the club, plus, all the interesting people (like you) I got to meet. Some people from Turkey reached me through my blog, and now I am writing articles for a popular science magazine called NTV-Bilim in Turkey. So yes, blogging does open you new doors and raises opportunities. One shall not underestimate the power of the Web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have friends who read my blog.. well at least they tell me they do so. My graduate advisor wanted me to keep my work limited to publications therefore I have not been able to write on my project details on the blog.  I try to write some real-time campus happenings, that way when people see me around, they share their comments and thoughts. Mostly fun. These days I can not blog as often due to my dissertation writing but I promise to strike back starting August. -- I don't use Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dear friend and collegue, Karen Ventii PhD (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencetolife/" title=""&gt;science to life&lt;/a&gt;), introduced me to the blogging world. I am very glad she did. I like to communicate and I like doing experiments, however laboratories are not the perfect place to be talkative (learned the hard way). Blogging helped me to release my words, my thoughts and everything else that I could no longer keep to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year was my first time at a SciBlogs Conference, and I had limited time, so I tried to read as many name tags as I could and go talk to sciblings. Therefore I had a lot of "oh so, this is him/her" moments, some disappointing, some surprising but always fun. I got to meet &lt;a href="http://almostdiamonds.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Stephanie Zvan&lt;/a&gt; for instance, after reading and following her blog for so long, her blog name has become like a brand in my mind. I called her "almost diamonds" for a while then switched to her first name eventually (I hope this doesn't make me sound like a weirdo)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never thought of the copyright issues or the problems that I might encounter with my employee based on the things I put on my blog. Conference made me realize that my blog is not my secret diary, it is out there and people actually read it. I was more careful on what I put or say in my blog afterwards, though I am still working on it. Like, one way to control myself is not to write when feeling too emotional or frusturated so to not regret later - and for a Mediterranean, that is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eh, I know! Mediterranean myself. Was there an event that marked your first year at blogging?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely, blogging helped me to make a voice on &lt;a href="http://www.counterminds.com/2009/03/darwin-issue-of-magazine-is-banned-in.html" title=""&gt;Turkey's censorship of evolution&lt;/a&gt;. I even made it to the news in Turkey. So instead of sitting at home and being frusturated on my own, it was a good feeling to be actually doing something. It was also amazing to see how evolution can gather so much attention on one's blog! Some creationist was threatening me and he even told me to behave (or else). A lot of action and drama for a small blog, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all I feel happy with the crowd I gathered. I always feel happy when a new reader stops by. I have no big ambitions on blogging (like being a blogging super star), as I said earlier, having fun and learning new things: priceless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your favorite ice-cream flavor?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vanilla&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My pleasure Coturnix, thanks for all the fish (and baklava).&lt;/p&gt;

They just infiltrated nations all around the planet, smuggling in individuals to form vast new colonies of billions, all loyal to the overlords back home. Of course, these are very, very short Argentinians, which made them harder to notice: &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8127000/8127519.stm"&gt;they're all ants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, one vast colony of Argentine ants is thought to stretch for 6,000km (3,700 miles) along the Mediterranean coast, while another in the US, known as the 'Californian large', extends over 900km (560 miles) along the coast of California. A third huge colony exists on the west coast of Japan.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
While ants are usually highly territorial, those living within each super-colony are tolerant of one another, even if they live tens or hundreds of kilometres apart. Each super-colony, however, was thought to be quite distinct.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But it now appears that billions of Argentine ants around the world all actually belong to one single global mega-colony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is used for the&lt;br&gt;symptomatic relief of sprains, muscular aches and bruising and swelling after&lt;br&gt;contusions. Two pillules should be taken every 2 hours for the first six doses, then&lt;br&gt;four times daily until symptoms improve for up to a maximum of 7 days.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The excipients used to manufacture the homeopathic medicinal product are lactose,&lt;br&gt;sucrose and purified water.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Oh, no arnica then?&lt;br&gt;This bit is utterly laughable:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Published scientific literature review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;The applicant has provided a bibliographic reference documenting a summary of&lt;br&gt;clinical trials using arnica in homeopathic dilutions. The summary refers to studies&lt;br&gt;where Arnica had been administered in a number of clinical conditions.&lt;br&gt;The applicant has also provided further details of eleven published clinical studies&lt;br&gt;investigating the clinical effects of arnica. The studies were performed under&lt;br&gt;randomised, double blind conditions and were carried out to investigate the post&lt;br&gt;operative clinical actions of arnica, such as pain relief and bruising.&lt;br&gt;The results of the clinical trials and studies provided were not conclusive in&lt;br&gt;establishing the clinical effects of arnica but indicated that there may be a trend&lt;br&gt;towards demonstrating some beneficial effects of arnica in some situations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll be contacting the MHRA as they seem to have omitted an important safety concern - how do I know that what is in the pack is what is on the label?

&lt;p&gt;Every year he throws a tech conference called &lt;a href="http://www.gnomedex.com/"&gt;Gnomedex&lt;/a&gt;, which is about how we humans work and play online. It’s been growing for years, and I have watched it with envious eyes. I’ve always wanted to attend, and every year for the past three Chris has invited me to come, but I have always been busy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, while I was laboring away on my machine, a Skype window popped open. It was from Chris, and all it had was a link to Gnomedex and the words, &amp;quot;And ^%$#*^ you if you can’t do it this time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I say no to that? So I am in fact going to Gnomedex this year! I’ll be talking about skepticism online: how we do it, why we need it, and what we can all do to participate. Or at least, that’s the plan. When I actually put my talk together I’ll know what it’s about then.&lt;/p&gt;

Without too much hesitation, he answered:  “Hard work.”  That certainly wasn’t the answer we wanted to hear — you mean there isn’t some secret recipe to being brilliant?  And of course hard work is not nearly enough to elevate you to the ranks of the world’s great scientists.  But now that I have marinated for some time in the juices of experience myself, I see the truth of what he was getting at; there are a lot of smart people out there, so it makes sense that what elevates a few of them above their peers is an extraordinary focus on their work and a great amount of simple effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it should come as no surprise that Isaac Newton, the greatest physicist of all time, was a relentless worker.  In his days at Cambridge, when he focused on the workings of the natural world, he would spend as little time as possible on anything that drew him away from the researches in his rooms.  Over the couple of years he was writing the &lt;em&gt;Principia Mathematica&lt;/em&gt;, he took things to extremes, going for extended periods without food or sleep.  (He also, apparently, died a virgin.  Extremes come in many guises.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most contemporary physicists have heard that Newton eventually left Cambridge and more or less turned his back on scientific research, to take up activities in later life that we associate with varying degrees of disreputability:  alchemy, religious studies, taking a bureaucratic position at the Royal Mint, using the Royal Society to attack his scientific rivals.  Lots of us shrug and agree that many older scientists do all sorts of crazy things, and don’t wonder too much about the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Newton-Counterfeiter-Detective-Greatest-Scientist/dp/0151012784"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/07/levenson-newtoncounter-us-cover1.jpg" alt="levenson-newtoncounter-us-cover1.jpg" width="225" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Happily, Tom Levenson (of &lt;a href="http://inversesquare.wordpress.com/"&gt;The Inverse Square&lt;/a&gt;, and one of our honored &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/06/06/guest-post-tom-levenson-on-einstein-religion-and-jewishness/"&gt;guest bloggers&lt;/a&gt;) has provided us with a fascinating peek into a telling episode in Newton’s later life — his career as a criminal investigator.   Not really “P.I.”, as Newton was acting in his capacity as a government official, the Warden of the Mint.  The story is closer to something from &lt;em&gt;Law and Order&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; — remarkably close, in fact.  In &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Newton-Counterfeiter-Detective-Greatest-Scientist/dp/0151012784/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newton and the Counterfeiter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Levenson tells the tale of how Newton took up what should have been a cushy sinecure, and ended up devoting his extraordinary Newtonian powers to the pursuit and prosecution of one William Chaloner, the counterfeiter of the title.  Poor Chaloner, suffice it to say, never knew what hit him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should say right up front that this is not a book about physics.  Some time back Tom asked me to read some pages from his draft, to make sure the physics was coming out right, but he assured me that physics played a very minor role in the book.  That baffled me a bit, because — well, it is Isaac Newton, right?  But this is a work of biography and intellectual history, and offers a fascinating “street-level view” of the dawn of the Age of Reason.  I can recommend it without hesitation to anyone who likes good stories, which I presume is just about anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book does begin with some stage-setting about Newton’s scientific work in Cambridge — it is Isaac Newton, right?  But it picks up when our protagonist finally wrangles a position in London as Warden of the Mint.  Not supposed to be a taxing job; one of the attractions for Newton was that he was going to have plenty of time available for his research.  Mostly, at that time, on alchemy and religion — one of the enlightening chapters looks at how Newton actually went about his alchemical work, which is both engrossing and baffling to the modern reader.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History did not cooperate.  The 1690’s was a transformative time for the English currency system, including the introduction of paper money, trade imbalances with the Continent, massive debts run up by William III’s wars in France, and an epidemic of counterfeiting and “coin-clipping,” by which people would shave off the edges of silver coins and melt them down to make new ones.  In response, the Mint eventually gave in and undertook a comprehensive re-coinage — a program that was on track to become a complete fiasco until Newton stepped in.  Remember that he was not simply an abstract theorist (although he was that); Newton was an extraordinarily careful experimenter, and he turned his practical side to the problem of re-coinage, with spectacular results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real fun comes in when Newton takes on Chaloner, one of the most notorious counterfeiters of the day.  I don’t want to give away too much, because you really should buy the book.  Suffice it to say that where Newton was gifted with an extraordinary intellect and a relentless work ethic, Chaloner was gifted with what we would today call “balls.”  No scheme was too audacious to be undertaken, no lie was too grandiose to be told, no collection of co-conspirators was too extensive to be betrayed or turned against each other.  Chaloner was a colorful character, whose story would have made entertaining reading no matter what era he was born into.  But he made one unforgivable mistake:  he attracted the particular ire of Isaac Newton, who turned the full force of his powers to tracking this miscreant down and bringing him to justice.  Chaloner’s own gifts notwithstanding, it was not a fair fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to look at successful people and imagine that they are defined by their sphere of success.  It’s hard for us today to think of Isaac Newton as anything other than a scientist.  But he was good at what he did, whether it was piecing together the mysteries of classical mechanics or paying informers to spy on suspected criminals.  Gil Grissom would approve — maybe not of all his methods, but certainly of his results.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246466969204"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4318">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a2f1cd4d892fa737</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Does Science Lead to Atheism?</title><published>2009-07-01T16:31:51Z</published><updated>2009-07-01T20:28:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/07/post-29.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center;font-size:300%;line-height:75%;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;No.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the short answer. The longer answer is that scientists are more likely to disbelieve in God than are nonscientists, and eminent scientists are more apt to be disbelievers than journeyman scientists. But does science lead them to atheism? Possibly, but it seems more likely that freethinkers or skeptics are attracted to science than that science creates atheists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I studied this question a few years ago, when John Lynch and I prepared an &lt;a href="http://darwin.bc.asu.edu/pub/reprints/EoU_Scientists.pdf" rel="external "&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;New Encyclopedia of Unbelief&lt;/em&gt;. What follows the horizontal rule is an excerpt from that article. One of the conclusions we drew was that biologists, anthropologists, and psychologists were more likely to disbelieve in God than physical scientists and engineers. That conclusion has recently been called into question, and I will discuss the new data after the second horizontal rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measuring Unbelief among Scientists (1914 and 1933).&lt;/strong&gt;  … the psychologist James H. Leuba surveyed a large number of US scientists in order to learn their beliefs about God and immortality.  In both polls, disbelievers (not including doubters or agnostics) represented a plurality over believers and doubters (Table 1).  Further, the least likely to be believers were psychologists, followed by sociologists, biologists, and physicists, in that order.  The order stood firm across the years. Distinguished scientists (as identified by &lt;em&gt;American Men of Science&lt;/em&gt;) exhibited a substantially greater rate of disbelief than “lesser” scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leuba’s poll was, however, not without problems. First, because the U. S. was almost monolithically Christian, Leuba formulated two questions that asked, in essence, whether respondents believed in a particular Christian conception of God.  Asking his questions in that way militated against getting positive responses from, for example, pantheists such as Robert Millikan and Albert Einstein, who associated God with the universe and its laws and thus did not revere, in Leuba’s words, “the God of our Churches.”  Leuba asked respondents whether they believed in “a God to whom one may pray in the expectation of receiving an answer” (a question specifically defined to exclude psychological or subjective consequences of prayer), disbelieved in such a God, or had no definite belief.  Second, several questionnaires were returned with remarks intended to justify the respondents’ refusals to answer the questions.  According to Leuba, most of these were from disbelievers; hence, he concluded, the percentage of disbelievers may have been understated in his poll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists are more educated than the general population, and Leuba, a religious humanist, thought that increasing education would decrease rates of belief in God.  To test his hypothesis, he surveyed college students at two unidentified colleges: a high-ranking college that was divided among the major Protestant denominations, and a college that was “radical” in its leanings.  In both colleges, the number of believers in both God and immortality decreased with age or academic advancement (freshman through senior years).  Leuba also cites a decrease in belief at one of the colleges between 1914 and 1933, as well as similar results found at Syracuse University in 1926.  Leuba, a professor at Bryn Mawr College outside Philadelphia, does not identify the two colleges in his study, but they are probably in the northeast, if not the Philadelphia area.  If the major Protestant denominations means the mainline Protestant churches, then Leuba’s studies of college students may not be representative, inasmuch as they omit students affiliated with churches not heavily represented in the northeast.  Oddly, Leuba does not mention the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measuring Unbelief among Scientists (the 1990’s). &lt;/strong&gt; In 1996 and 1998, Edward J. Larson and Larry Witham replicated Leuba’s surveys.  For consistency, they did not edit Leuba’s questions, despite the cultural changes that had occurred in 80 years. Additionally, &lt;em&gt;American Men and Women of Science&lt;/em&gt; no longer highlights eminent scientists, so Larson and Witham derived their “greater” scientists from the membership of the National Academy of Sciences; comparison with Leuba’s “greater” scientists is therefore problematic, because the NAS probably contains substantially more-eminent scientists than the highlighted scientists of the earlier surveys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larson and Witham found that nearly 50 percent of the scientists and nearly 75 percent of the “greater” scientists surveyed disbelieve in both God and immortality. An additional 15-20 percent are doubters.  It is hard to make much of three numbers, but during the century the percentage of disbelievers increased monotonically in every category, except for a peak in the percent of scientists who disbelieved in 1933.  Disbelief in immortality more than doubled among scientists in general and nearly tripled among “greater” scientists.  It is thus hard to credit Larson and Witham’s claim that belief among scientists has remained more or less steady for 80 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C. Mackenzie Brown has analyzed Leuba’s data and also suggested that demographics may make comparison between Leuba’s and Larson and Witham’s surveys difficult.  For example, more scientists now are women, and women are more likely to be religious than men.  This factor reduces the number of disbelievers in the later surveys and possibly disconfirms Larson and Witham’s conclusion that scientists’ religious beliefs have not changed much since 1914.  Brown has similarly noted that applied scientists are underrepresented among the greater scientists and adds drily that their underrepresentation may be relevant to any discussion of the beliefs of eminent scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Laurence Iannaconne and his colleagues examined existing data gathered between 1972 and 1990, and tried to assess the prevalence of scientists’ belief in God.  They found that 19 percent of “professors/scientists” have “no religion” and 11 to 21 percent “oppose religion” (Table 2).  It is hard to compare these figures with those of Leuba and Larson, but arguably between 27 and 40 percent of professors/scientists may be doubters or disbelievers. The study broke the data down further by discipline and found a hierarchy similar to that found by Leuba: Social scientists, at 36 percent, were most likely to have no religion, followed by physical scientists and mathematicians (27 percent) and life scientists (25 percent).  Among the social scientists, sociologists (35 percent), psychologists (48 percent), and anthropologists (57 percent) were most likely to have no religion. According to a 2003 Harris poll, by contrast, 90 percent of all adults [in the U.S.] believe in God and 84 percent in survival of the soul after death; that is, 10 percent disbelieve in God or are doubters, and 16 percent disbelieve in immortality or are doubters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interpreting the Data.&lt;/strong&gt;  Leuba speculated whether scientists become disbelievers or whether independent thinkers willing to confront reigning orthodoxies become scientists.  The greater scientists are presumably on average more-independent thinkers than the lesser; the fact could account for the increase of disbelief among greater scientists. That conclusion is supported by a study by Fred Thalheimer, who concluded that religious beliefs are frequently set during high school or college and that nonreligious students may choose more-intellectual or -theoretical endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists who study biology, psychology, and sociology and anthropology are more likely to disbelieve in God and immortality than physical and applied scientists.  Leuba speculated that physicists and engineers see a creator in the lawfulness of the physical and engineering worlds.  Social and biological scientists may be less likely to see lawfulness in their studies, and Brown asks, further, whether social and biological scientists are perhaps influenced by the suffering that they see and physical scientists do not see.  Thus, the question may be why biological and social scientists are more likely to disbelieve, rather than why physical scientists and engineers are less likely.  Arguably, then, science leads to disbelief, at least among those already inclined to be independent thinkers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leuba predicted that increasing scientific knowledge would lead to increasing disbelief.  That prediction is apparently (at least partly) correct. He further predicted that the religions would adapt to the best scientific insights and “replace their specific method of seeking the welfare of humanity by appeal to, and reliance upon divine Beings, by methods free from a discredited supernaturalism.”  That prediction, at least so far, is largely incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measuring Unbelief among Scientists (2004-2007).&lt;/strong&gt; Elaine Ecklund and Christopher Scheitle have recently examined the religious beliefs of scientists as a function of discipline. They discuss a survey of faculty at 21 elite research universities. Among the questions they asked were, “Which one of the following statements comes closest to expressing what you believe about God?” The statements ranged from “I have no doubts about God’s existence” through “I have some doubts, but I believe in God” to “I do not know…and there is no way to find out” and “I do not believe in God.” To compare their results with Leuba’s and others, I identified “I do not believe in God”  with disbelief and identified “I believe in God sometimes” and “I do not know…and there is no way to find out” with doubt. The comparison is problematic, if only because Leuba’s survey concerned a God who potentially answers prayers. The results are presented in Table 3. They support the conclusion that scientists are more apt to be disbelievers than the general public, but they are at odds with the conclusion that the rate of disbelief correlates with discipline. Ecklund and Scheitle, however, performed a statistical analysis that suggests nevertheless that biologists may be somewhat less inclined toward religion than physicists; they speculate that the correlation, if it is real, may result from what they call the contentious relationship between evolution and certain religious groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ecklund and Scheitle’s study is marred somewhat both by its restriction to elite scientists and by its mechanism for choosing those elite scientists. Not every faculty member at an elite university is an elite scientist, certainly not on a par with members of the National Academy of Sciences.  Nevertheless, they found that the best predictor of their scientists’ religious practice is the scientists’ childhood religious practice and conclude, more or less in agreement with Thalheimer, that freethinkers or doubters to some extent self-select when they become scientists. Thus, science may not lead to disbelief; rather, disbelievers or skeptics are led to science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Ecklund and Scheitle found that younger scientists are more apt to be religious than are older scientists and note without comment that this finding “could indicate an overall shift in attitudes towards religion among those in the academy.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unbelief outside the US.&lt;/strong&gt;  I do not know of any studies similar to Leuba’s outside the United States. Europe is generally thought to be less religious than the United States, but Andrew Curry, writing in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, notes some disquieting appearances of creationism in Europe. He cites a German study, which I have not read, to the effect that students’ openness to creationism is less a result of religion than of their failure to appreciate or understand science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pierre Clément and his colleagues report on a study of the creationist beliefs of teachers, as opposed to professors and practicing scientists.  The cohort of “teachers” comprises both practicing teachers and students studying to become teachers. The study included 19 countries, mostly from Europe, the Levant, and northern Africa. Approximately one-third of the teachers were biology teachers, and the remainder taught the national language. Among 14 of those countries, 12.5 % of respondents were agnostic. In France and Estonia, more than 50 % were agnostic. The authors give no indication whether the biology teachers were more or less likely to be agnostic than the language teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study asked questions such as, “Which of the following four statements do you agree with most? … 1. It is certain that the origin of the humankind results from evolutionary processes.
2. Human origin can be explained by evolutionary processes without considering the hypothesis that God created humankind. 3. Human origin can be explained by evolutionary processes that are governed by God.  4. It is certain that God created humankind.” A similar set of questions asked about the origin of life, as opposed to the origin of humanity. The questions were translated into each national language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clément and colleagues considered those who ticked question 4 to be (anti-evolutionist) creationists, whereas those who ticked question 3 were  designated creationist-evolutionists - most probably what in the United States are called theistic evolutionists. Only about 2 % of the respondents from France, for example, were creationists; more than 80 % of respondents from Morocco and Algeria were creationists, even among biology teachers. Creationism was more likely in those who were more religious, either in belief or in observance, irrespective of religion. Those who said that the theory of evolution contradicted their own beliefs ranged from a few percent among agnostics, through approximately 25 % among Catholics and Protestants, and 40 % among Orthodox, to nearly 75 % among Muslims. Acceptance of evolution, including theistic evolution, among the entire cohort of teachers, however, increased with years of training, from about 45 % among those with less than 2 years of training through 80 % among those with 4 or more years of training. These numbers are all rough, because I had to pick most of them off some fairly small graphs. I suspect that the correlation with religion is partly the result of demographics; the study did not compare, for example, Catholics and Muslims within a single country, such as France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study included five countries in western Europe: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Portugal, and Italy. Approximately 10 % of biology teachers in the UK and 15% in Portugal responded that it was certain that God created life - the response that Clément and his colleagues consider the creationist response. Nearly 20 % of the language teachers in Italy responded similarly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, roughly 15 % of biology teachers in the UK and Germany, a bit over 20 % in Portugal and Italy, and 35 % in France responded that the origin of life resulted from natural processes (Table 3). The language teachers’ responses to the same question ranged from a low of perhaps 12 % in the UK (which at 35 % also had a relatively high fraction of theistic evolutionists) to 52 % in France. In four of the five countries, the percentage of language teachers who thought that life had resulted from natural processes exceeded the percentage of biology teachers; I haven’t the foggiest idea why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the percentage of both biology and language teachers who ticked natural causes or theistic evolution was least in the Muslim and Orthodox countries, Lebanon, Malta, and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion.&lt;/strong&gt; Paul Strode and I tried to show that science is not necessarily incompatible with religion, though it certainly falsifies the specific claims of some religions. Nevertheless, both atheists and creationists (some of them, anyway) want to think that science necessarily leads toward atheism or agnosticism. It is hard to say, but it seems more likely that skeptics or freethinkers, who may be already inclined toward disbelief in God, are more likely to become scientists or, perhaps, science teachers. The claim that social scientists are less likely to believe than are physical scientists may not stand up to scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

Says Ruben Andersson (apparently a Swedish expat and anthropologist),&lt;blockquote&gt;Sweden's conservative coalition government has stood still as the financial crisis has engulfed the country. Jobs, social services and healthcare are eroding. The Sweden Democrats - the equivalent of the BNP - are on the rise. The social state is failing. The Swedish dream is no more. ... Sweden's homemade financial meltdown of the 1990s ... finally killed off the dream. Poverty was added to the pessimism. Savage cuts hit schools, unemployment rocketed, the krona sank - leaving the social system in a disarray from which it has not recovered.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I certainly don't pretend to have a very comprehensive or updated view of the state of my country's social security system and national economy. But I've lived here for decades, and I do know that our society is very far from "eroding", "failing" and "in disarray".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swedish media have been discussing the uncertain future of our high-taxes, cheap social services system for about twenty years now. They have been unfailingly gloomy about it. But it still costs me only $19 to see a doctor (no, the queue is never long as Andersson claims) and $260 a month to have a child in daycare. Swedish universities still don't charge students a fee, and anybody can still have six years' worth of government loans to support them through their studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andersson's piece appears to be the first he's sold to the Guardian. My impression is that in order to make the sale, Andersson fed his editor a scary interesting story that happens not to be true. His choice of words suggests that he has pretty extreme libertarian opinions that cause him to &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; the Swedish system to fail. He would dislike it simply on first principles even if the system showed no weaknesses whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Psychiatric care, the source of many ... scandals, has a near-medieval penchant for authoritarianism with few European equivalents. People are locked up for months for not taking medicine, given no therapy, and spat out of the system into despair and destitution. The mentally ill die in wards and in outpatient isolation. And they do not even have charities to turn to&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is bollocks. The main problem with the Swedish psychiatric care system is that out of misguided respect for their integrity, patients who can't really take care of themselves are allowed to roam free and homeless. And note the guy's highly suggestive love of charities. He simply doesn't like high taxes and collective solutions. He then goes on to talk about "Sweden's second-rate public services", which is just a joke.

&lt;p&gt;Dear Reader, to get a fair large-scale grip on current Swedish society, you shouldn't listen to me, because I spend most of my time in the 1st Millennium AD. And you certainly shouldn't listen to Ruben Andersson, because he is an axe-grinding anti-collectivist who is more interested in influencing society than describing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/07/libertarian_columnist_smears_s.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/AfTc9hzCByM" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246461540947"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-7697714744648938244">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/88d5de5a9be89e07</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The Christian Faith Made Simple</title><published>2009-07-01T13:54:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-01T14:09:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/QReVGwa5X7k/christian-faith-made-simple.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/7697714744648938244/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=7697714744648938244" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/07/christian-faith-made-simple.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">In the words of that famous Christian hymn: &lt;em&gt;Only Believe. Only Believe. &lt;strong&gt;All things are possible.&lt;/strong&gt; Only Believe!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;God the Father; God the son; God the Holy Spirit: These three in One. Very God of Very God being of one substance (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Homoousios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), begotten not made, True God from True God. This very same True God was born by the creature He created (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Theotokos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: God Bearer or when the Creator created the creature who, in turn, created the Creator in sinful flesh yet without sin): Mary who herself was impregnated by her own Father God so He could be born into the very fallen world of sin the Creator so detested and cursed the created creatures with. In so doing, He became flesh and &lt;span&gt;dwelt&lt;/span&gt; among us, but to correct the very Fallen State the Creator cursed the creatures with, the Creator had Himself killed so He as Very God of Very God could shed His own sinless blood for Himself (Creator-Creature atoning to Creator) in order that He could finally accept the world the Creator created in His perfect mind which the Creator had fully planed with fore-knowledge before the foundations of the earth (Gospel of John Chapter 1). The Creator is now seated at the right hand of Himself while making inter-secession to Himself for the fallen creatures of which he had foreknowledge (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Supralapsarianism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) of before He created the foundations of the cosmos. He, Himself, will now come again to receive this, His fallen creation, unto Himself by re-creating a &lt;em&gt;New Heaven&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;New Earth&lt;/em&gt; in which the redeemed fallen creatures will also rule with the Creator in a &lt;em&gt;New Jerusalem&lt;/em&gt; filled with the very items (Gold and Emeralds: Revelation 21) which produce the greed and lust of the fallen state of the creature the Creator condemned in the old eternal &lt;span&gt;Covernant&lt;/span&gt; now replaced with the new eternal &lt;span&gt;Covernant&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now dear Christian, just which part of your salvation do you not understand? (Remember, your very soul hangs in the balance between orthodoxy and heresy or between eternal damnation and eternal salvation.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May God have mercy on your mental state!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-7697714744648938244?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Knowing myself (and my ADHD) I did some cherry-picking. I skipped the heavy-duty chemistry lectures that I was bound not to understand, and went to only two talks I really wanted to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one was by my yesterday's co-panelist Prof. Sir Harold Walter Kroto (&lt;a href="http://www.kroto.info/" title=""&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Kroto" title=""&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/LaureateDetails.AxCMS?UserID=6862" title=""&gt;Lindau biography&lt;/a&gt;). Just this moment, I am sitting in the press room discussing with other bloggers who are at this very moment writing blog-posts about Kroto's talk, how impossible it is to describe it. He touched on many topics - numbers, chemistry, science, environment, education, Web (or as he puts it: GYWW - Google/YouTube/Wikipedia World), religion, scientific method and much more. But it is impossible to describe it, really. What was it &lt;b&gt;about&lt;/b&gt;? It is one of those talks where you need to be there, sit back, and let the speaker grab you. Laugh. Enjoy. So, you should just &lt;a href="http://eurovision3.feedroom.com/index.jsp?auto_band=x&amp;amp;rf=sv&amp;amp;fr_story=375f4f44790e87faf028f0afa72cda648eb5fb65&amp;amp;skin=showcase" title=""&gt;watch it yourself&lt;/a&gt;. See what strings it pulls for you. How it makes you think. What moral you get out of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second talk was by Prof. Dr. Peter Agre (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Agre" title=""&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/LaureateDetails.AxCMS?UserID=6746" title=""&gt;Lindau biography&lt;/a&gt;). This was definitely something different (&lt;a href="http://eurovision3.feedroom.com/index.jsp?auto_band=x&amp;amp;rf=sv&amp;amp;fr_story=87da081af7bb4bbb4662b44ef501e4f92b531ddb&amp;amp;skin=showcase" title=""&gt;watch his talk here&lt;/a&gt;). After all these talks about chemistry, and several on the science of climate change, Agre decided to do something different - remind us what this is all about. His talk was essentially a vacation slide-show of his four camping/canoeing trips in the Arctic areas of Canada and Alaska. But every shot was breathtakingly beautiful. And every now and then, a picture would remind us how fragile those seemingly harsh environments are and how strongly susceptible they are to climate change. Others used numbers and graphs to issue warnings about the necessity for quick response to the climate issue. Agre used powerful imagery to appeal to our emotions instead - not just how it all works, but what is it that we are trying to preserve and protect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/lindau_nobel_conference_-_wedn.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/wBIpYCf5Wa0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246457671645"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=547">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6798366d663f80ae</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">Human Subjects as Political Pawns</title><published>2009-07-01T13:51:52Z</published><updated>2009-07-01T13:51:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=547" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;When it comes to “alternative medicine” trials, it seems that the NIH is willing to experiment on people in ways that would be unthinkable for real biomedical research. The federal Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) has posted a preliminary &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/detrm_letrs/YR09/may09b.pdf"&gt;determination letter&lt;/a&gt;, dated May 27, 2009, addressing some of the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18596934?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;charges we had made&lt;/a&gt; against the politics-driven NIH Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a remarkably damning statement, particularly regarding an NIH study. That is, it found—or the recipients admitted—that each of several charges was valid. Among these are misleading statements and unstated risks in the consent form, and the embarrassing backgrounds of TACT investigators. According to the determination letter,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…investigations revealed multiple instances of substandard practices, insurance fraud, and felony activity on the part of investigators.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the OHRP appears willing to let the TACT continue if it will ‘take corrective actions’. Regarding investigators who are felons, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While concerning, these things do not automatically preclude an investigator from participating in research…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recommend that the IRBs that reviewed this research re-examine the processes for evaluating study investigators to determine they are obtaining sufficient site and investigator information that is adequate to comply with HHS regulations…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As disturbing as that recommendation sounds, the OHRP can only regulate what it has statutory authority to regulate. It regulates institutions, not investigators and not IRBs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, however, remain concerned that the TACT protocols and investigators did not provide accurate statements to the relevant IRBs in the first place. Wouldn’t such information have been important, not only for IRB deliberations, but for informed discussions with potential experimental subjects? From the determination letter, it sounds as though the OHRP cannot insist that the TACT address such inconvenient questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of our most important charges are either not mentioned (e.g., a tainted NIH scientific review committee, investigators promoting ‘chelation therapy’ during the study in violation of federal code, a tainted Data Safety and Monitoring Board, and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=132"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that incompetent investigators have contributed to at least two deaths in the trial) or were deferred to the FDA. Presumably, there is more to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We contended that if the TACT had been accurately represented in 2001-2003, no competent IRB or scientific review committee would have approved it. The OHRP determination letter implicitly raises this question: how could any IRB, after discovering the multitude of misrepresentations that were the basis for the study’s original approval, now allow it to continue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Robert Huber: Intracellular protein degradation and its control&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was a disaster. Not because it wasn't good, because it was; lots of fine, detailed science on the regulation of proteases by various mechanisms, with a discussion of the structure and function of proteasomes, accompanied by beautiful mandalas of protein structure. No, the problem was that this listener's jet lag has been causing some wild precession of my internal clocks, and a quarter of the way through this talk all systems were shutting down while announcing that it was the middle of the night, and I really couldn't cope. I'm going to have to look up some of his papers when I get home, though.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Walter Kohn: An Earth Powered Predominantly by Solar and Wind Energy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kohn has made a documentary to illustrate the power of solar energy. It was very basic, a bit silly — John Cleese narrates it — but might be useful in educating the pubic. He showed excerpts from it, and while it was nice, it didn&amp;#39;t fire me up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peter Agre: Canoeing in the Arctic, a Scientist´s Perspective&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a bit strange. We've had all these science talks on global warming, so Agre decided to just show us what we stand to lose, and showed us photos of his vacations on canoeing trips in Canada and Alaska. They were gorgeous photos, but please don't show me your photo album when I'm crashing hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my new and revised plan is to take a nap this afternoon and try to recharge a bit. I really must be alert for tomorrow's session with Shimomura, Chalfie, and Tsien, which are the talks I was most anticipating. There's also a curious talk by Werner Arber on something called &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/AbstractDetails.AxCMS?AbstractID=329"&gt;Molecular Darwinism&lt;/a&gt; which has my skeptical genes tingling; I've got to see what kinds of evidence he provides for that.

&lt;p&gt;She's the CBS reporter who can really bring home the crazy when it comes to vaccines and autism, laying down some serious crankery (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/antivaccination_crankery_on_the_cbs_news_1.php"&gt;complete with many logical fallacies&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/more_execrable_journalism_about_vaccines.php"&gt;hit pieces on Dr. Paul Offit&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, at times she gives Mike Adams a run for his money when it comes to laying down the pseudoscience and crankery. Worse, she &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/sharyl_attkisson_of_cbs_and_generation_r.php"&gt;appears to be in bed&lt;/a&gt; with at least one of the bloggers at the antivaccine propaganda blog Age of Autism for the purpose of bringing antivaccination lunacy to the masses by assisting them in smearing &lt;a href="http://www.voicesforvaccines.org/"&gt;Voices for Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, aside from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/investigative_reporter_steve_wilson_of_w.php"&gt;Steve Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, I can't recall a reporter for a mainstream news outlet who regularly sides with the anti-vaccine movement and helps them promote their propaganda, and the bad thing is that she's national.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to be honest. I didn't know if this was just a single blind spot on Attkisson's part. There are many people who appear perfectly reasonable--and, in fact, are perfectly reasonable in most areas--but have a major blind spot in just one area. On the other hand, the principle of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/06/crank_magnetism_1.php"&gt;crank magnetism&lt;/a&gt; observes that people who are prone to one area of pseudoscience and crankery are very often attracted to other areas of pseudoscience and crankery. The reason is that they have no mental filter. The same defects in their reasoning and critical thinking abilities that lead them to fall for one form of woo leave them open to many forms of woo. So, is Attkisson prone to crank magnetism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You betcha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She's back &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/29/cbsnews_investigates/main5123621.shtml"&gt;repeating bad science&lt;/a&gt; that purports to have found that aluminum containing antiperspirants cause cancer. It's a bad, bad, bad report. In fact, it's as bad as anything Attkisson's ever written about vaccines. (Well, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/antivaccination_crankery_on_the_cbs_news_1.php"&gt;almost as bad&lt;/a&gt;.)

&lt;p&gt;Now c’mon, that’s pretty good. It looks a &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; lot more like Michael Jackson than pretty much any Jesus sighting.

And after 99 monthly columns of exploring such topics (this is Opus 100), I conclude that I’m a skeptic not because I do not want to believe but because I want to know. I believe that the truth is out there. But how can we tell the difference between what we would like to be true and what is actually true? The answer is science. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science begins with the null hypothesis, which assumes that the claim under investigation is not true until demonstrated otherwise....Failure to reject the null hypothesis does not make the claim false, and, conversely, rejecting the null hypothesis is not a warranty on truth. Nevertheless, the scientific method is the best tool ever devised to discriminate between true and false patterns, to distinguish between reality and fantasy, and to detect baloney. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The null hypothesis means that the burden of proof is on the person asserting a positive claim, not on the skeptics to disprove it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.michaelshermer.com/2009/07/i-want-to-believe/"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Now compare what he wrote to &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/06/one-of-surprising-discoveries-of-modern.html"&gt;what I wrote here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-1862476714207887400?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Today I will focus on chiropractic for back pain and similar indications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manipulative Therapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence to support the very narrow indication of spinal manipulation for the symptomatic management of acute uncomplicated lower back strain. The good news for chiropractors is that this is a very common condition and does not respond well to conventional management - actually all treatments: medical management, physical therapy, manipulation, and even just patient education, appear to be equally and quite modestly effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a body of clinical studies that are relevant to the question of manipulation for lower back strain. A review of this research was published in 1989 by the RAND corporation, an independent research group that put together a panel of both physicians and chiropractors to review the available research on manipulative therapy. They concluded that evidence from 22 studies supported the use of manipulative therapy for acute uncomplicated lower back pain (again - no real pinched nerves).  It is important to understand, however, that they were referring to manipulative therapy, not chiropractic.  In fact only 4 of the 22 studies mentioned included chiropractors. In the other studies the manipulative therapy was performed by physicians and physical therapists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RAND study went on to enumerate a long list of situations in which spinal manipulation should not be performed, including evidence of nerve root compression. Other contraindications include a greater than 6 month duration, X-ray or clinical evidence of malignancy, failure to respond to manipulation or a history of not responding to manipulation, among others.  They also concluded that there was insufficient evidence to justify the use of manipulation for most forms of chronic lower back pain. The study in no way supported chiropractic subluxation theory or the scope of chiropractic practice. Nor did it make any comparison between manipulation and other forms of treatment for low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the popular confusion of chiropractic with manipulative therapy, and the use of manipulation for symptomatic treatment vs the pseudoscientific treatment of subluxations and innate intelligence - some chiropractors were able to exploit this and other positive studies of manipulation to advertise that “chiropractic works” as a way of promoting chiropractic treatments that have nothing to do with manipulation for lower back pain. The number of misrepresentations prompted Paul G. Shekelle, MD, MPH of the RAND corp. who designed the study &lt;a href="http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9283062_ITM"&gt;to write&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through RAND’s process of monitoring the popular media, we have become aware of numerous instances where our results have been seriously misrepresented by chiropractors writing for their local paper or writing letters to the editor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been further studies since the 1989 review. The Meade study, which was published in the British Medical Journal in 1990, concluded that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For patients with low back pain in whom manipulation is not contraindicated, chiropractic almost certainly confers worthwhile long-term benefit in comparison with hospital outpatient management.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some serious limitations of this study, however. The two treatment groups were not comparable, because the chiropractic group received 44% more treatment (costing 50% more) over twice as long a period of time and in a private setting.  The outpatient physical therapy group was part of the National Health Service, and were noted to have limited resources and could not treat their patients in the same fashion that a private practitioner could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, patients entered into the study were put through a medical screening process including X-rays that were interpreted by hospital radiologists. Between 25 and 50% of patients entering the study were eliminated because they were felt to have contraindications to manipulation.  This fact alone makes it impossible to accurately apply the results of this study to the way chiropractic is practiced in the real world, where there is rarely independent radiological review or other medical screening. Of course, practices vary greatly, and some chiropractors do collaborate with physicians for medical screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large 1998 study compared chiropractic to physical therapy to a third group that only received an informational booklet. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9761803?dopt=Abstract"&gt;The study concluded&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients with low back pain, the McKenzie method of physical therapy and chiropractic manipulation had similar effects and costs, and patients receiving these treatments had only marginally better outcomes than those receiving the minimal intervention of an educational booklet. Whether the limited benefits of these treatments are worth the additional costs is open to question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safety of manipulative therapy has not been adequately established. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11239743?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=5&amp;amp;log$=relatedreviews&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;This 2001 review concludes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most valid studies suggest that about half of all patients will experience adverse events after chiropractic SM. These events are usually mild and transient. No reliable data exist about the incidence of serious adverse events. These data indicate that mild and transient adverse events seem to be frequent. Serious adverse events are probably rare but their incidence can only be estimated at present. Further prospective investigations are needed to define their incidence more closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15125860?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=4&amp;amp;log$=relatedreviews&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;A 2004 review &lt;/a&gt;of spinal manipulation and mobilizing for acute and chronic back and neck pain concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data synthesis suggests that recommendations can be made with some confidence regarding the use of SMT and/or MOB as a viable option for the treatment of both low back pain and NP (neck pain). There have been few high-quality trials distinguishing between acute and chronic patients, and most are limited to shorter-term follow-up. Future trials should examine well-defined subgroups of patients, further address the value of SMT and MOB for acute patients, establish optimal number of treatment visits and consider the cost-effectiveness of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research which has been done into the effectiveness of manipulative therapy can best be summarized as suggesting a role for spinal manipulation in the symptomatic treatment of uncomplicated low back pain, provided adequate medical screening is performed. This includes manipulation by some chiropractors, or by physical therapists, physiatrists and others. Manipulation is no more effective, and is often more expensive than, other forms of treatment - such as best medical management or simple physical therapy with good home back care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Uses of Chiropractic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many chiropractors also use spinal manipulation for other indications, without evidence to support their safety and effectiveness. For example, neck manipulation for headache is not uncommon, despite a lack of adequate evidence for efficacy. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9798179?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=3&amp;amp;log$=relatedarticles&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;The study most often cited&lt;/a&gt; by chiropractors to support manipulation for migraine compared neck manipulation to 25mg of Elavil for 8 weeks vs combined therapy and found no difference in outcome. They conclude from this that neck manipulation works as well as medical management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, 25mg of Elavil is too low a dose for most patients to response, and the duration of treatment before a response is typically seen is 6-8 weeks. Often a significant response is only seen after several months, and after increasing the dose to between 50-100mg per day. In other words, they used an inadequate control - a treatment that would not be expected to work. Therefore, the more reasonable conclusion to reach from this study is that chiropractic manipulation does not work for migraine. Also, the lack of any additive effect is consistent with pure placebo response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15266458?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=5&amp;amp;log$=relatedreviews&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;Cochrane review from 2004&lt;/a&gt; of physical treatments for headaches, including manipulation, concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of non-invasive physical treatments require further research using scientifically rigorous methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Requires further research” means that there is no currently proven benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With neck manipulation there is also a concern for serious risk. Although the statistical risk is low, there are &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12743225?ordinalpos=10&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;reported cases of stroke&lt;/a&gt; and even death following neck manipulation, resulting from arterial dissection - a tear in an artery in the neck. There is insufficient evidence to conclude firmly what the risk is, but given the soft evidence for a benefit for neck manipulation even a small chance of a serious side effect like stroke is likely not justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many chiropractors also offer “maintenance therapy” - regular visits for manipulation to prevent disease or symptoms. There is no evidence and no biological plausibility to justify maintenance chiropractic manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18280103?ordinalpos=13&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;critical summary by Edzard Ernst&lt;/a&gt;, in my opinion, is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core concepts of chiropractic, subluxation and spinal manipulation, are not based on sound science. Back and neck pain are the domains of chiropractic but many chiropractors treat conditions other than musculoskeletal problems. With the possible exception of back pain, chiropractic spinal manipulation has not been shown to be effective for any medical condition. Manipulation is associated with frequent mild adverse effects and with serious complications of unknown incidence. Its cost-effectiveness has not been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt. The concepts of chiropractic are not based on solid science and its therapeutic value has not been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chiropractic profession has its roots firmly planted in pure pseudoscience, but despite this there happens to be a plausible role for spinal manipulation for the limited indication of uncomplicated lower back strain. Further research is needed to explore subgroups, cost effectiveness, safety, and whether or not there is any legitimate role for neck manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due, it seems, to the personality and personal beliefs of B.J. Palmer, the chiropractic profession has had an ongoing hostile relationship with mainstream scientific medicine. This is unfortunate. Also, the profession has expanded its philosophy and practice to the point that there are now many separate professions all practicing under the banner of chiropractic, leading to much public confusion and poor to nonexistent maintenance of a standard of care within chiropractic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chiropractic profession is in need of serious reform. They are unlikely to accept the recommendations of an outsider like myself, but I am going to give them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the profession needs to clean house. Much like the Flexner report did a century ago for medicine - closing most medical school because they were substandard, the chiropractic profession needs to go through a similar purging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- This means rejecting completely subluxation theory, including the notion of innate intelligence and the existence of mysterious chiropractic subluxations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Along with subluxation theory, chiropractors should condemn the use of manipulative therapy to treat medical conditions and diseases, including asthma, ear infections, ulcers, migraines, and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- The chiropractic profession should endorse the principles of science-based medicine and dedicate themselves to high standards of science and transparency. This includes subjecting their treatments to more clinical research, changing their practice based upon the evidence, exploring the risks as well as the benefits of their own treatments, and internally policing their practitioners in order to maintain an adequate standard of care across their profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Chiropractors should seek to align themselves with other science-based professions. This includes endorsing science-based public health measures, like immunization. They should not foster hostility toward science-based practitioners, and they should refer patients to other specialists when appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Chiropractors should not seek to expand their scope of practice beyond their training and ability. They should not present themselves as primary care providers, nor lobby for regulations to allow them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Chiropractors can thrive as a health-care profession as experts in back care and physical medicine. This would provide them with a sufficiently broad scope of practice to be viable, in an area where there is a great need for expertise and symptomatic management. In fact, many science-based chiropractors do just fine within this scope, and provide a best-practice model for their profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- The chiropractic profession should purge from their training and practice modalities other than spinal manipulation that are pseudoscientific - including iridology, applied kinesiology, homeopathy, and nutritional pseudoscience. Of course, the medical profession now needs to do this too, as pseudoscience has infiltrated mainstream medicine, but that is a separate article. Also, the percentage of chiropractors using such methods is far greater than within mainstream medicine, and is therefore much more of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Chiropractic colleges should change their curriculum so that they are more uniform and more in line with modern scientific concepts and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I harbor no illusions that anything like what I have described above will happen anytime soon, if ever. I hold out a little hope, as there is a small minority of chiropractors who also endorse what I have outlined and are trying to reform their profession from within. I wish them well, and I eagerly await the day that I can feel comfortable with the average chiropractor as an allied science-based health professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, in my opinion, public criticism of pseudoscientific claims and practices within chiropractic is the only ethical response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Most popular diets are based upon the premise that the kinds of foods one eats is a dominant factor in determining weight - low carb vs low fat, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, there is a growing body of scientific evidence, approaching consensus, that by far the dominant factor in weight control is the amount of calories one consumes, not the form in which those calories come. The best science-based nutritional advice for weight control seems to be - exercise regularly and practice portion control. For other health concerns, like heart health and avoiding diabetes - eat a well-balanced diet and get more of your calories from plants than animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it in a nutshell, but it is hard to sustain a multi-billion dollar weight loss and self-help industry with such simple advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, it is human nature to prefer quick fixes and easy answers to tough love. Weight control is not complex, but it turns out to be very difficult for most people. Will power is not enough for 95% of the population. We can hardly blame people for what appears to be almost universal human traits. As a public health issue, approaches to obesity are not going to be found in scare tactics and weight loss schemes. The culture needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of that cultural change, in my opinion, is getting away from the very notion that the problem is caused by “bad foods”. The latest target of this approach is high fructose corn syrup (HFCS).   As reported by &lt;a href="http://blogs.consumerreports.org/health/2008/10/high-fructose-c.html"&gt;Consumer Reports:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, researchers from the Louisiana State University and University of North Carolina published a paper that theorized that high-fructose corn syrup in beverages could play a role in the obesity epidemic. They looked at the correlation between the 1,000 percent increase in high-fructose corn syrup consumption between 1970 and 1990, and a correlating rise in obesity rates. Because of the way the body metabolizes fructose from beverages, the researchers argued, it may play a role in the obesity epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this was a classic example of confusing correlation with causation.  The rising rate of obesity correlates with an overall increase in calories, and there is no evidence to implicate any particular source of calories as being the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple chemistry helps put HFCS into some perspective. Table sugar is sucrose, which is a combination of fructose and glucose - two common simple sugars. Corn syrup is mainly glucose, but HFCS is manufactured to have about 50% fructose and 50% glucose - the same ratio as sucrose or table sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are metabolic differences between fructose and glucose. Often studies showing that pure fructose can alter sugar and fat metabolism are presented as evidence against HFCS, missing the point that the ratio of fructose to glucose in the American diet has not changed with the introduction of HFCS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent review of the literature published in the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19386822?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=4&amp;amp;log$=relatedarticles&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, regarding the association of HFCS and obesity, concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel concluded that evidence from ecological studies linking HFCS consumption with rising BMI rates is unreliable. Unlike some prominent epidemiologists, the expert panel concluded that the evidence from epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials is inconclusive. They also noted that there were inadequate data available that distinguish between HFCS consumption and sucrose consumption with respect to weight gain. Further, they acknowledged that while the sweetener level and type have changed over time, the fructose:glucose ratio in the U.S. food supply has remained the same for 50 y. Finally, the panel concluded that HCFS did not contribute to weight gain any differently than other energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words - HCFS is not the boogeyman. It is a distraction from the real issue - an increase in overall caloric intake. There may also have been a rise in total sugar intake, but the types of sugars have not changed. A diet with a large proportion of simple sugars is not a good idea because such a diet is also likely to contain too many calories, and high sugar intake increases the risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, the corn lobby is hard at work promoting this information - that HFCS is not the bad guy. But don’t make the mistake of assuming that because some information is in line with the interests of a specific corporation or industry that means the information is false. Any such information is likely to have winners and losers, that doesn’t mean it’s a conspiracy of the winners. We could just as likely conclude that negative information about HFCS is a conspiracy of the sugar cane lobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does mean that we have to look for corporate interests in the published scientific data, and demand full disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest. There doesn’t appear to be any in the literature I reviewed - it seems there is a broad based consensus, not just corporate shills. I’m sure this won’t stop some from accusing me of being part of the corn lobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that HFCS is sugar. It is high calorie and has no other nutritional value other than as fuel. It should be consumed, like all sugars, in moderation. People should be aware that HFCS = sugar, and not be confused by this on food labeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we will not impact the rise in obesity by treating HFCS as the culprit, or by replacing it with other sugar-based sweeteners.  We need more evidence-based public health measures to fight obesity - making healthy choices easier, making portion control easier, and disclosing calories on menus so that people know how many calories they are consuming. We don’t need boogeyman scare tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, this is Big Chemistry day, and I'm struggling to keep up with the unfamiliar. I need more biology for it all to make sense!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rudolph Marcus: From 'On Water' and enzyme caalysis to single molecules and quantum dots. Theory and experiment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was afraid of this. This Lindau conference has a primary focus on chemistry, and I am not a chemist…and I just knew there would be a talk or two at which I would be all at sea, and that was the case in Marcus&amp;#39;s talk, which was all hardcore chemistry. I got the general gist — he&amp;#39;s making an argument that you need both a solid grounding in theory in order to carry out computational chemistry, which seemed fairly obvious to me — but I confess that his discussion of the details of on-water catalysis, single molecule enzyme catalysis, and quantum dots lost me, through no fault of his. I don&amp;#39;t have the background to follow the context of the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kurt Wüthrich: Structural genomics — exploring the protein universe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was more of that tricky chemistry stuff, but at least it was related to biology. Wüthrich studies 3D protein structures, specializing in using NMR of proteins in solution. He fave a little background, and talked especially about his particular interest in hemoglobin, an interest that continues — he currently works at catching EPO doping in athletes. The more interesting part of the work is his current contributions to analyzing the structure of proteins in the genome. He made the point that there are currently over 6 million gene sequences tucked away in databases, but we know the the 3D structure of only about 50,000 of them. He&amp;#39;s part of a very large research consortium that is trying to fill in the gaps with high throughput, automated techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Harold Kroto: Science, society and sustainability&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever heard a Kroto talk, you know it is pretty much indescribable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did present all of chemistry in 30 seconds, but much of it was about about science education, science's role in society, and how science is going to be necessary to save the world. There was a good strong bit of promotion of atheism (he's one of us!), and an amusing tour of the Creation "Museum", which he visited recently. All I can recommend is that you keep an eye on the &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/"&gt;Lindau site&lt;/a&gt; — they will make the lectures available online at some time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/wednesday_morning_at_lindau.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/GodBlQwVUKc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246440928543"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/old_fossil_disproves_darwin.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f5f1f969168a59ce</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Old fossil "disproves" Darwin!</title><published>2009-07-01T10:17:50Z</published><updated>2009-07-01T10:17:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/v3qUndkUa50/old_fossil_disproves_darwin.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/old_fossil_disproves_darwin.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The old fossil is &lt;a href="http://www.theusdaily.com/articles/viewopiarticle.jsp?id=2278&amp;amp;type=Opinion"&gt;Pat Buchanan&lt;/a&gt;, who has published a freakishly antiquated diatribe against Darwin.

Windchy. You can get an idea of Windchy's level of scholarship by this quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Darwinism has proven "disastrous theory" is indisputable.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Karl Marx loved Darwinism," writes Windchy. "To him, survival of the fittest as the source of progress justified violence in bringing about social and political change, in other words, the revolution."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Darwin suits my purpose," Marx wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/strangerfruit/2008/01/darwin_and_marx.php"&gt;John Lynch has rebutted this claim&lt;/a&gt;; I rather doubt that Marx could love someone as bourgeois as Darwin, a prosperous landowner and investor, a fellow who thought his greatest success in life was his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/understanding_darwin_the_legac.php"&gt;talent as a businessman&lt;/a&gt;, and I can be fairly confident that any affection would not have been returned. And please, don't even mention the false claim that &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA002_2.html"&gt;Marx wanted to dedicate &lt;i&gt;Das Kapital&lt;/i&gt; to Darwin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not enough to link Darwin to Marx; Windchy also has to turn Hitler into a committed Darwinist. You'd think he'd stop to marvel at the idea that Darwin could have inspired two such antagonistic philosophies, but Windchy and Buchanan aren't quite that thoughtful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darwin suited Adolf Hitler's purposes, too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Although born to a Catholic family Hitler become a hard-eyed Darwinist who saw life as a constant struggle between the strong and the weak. His Darwinism was so extreme that he thought it would have been better for the world if the Muslims had won the eighth century battle of Tours, which stopped the Arabs' advance into France. Had the Christians lost, (Hitler) reasoned, Germanic people would have acquired a more warlike creed and, because of their natural superiority, would have become the leaders of an Islamic empire."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Charles Darwin also suited the purpose of the eugenicists and Herbert Spencer, who preached a survival-of-the-fittest social Darwinism to robber baron industrialists exploiting 19th-century immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For being a "hard-eyed Darwinist", Hitler certainly seems to have failed to make much use of the theory. Read &lt;i&gt;Mein Kampf&lt;/i&gt; and you will find &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; about Darwin or evolution, but you will find much about God. And don't his strange notions about an Aryan Islamic empire simply mark Hitler as a crazy crackpot, and say nothing at all about Darwin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do make some outrageous accusations against Darwin: he was a thief and a liar who stole his whole theory from Wallace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darwin, he demonstrates, stole his theory from Alfred Wallace, who had sent him a "completed formal paper on evolution by natural selection."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"All my originality ... will be smashed," wailed Darwin when he got Wallace's manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for their thesis, Darwin&amp;#39;s writings are preserved to an amazing degree — the history of his idea can be traced almost to the day. We know that he was putting together an outline of his theory within a few years of returning from the voyage of the &lt;i&gt;Beagle&lt;/i&gt;; we have an early draft of his thesis written in 1842, well before the contact with Wallace; we have his correspondence where he bounced these ideas off his colleagues. He didn't steal his theory at all, but had it well formulated before Wallace wrote his fateful letter, triggering him to finally publish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You only have to read &lt;a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A273&amp;amp;viewtype=text&amp;amp;pageseq=1"&gt;Wallace's own gracious account of his interactions with Darwin&lt;/a&gt; to see how false Windchy's claims are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion I would Only wish to add, that my connection with Darwin and his great work has helped to secure for my own writings on the same questions a full recognition by the press and the public; while my share in the origination and establishment of the theory of Natural Selection has usually been exaggerated. The one great result which I claim for my paper of 1858 is that it compelled Darwin to write and publish his Origin of Species without further delay. The reception of that work, and its effect upon the whole scientific world, prove that it appeared at the right moment; and it is probable that its influence would have been less widespread had it been delayed several years, and had then appeared, as he intended, in several bulky volumes embodying the whole mass of facts he had collected in its support. Such a work would have appealed to the initiated few only, whereas the smaller volume actually written was read and understood by the educated classes throughout the civilised world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's another case where Windchy/Buchanan accuse Darwin of lying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darwin also lied in "The Origin of Species" about believing in a Creator. By 1859, he was a confirmed agnostic and so admitted in his posthumous autobiography, which was censored by his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He doesn't claim to believe in a Creator in the &lt;i&gt;Origin&lt;/i&gt;. There is a brief mention of the possibility of a Creator initiating the universe in later editions of the book, but it's more compatible with a deistic view than anything. He was an unbeliever in any specific religious doctrine, but that does not make him at all hypocritical to have considered the possibility of a creator beginning the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much more can Buchanan get wrong? How about everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darwin's examples of natural selection -- such as the giraffe acquiring its long neck to reach ever higher into the trees for the leaves upon which it fed to survive -- have been debunked. Giraffes eat grass and bushes. And if, as Darwin claimed, inches meant life or death, how did female giraffes, two or three feet shorter, survive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most animals, they&amp;#39;ll eat whatever is physiologically advantageous…but they prefer the leaves and shoots of acacia trees, where a long neck to reach the branches is advantageous. If you actually read the &lt;i&gt;Origin&lt;/i&gt;, Darwin proposes several advantages of the long neck: for feeding, but also for observing predators, for combat, and as part of the defensive strategy of growing to large body size, and he uses the giraffe as an example of  a general principle: "The preservation of each species can rarely be determined by any one advantage, but by the union of all, great and small."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this has been debunked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Buchanan can do is a standard Gish Gallop, next bringing up canards like &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC001.html"&gt;Piltdown Man&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC002.html"&gt;Nebraska Man&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC201_1.html"&gt;typically distorted version of punctuated equilibrium&lt;/a&gt;. It's quite a performance, and it really takes a lot of work to distill stupid down to something quite as concentrated as what Buchanan presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This man actually ran for president? There are times I have to stand appalled at the lack of discrimination in our political process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a fundamental difference in Japanese workmanship---to pull with control rather than push with force." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quote is from a favorite book of mind, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xP5XQMXHw-sC&amp;amp;dq=obasan+joy+kogawa&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=bn&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=eNlIStTROY7Ctwf6mvWuAg&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=5"&gt;Obasan&lt;/a&gt; (1981) by Joy Kogawa. It's a novel about Japanese-Canadian Naomi Nakane and her family during and after World War II. It's written in language that is at times sparse and lyrical, poetic, and what's said is just as important as what is not, especially about what happened to Naomi's mother when she goes back to Nagasaki. "Pull[ing] with control rather than push[ing] with force" could describe how Naomi gradually finds out what really happened--is is tragic---to her mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Pull[ing] with control rather than push[ing] with force" comes close to describing how we try to help Charlie learn, grow and move on in a world that's not inclined to accommodate to his needs. Sometimes, we pull too much, and maybe even (without meaning to) push Charlie too far and too much &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_principle_of_doubt"&gt;as on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;. And then, we remind ourselves how much Charlie and we learn from not always doing the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_same_old_same_old"&gt;same old same old&lt;/a&gt; and trying something different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday something happened for the first time ever: Charlie and I went on a bike ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bike running has been strictly a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/we_ride_bikes_together"&gt;Charlie and dad thing&lt;/a&gt;. I rode a bike everywhere (even in the snow) when I was in grad school, but have been (1) very out of practice and (2) too nervous about Charlie. After a memorable (infamous) moment when Jim told me to let go of 6-year-old Charlie's bike and I couldn't let go and I ended up pulling him and the bike over on top of me, it has been felt, Jim handles the bike rides. Charlie has become so used to this that, when I tried to tail the two of them a few months ago (I have inherited Charlie's old yellow bikes), Charlie was unnerved and I betook myself on my own route around the neighborhood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday around 1.30pm Charlie put on his bike helmet, said he wanted to ride bikes, and went to get his bike.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I explained that Jim was at work in New York and would be back in a few hours. Charlie first got out Jim's bike and arranged both his own and his dad's bikes nicely about two feet away from the curb, ready for riding action. After seeing how close a few cars came to the bikes, I explained to Charlie that I had to move them closer to the sidewalk. And, that Jim was not coming home for some time. I got out the yellow bike and talked about us doing a short ride, all while knowing, that's not really going to be possible: Bike rides mean some very specific things to Charlie one being, the route.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I knew it, he had gotten me Jim's bike helmet and was smiling when I shut the door and left a note for his &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/in_the_community"&gt;sitter&lt;/a&gt;, who was to come at 2.30pm. Then Charlie was astride his bike and heading down the street and so was I and away we went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until we got to a fairly busy intersection, I felt a sense of ease skimming down the street, Charlie in front of me. As we neared the intersection, and he started to veer into the middle of the street, I was more than reminded of why I'm so grateful that Jim takes Charlie on these rides. Cars were turning, signalling, speeding up, slowing down, honking. I called out to Charlie to stop at the sign (he did) and go left (he did) and we went down some side streets, the breeze to our backs. We passed a street that would bring us in a nice circle back home if we made a left onto it: Charlie kept going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And going and going, till we hit an ever busier intersection. He stopped and, on seeing me getting off my bike, did too. "This way," he said and pointed to the right. Instantly images of all the streets, and all the cars and SUVs and trucks, we'd have to ride by en route to various destinations "this way" (a playground we once visited a lot, a bridge Jim and Charlie habitually ride over) filled my mind. Without Jim's finely honed sense of how to guide Charlie in the streets and direct traffic, I knew we could be in some very sticky (and dangerous) situations. Plus, the sitter was probably at our house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told Charlie I needed to call her; of course, I didn't have her number saved on my phone. I thought and kept my words minimal, and to the point: &lt;em&gt;She was waiting at our house. Dad would be home very soon and take him on ride. I was just not able to do it.&lt;/em&gt;  Charlie was very consternated [understatement]. Thinking he's going one way and then being told he has to turn around, back track, is a transition that's especially difficult for him to negotiate his way through. He cried out and grasped the handlebars tighter, shook them, and started to get back on his bike. A trio of tweenage girls walked down the street as Charlie sounded his distress. Then, looking very worried, he pulled himself onto his bike and turned left, towards home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pedaled really really fast and fortunately we only had to go a few blocks before he turned left on our street. I spotted the sitter's car and then Charlie had stopped and put down the kickstand, and said "hi" as he walked past the sitter.  He was on edge for a half-hour but calming after getting himself a couple of glasses of water and sitting on the old blue couch. He played with his Legos while the sitter tried her hand at some magnet blocks. Jim came back around 4.30pm and he and Charlie were off &lt;i&gt;likethat&lt;/i&gt;. They rode far over the bridge that Charlie had in mind with me, and then beyond, per Charlie's wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May I just keep remembering the power of a patient, gentle push.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246434413918"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3684">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fd0053a9c5b661ad</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="anti-vaccine lunacy"/><category term="autism"/><category term="Autism Speaks"/><category term="Eric London"/><category term="vaccines"/><title type="html">‘Autism Speaks’ loses another one</title><published>2009-07-01T07:26:40Z</published><updated>2009-07-01T07:26:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/01/autism-speaks-loses-another-one/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="vaccine1" src="http://skepacabra.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/vaccine1.jpg?w=184&amp;amp;h=137" alt="vaccine1" width="184" height="137"&gt;I’ve &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/02/26/david-kirby-conspires-with-autism-speaks/"&gt;blogged before about Alison Singer&lt;/a&gt;, the high-ranking official at Autism Speaks who resigned due to her frustration with her organization’s pandering to the pseudo-scientific, anti-vaccine crowd. And &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/18/autism-science-foundation-launched/"&gt;I’ve also blogged about her more recent founding of the Autism Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, devoted to helping real autism research, and about &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/05/28/welcoming-the-autism-science-foundation-to-wordpress/"&gt;their new blog on WordPress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well now the Autism Science Foundation blog  is reporting that another key official from Autism Speaks, &lt;a href="http://autismsciencefoundation.wordpress.com/2009/06/30/naar-founder-eric-london-resigns-from-autism-speaks-citing-disagreement-over-autismvaccine-research/"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;Dr. Eric London,&lt;/span&gt; has left the organization for similar reasons&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;Dr. Eric London has announced his resignation from the Autism Speaks Scientific Affairs Committee.  London is the Director of the Autism Treatment Laboratory at the New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities. He is also Chief Scientific Advisor of the New York State Autism Consortium and a member of the Autism Science Foundation’s Scientific Advisory Board.  He is the co-founder of the National Alliance for Autism Research (NAAR). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an excerpt from his resignation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;However, the pivotal issue compelling my decision is the position which Autism Speaks is taking concerning vaccinations. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The arguments which Dr. Dawson and others assert– that the parents need even further assurances and there might be rare cases of “biologically plausible” vaccine involvement –are misleading and disingenuous. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Through its website and other communications, Autism Speaks has been influential and contributory in encouraging parents’ doubts. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;By preferentially investing and advocating for the use of limited financial resources on the “biological plausibility” argument, the organization is adversely impacting the advancement of autism research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;Recent reports have documented significant outbreaks of measles and other infectious diseases which could have been controlled and even eradicated. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The lowering of the vaccination rate has already led to deaths. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;If Autism Speaks’ misguided stance continues, there will be more deaths and potentially the loss of herd immunity which would result in serious outbreaks of otherwise preventable disease. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;I further fear that if and when herd immunity is lost, there may be a societal backlash against the autism community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In my role as an Autism Speaks Scientific Affairs Committee member, I would be lending credibility to an organization whose scientific agenda and positions I can no longer ethically support. Please accept my resignation, effective immediately.  &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applaud Dr. London’s decision. His departure itself will no doubt hurt the credibility of the anti-vaccinations but now hopefully he’ll also be actively promoting good science while actively challenging their claims. So far Age of Autism hasn’t started their inevitable smear campaign against Dr. London, but I surmise as I write this blog, they’re working feaverishly through on how to spin this story.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, the definition of “sorcerer” in this case includes your meat-and-potatoes atrologers and soothsayers in addition to people with beards and pointy hats and comprehensive knowledge of ancient elven languages. But really, that just makes this statistic even more depressing. So what are eleven million Italians paying sorcerers to help them with? Surprisingly, magic broom-related housework is nowhere on the list. 46% seek the advice of charlatans to mend their broken hearts. 25% want to know about health problems, 22% of consultations have to do with violence (not clear if this means paying to attack people with lightning spells, which would be amazing), and 7% are having trouble at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/13/54-of-icelanders-dont-deny-the-existence-of-elves/"&gt;the school in Iceland that teaches about elves because 54% of Icelanders believe in elves&lt;/a&gt;. It’s just another example of how foreign religions seem particularly goofy to us even when there is nothing that is any more nutty about their beliefs than the ones that permeate our own culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tbn3.google.com/images?q=tbn:GFOH-SlyyuB9OM:http://www.duckstudios.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/harry-potter.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://tbn3.google.com/images?q=tbn:GFOH-SlyyuB9OM:http://www.duckstudios.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/harry-potter.jpg" alt="" width="128" height="125"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;MIRACLES – A woman in Annapolis had malignant tumors in her lungs, liver, stomach, and chest. Fortunately, she got treated with the best modern medicine has to offer at Johns Hopkins Hospital and no longer has the tumors. Unfortunately, however,&lt;a href="http://www.amateurscientist.org/2009/06/miracle-of-medicine.html"&gt; it’s a dead 19th century priest who’s getting all the credit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to seeking medical attention from trained professionals on the cutting edge of their field, Heibel also prayed to the disembodied spirit of 19th century Maryland priest Francis X. Seelos, whose bone fragment she wears in a pendant around her neck. Yes, this is pretty creepy. And it’s also a bit of a tragedy, since the ghost of Seelos is now taking the credit for all the hard work of Heibel’s doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, despite being dead, Seelos still has one more “miracle” to perform to be officially canonized as a Catholic saint. So of course this means the Catholic investigators are on the case to determine if this is a fake miracle or, you know, one of those “real” miracles we hear so much about. Ugh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great time at the NN drinks last night, despite there &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/maxine/blog"&gt;being&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/scurry/blog"&gt;only&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/franknorman/blog"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/UE19877E8/blog"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/hubs/london/blog"&gt;regulars&lt;/a&gt; there; and the magnificent &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/tomorrows-table/"&gt;Pamela Ronald&lt;/a&gt;. Pamela said something nice about a certain &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/2008/09/14/on-depression%E2%80%94a-personal-perspective"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; last year, without realizing that was me, which is, actually, the kind of fame that appeals to me. People know what I’ve done without associating it with the mental-looking redhead tripping over his own shadow and drinking Theakstons out of plastic cups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Apparently I'm the next @stephenfry sez @rpg7twit. Big, brain size of planet, yes. Gay, famous, no.&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/cromercrox/status/2416285563"&gt;@cromercrox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we all (here at NN anyway) know &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/henrygee/blog"&gt;Henry Gee&lt;/a&gt; and what he looks like. But the rest of the world doesn’t. Which is a shame, especially as one of us is convinced that Henry Gee &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the next Stephen Fry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RT @rpg7twit Henry Gee, aka @cromercrox: the new @stephenfry ?&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a&gt;@kejames&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I urge you, retweet the next internet meme. And remember where you were on 1st July 2009, when first you realized that Henry Gee is the next Stephen Fry.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Richard Grant</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/posts.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/posts.rss</id><title type="html">Confessions of a (former) Lab Rat</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.nature.com/rpg/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246430803576"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3678">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cc6a41a6ec0e8105</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="athvertising"/><category term="Atheist Bus Campaign"/><category term="Keith Olbermann"/><category term="New York"/><category term="New York City Atheists"/><title type="html">Keith Olbermann disgraces himself again</title><published>2009-07-01T06:35:53Z</published><updated>2009-07-01T06:35:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/06/30/keith-olbermann-disgraces-himself-again/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jdlong.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/olbermann_worst.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://jdlong.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/olbermann_worst.jpg?w=250&amp;amp;h=187" alt="" width="250" height="187"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I used to like Keith Olbermann. I really did. What the hell happened? The guy really has become the Bill O’Reilly of the radical Left. Okay, he’s a little bit more interested in actual facts and fair, objective reporting than Bill-O, but &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/06/30/keith-olbermann-puts-anonymous-atheist-on-list-of-worst-persons/"&gt;as this clip shows&lt;/a&gt; (as well as his poorly conceived attack of British journalist Brian Deer earlier this year), he’s not interested in fair, objective reporting. In the clip linked above, Keith-O declares that the anonymous donor largely responsible for getting the &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/06/19/atheist-bus-campaign-stops-in-nyc/"&gt;Atheist Bus Campaign ads in NYC&lt;/a&gt; is the third worst person in the world. And why does Keith-O think they’re so terrible, presumably more terrible than Osama bin Laden, who didn’t make the list? Because of  the Keith-O’s perceived irony over the fact that they’re remaining anonymous while financially supporting an ad campaign that encourages atheists to come out of the closet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tonight’s worst persons in the world. The bronze: To the person who donated the scratch for ten thousand dollars worth of ads on the sides of buses in New York City, promoting atheism. They read, “You don’t have to believe in God to be a moral or ethical person.” The hope, from president Ken Bronstein of the group &lt;a href="http://www.nyc-atheists.org/"&gt;NYC Atheists&lt;/a&gt;, is to get people to stop hiding their non- belief — to stop hiding it. No complaint about the message — however, while Bronstein says, “We want to get atheists to come join us, to get out of the closet,” unfortunately the donor who made the ads possible is keeping his identity anonymous. (Contemptuous eye-roll.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So an atheist promoting a campaign to encourage other atheists to come out while choosing to remain anonymous yourself makes you a bad person? According to Keith-O, the answer apparently is not only YES, but it makes you the third worst person in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2009/06/atheists-and-the-closet.html"&gt;Greta Christina sums up the flaw in Keith-O’s logic quite well&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were doing a segment about an ad campaign designed to let gay people know that they weren’t alone and to encourage them to come out of the closet — and one of the major donors to the campaign wanted to remain anonymous — would you decry them as one of the worst persons in the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or would you understand that coming out as gay can — yes, still, even this day and age — be a hazardous enterprise? Would you understand that coming out can mean alienating family and friends, losing your job or your kids, getting beaten up or even killed? Would you understand that people have to come out on their own timetable, and that a person who wants to take action to support gay rights and gay visibility still might not be completely out of the closet? Would you understand that even gay people who are out to their families and friends and colleagues still might not want their name, and their gayness, splashed all over the national news?And if so, then why don’t you understand it about atheists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some realities about living as an atheist that you may not know about, Mr. Olbermann. Coming out as an atheist can have serious real-world consequences. Parents get &lt;a href="http://www.volokh.com/posts/1125342962.shtml"&gt;denied custody of their children&lt;/a&gt; for being atheists. People get &lt;a href="http://atheism.about.com/b/2007/09/25/loving-christians-vandalize-atheist-activists-home.htm"&gt;harassed and vandalized by their neighbors&lt;/a&gt; for being atheists. Teachers get &lt;a href="http://www.democracyforamerica.com/blog_posts/27752-texas-teacher-suspended-for-being-liberal-and-an-atheist"&gt;suspended for being atheists&lt;/a&gt;. Teenagers get &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Story?id=3164811&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;harassed and suspended from school&lt;/a&gt; for being atheists. Politicians &lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2008/10/anti-atheist-bigotry-in-the-senate-campaign.html"&gt;whip up anti-atheist fear&lt;/a&gt; to try to get elected. (And that’s just in the US. I’m not even talking about parts of the world where atheism is a crime, punishable by imprisonment or death.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s coming from someone who is both gay and an atheist. Sorry Keith-O, but I’m calling this one an EPIC FAIL!&lt;/p&gt;

I know you can. And who is this idiotic state representative? Why it’s none other than Sally Kern, the same Sally Kern that famously &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBmCA4z8Yzc"&gt;called gays a bigger threat to America than terrorists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Kern doesn’t understand little things like the law of cause and effect. When the financial system collapses, it’s not the fault of those who operate that system. No,that would be too simple. It’s really Obama’s fault for not being religious enough and the fault of the gays as well as everyone that doesn’t fit her personal vision of morality. If history is any indication, I’m sure we’ll be learning about her extra-marital affair soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of scapegoating is just plain disgusting. But perhaps the ACLU said it best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s very unfortunate, frankly, I haven’t seen scapegoating like this since pre-World War II Germany”, said C.S. Thornton, the Deputy Director of the ACLU Chapter of Oklahoma. “She blames all these things upon a great moral crisis that has in fact caused our national economic downtown, but nowhere in this parade of horribles does mention greedy Wall Street executives or government regulators who were asleep at the switch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice for Ms. Kern is that if she’s that certain this is all the fault of the godless heathens, then maybe should she get right on putting together a bill to raise funds for a massive animal sacrificing initiative. Well, maybe we can even sacrifice virginal women to the volcano gods too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mNHAJ04OdjM/Sko6AS7BGQI/AAAAAAAAA5A/1oPiui34kcc/s200/inhofe.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mNHAJ04OdjM/Sko6AS7BGQI/AAAAAAAAA5A/1oPiui34kcc/s200/inhofe.jpg" alt="" width="164" height="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But of course she’s not the only idiotic public official from Oklahoma. &lt;a href="http://www.amateurscientist.org/2009/06/cooking-science.html"&gt;Senator James Inhofe is claiming to have exposed what he calls “probably the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people”&lt;/a&gt;. What is that hoax he’s speaking of? Why it’s Global Warming. Yup. Guess which political party this anti-scientific crank belongs to. I know you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says the Environmental Protection Agency has been “cooking the science” on global warming since 1998, and that they purposefully falsified a report to eliminate research showing carbon dioxide has no harmful effect on the environment. Their motive? To further the Obama administration’s climate change initiatives. See, according to global warming conspiracy theorists, evil socialist fascists in the government want to declare your guns a federally protected wetland so that they might steal them from you and throw you into an internment camp. Or at least, I think that’s what they believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, what is wrong with these Oklahoma state officials? Is there something in the water?&lt;/p&gt;

It seems that there is actually a segment of the population that is so hopelessly lost that they actually turn to Billy Graham for advice. This news comes after Graham responded to the question, &lt;a href="http://www.kansascity.com/238/story/1296862.html"&gt;why does atheism appear to be on the rise and why it’s getting more attention these days&lt;/a&gt;. As I read Graham’s response, I like to picture him crying over the downfall of his once  great cult:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; DEAR M.M.:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, atheism has been in the public eye more in recent years, largely because of a few atheists who’ve captured the public’s attention through their books. They aren’t large in number, but they do tend to be aggressive in promoting their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why have they drawn so much attention? One reason, I believe, is because they know how to use the media very effectively. They also appeal to people who want to be free from God or any moral restraints. Like the philosophers of Paul’s day who were constantly looking for new ideas to debate, many people today eagerly latch on to the latest fad (see Acts 17:21). Atheism attracts their attention, at least for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, however, modern atheists have very little new to say. In fact, atheism has been around for thousands of years; even the Psalmist, writing hundreds of years before Christ, referred to them: “The fool says in his heart, ‘There is no God’ ” (Psalm 14:1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be misled by those who claim God doesn’t exist, because he does. And the ultimate reason we know it is because he came down from heaven and walked on this earth in the person of Jesus Christ. Christ was God in human flesh, and he proved it by rising from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love when he invokes the classic “atheists just want to be free to be bad” gambit. No matter how many times I hear it, it never makes any sense at all. If Yahweh really did exist, how would pretending he didn’t prevent Yahweh’s punishment? And isn’t the lack of any empirical evidence for Yahweh a far easier reason to be an atheist. And isn’t the whole thesis of Christianity that unlike those dirty, evil, Christ-killing Jews who have to work for salvation, Christians get the free pass out of hell and thus are “free of moral restraints?”And if atheism means freedom from moral restraints then damn, I must be doing it wrong. I haven’t even raped, murdered, or enslaved a single person yet. But then again, neither have any of the prominent atheist activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s not like there’s anything really new about atheism. There are new public representatives of atheism but most of the arguments are hundreds and in some cases, thousands of years old. You could just as easily call guys like William Lane Craig, Dinesh D’Sousa, and Lee Strobel the “New Theists.” So if this is just a fad, then it’s at least a 2400-year-old fad if we include Socrates and Epicurus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t cry, Billy. 2000 years is a hell of a good run.&lt;/p&gt;

Mark Sanford delivered another parsing puzzler in his latest comments to the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gDqYFtNBYPAEC7Db1AfmQ7YsB6EAD99598L00"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;, in which he admits to additional liaisons with his Argentinian mistress and further unspecified &amp;quot;line-crossing&amp;quot; with other women:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would say is that I've never had sex with another woman. Have I done stupid? I have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we know that Gov. Sanford has been studying the Bible during his marital/political crisis, perhaps he was thinking of verses like these (from the New International Version):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For rulers hold no terror for those who &lt;i&gt;do right&lt;/i&gt;, but for those who &lt;i&gt;do wrong&lt;/i&gt;. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you. (Romans 13:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				Let him who &lt;i&gt;does wrong&lt;/i&gt; continue to &lt;i&gt;do wrong&lt;/i&gt;; let him who is vile continue to be vile; let him who &lt;i&gt;does right&lt;/i&gt; continue to &lt;i&gt;do right&lt;/i&gt;; and let him who is holy continue to be holy. (Revelation 22:11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				My people are fools; they do not know me. They are senseless children; they have no understanding. They are skilled in &lt;i&gt;doing evil&lt;/i&gt;; they know not how to &lt;i&gt;do good&lt;/i&gt;. (Jeremiah 4:22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				Then Jesus said to them, &amp;quot;I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to &lt;i&gt;do good&lt;/i&gt; or to &lt;i&gt;do evil&lt;/i&gt;, to save life or to destroy it?&amp;quot; (Luke 6:9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In idiomatic English, you can &lt;i&gt;do wrong/right/good/evil&lt;/i&gt; — or, in the negative, you can &lt;i&gt;do no  wrong/right/good/evil&lt;/i&gt;. But you can't just use any adjective in the &lt;i&gt;do X&lt;/i&gt; frame to mean 'do that which is X.' What's special about &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;right, good&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;evil &lt;/i&gt;is that they can serve as adjectives or nouns ('that which is wrong,' 'that which is right,' etc.). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stupid&lt;/i&gt;, on the other hand, does not generally mean 'that which is stupid.' Admittedly, it is possible to nominalize &lt;i&gt;stupid&lt;/i&gt;, given the right context. For instance, there's the idiom &lt;i&gt;stuck on stupid&lt;/i&gt;, famously used by General Russel L. Honoré in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina (see YouTube clip &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVBY_SqzJtI"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  And I could imagine someone saying &lt;i&gt;my stupid&lt;/i&gt; on the model of &lt;i&gt;my bad&lt;/i&gt; and other sporadic &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003257.html"&gt;my&lt;a&gt; &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003263.html"&gt;Adj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; formations, but even that's a stretch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(It's also possible to nominalize &lt;i&gt;stupid&lt;/i&gt; to mean &amp;#39;a stupid person.&amp;#39; The OED has this sense back to 1712, in a quote from Richard Steele: &amp;quot;Thou art no longer to drudge in raising the Mirth of Stupids..for thy Maintenance.&amp;quot; Nowadays this mostly survives as a disparaging vocative, as in &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s the economy, stupid.&amp;quot; And then there are those &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m with stupid&amp;quot; T-shirts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So did Sanford have &lt;i&gt;do wrong&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;do evil&lt;/i&gt; in mind, and then decide mid-sentence to use &lt;i&gt;stupid&lt;/i&gt; instead? Perhaps he wanted to combine the sense of &lt;i&gt;do wrong/evil&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;be/feel/look stupid&lt;/i&gt;. Certainly Sanford's behavior covers all of these unspoken possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

He points out the &lt;b&gt;biological clocks&lt;/b&gt; are "...sort of messy application, from the standpoint of physics..." and he is right - for us biologists, messier the better.  We wallow in mess, cherish ambiguity and relish in complexity.  Anyway, he is talking about real clocks - things made by people to keep time.

I am talking an increased heart rate, general body flushing, widened bronchi, decreased peristalsis, sweating, piloerectory sympathetic response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) A devestating pair of shoes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Confirmation of the fact that megablogger &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/?utm_source=bloglist&amp;amp;utm_medium=dropdown"&gt;Ed Brayton&lt;/a&gt; basically worships me and hangs on every totally hot word I type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Dr. Isis received an email that provided both #1 and #2. Blog lurker JPowers155 writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT:0px"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Isis:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am but a humble blog stalker who found your site courtesy of my friend Ed Brayton (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/dispatches"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dispatches from the Culture Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;). After listening to yet another of my discourses on the importance of fabulous footwear (and handbags), he suggested that I take my obsession to your blog and bother him no further. &lt;strong&gt;He was, of course, extremely complimentary of your illustrious self and I've found myself in the unusual position of agreeing with his assessment of your wit and talent. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;[emphasis a la Isis]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of this preamble is leading up to this shoe: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.luxist.com/2009/06/30/minnie-feather-pumps/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://www.luxist.com/2009/06/30/minnie-feather-pumps/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peacock feathers? Check. Grosgrain ribbon? Check. High heel? Check. (I'd remove the pearl stick pin detail for day as it's a bit much, but for an evening event, it might just work.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your servant,&lt;br&gt;JPowers155&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shoes found at the link provided absolutely melted my soul...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="350" alt="minnieshoes0609.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/06/ed_brayton_3s_dr_isis_and_dr_i/minnieshoes0609.jpg" width="480"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: Pedro Garcia's Minne Feather Pump&lt;a href="http://www.net-a-porter.com/product/48384#"&gt; Net-a-Porter&lt;/a&gt;.  I even adore those little pearl pins.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing more beautiful than those shoes is the knowledge that Ed Brayton sits around with his friends talking about how wonderful I am. "Wit and talent?" Dr. Isis cannot make that stuff up if she tried. I mean, it's not going to stop me from humilating him when we finally make our schedules mesh to meet for the great &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/05/an_open_challenge.php"&gt;Meat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2009/05/picking_up_the_gauntlet_its_on.php"&gt;Eating&lt;/a&gt; Challenge, but it certainly evokes a level of affection that would cause me to offer him my handkerchief to dry his eyes with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if Ed really wants to demonstrate his unwavering love and devotion, he can begin a campaign to rescue my Barbies. I was unable to find them for several years, with the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/03/trampy_toys_and_what_we_tell_o.php"&gt;exception of one&lt;/a&gt;, and I have learned from reading Ed's blog that Glenn &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2009/06/weirdest_video_ever.php"&gt;Beck has stolen them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, Ed. Wrangle your readers and rescue them before they are violated any further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I was somewhat surprised at how shy people are of the little Flip camera - so much worry about the future career prospects if one does something seemingly 'unprofessional' like say a couple of words about one's research for the Lindau YouTube channel and my blog. But see the two interviews below, and I got a few more promise to do it tomorrow. I bet Nobel Laureates will be easier to persuade than the young researchers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, although it was very hot, I put on my shirt and tie (instead of my 'Ida' t-shirt) for the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.de/lindaunobel/2009/06/valuable-links-for-todays-open-access-panel.php" title=""&gt;Open Access panel&lt;/a&gt; which I shared with &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/LaureateDetails.AxCMS?UserID=6862" title=""&gt;Sir Harald Kroto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nphys/index.html" title=""&gt;Dr. Jason Wild&lt;/a&gt;. Moderator Beatrice Lugger made an excellent introduction which made it easy for us to get started right off the bat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr.Kroto talked about his efforts (and those are huge!) in providing educational materials for science teachers, as well in using modern technology, especially video, by the students. This includes a mandatory video they have to make about their research which goes into their CVs and is evaluated when they apply for the next level of education, e.g., grad school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr.Wild, who is published of physical journals at Nature and I used the perceived "competition" between Nature and PLoS as a starting point to introducing the two publishers, the two publishing systemes and two business models. This was then a good basis for further discussion of various Science 2.0 applications, the commenting/notes/ratings &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/tag/commenting/" title=""&gt;functionalities&lt;/a&gt; on PLoS papers, and the importance of Open Access for research, for medical practitioners (particularly in the developing world) and teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last segment, to some extent prodded by the excellent questions by the journalists in the room (this was a Press event), we went into speculation about the future of science publishing and communication, for which I borrowed heavily not just from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/the_scientific_paper_past_pres_2.php" title=""&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/why_does_impact_factor_persist_1.php" title=""&gt;own&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/on_my_last_scientific_paper_i_1.php" title=""&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;, but also from the brand new, thought-provoking and generally excellent post (a Must Read!) by &lt;a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/?p=629" title=""&gt;Michael Nielsen&lt;/a&gt; which I just managed to read a few hours before the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone filmed the session, but I understand that the video will not be posted online (or allowed to be posted by me, if I get my hands on it in a shape of a CD). You will have to trust my word that the panel went very, very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening, we were split into groups for dinners. Each group had a Nobel laureate or two, a couple of people from the Press (which includes bloggers, as this is a forward-thinking conference) and a lot of young scientists. I went to the elegant and excellent Restaurant Wissinger to the dinner hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.henkel.com/cps/rde/xchg/henkel_com/hs.xsl/index.htm" title=""&gt;Henkel&lt;/a&gt;. Nobel laureates Shimomura and Wütrhrich were in our group, but I (as Press, remember) did not want to bother them - there were many young folks there eager to talk to them and that is much more important to them than me - if I want an interview, I can probably get it tomorrow. Instead, I spent a wonderful evening talking to the neighbors at my table, all bright, young, highly motivated scientists. And the food was delicious, including great local wines (Hagnauer Burgstall, a dry pinot gris, and Meersburger Benge, a dry pinot noir).

You can now also easily place articles on various social services (CiteULike, Mendeley, Connotea, Stumbleupon, Facebook and Digg) with just one click. Here are my own picks for the week - you go and look for your own favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006103" title=""&gt;Characteristics of Medical Research News Reported on Front Pages of Newspapers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The placement of medical research news on a newspaper's front page is intended to gain the public's attention, so it is important to understand the source of the news in terms of research maturity and evidence level. We searched LexisNexis to identify medical research reported on front pages of major newspapers published from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2002. We used MEDLINE and Google Scholar to find journal articles corresponding to the research, and determined their evidence level. Of 734 front-page medical research stories identified, 417 (57%) referred to mature research published in peer-reviewed journals. The remaining 317 stories referred to preliminary findings presented at scientific or press meetings; 144 (45%) of those stories mentioned studies that later matured (i.e. were published in journals within 3 years after news coverage). The evidence-level distribution of the 515 journal articles quoted in news stories reporting on mature research (3% level I, 21% level II, 42% level III, 4% level IV, and 31% level V) differed from that of the 170 reports of preliminary research that later matured (1%, 19%, 35%, 12%, and 33%, respectively; chi-square test, P = .0009). No news stories indicated evidence level. Fewer than 1 in 5 news stories reporting preliminary findings acknowledged the preliminary nature of their content. Only 57% of front-page stories reporting on medical research are based on mature research, which tends to have a higher evidence level than research with preliminary findings. Medical research news should be clearly referenced and state the evidence level and limitations to inform the public of the maturity and quality of the source.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006014" title=""&gt;Racial Differences in the Human Endogenous Circadian Period&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The length of the endogenous period of the human circadian clock (tau) is slightly greater than 24 hours. There are individual differences in tau, which influence the phase angle of entrainment to the light/dark (LD) cycle, and in doing so contribute to morningness-eveningness. We have recently reported that tau measured in subjects living on an ultradian LD cycle averaged 24.2 hours, and is similar to tau measured using different experimental methods. Here we report racial differences in tau. Subjects lived on an ultradian LD cycle (1.5 hours sleep, 2.5 hours wake) for 3 days. Circadian phase assessments were conducted before and after the ultradian days to determine the change in circadian phase, which was attributed to tau. African American subjects had a significantly shorter tau than subjects of other races. We also tested for racial differences in our previous circadian phase advancing and phase delaying studies. In the phase advancing study, subjects underwent 4 days of a gradually advancing sleep schedule combined with a bright light pulse upon awakening each morning. In the phase delaying study, subjects underwent 4 days of a gradually delaying sleep schedule combined with evening light pulses before bedtime. African American subjects had larger phase advances and smaller phase delays, relative to Caucasian subjects. The racial differences in tau and circadian phase shifting have important implications for understanding normal phase differences between individuals, for developing solutions to the problems of jet lag and shift work, and for the diagnosis and treatment of circadian rhythm based sleep disorders such as advanced and delayed sleep phase disorder.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000101" title=""&gt;Seasonal Hunger: A Neglected Problem with Proven Solutions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;    *

&lt;p&gt;      Most of the world's acute hunger and undernutrition occurs not in conflicts and natural disasters but in the annual "hunger season," the time of year when the previous year's harvest stocks have dwindled, food prices are high, and jobs are scarce.&lt;br&gt;
    *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;      We know what works in fighting seasonal hunger and undernutrition: there are identifiable policy and program successes in contexts around the world, but they often operate on a small scale and in isolation.&lt;br&gt;
    *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;      Community-based interventions to treat acute undernutrition and promote growth of preschool children are examples of successful interventions that should be scaled up.&lt;br&gt;
    *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;      Global scale-up of a basic "minimum essential" intervention package against seasonal hunger would cost around 0.1% of global GDP and save millions of lives, while protecting millions more from severe illness.&lt;br&gt;
    *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;      Focusing on seasonal hunger would be an effective way to leverage resources for the attainment of the hunger-related Millennium Development Goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000128" title=""&gt;Bad Taste Protects Fruit Flies from Eating a Toxic Amino Acid in Plants&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Besides enhancing the pleasure of eating, our sense of taste can steer us away from poisonous foods. Many plants, for example, produce bitter-tasting toxins, such as caffeine and quinine, to deter predation by herbivores from cows to insects. But it remains a mystery how animals developed their capacity to detect--and so avoid--the tens of thousands of plant toxins, which include alkaloids, phenolics, and nonprotein amino acids. The best-known toxic nonprotein amino acid is L-canavanine, which accumulates in the seeds of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and many other leguminosae. L-canavanine is so similar to the amino acid L-arginine that it gets incorporated into proteins, rendering them dysfunctional. A few insects have developed strategies for counteracting this toxin, including larvae of the beetle Caryedes brasiliensis, which depend entirely on seeds of the legume Dioclea megacarpa and catabolize L-canavanine into harmless compounds. However, the vast majority of insects are susceptible to L-canavanine, and little is known about their ability to detect it in plants.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000102" title=""&gt;Clean Water Should Be Recognized as a Human Right&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the March 2009 United Nations (UN) meetings coinciding with the World Water Forum, Canada, Russia, and the United States refused to support a declaration that would recognize water as a basic human right. The special resolution proposed by Germany and Spain, and endorsed by the President of the UN General Assembly, was instead rejected in favor of further examination of issues of access to safe drinking water and sanitation [1].

&lt;p&gt;Opposition to this declaration runs counter to considerable evidence that access to clean water, which is essential for health, is under threat. According to the World Health Organization, 1.2 billion people worldwide do not have access to clean drinking water, and a further 2.6 billion lack adequate sanitation services. These numbers are expected to rise. The UN has estimated that 2.8 billion people in 48 countries will be living in conditions of water stress or scarcity by 2025 [2].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000143" title=""&gt;Parks and Tourism&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why should it matter how many people visit national parks? In a word: politics. Protected areas are not only physical places, reservoirs of biodiversity, and sources of ecosystem services, such as breathable air and drinkable water. They are also human political constructs, and they are under ever-increasing pressures from growing human populations and resource demands. Visitors may bring them the political capital to survive.

&lt;p&gt;Biologists have pointed out for decades that protected areas are not playgrounds, but life-support systems for the planet&amp;#39;s population of humans, as well as its other species. Economists estimate that ecosystem services worldwide contribute twice as much to the human economy each year as all forms of human industry combined--many trillions of dollars [1],[2]. At regional scale, ecosystem services from National Wildlife Refuges in the contiguous 48 states of the Unites States have been valued at US$27 billion annually [3]. The human economic value of conserving biodiversity is many orders of magnitude higher than the funds invested in it [2],[4]-[9]. The cost of buying all of the world&amp;#39;s biodiversity hotspots outright has been estimated at around US$100 billion--less than five-years&amp;#39; expenditure on soft drinks in the US [10]. But the actual funds allocated worldwide each year, a few billion dollars in total, are &amp;lt;5% of minimum requirements for effective conservation [11]. This compares with the trillions of dollars spent in 2009 to prop up financial systems in the US, European Union, and China [12].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_43.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/-86uGBS_8vI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246406621914"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/30/space-carnival-109/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d6efbb0606f3cb3b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">Space Carnival 109</title><published>2009-07-01T00:00:11Z</published><updated>2009-07-01T00:00:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/30/space-carnival-109/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hey, I just found out the 109th edition of the Carnival of Space is being held at none other than my friend, fellow TAM speaker, and Hollywood scientist Jennifer Ouellette’s &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovery.com/twisted_physics/2009/06/carnival-of-space-109.html"&gt;Twisted Physics blog&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn&amp;#39;t bad, except that it was very basic—maybe if I were a real journalist instead of a fake journalist I would have appreciated it more, but as it was, it was a nice overview of some common ideas in neuroscience, with some discussion of pretty new tools on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He started with a little history to outline what we know, with Ramon Y Cajal showing that the brain is made up of network of neurons (which we now know to be approxiamately 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; neurons large). He also predicted the  direction of signal propagation, and was mostly right. Each neuron sends signals outwards through an axon, and receives input from thousands of other cells on its cell body and dendrites.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Signals move between neurons mostly by synaptic transmission, or the exocytosis of transmitter-loaded vesicles induced by changes in calcium concentration. That makes calcium a very interesting ion, and makes calcium concentration an extremely important parameter affecting physiological function, so we want to know more about it. Furthermore, it's a parameter that is in constant flux, changing second by second in the cell. So how do we see an ion in real time or near real time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is to use fluorescent indicator dyes which are sensitive to changes in calcium concentration — these molecules fluoresce at different wavelenths or absorb light at different wavelengths depending on whether they are bound or not bound to calcium, making the concentration visible as changes in either the absorbed or emitted wavelength of light. There is a small battery of fluorescent compounds — Fura-2, fluo 3, indo-1 — that allow imaging of localized increases in calcium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's another problem: resolution. Where the concentration of calcium matters most is in a tiny microdomain, a thin rind of the cytoplasm near the cell membrane called the cortex, which is where vesicles are lined up, ready to be triggered to fuse with the cell membrane by calcium, leading to the expulsion of their contents to the exterior. This microdomain is tiny, only 10-50nm thick, and is below the limit of resolution of your typical light microscope. If you're interested in the calcium concentration at one thin, tiny spot, you've got a problem.

&lt;p&gt;Most presynaptic terminals are very small and difficult to study; they can be visualized optically, but it&amp;#39;s hard to do simultaneous electrophysiology. One way Neher gets around this problem is to use unusually large synapses, the calyx of Held synapse, which is part of an auditory brainstem pathway. It&amp;#39;s an important pathway in sound localization, and the signals must be very precise. They have a pecial structure, a cup-like synapse that envelops the post-synaptic  cell body — they&amp;#39;re spectacularly large, so large that one can insert recording electrodes both pre- and post-synaptically, and both compartments can be loaded with indicator dyes and caged compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question being addressed is the concentration of Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the microdomain of the cytoplasmic cortex, where vesicle fusion occurs. This is below the level of resolution of the light microscope, so just imaging a calcium indicator dye won&amp;#39;t work — they need an alternative solution. The one they came up with was to use caged molecules, in particular a reagent call Ca-DMN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caged molecules are cool, with one special property: when you flash UV light of just the right wavelength at them, they fall apart into a collection of inert (you hope) photoproducts, releasing the caged molecule, which is calcium in this case. So you can load up a cell with Ca-DMN, and then with one simple signal, you can trigger it to release all of its calcium, generating a uniform concentration at whatever level you desire across the entire cell. So instead of triggering an electrical potential in the synaptic terminal and asking what concentration of calcium appears at the vesicle fusion zone, they reversed the approach, generating a uniform calcium level and then asking how much transmitter was released, measured electrophysiologically at the post-synaptic cell. When they got a calcium level that produced an electrical signal mimicking the natural degree of transmitter release, they knew they'd found the right concentration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caged compounds don't have to be just calcium ions: other useful probes are caged ATP, caged glutamate (a neurotransmitter), and even caged RNA. The power of the technique is that you can use light to manipulate the chemical composition of the cell at will, and observe how it responds. These are tools that can be used to modify cell states, to characterize excretory properties, or to generate extracellular signals, all with the relatively noninvasive probe of a brief focused light flash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/irwin_neher_chemistry_helps_ne.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/ts_62gdoLSc" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246406542760"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/our_states_long_suffering_is_o.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9c3b58aaf4da0c1a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Our state's long suffering is over at last</title><published>2009-07-01T00:31:03Z</published><updated>2009-07-01T00:31:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/ogL48jHVPI4/our_states_long_suffering_is_o.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/our_states_long_suffering_is_o.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota Supreme Court has ruled against him, and &lt;i&gt;finally&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/06/franken_wins_court_battle_uncl.php"&gt;Norm Coleman has conceded the Minnesota state senate race to Al Franken&lt;/a&gt;.

This just hot in my in box from &lt;a href="http://gonextstep.org"&gt;Next Step&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 200-plus people who rallied in Trenton on May 14 to restore budget cuts to New Jersey Centers for Independent Living can declare victory. All budget cuts have been restored!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I've been able to post back with some good news, some positive results of self-advocate efforts to prevent the states from taking away our lifelines.  Hopefully this can help encourage us to keep rallying, protesting, calling, and complaining.  Keep telling your stories and making it known that it is not OK to balance the budget by taking away people's ability to survive or have any sort of quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard work, but we still have hope of success, one small bit at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "typewriter" described on the second page (fifth paragraph:  "Another kind of Chinese typewriter") section of the Wikipedia article cited above is the only kind of machine for writing Chinese that achieved fairly widespread use.  (Most of the typewriters shown &lt;a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=chinese%20typewriters&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;tab=wi&amp;amp;um=1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are of this sort.)  It was basically a limited font of about two to three thousand of the most common characters, with hundreds or thousands of more obscure characters kept in boxes nearby, to be laboriously sought out when needed (most typists just wrote such characters in by hand [if they knew them; but usually they were simply copying from a printed page or somebody&amp;#39;s handwritten draft anyway — even now, except with pinyin-inputting systems, Chinese have not benefited very much from touch-typing] rather than try to find them in the boxes).  The Wikipedia article claims that &amp;quot;good operators were able to type around 70 words per minute.&amp;quot;  First of all, this probably means &amp;quot;characters,&amp;quot; not &amp;quot;words&amp;quot; (which are largely disyllabic).  Secondly, this could only have been true of a highly skilled operator presenting a carefully prepared and practiced text without any unusual characters (i.e., beyond those in the main tray).  The typists I observed using these machines in Taiwan, China, and at the UN back in the 70s and early 80s — all professionals, not casual typists — seldom exceeded about 10-12 characters per minute under the best circumstances (only common characters found in the main tray, and working from clean drafts or copying from printed materials).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the difficulties outlined above have continued even into the computer age, which accounts for the (should I avoid using "literally"?) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_input_methods_for_computers"&gt;thousands of different inputting systems&lt;/a&gt; that have been devised during the past three decades.  The vast majority of individuals, both for short text messaging and for word processing with computers, now use various types of romanized inputting, with those methods that take advantage of word segmentation being the most efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

Back in 2007, Jeff and Sandee Winkelman won a &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/winkelman-v-parma-city-school-district-05-983/"&gt;Supreme Court decision (05-983)&lt;/a&gt; that allowed them to sue their public school district regarding their child's special education needs even if they did not hire an attorney. The Winkelmans were unable to afford a lawyer to challenge the Parma, Ohio, school district’s plan to educate their autistic son Jacob in a public school autism program. After questioning the appropriateness of the education that Jacob would receive in the public school program, they requested that the Parma School District pay for tuition at a private autism school, the Monarch School in Shaker Heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Supreme Court ruled yesterday that Jacob is not entitled to be educated at a private school at taxpayer expense.  As reported in the &lt;a href="http://www.nbc4i.com/cmh/news/national/national_govtpolitics/article/mother_of_boy_with_autism_i_am_very_sad/18306/"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="http://www.nbc4i.com/cmh/news/national/national_govtpolitics/article/mother_of_boy_with_autism_i_am_very_sad/18306/"&gt;NBC4i&lt;/a&gt;) about Winkelman v. Parma City School District, 08-1089,  he Supreme Court rejected an appeal from the Winkelmans concerning reimbursement for tuition for Jacob at the Monarch School. Tuition at the Monarch School is about $64,500 a year. In noting the progress that Jacob has made, Sandee Winkelman said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m very sad.......We were right in pursuing it.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..............&lt;br&gt;
“Jacob still has a disability and we have to look out for what we needs. It took him four years before he could even sit at a desk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court's decision is highly disappointing: What kind of education will Jacob receive now if the Winkelmans are (as seems to be the case) unable to pay for the Monarch School?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has not been all bad news for special education in the courts, keeping in mind &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/supreme_court_spec_ed_decision"&gt;this recent Supreme Court decision&lt;/a&gt;, that, even if a child has never received special education services from a public school district, the child is entitled to be reimbursed for tuition to a private school. And please &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/ask_your_congressperson_to_support_the_idea_fairness_restoration_act"&gt;ask your Congressperson to support the IDEA Fairness Restoration Act&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

The model that protons and neutrons were made of quarks was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark"&gt;proposed and validated&lt;/a&gt;, the most powerful nuclear device &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba"&gt;of all time was detonated&lt;/a&gt;, and the Cosmic Microwave Background &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation"&gt;was discovered&lt;/a&gt;, validating the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1948_gamow.php"&gt;Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;.  (Not to mention &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Double_Helix"&gt;devastating advances in biology&lt;/a&gt;, too.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But something far more awesome than that happened in 1969.  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1969_and_th/45325main_MM_Image_Feature_69_rs4.jpg" width="500" alt="45325main_MM_Image_Feature_69_rs4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It not only trumps splitting the proton and confirming the Big Bang, it is -- for me -- the finest accomplishment in all of human history.  And its 40th anniversary is exactly &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11"&gt;three weeks from today&lt;/a&gt;.  So congratulations to the Apollo 11 crew:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1969_and_th/754px-Apollo_11.jpg" width="500" alt="754px-Apollo_11.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three men are symbols of the entire space program, and of just how &lt;b&gt;awesome&lt;/b&gt; the rest of the Universe is, outside of our home world.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1969_and_th/4492_97328326460_96339861460_2430826_3538782_n.jpg" width="500" alt="4492_97328326460_96339861460_2430826_3538782_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a whole bunch of "firsts" that happened with this mission, but they can be summarized in one simple sentence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We became the first living species to willfully transport ourselves off of our home world and onto another, and to live there, for however brief a time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Or, as Neil Armstrong &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1969_and_th/13.mp3"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;p&gt;We are definitely the first species in our Solar System to willfully travel to another world, and depending on what or who else is out there, we may be the first species in our whole galaxy or even the entire Universe to do so!  And on July 20th, 1969, this was accomplished with one man's first step:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1969_and_th/62288main_aldrin_ladder_full.jpg" width="500" alt="62288main_aldrin_ladder_full.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;(That's Buzz on the ladder, by the way. Neil was already down there; who else was going to snap the photo?!)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have always been explorers, but it was this moment, out of all the moments of the 20th century, that exemplifies just how capable we are of accomplishing even the most daunting of all possible tasks.  &lt;b&gt;We left Earth, traveled hundreds of thousands of miles through space, and walked on another world.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1969_and_th/lunar_landing.jpg" width="500" alt="lunar_landing.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As important as everything else was during the 1960s, &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; else captured the world's imagination as Apollo 11 did.  This is so much more important than confirming a scientific theory, than a new, groundbreaking observation, or even an unexpected discovery.  This is something that galvanized the entire Earth, and brought us all together, in awe, at what we are capable of doing -- for good, for knowledge, for adventure, and for the human endeavor -- as a species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's up to us to find the next great enterprise for discovery to inspire the world.  What will we do in the 21st century to rival &lt;i&gt;walking on another world&lt;/i&gt; for the very first time?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1969_and_th.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246398553222"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-6808717560314352246">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aafd619263b78a71</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolutionary Biology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Genes, Phylogeny, and Orangutans</title><published>2009-06-30T19:29:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-02T16:58:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/06/genes-phylogeny-and-orangutans.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/6808717560314352246/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=6808717560314352246" title="14 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Jeffrey H.

Because it was popular, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2008/01/why_chiropractic_is_patently_r.php"&gt;I resurrected it&lt;/a&gt;.  Well, a chiropractor has come to bravely defend his field and&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2008/01/why_chiropractic_is_patently_r.php#c1743907"&gt; left me a comment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study in the May 2007 issue of the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics reports health plans that use Chiropractors as Primary Care Providers (PCPs) reduce their health care utilization costs significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study covers the seven-year period from 1999 to 2005. Researchers compared costs and utilization data from an Independent Physicians Association (IPA) that uses Chiropractors as PCPs and a traditional HMO that doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chiropractic PCPs had 59 percent fewer hospitalizations, 62 percent fewer outpatient surgical cases and 85 percent lower drug costs compared with the HMO plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patients in the Chiropractic PCP group also reported higher satisfaction with their care than the HMO group. Over the seven-year period, Chiropractic patients consistently demonstrated a high degree of satisfaction with their care that ranged from 89 percent to 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study co-author James Winterstein, D.C. says that patients using Chiropractic PCP health care groups “experienced fewer hospitalizations, underwent fewer surgeries and used considerably fewer pharmaceuticals than HMO patients who received traditional medical care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm…interesting assertions.  Let’s examine these assertions and the “article” they come from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="padding:5px;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" alt="ResearchBlogging.org" style="border:0pt none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;We will set aside for a moment that the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics is not well-regarded in the science-based medicine community, and examine the article on its merits alone.  Once we’ve dealt with that, we’ll examine the chiropractors comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “study”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Clinical Utilization and Cost Outcomes From an Integrative Medicine Independent Physician Association: An Additional 3-Year Update,” is a bit of a confusing piece of writing, but I’ll do my best to parse it out for you.  The goal of the study is quite clearly set out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we are not taking a position on the efficacy of any CAM treatment. Rather, we are interested in the current use of CAM modalities and cost effects of such use, regardless of treatment outcome. These clinical utilization and cost outcomes are compared with previously published results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, they are looking at alternative medicine vs. real medicine to see which is cheaper, not whether it actually works.  Unsurprisingly, I have a problem with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could do a much quicker study asking the same question.  If I were to forbid people from seeing the doctor or going to the emergency room, I would undoubtedly find that they spent fewer health care dollars.  But why would I ask such a thing?  There is no point to seeing how much something costs without addressing whether or not it even works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what the original study and this one did was look at patients cared for by a group of “alternative” doctors and compare them to a group of patients cared for by a group of real doctors.  In the study, they equate CAM-oriented physicians with chiropractors, which confused me, so I went back to the original study(2) to investigate this issue (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the project’s inception, personal interviews were conducted with all categories of physicians, including MDs/DOs and DCs whose style of medical practice qualified them as potential CAM-oriented PCPs. &lt;strong&gt;For a variety of professional, personal, political, and economic reasons, only the Doctors of Chiropractic were willing to undertake the project.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Res ipsa loquitor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let’s skip straight to the outcomes.  I think we can safely ignore for now the patient satisfaction outcomes, since patients self-selected into the chiropractic group.  Moving on to the reduced utilization, it’s important to point out a few facts.  First, as noted, the patients self-selected into the altmed group so may be less inclined to utilize medications and procedures.  Second, chiropractors aren’t really allowed to do very much, and their &lt;s&gt;religion&lt;/s&gt; philosophy is biased against accepted theories of disease, so they are not likely to go to their physician overseers and ask them to order tests and prescribe medications.  Third, cost is irrelevant if the care isn’t known to be effective. Finally, in the words of the authors themselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The validity and generalizability of this observation are guarded given the lack of randomization, lack of statistical analysis possible, and potentially biased data in this population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, about that comment from my old piece.  The commenter completely passed over the issue of whether or not chiropractic makes sense, and quoted from a study that explicitly avoids evaluating the efficacy of chiropractic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiropractors have a long way to go if they wish to justify their practices, and this study doesn’t move them any further down that road.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a remarkable fact, and surprising; these are the same parents whose value of time (their wage rate) has increased relative to that of all parents, as, unsurprisingly, have their hours working for pay (since we know that labor supply responds to wage rates).

There were divides, yes, and some of them necessary, good divides, and others--not so much.  There was some common ground as well.  There was definitely a lot to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a past life, I worked for a very long time in the field of technical communications, information design, and web development.  I managed a company-wide intranet and wrote most of the documentation for a telecommunications / software development company.  It's the sort of work that invariably starts with the question "who is the audience?"  Because, well, writing a help file for customer service representatives is quite a different thing from writing a help file for a network engineer--or a troubleshooter.  Context is then the second question: what does the audience need to get from the writing, how will the audience be &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; the information?  Y'all expect complete sentences and something resembling good grammar in a blog post, but when you're frustrated with a piece of software you don't want to have to wade through walls of perfectly formed text--you want to see the solution to your problem instantly and fix it quickly.  Speed of information retrieval is usually more important in software help files than proper grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, like, what does all that have to do with autism community divisions?  Or a conference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Elesia and I were preparing our presentation on self-advocacy for people who use non-standard communication (focus on deaf and autism stuff), that question of audience and information usage was just as critical as it had been in my tech com days.  Were we writing directly for speech/language professionals?  For parents looking for things to teach their kids?  Or were we writing this for people like ourselves?  We had to write for all three audiences as best we could, but in the end decided to address the self-advocates as our primary audience.  "I've sat through enough talks where a professional or parent talked about me 'the client' in third person, let them experience what it's like for a change," I even grumpily said.  So our presentation made the assumption first and foremost that we were addressing our peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this have to do with questions of division within "the community?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, yes, the divide is artificial and way more antagonistic online than it is in day-to-day "meatspace."  However, in some other ways the fact that audience and context matters may point to some more solid reasons for why the divide does, and likely will always, exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I protect myself from abuse when I am invariably far too trusting of others?&lt;/em&gt; --This is a question I ask for myself.  Answers need to play to my skills and strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I know if the person who looks after my daughter can be trusted not to abuse her?&lt;/em&gt; --This is a question a parent might ask.  Answers need to play to the parent's very different skills and strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I teach the person I work with to have a better danger sense about others?&lt;/em&gt;  --This is a question a professional might ask.  Answers are in a different format here than for the parent or self-advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers to these questions are, necessarily, different due to differences in perspective, motivation, and context.  This isn't a bad thing, it's just a thing.  Is there a way to make these different perspectives, motivations, and contexts complimentary and respectful instead of antagonistic and offensive?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246388713842"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/30/praying-allah-carte/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3a9c63af144e6237</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Praying Allah carte</title><published>2009-06-30T18:26:38Z</published><updated>2009-06-30T18:26:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/30/praying-allah-carte/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I often wonder why people are so gung ho about getting prayer in school. Shouldn’t we be worrying more about edumacating the kids? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I could write reams about this, but I won’t bother: &lt;a href="http://saganist.blogspot.com/2009/06/to-everyone-who-wants-prayer-in.html"&gt;Saganist nails it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when I was in high school and there was some talk about putting prayer in the schools. I had an agreement with a friend what we would do if it passed. We would both stand up together during the prayer time, take our left arms and put them over our heads to touch our right ears, stand on one leg, make rapid random movements with our right arms, and scream &amp;quot;Aglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglagla!!&amp;quot; as loudly as we could. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the teacher tried to stop us, we would say our religion demanded that we do this. I sometimes wish that the anti-Constitutional forces in the area had gotten their way.

Last month I &lt;a href="http://arnoldzwicky.wordpress.com/2009/05/21/dubious-passive/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about one such case on my blog, but there you could imagine how the sentence arose. My most recent find just looks perverse, and it has an awkward adverb placement as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the caption to a photograph (of an aged woman smoking a pipe) on a postcard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ralston NB: 92-year-old Grandma Hayes attributes her long life and good health to the fact that five pipefuls of tobacco are daily smoked by her! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The photograph, dated 1925, is credited to Underwood and Underwood, with copyright by Underwood Photo Archives, Ltd. in San Francisco. The postcard is from Pomegranate Communications, Inc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this, rather than:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;92-year-old Grandma Hayes attributes her long life and good health to the fact that she smokes five pipefuls of tobacco daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;92-year-old Grandma Hayes attributes her long life and good health to smoking five pipefuls of tobacco daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, though I have nothing against "split verbs" (see my recent blog &lt;a href="http://arnoldzwicky.wordpress.com/2009/06/19/mcintyre-simmering/"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt;, with links to earlier Language Log postings), "are daily smoked by her" strikes me as more awkward than "are smoked by her daily".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Dr. SkySkull of the &lt;a href="http://skullsinthestars.com/" title=""&gt;Skulls in the Stars&lt;/a&gt; blog, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="skullicon.jpg.gif" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/skullicon.jpg.gif" width="80" height="75" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;First, the name: I seem to have evolved many different aliases over my time in the blogosphere!  My usual moniker is simply "gg", though I am occasionally referred to by my blog title, "Skulls in the stars".  A friend of mine somewhat sarcastically started referring to me as "Dr. SkySkull", as well, and I'm rather fond of that title. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the name out of the way, I can say that I'm an assistant professor of physics at a Southeastern University.  More specifically, I am a theoretician with an emphasis in "classical optics", which means that I am more interested in the wave properties of light than the quantum-mechanical particle aspects of light.  I actually started my career in experimental particle physics as an undergraduate, and made the change in grad school.  There's an amusing story behind the change that I've promised to tell on my blog at some point...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a faculty member, I'm required to do research, write grants, teach courses, supervise graduate students, and help keep the department running.  I'm also currently working on an optics-related textbook, which I'll explain more about when it's closer to being done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, hopefully "growing up" includes getting tenure, which I'm up for this year!  Other than that... heck, I never know what will interest me next.  I jump out of airplanes, play guitar, and ice skate as hobbies.   There are certainly days when any and all of those appeal to me more than academia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, though, I really love my job.   Doing scientific research, and trying to educate people about it, is a blast, and I hope to keep at it for a long, long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the fact that the Web opens up a direct line of communication between scientists and the general public.  If a member of the public had a science-related question in times past, the best they could do was seek out a popularized book on the subject and hope that the explanation would suffice.  Now that same person can find an answer in a (free) science blog post, and can ask follow up questions directly to the author. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, all of my science blog posts these days are written primarily with an eye towards a non-technical audience.  I work very hard to try and explain concepts without mathematics and in a manner that would be understandable without a major science degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it stands, blogging does not directly figure into my work.  It does provide many indirect benefits for my research, though. For one, blogging provides an additional motivation to keep current in the scientific literature.  When I read journals now, I'm not only looking for research relevant to my own but also for good blog-fodder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging also pushes me to read, and understand well, topics outside of my immediate area of expertise.  I've found that trying to write a post on a subject, especially for a non-technical audience, forces me to learn the material at a level much deeper than I otherwise would have bothered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 'history of science' blogging has also proven unexpectedly beneficial to both my research and teaching, but I'll say more about that in a moment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't used any of the social networking resources in my work at all.  I use Facebook, but purely as a means to keep up with distant friends and family.  Twitter is something I can never see myself using - I give myself heartburn enough trying to blog several times a week, I can't even imagine posting several times daily!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still can dictate exactly when and how I was drawn into the science blogosphere! I read Al Franken's book "Lies" when it came out in the first Bush term, and that made me a fan and a regular listener of Air America Radio in its early years.  From there, I got turned on to many different political blogs.  Somewhere along the way, there was a reference to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" title=""&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;, which put science blogs on my radar.  I started there, found myself drifting over to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/" title=""&gt;Science After Sunclipse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" title=""&gt;Good Math, Bad Math&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/" title=""&gt;Uncertain Principles&lt;/a&gt;, and I was hooked from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's really hard to pick favorites, because I like so many and visit them regularly!  Many of my favorites are curiously not even in my field: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/" title=""&gt;Neurotopia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/" title=""&gt;Laelaps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://magmacumlaude.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Magma Cum Laude&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/" title=""&gt;Science After Sunclipse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.scienceforums.net/swansont/" title=""&gt;Swans on Tea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twistedphysics.typepad.com/" title=""&gt;Cocktail Party Physics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/" title=""&gt;White Coat Underground&lt;/a&gt; are just a few. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started reading &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/" title=""&gt;White Coat Underground&lt;/a&gt; after meeting PalMD at the Conference.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/" title=""&gt;Neurotopia&lt;/a&gt; I was already familiar with, but started reading much more regularly after getting a chance to hang out with the uber-cool Scicurious.  I met Tom Levenson at the Conference and now regularly check out his &lt;a href="http://inversesquare.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Inverse Square Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You run the &lt;a href="http://ontheshouldersofgiants.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Giant's Shoulders blog carnival&lt;/a&gt; - can you explain what is the motivation for doing this, what is the goal?  Why are you drawn to history and why do you think others should as well?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The carnival began almost by accident!  I've always had a significant respect for the history of science, which was instilled in me by my Ph.D. advisor, but I never really expected to make it one of my big "things."   I try to be very thorough in my science posts, however, and I found myself hunting down some very old, classic papers in an introductory post on how the speed of light is measured.  In April 2008, I thought it would be fun to "challenge" other science bloggers to go and read a classic paper in their own field.  I was expecting a few people to pick it up, but surprisingly (and in no small part due to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/05/blog_about_a_classic_science_p.php" title=""&gt;A Blog Around the Clock&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://skullsinthestars.com/classic-science-papers-the-2008-challenge/" title=""&gt;lots of people decided to pick up the challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that lots of bloggers have at least some interest in blogging about historical topics, and it seemed natural to have a central "focus" for their efforts - hence, the carnival.  Overall, my goal is to promote an understanding of the history of science amongst both scientists and the general population - and that understanding can be beneficial to both groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of interesting stories in the history of science, and those stories - and the people behind them - can help humanize science in the eyes of the public.  Too often scientists are viewed as humorless curmudgeons working alone in some dark lab on scientific minutiae.  Historical tales such as Tom Levenson's new book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Newton-Counterfeiter-Detective-Greatest-Scientist/dp/0151012784/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1246060558&amp;amp;sr=8-1" title=""&gt;Newton and the Counterfeiter&lt;/a&gt; can counter that perception - who could have imagined Isaac Newton matching wits with a crime-lord!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an educator, I find that understanding the historical origins of a discovery helps immensely in explaining it to a class.  In physics, at least, we tend to highlight the major breakthroughs but leave out a lot of the "connecting tissue".  This can give students a misleading view of how science is actually done and make it look much more mysterious than it needs to be.   Also, fun little historical anecdotes can make the class a lot more fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a researcher, my historical readings give me a better understanding of how major discoveries are made, and what sort of "mental blocks" kept other researchers from making them.  What distinguishes an Einstein from a less successful researcher?  There's no easy answer to that, but one can partly see the oversights of Einstein's contemporaries by reading the old journals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also fascinating to see how scientific discoveries percolate their way into the popular culture.  I also blog about classic weird fiction on my blog, and shocking discoveries such as quantum mechanics and relativity made their mark on the fiction of the time.   H.P. Lovecraft, for instance, was a voracious science reader, and the weirdness of Einstein's relativity permeates much of his writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You led a &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/History_of_Science/" title=""&gt;session about History of Science&lt;/a&gt; online. What did you learn from running the session?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One indirect thing I learned from it was how wonderfully democratic blogging is!  As a professor, I was sharing the stage with a graduate student (Scicurious) and an undergraduate (Brian of Laelaps), and I thought that it was great to have all those perspectives presented simultaneously!  Folks like Sci and Brian are the future of science education, and it was very energizing to see their enthusiasm and hear their views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's hard to pin down any single event that really left a mark.  Mainly, it was a lot of little things that I internalized, like the different ways that people look at science communication.  One thing I'm already taking back to my job, though, is that the blogs are a powerful tool for such communication, and I'm already trying to get more of my colleagues involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to see you again and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise!  I'm looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;

Like most Libertarian hatchet jobs these days, it starts with a belief in an unproven set of first principles roughly equating The Market with a just and loving God, mixes in a total lack of understanding of a complex issue, and arrives at a useless conclusion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author doesn’t know the difference (and it’s significant) between &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/adsense"&gt;AdSense&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://mattmaroon.com/adwords.google.com"&gt;AdWords&lt;/a&gt;, which is the first clue as to how little he actually knows about this issue. I’m not even sure where I side on the Google antitrust topic, but I know it’s a hell of a lot less simple than “Google makes the best search engine and as soon as they stop the money will flow elsewhere.” Anyone who has actually used either of those two products (I’ve done both) knows this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to find people (via Google searches no less) who were making a lot of money and then were effectively put out of business by a change in or sudden enforcement of the nebulous AdWords or AdSense terms, or in Google’s results algorithm. It’s clear to anyone sufficiently knowledgeable about internet marketing that Google’s tremendous share of searches gives them unprecedented control over the flow of advertising dollars on the net.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author continues:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Google is to be shackled so that future competitors can catch up to Gmail, Google Maps and Google Books.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Books is undergoing a controversy of its own in relation to their &lt;a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/06/googlebookssettlementauthorsguild.html"&gt;settlement with the Authors Guild&lt;/a&gt; giving them and only them rights to sell orphaned books digitally, which has nothing to do with what the DoJ is rumored to be investigating. I’m not sure where I stand on that issue yet either, but one thing is for sure: it’s small potatoes compared to AdSense/AdWords and search engine results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gmail is in 4th place behind Yahoo, Microsoft, and AOL respectively, and Google Maps does well but has far &lt;a href="http://siteanalytics.compete.com/maps.google.com+mapquest.com/"&gt;more significant competition&lt;/a&gt; than their search or advertising products.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summation, this guy has very little clue what he’s talking about, but that never stops a Libertarian from writing a negative opinion piece about the government.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epstein is an analyst at the Ayn Rand Center for Individual Rights.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shocker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you an exhausted antiscientist? Has railing against the mainstream science paradigm got you down? Making up &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot; is tough, and it’s tiring CONSTANTLY TYPING IN CAPITAL LETTERS, &lt;font color="red"&gt;using different color fonts&lt;/font&gt;, and don’t forget all those exclamation points!!! Not to mention comparing scientists to Hitler and Himmler, and yourself to Galileo and Einstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, your mind is soft and not used to real work, so you need to take constant breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;

&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/space/puzzles/faces-of-mars/puzzles.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/marsfacepuzzle.jpg" alt="Mars Face puzzle"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have I got the time-waster for you! Head (haha, as you’ll see in a sec) on over to &lt;a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/space/puzzles/faces-of-mars/puzzles.html"&gt;Discovery Channel’s Faces of Mars jigsaw puzzle page&lt;/a&gt;! There, staring right back at you, you’ll find three clear indications that transhuman aliens from the future dimensions of light have visited the Red Planet and have left us signposts/warnings/idols/guaranteed-money-makers-if-you-yell-loudly-enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll have hours of fun here, but be warned: when you finally put the pieces together, you’ll have an actual coherent picture. Don’t be scared, though.

Is there ever a circumstance in which it is okay to &lt;em&gt;abuse&lt;/em&gt; your children? I’m not referring to the debate over spanking—I’m talking about laws that are currently enacted in certain states that allow parents to physically abuse and murder their children because of a specific circumstance: religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/06/30/courts_face_new_challenges_in_faith_healing_cases/?rss_id=Boston.com+--+Local+news"&gt;This AP article&lt;/a&gt; explores the challenges that face courts trying cases involving parents who neglect their children’s health and well-being because of religious beliefs. Many states have exemptions for these parents that absolve them of their sins because they once read a book that said thinking really hard in an upward direction would cure their children’s ailments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, it was not enough to have Pentecostal and Jehovah’s Witness parents literally getting away with murder. According to the article, religious exemptions are only now being publicly questioned because more people are claiming these exemptions apply to their less-popular belief systems, such as those found online:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregory P. Isaacs, an attorney for [appropriately named Universal Life Church child-murderer] Crank, who’s out on bond, argues that Tennessee’s religious exemption law is untested and too vague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It really has a tremendous amount of problems,” Isaacs said. “What is an organized religion and what is an ordained minister? What illnesses can you attempt to heal by faith? Those are the two pitfalls in the statute. That’s not what’s really clear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That this question even needs to be asked is, to me, remarkable. It is never okay to neglect a child’s health. Crank’s daughter died with a “tumor the size of a basketball” on her shoulder. &lt;em&gt;It does not matter&lt;/em&gt; what religion Crank is and how many other people in the world buy into the same delusion, and it doesn’t matter how long ago her holy books were written. If Jesus Himself descended from the heavens and knocked on Crank’s door accompanied by a choir of angels and the Pope and Moses and Bill Donohue and a crowd of paparazzi, and commanded her to withhold medical treatment from her daughter, it is Crank’s duty as a parent to kick Jesus in the sack and go to the hospital. If she doesn’t, she is not fit to be a parent or a free human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are those out there who have a rational outlook on the question of religious exemptions. The article mentions Rita Swan, director of &lt;a href="http://www.childrenshealthcare.org/"&gt;Children’s Healthcare is a Legal Duty&lt;/a&gt;, an organization focused on abolishing those exemptions nationwide. She gets the best quote in the entire article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the Wisconsin case, Swan said legislators there are considering a bill that would repeal the state’s religious exemption to its child abuse and neglect law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the U.S. under the First Amendment, we’re not supposed to be establishing religion or carving out any preferences for prestigious religions,” Swan said. “The courts should not be giving any kind of deference to established denominations and making any distinctions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t agree more.

It’s worth watching:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;




&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About some people’s total credulity when it comes to ridiculous doomsday scenarios, Neil says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a profound absence of awareness of … how nature works. They’re missing some science classes in their training in high school or in college that would empower you to understand and to judge when someone else is basically full of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually disagree with Neil here; it’s not that students missed that part of science class, it’s that &lt;em&gt;it was never taught in science class to start with&lt;/em&gt;. It’s very, very rare that science is taught as a &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt;, as a way of knowing. Instead, it’s taught like a compendium of facts, as dry as a dictionary, and like a dictionary only pulled out when needed. In fact, the methods of science are a way of understanding everything in the whole Universe, and so can be used all the time, whether it’s when you’re deciding to eat a sandwich or when you’re trying to figure out why gamma-ray burst beams are collimated so tightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being skeptical, asking for evidence, examining that evidence, and diagnosing it compared to the whole of learning that goes on around it is the way to go. That’s how you distinguish sense from nonsense. It takes work, and sometimes hard work, but it’s worth it. The prize is understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I do agree strongly with Neil when he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sceince is basically an inoculation against charlatans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew it was coming. It had to. History was on my side. My quarry was nutty, but in a way exceedingly predictable. it wasn't so much that I knew exactly what he would do. He wasn't predictable in that way. It was that I knew he would do something crazy. Actually, on second thought, I did know what he was going to do. I had only to consider how ghoulishly he treated &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/the_ghouls_descend_upon_the_corpse.php"&gt;Tony Snow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/08/the_latest_scummy_tactic.php"&gt;Bernie Mac&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/023434.html"&gt;Tim Russert&lt;/a&gt; and how he leapt at the opportunity to abuse &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/a_ghoul_descends_upon_christina_applegat.php"&gt;Christina Applegate&lt;/a&gt;. To him, when a dying celebrity like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/abusing_celebrities_with_cancer_to_sell.php"&gt;Patrick Swayze&lt;/a&gt; rejected quackery, it was more than he could stand. Whenever celebrities suffer from serious diseases cancer and especially when they die, he is there, looking for any opening to blame their suffering and death on that evil "allopathic" scientific medicine. And there were two major deaths last week. Both were big, but one was really, really big. I'm talking Elvis big. Best of all for him, one of them died of cancer and the other died mysteriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew my quarry would have a hard time resisting one of them, but I knew there was no way he could resist the death of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's right. You guessed it. That quack promoter supreme, that man for whom no quackery is too wild or improbable to embrace wholeheartedly, that master of hyperbole and lover of bad Hitler analogies and even worse cartoons, Mike Adams, creator of NaturalNews.com, has decided to apply his investigatory prowess to the recent deaths of Farrah Fawcett and Michael Jackson, labeling them "&lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/026511_cancer_chemotherapy_doctors.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;the latest celebrity victims of big pharma&lt;/a&gt;." Let me tell you, it's vintage Adams, which means it's vintage alt-med crazy turned up not just to 11 but to 20 and beyond:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(NaturalNews) That Michael Jackson and Farrah Fawcett both died in the last 48 hours is shocking news to many, but it's not nearly as surprising as the fact that they were both killed by Big Pharma's toxic drugs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you understand why, although I despise the message Adams promotes, I still can't help but check his website from time and derive enormous entertainment value from the sheer looniness found there.

&lt;p&gt;Our newest machine is also the only one that's still working flawlessly. A little 2008 LG netbook, it runs Win XP and Ubuntu linux and is mainly used by Junior as a gaming machine. When travelling, my wife and I like to bring it along for its handy dimensions and slight weight, but the dinky screen doesn't lend itself to everyday computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dear 2005 Dell laptop, on which I type these lines, is barely holding together. Its recently renewed Win XP installation is flaky, booting up with an arcane error message and unable to complete the installation of service packs. It just bluescreened on me for the first time. The machine's also starting to become amnesiac about its hardware, having forgotten that it has built-in wifi and sound circuitry. And its battery life is all too brief these days. But there's something about a computer you've used so much that the case's white plastic is showing through the silver-metallic coating in a pattern that mimics your hands...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family workhorse, a 2004 Dell desktop machine, is currently in a coma after I tried to upgrade to a larger main hard drive and install the most recent Ubuntu version. All our data are apparently still intact on the machine's original smaller hard drive, but neither of the two is bootable at present and there's something weird going on that causes Ubuntu to freeze half-way when I try to boot from a CD. To migrate that data I'll probably have to install the smaller drive into my dad's old computer and then jury rig some ethernet cable connection to the computer's successor. Or install Win XP on the large new drive, which would be a short-term solution since that operating system has an alarming tendency for each installation to degrade steadily in performance until the machine becomes unusable. And the overhead of the fucking virus protection software is a nuisance. Luckily I have all my important stuff on a dav server elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computer that nobody ever uses is my extra mom's 2001 Dell laptop. It's actually not that bad though. Its battery is completely dead so every time you start it you have to tell it what year it is, and it couldn't use its wifi card after I installed Win XP, so I put the card in the 2005 laptop to replace the circuitry that machine's forgotten that it has. But as our computers go, and considering its age, the 2001 laptop is pretty good. It's actually our second-quietest machine, and the operating system shows no apparent glitches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it a bit infuriating the way old computers become &lt;i&gt;unpredictable&lt;/i&gt;. I could sort of understand them breaking down catastrophically due to corrosion of the power supply's wiring or failing of the ball bearings in the hard drive. But shouldn't the microcircuitry be kind of WORK or NOT WORK, instead of starting to act capriciously? Maybe it's a question of operating systems co-evolving with the hardware, so that when you run the on-line upgrades to your old machine it gets saddled with an OS that is actually intended to run on a slightly different (and much faster) machine. But just as the mechanical parts tend to work or not work at all, I expect the electronics to do likewise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/06/tech_note_our_crappy_computers.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/wE0bt9jmpAY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246366185424"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=567">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3c107f3c299daf26</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><title type="html">Toyota Gets In The Game</title><published>2009-06-30T12:06:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-30T12:06:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=567" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In April of this year &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=508"&gt;I wrote about Honda’s &lt;/a&gt;press release announcing that they had made some breakthroughs in the area of mental control of robots. On close inspection it seemed that Honda had not accomplished anything that other researchers weren’t already doing, so they were essentially announcing that they were in the game. Well, not another Japanese car manufacturer is in the game also - Toyota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Toyota-technology-has-brain-apf-2893135796.html?x=0&amp;amp;.v=1"&gt;They announced &lt;/a&gt;that they have developed a system that allows a person to control a wheelchair with their thoughts alone.  The system allows a person to make the chair go right, left, or forward with thoughts alone. Curiously, in order to stop the chair a traditional puffer control is still needed (where the operator controls the chair by puffing into a tube).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nothing new - devising a system that can distinguish among three brain states is fairly crude. Obviously they could not make it distinguish a fourth to command the chair to stop. But Toyota needs their distinguishing feature - something to put in the press release to make their technology seem like a breakthrough. So, they tell us, theirs is the fastest system yet. While other systems take several seconds to process the thought commands, their system accomplishes this task in 125 milliseconds (thousandths of a second). That is fast enough to give the feel of instantaneous control. In fact the response time of the brain itself, from thought to action, is about 100 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is an incremental advance at best, it does sound like a legitimate advance. But more interesting is that we now have two large corporations investing in research into mental control of machines. They add to the research groups at &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=305"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59791-2004Dec12.html"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; who have also made headlines with their research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Pittsburgh has a suite of labs that are working on the various aspects of robotic mental control. At the &lt;a href="http://motorlab.neurobio.pitt.edu/"&gt;Motorlab&lt;/a&gt; their research if focusing on correlating patterns of cortical activation with motor control in three-dimensional space. At the &lt;a href="http://www.engr.pitt.edu/cui/"&gt;NTE&lt;/a&gt; lab, they are researching the interface between neural tissue and “smart biomaterials,” as well as neural tissue engineering. So they are working on the interface between brain and machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href="http://www.engr.pitt.edu/rnel/Research/NeuralProstheses/NeuralProstheses.html"&gt;Rehab Neural EngineeringLab&lt;/a&gt; they are working on decoding the sensory feedback given to the brain from limbs during movement. This research could close the loop - allowing users to feel their prosthetic limb, which would greatly enhance control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although not mentioned on their site, there is straight neuroscience research which is discovering the neural activity that correlates with the brain’s sense of ownership over a body part - the sense that a body part belongs to you. So it is very plausible that in the future not only would a brain-machine interface allow a user to control a robotic limb, but also to feel it, receive information from the limb regarding its position and the tension on its “muscles”, and also feel as if it is part of their body. This is Six Million Dollar Man territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all very exciting. As the Neuro Rehab website says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a rapidly growing brain-computer-interface (BCI)         community working to develop methods of extracting and         processing neural signals for directly controlling devices         such as cmputers or prosthetic systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we also have large corporations like Honda and Toyota in the game - which is a sign that a technology is poised to move out of the lab and into the market. These companies say they have not plans to market any particular technology, they are just doing technology research.  This is clear from the crude devices they are demonstrating. But it means that we are beyond the basic university level research into developing technological applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must also remind ourselves that while this technology is steadily progressing, and has already made interesting advances, it is probably years away from the simplest applications and decades away from any mature applications, like fully functional neuro-prosthetic limbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the one downside to tracking new and exciting technology in its early phase - you have to wait years to decades before the promised applications emerge. It’s like seeing an awesome movie preview a decade before the release date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Thursday evening nearly 70 members of the Ohio State Alumni Club of Hardin County, as well as community members, saw an animated presentation by [Jerry] Lucas on the new way he plans on revolutionizing learning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Lucas, now 69, said he's been involved in memory training his entire life. As a boy he invented mind games to keep himself entertained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Through conditioning his mind with new ways to learn and memorize things, Lucas has established the Lucas Learning System. The system focuses on linking visuals with things that don't have an identity, such as pronouns and Arkansas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;To remember a pronoun, Lucas created an image of a Catholic nun with a golf club. She was a professional golf player, hence pro-nun. Lucas ingrains that image in the mind, so every time you hear pronoun, you see the visual.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But wait, I thought,  how does that golfing nun hook up with an &lt;em&gt;antecedent?&lt;/em&gt; I had no trouble coming up with a concrete sound-alike for &lt;em&gt;antecedent&lt;/em&gt; — &amp;quot;ant a seed ant&amp;quot;, two ants fighting over a seed, get it? But I failed to come up with a memorable story to connect the nun and the ants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I tried web search, that modern aid to creativity as well as memory. Looking for &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=nun+ant&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi=g1"&gt;{nun ant}&lt;/a&gt; sent me off on various false trails, including the vernacular spelling of &lt;em&gt;aint&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; ("You ant seen nun yet dis jus tha beginning!!!!!") and the uncyclopdia article on &lt;a href="http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Vampire_ants"&gt;Vampire Ants&lt;/a&gt; (who prey on virgin nun ants).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for things related to nuns and pronouns turned up &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OCEweX1U3MEC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lieutenant Nun: Transgenerism, Lesbian Desire, &amp;amp; Catalina de Erauso&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ("It seems neither fair nor accurate, however, to use exclusively feminine pronouns to refer to the Nun-Lieutenant, who worked so diligently to make herself into a man"), and also  "&lt;a href="http://doctormemory.com/html/lucas_learning_system_explained.html"&gt;The Lucas Learning System Revealed&lt;/a&gt;", which asserted again the value of the "sound-alike word system", without explaining what it's good for other than turning a hard problem (learning the words &lt;em&gt;pronoun&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;antecedent&lt;/em&gt;) into another hard problem (making up a memorable story about nuns, golf, ants, and seeds, or whatever):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[I]f you read the list: cat, horse, cow or dog, you will immediately visualize each word as you read it. It’s automatic. Your mind simply develops a mental image. However, intangible words like "pronoun" cannot be visualized. Such words do not create an automatic picture in your mind. Doctor Memory has solved this problem with a sound-alike word system that makes intangible words tangible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually the web provided an answer, or at least an account of how visualizing a pronoun as a golfing nun could possibly be helpful. Alexander Wolff, "&lt;a href="http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1029059/index.htm"&gt;Thanks For The Memory&lt;/a&gt;", Sports Illustrated, 6/30/2003, described Lucas's stump speech in more detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Audaciously, he has applied visualized learning to even the least concrete concepts. "How many of you have seen a pronoun?" he asks. "If a pronoun ran down the aisle and jumped on this podium, would you say, 'Why, that's a pronoun! I haven't seen one for four days!' "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In fact, Lucas has seen a pronoun and, with the help of an artist, rendered it. She's a golf pro in a nun's habit—a pro nun. She does many things, among them serve on a team of Lucas's devising, the Capitalize Team. Like her teammates she wears a cap graced with elongated eyes (cap-tall-eyes), and there, in a cartoon tableau, she's teeing off on an eyeball. It's an absurd image, but just wacky enough to make us never forget that we capitalize the pronoun I.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I get it. No ants, just eyes. Capitalizing &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; must be more of a problem than I realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I'm sceptical that the Capitalize Team is really going to help restore America to grammatical literacy. But wait, maybe the Lieutenant Nun can join Dick Cheney and Joe Biden in a game of pick-up basketball, and straighten out everybody's confusions about the passive &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;vice&lt;/span&gt; voice. . . Um, no, never mind.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246364951186"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/clocktutorial_2_basic_concepts_3.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/deacce7389b0f16d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Tutorials"/><title type="html">ClockTutorial #2: Basic Concepts and Terms</title><published>2009-06-30T11:23:52Z</published><updated>2009-06-30T11:23:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/W-eBP0MH0Uk/clocktutorial_2_basic_concepts_3.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/clocktutorial_2_basic_concepts_3.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://circadiana.blogspot.com/2005/01/clocktutorial-2-basic-concepts-and.html" title=" ClockTutorial #2: Basic Concepts and Terms"&gt;&lt;img alt="From the Archives" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2006/06/ClockWeb%20logo2.JPG" width="104" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Alvaro is hosting a series of conferences this year in celebration of Darwin’s 200th birthday called “&lt;a href="http://www.fundacioncienciayevolucion.cl/category/en/"&gt;Ciencia y Evolución&lt;/a&gt;” (Science and Evolution).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Darwin spent nearly a third of his 5-year voyage around the world in Chile (1/3? Wow, who knew?), Alvaro thought it appropriate to host a conference there on evolutionary everything, with three different events (May on medicine and evolution, June on economics and evolution, July on politics and evolution, and September on everything Darwin with a veritable who’s who of evolutionary theory). Next week I’ll blog about the wickedly interesting conversations between the three of us evolutionary economists: myself (a libertarian atheist), Kevin McCabe (a conservative Catholic from George Mason University who does neuroeconomics), and Ulrich Wit from the Max Planck Institute in Jena, Germany (a socialist economist). Suffice it to say that the dinner conversations, along with the public debate, saw fireworks. More on that later.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I had heard that Chile has one of the largest telescope arrays in the world, Alvaro was kind enough to hook me up with Dr. Massimo Terenghi, who orchestrated the design, construction, and implementation of the Paranal observatory, which houses four 8.2 meter telescopes and four smaller meter-size telescopes, plus the architectural-award winning hotel/living quarters for the astronomers and staff, featured in the latest Bond flick, &lt;a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=NPWZsaxViDE&amp;amp;offerid=146261&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;tmpid=1826&amp;amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252FWebObjects%252FMZStore.woa%252Fwa%252FviewMovie%253Fid%253D304003911%2526s%253D143441%2526uo%253D6%2526partnerId%253D30" title="OPEN in iTunes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quantum of Solace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. After my talks, Massimo and I flew from Santiago two hours north to Antofagasta, then drove two hours inland through the Atacama desert, one of the driest places on Earth, then made the climb up the mountain to this amazing cluster of buildings and telescopes. (See the photo gallery below that accompanies this commentary.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Massimo was 14 he had a thriving stamp collection for which he was so dedicated that his grades collapsed, so his mom put the collection away and gave Massimo a book to read and told him to get serious about learning. The book was on astronomy and he’s never looked back, blasting through his education at the University of Milan with a doctoral degree in theoretical astrophysics, completing his dissertation on gamma radiation from the galactic core. He then moved to Arizona where he participated in the first research on the large-scale distribution of galaxies throughout the universe (that spidery/soap bubbly model of galaxy distribution we’ve all seen on countless science channel shows). Massimo then returned to Europe to co-found the European Organization for Astronomy in the Southern Hemisphere (ESO) and began scouting for a high dry place to look at the heavens. Enter Chile and the Atacama desert, where humidity hovers around 5% and it never rains (unlike Southern California where, despite the song, it rains way too often for astronomers with no time to spare). Seriously, this place is in the middle of nowhere. It looks exactly like Mars, except it has a blue sky and a paved road. Just Google Earth “Paranal Observatory” and you’ll see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How sophisticated are these telescopes? The astronomers are not even allowed in the domes at night! These telescopes are so complicated that they are run by engineers trained to do nothing but drive these puppies every night from a control center. Analogy: observing a solar eclipse from a 747 doesn’t mean that you also know how to fly the 747. &lt;em&gt;That’s&lt;/em&gt; what these telescopes are like, with hundreds of computers that micro-adjust the mirrors and coordinate 1, 2, 3, or even 4 of the 8.2 meter telescopes at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How big are these mirrors? The #1 telescope in the Shermer Telescope Ranking System (STRS) is Mt. Wilson’s 100-inch Hooker telescope, from which Edwin Hubble discovered that the Milky Way galaxy is just one of billions of galaxies that are all expanding away from one another. (That’s how you get a space telescope named after yourself!) The ESO telescopes are 8.2 meters = 26.9028 feet = 322.8 inches, or over &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; times the size of the Hooker, &lt;em&gt;and there’s four of them&lt;/em&gt;!!! Believe me when I tell you, I was not dumb enough to ask where the eyepiece was on these babies. But if they did put an eyepiece on one of them, and you pointed it at the moon where Apollo 11 landed 40 years ago next month, just before you went blind you would be able to see the lunar landing base (the bottom of the LEM). Now that’s a telescope!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, suffice it to say, I was in good hands for my visit to this cosmic Mecca, and we made good use of the travel time to discuss the Big Questions in life, including God: Massimo is a believer. And not in Einstein’s/Spinoza’s deistic god, but Yahweh, the God of Abraham. Why? After admitting that his beliefs are undoubtedly influenced by his Italian Catholic upbringing, as a professional astronomer he is continually struck by the remarkable beauty and magnificent grandeur of the cosmos, which his reason and intuition tell him could not have come about through natural forces alone. Of course I countered with the multiverse argument, and we reviewed the various points pro-and-con about the likelihood of life evolving elsewhere in the cosmos and what this might mean for religion and theology. (Massimo is convinced that virtually every star we will be studying with the upcoming space-based and ground-based telescopes will have planets, and that surely there is intelligent life elsewhere in the cosmos.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such conversations should, this one ended with two friends finding mutual respect for different positions, because life is too short. We had a lively dialogue on our way down the mountain and I feel exceptionally fortunate to have made the acquaintance of Massimo Terenghi, one of the most interesting people I have met in my travels. And I promised him that the next time he comes to Southern California that I would take him to the #1 telescope in the world…. &lt;/p&gt;

We are now living in the anthropocene, when so many people  exist that that we are affecting the planet's functions. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations have been changing rapidly in recent decades, along with changes in temperature, and the fact of the matter is that the changes in the chemical composition of the atmosphere are causally connected to changes in temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He showed long term records of 450,000 years of temperature and chemistry, which show regular changes in temperature and chemical composition, even of regular cycles of change. But recent changes are much larger, and the changes in the last century were not expected from known natural causes — they don&amp;#39;t fit the prior pattern. Only pseudoscientific (he was not at all mealy-mouthed: yes, he called the people who question anthropogenic change to be pseudoscientific) papers currently question the causal relationship of human activities to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some events that should give us pause. The glaciers feeding China&amp;#39;s rivers are shrinking, and the Tibetan plateau has important role in climate of China — what happens when China&amp;#39;s huge population faces major droughts? He mentioned specific events like Katrina, the exreme weather events. We can&amp;#39;t tell for certain that an individual event is climate change related, but statistics show a pattern of increasing events, such as wildfires and droughts. 400 million people are living under extreme drought conditions, and very dry land has increased worldwide in a short period of time: 15% of land was so classified in 1970, but it&amp;#39;s now up to 30% in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trends show that greenhouse gases are increasing. What needs to be done? We need a revolution in the way society functions to prevent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from rising abouve 350-450 ppm. Can it be done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Molina is generally optimistic. He thinks that we can limit CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with existing technologies. His recipe is improved fuel economy, more efficient builidongs, improved power plant efficiency, substituting natural gas for coal, using carbon capture and storage, developing alternative power sources (nuclear, wind, solar, biofuels), and forest management. We need to do ALL, there will not be a single magic bullet that solves the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He argues that we are not running out of fossil fuels (there is lots of coal), but we are running out of oil. However, we will run out of atmospheric capacity to cope with emissions before we run out of oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are playing a game, like roulette. We are gambling: to win, a policy should result in a temp increase of less than 2° C. What policy does is shift the probabilities of winning -- we are paying to move from one roulette wheel with bad odds to another with lower risk. We want to buy stabilization of probabilities and reduce uncertainty, and it&amp;#39;s not that expensive. An investment of a few percent of GDP produces a big improvement of our odds. He compared it to a hypothetical airplane trip. If you were told you could board a plane right now that has a 10% chance of both engines failing, or you could wait a few hours to take a different plane that cost 10% more but had a negligible chance of engine failure, which would you do? For most of us, the choice is simple, since the first plane has a good chance of catastrophic failure, and we&amp;#39;d rather avoid that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less optimistically, he brought up the possibility of tipping points and the instability of the system. It is a big worry that we have a risk of entering practically irreversible modes: he gave the example of melting of arctic summer ice, since once the ice cap is gone, it is not trivial to restore it. Some tipping points may occur relatively soon. We are at risk of catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ended with simple actions we should take now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put a price on carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increase investment in energy tech research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Expand international cooperation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Emphasize win-win solutions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big problem is that right now 3/4ths of the planet is striving to reach the ecoonomic standards of the developed countries — they should, and they have every right to aspire to it, but it is physically impossible for them to do it with the same wasteful strategies of the developed nations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/mario_molina_energy_and_climat.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/xmXTKZvUlP8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246356141881"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/aaron_ciechanover_drug_discove.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/03a52ecd0811e87c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Lindau"/><title type="html">Aaron Ciechanover: Drug discovery and biomedical research in the 21st century: the third revolution</title><published>2009-06-30T10:48:45Z</published><updated>2009-06-30T10:48:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/Z6G-9fOnXBE/aaron_ciechanover_drug_discove.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/aaron_ciechanover_drug_discove.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first few talks this morning focused primarily on policy as illuminated by science; only the third talk was pure science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chiechanover's talk was on both the history and future of drug research, which he characterized in terms of three major revolutions in the last century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first revolution was a period of accidental discoveries in 1930s-1960s, where the discovery of a useful drug comes first, by observation of therapeutic effects, followed by chemical isolation, and only at the end (if at all), is the mechanism of action worked out. He gave the example of aspirin. Willow tree bark used for pain relief since at least Aristotle, but the active agent (salicylin) was only isolated in the 19th century by Buchner, and it was initially useless medically: it was water-insoluble and extremely bitter. Gerhard acetylated it to make it soluble near the end of the 19th century (but didn't take advantage of it as a clinical tool), and Hoffman (who made Bayer rich) repeated the acetylation and turned it into a useful drug, using it to treat his father, who was sick with arthritis.  It's mechanism, as an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, was  not discovered until the late 20th century. The drug also prevents platelet aggregation, so is also being used in heart disease prevention, and its anti-inflammatory action may also make it a preventative for some cancers. However, it is a story of complete serendipity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of fortuitous discovery was Fleming's penicillin, which was a major factor in nearly doubling human lifespan in about a century, and antibiotics in general opened up the potential for all kinds of life-saving procedures, such as surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Second revolution occurred in the 1970s-2000s, and was planned. The key innovation here is high throughput, brute force screening of large libraries of chemical compounds, which he compared to "fishing in a swamp". We have no idea what we'll find, but there is the expectation that some compound will be found that will have a useful effect. It is a procedure that still relies serendipity, we've merely elevated the chances of finding something, and of exploiting it rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example given was the work of Akira Endo, who knew that fungi were resistant to parasites, presumably because they contained agents to suppress bacterial cell wall synthesis by inhibiting cholesterol production. His work led to the discovery of statins, which has become a $20 billion/year industry for reducing to cholesterol levels in patients with heart disease. It has also been found to reduce the probability of heart attacks in patients who only have susceptibility for heart disease, and is now being used as a preventative in healthy patients (which is always a great way to vastly increase profits). It may also help with Alzheimers and malignancies, by mechanisms not currently known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third revolution is ongoing. The new strategy is understanding the mechanism first, followed by targeted design. He illustrated the problem with current pharmaceuticals by pointing out that men with prostate cancer and women with breast cancer are treated with the same tools: imaging technology, histology, and chemotherapy. These are different diseases! At the same time, two women may be diagnosed with breast cancer, but one will be estrogen sensitive and the other will be estrogen insensitive, which means that an effective treatment for one may be a lethal waste of time for the other. We aren't treating the disease specifically, but are using a one-treatment-fits-all formula for for general disease. What we need is a molecular diagnosis of tumors to fit treatment plans individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He thinks we are entering an era of personalized medicine. One example he gave was herceptin, which is an antibody targeted for the EGF receptor. People with a mutant, constitutively active EGF receptor are susceptible to certain kinds of cancers, so this is a very useful drug for down-regulating EGF activity. But for people with wild-type receptors, it's completely useless. The utility of this drug relies on diagnosis by PCR of specific alleles to find candidates for drug use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sees great promise in cheaper whole genome sequencing as an important tool for personalized medicine, and is looking forward to the days of the thousand-dollar genome. He also advocates a systems approach: interdisciplinary action will be needed to put together useful solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems he foresees with personalized, targeted therapies are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multigenic deseases. Most of these diseases and susceptibilities aren't going to be the product of single alleles, but of multiple, interacting genes. That means answers won't be simple, but will require an understanding of combinatorial effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malignancies are typically the product of genomic instability. They are moving targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complications of human experimentation. We can't just pin down patients and run them through a series of carefully controlled trials, so working out the effective details of personalized medicine are going to be hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of good animal models. A mouse is not a human. We can't do the necessary experiments on people, but at the same time we can't entirely trust the results of animal experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costs and legal liabilities. Medicine is done for profit. How do you pay for tools that work on tiny percentages of the population?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bioethical problems. Information has repercussions. How do individuals cope with the knowledge that they might have, for instance, elevated susceptibility to breast cancer? How will it affect their relationships with family and spouses (or prospective mates)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This was a good talk, but very, very general. I'm hoping we get some more scientific meat in other talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, the way the meetings are run at Lindau is a little different than I&amp;#39;m used to — there is no Q&amp;amp;A afterwards! However, what they do instead is schedule small group meetings with the Nobelist speakers and the &amp;quot;Young Investigator&amp;quot; group of attendees, to which people here as press (like me!) are not invited, which is too bad from my point of view, but is probably a very good way to give people with more direct interests good access to the speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;This may not be helpful but the things I wish I knew about Dr. Isis' alter ego include: Where/how did you grow up? Where did you go to school? How did you become interested in science? And in your particular area of research? What struggles have you faced? How have you been lucky? Do you have pets? What do you do for fun/hobbies (I guess you won't be able to say blog)? How have you been an advocate for women in science? For science literacy? Community outreach/activities? What are you thoughts about teaching? What/who inspires you? How does your creative process work in the context of your scientific work? Where would you like to see science (in general) and your work (in particular) be in the future? Talk about some mistakes you've made and some "eureka" moments. Talk about your family. And, go ahead, talk about your shoes. (But know that if you do, people WILL figure out who you are.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be honest and personal. People really dig this kind of stuff. I know I do. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catharine believes you all will dig it if I am honest and personal.  To be honest and probably too personal with you all, Dr. Isis left work today at 4pm, trusting the day's experiments to the capable members of the lab, because for the first time in easily 10 years she has cramps.  The domestic and laboratory goddess has spent the evening cuddled with a bottle of Motrin, 1.5 quarts (and, by the way, what the balls happened to the regular sized cartons of ice cream? This is missing 0.5 quarts) of &lt;a href="http://www.onsecondscoop.com/2009/04/breyers-waffle-cone-overload.html"&gt;Breyers waffle cone ice cream&lt;/a&gt;, and the second season of &lt;a href="http://www.sho.com/site/tudors/home.do"&gt;The Tudors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/06/isis_does_a_good_deed_gets_cal/body-language-6_300.jpg" alt="body-language-6_300.jpg" height="357" width="300"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://img4.realsimple.com/images/health/preventative/0804/body-language-6_300.jpg"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;:  Isis's cramps, except in her uterus and with hotter shoes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still believe that opening up and being personal can be of value to women trying to figure out a life in science, but opening up and being personal can also place you square in the cross hairs of criticism and judgment.   This week, for example, Dr. Isis founder herself swiftly judged.  Oh, so swiftly judged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Vaccines don't cause Autism.  Mercury in vaccines didn't cause Autism.  Jenny McCarthy's son was vaccinated after mercury was removed from the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.  Autism rates haven't dropped as a result of mercury being removed from vaccines.  Autism rates are the same in vaccinated and non-vaccinated kids.  There are big studies around the world showing this to be true.  They are the best science we have and science is our only hope in solving this.  Chip Denman said it best,  (Forgive my paraphrasing) "Science is not a smorgasbord.  You don't pick and choose what you want to believe.  You sit down and take what you're served."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism rates won't be changed by Jim Carrey or Jenny McCarthy but there will be dead and injured people as a result of their anti-vaccine campaign.  Some people claim there already are: &lt;a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/Jenny_McCarthy_Body_Count/Home.html."&gt;jennymccarthybodycount.com&lt;/a&gt; Read about measles, mumps and rubella and the damage they did before vaccines.  We've forgotten the damage these diseases and others brought before vaccines.  Ask your grandmother.  If we stop the vaccines the Center for Disease Control thinks we'll have 2.7 million deaths worldwide annually from measles alone.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jrefmail@randi.org (Michael Goudeau)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246351005491"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/support_the_idea_fairness_restoration_act">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a8287872b561cb5a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Support the IDEA Fairness Restoration Act</title><published>2009-06-30T08:21:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-30T08:21:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/support_the_idea_fairness_restoration_act" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://idea.ed.gov/images/splash_screen_muted_2.jpg" height="160" alt="Building the Legacy of IDEA 2004 from http://idea.ed.gov/images/splash_screen_muted_2.jpg" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-right:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="210"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The IDEA Fairness Restoration Act (&lt;a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.2740:"&gt;HR 2740&lt;/a&gt;) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on June 4 by Congressman Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Congressman Pete Sessions of Texas. The bills amends &lt;a href="http://idea.ed.gov/"&gt;IDEA&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...permit a prevailing party in an action or proceeding brought to enforce the Act to be awarded expert witness fees and certain other expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, when parents go to due process in order to get appropriate services for a child under IDEA, they would be allowed to have a school district pay for expert witnesses called in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under IDEA, students with disabilities are guaranteed a free and appropriate education until the age of 21. In 1986, Congress adopted legislation that was meant to allow prevailing parents to recover their expert witness fees in due process cases filed against school districts. However, in 2006, a Supreme Court decision, &lt;i&gt;Arlington Central School District v. Murphy&lt;/i&gt;, said that parents would not be able to recover these costs. That is, if parents now wish to seek an expert witness to build their case, they cannot seek to have these fees provided for by the school district. This in effect means that many families will not be able to provide their child with a free and appropriate education, as they are in effect prevented from building their case sufficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR 2470 restores the original intent of IDEA. In the &lt;a href="http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=ED283337"&gt;Handicapped Children's Protection Act of 1986&lt;/a&gt;, Congress intended that parents be able to recover their expert witness fees. It can cost thousands of dollars to hire qualified medical, educational and other expert witnesses. If parents have no choice but to shoulder these costs, due process---and the chance to provide a child with disabilities with the education and accommodations they need and that is their right. At &lt;a href="http://www.asdworld.com/2009/06/26/idea-fairness-restoration-act-seeks-funds-for-iep-experts/"&gt;ASD World&lt;/a&gt; you can read some accounts of how students' educations have been affected by the Murphy decision such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; From a Special Education Advocate in the Midwest, “Since Arlington, I have had no fewer than three clients who had to withdraw their request for a hearing, and no fewer than five clients who wanted to request a hearing but did not, due to the fact that they could not afford witness fees and costs.”  She explained how one of her clients had become deeply depressed because he was powerless to to stop the school district from denying his children the educational services they needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/ask_your_congressperson_to_support_the_idea_fairness_restoration_act"&gt;action&lt;/a&gt; by contacting your Congressperson to support the &lt;a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.2740:"&gt;IDEA Fairness Restoration Act&lt;/a&gt; and to support students with disabilities and their families like mine and yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.2740:"&gt;text&lt;/a&gt; of the bill:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A BILL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To amend the &lt;a href="http://idea.ed.gov/"&gt;Individuals with Disabilities Education Act&lt;/a&gt; to permit a prevailing party in an action or proceeding brought to enforce the Act to be awarded expert witness fees and certain other expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Act may be cited as the `IDEA Fairness Restoration Act'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEC. 2. INCLUSION OF EXPERT WITNESS FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES AS ATTORNEYS' FEES.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) In General- Section 615(i)(3) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1415(i)(3)) is amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:&lt;br&gt;
`(H) INCLUSION OF EXPERT WITNESS FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES AS ATTORNEYS' FEES- For the purposes of this paragraph, the term `attorneys' fees' shall include the fees of expert witnesses, including the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation necessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian's case in the action or proceeding.'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) Effective Date- The amendment made by subsection (a) shall apply to any action or proceeding brought under section 615 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1415) that has not been finally adjudicated as of the date of the enactment of this Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246349982635"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=543">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b8abc81cf87d5a6e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clinical Trials"/><category term="Cancer"/><category term="false positives"/><category term="Mammography"/><category term="screening tests"/><title type="html">Screening Tests – Cumulative Incidence of False Positives</title><published>2009-06-30T08:00:01Z</published><updated>2009-06-30T08:00:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=543" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to think of medical tests as black and white. If the test is positive, you have the disease; if it’s negative, you don’t. Even good clinicians sometimes fall into that trap. Based on the pre-test probability of the disease, a positive test result only increases the probability by a variable amount. An example: if the probability that a patient has a pulmonary embolus (based on symptoms and physical findings) is 10% and you do a D-dimer test, a positive result raises the probability of PE to 17% and a negative result lowers it to 0.2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even something as simple as a throat culture for strep throat can be misleading. It’s possible to have a positive culture because you happen to be an asymptomatic strep carrier, while your current symptoms of fever and sore throat are actually due to a virus. Not to mention all the things that might have gone wrong in the lab: a mix-up of specimens, contamination, inaccurate recording…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mammography is widely used to screen for breast cancer. Most patients and even some doctors think that if you have a positive mammogram you almost certainly have breast cancer. Not true. A positive result actually means the patient has about a 10% chance of cancer. 9 out of 10 positives are false positives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But women don’t just get one mammogram. They get them every year or two. After 3 mammograms, 18% of women will have had a false positive. After ten exams, the rate rises to 49.1%. In &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/338/16/1089"&gt;a study of 2400 women &lt;/a&gt;who had an average of 4 mammograms over a 10 year period, the false positive tests led to 870 outpatient appointments, 539 diagnostic mammograms, 186 ultrasound examinations, 188 biopsies, and 1 hospitalization. There &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17404352?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=4&amp;amp;log$=relatedreviews&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;are also concerns &lt;/a&gt;about changes in behavior and psychological wellbeing following false positives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, no one had looked at the cumulative incidence of false positives from other cancer screening tests. &lt;a href="http://www.annfammed.org/cgi/content/full/7/3/212"&gt;A new study in the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.annfammed.org/cgi/content/full/7/3/212"&gt;Annals of Family Medicine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has done just that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They took advantage of the ongoing Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial to gather their data. In this large controlled trial (over 150,000 subjects), men randomized to screening were offered chest x-rays, flexible sigmoidoscopies, digital rectal examinations and PSA blood tests. Women were offered CA-125 blood tests for cancer antigen, transvaginal sonograms, chest x-rays, and flexible sigmoidoscopies. During the 3-year study period, a total of 14 screening tests were possible for each sex. The subjects didn’t all get every test.By the 4th screening test, the risk of false positives was 37% for men and 26% for women. By the 14th screening test, 60% of men and 49% of women had had false positives. This led to invasive diagnostic procedures in 29% of men and 22% of women. 3% were minimally invasive (like endoscopy), 15.8% were moderately invasive (like biopsy) and 1.6% involved major surgical procedures (like hysterectomy). The rate of invasive procedures varied by screening test: 3% of screened women underwent a major surgical procedure for false-positive findings on a transvaginal sonogram.These numbers do not include non-invasive diagnostic procedures, imaging studies, office visits. They do not address the psychological impact of false positives. And they do not address the cost of further testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data should not be over-interpreted. They don’t represent the average patient undergoing typical cancer screening in the typical clinic. But they do serve as a wake-up call. Screening tests should be chosen to maximize benefit and minimize harm. Organizations like the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force try to do just that; they frequently re-evaluate any new evidence and offer new recommendations. Data like these on cumulative false positive risks will help them make better decisions than they could make based on previously available single-test false positive rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=443"&gt;“In a post &lt;/a&gt;earlier this year, I discussed the pros and cons of PSA screening. Last year, I discussed &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=41"&gt;screening ultrasound exams&lt;/a&gt; offered direct to the public to bypass medical judgment). If you do 20 lab tests on a normal person, statistically one will come back false positive just because of the way normal lab results are determined. Figuring out which tests to do on a given patient, either for screening or for diagnosis, is far from straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new information doesn’t mean we should abandon cancer screening tests. It does mean we should use them judiciously and be careful not to mislead our patients into thinking they offer more certainty and less risk than they really do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a fundamental difference in Japanese workmanship---to pull with control rather than push with force." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quote is from a favorite book of mind, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xP5XQMXHw-sC&amp;amp;dq=obasan+joy+kogawa&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=bn&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=eNlIStTROY7Ctwf6mvWuAg&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=5"&gt;Obasan&lt;/a&gt; (1981) by Joy Kogawa. It's a novel about Japanese-Canadian Naomi Nakane and her family during and after World War II. It's written in language that it at times sparse and lyrical, poetic, and what's said is just as important as what is not, especially about what happened to Naomi's mother when she goes back to Nagasaki. "Pull[ing] with control rather than push[ing] with force" could describe how Naomi gradually finds out what really happened--is is tragic---to her mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Pull[ing] with control rather than push[ing] with force" comes close to describing how we try to help Charlie learn, grow and move on in a world that's not inclined to accommodate to his needs. Sometimes, we pull too much, and maybe even (without meaning to) push Charlie too far and too much &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_principle_of_doubt"&gt;as on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;. And then, we remind ourselves how much Charlie and we learn from not always doing the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_same_old_same_old"&gt;same old same old&lt;/a&gt; and trying something different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday something happened for the first time ever: Charlie and I went on a bike ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bike running has been strictly a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/we_ride_bikes_together"&gt;Charlie and dad thing&lt;/a&gt;. I rode a bike everywhere (even in the snow) when I was in grad school, but have been (1) very out of practice and (2) too nervous about Charlie. After a memorable (infamous) moment when Jim told me to let go of 6-year-old Charlie's bike and I couldn't let go and I ended up pulling him and the bike over on top of me, it has been felt, Jim handles the bike rides. Charlie has become so used to this that, when I tried to tail the two of them a few months ago (I have inherited Charlie's old yello bikes), Charlie was unnerved and I betook myself on my own route around the neighborhood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday around 1.30pm Charlie put on his bike helmet, said he wanted to ride bikes, and went to get his bike.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I explained that Jim was at work in New York and would be back in a few hours. Charlie first got out Jim's bike and arranged both his own and his dad's bikes nicely about two feet away from the curb, ready for riding action. After seeing how close a few cars came to the bikes, I explained to Charlie that I had to move them closer to the sidewalk. And, that Jim was not coming home for some time. I got out the yellow bike and talked about us doing a short ride, all while knowing, that's not really going to be possible: Bike rides mean some very specific things to Charlie one being, the route.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I knew it, he had gotten me Jim's bike helmet and was smiling when I shut the door and left a note for his &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/in_the_community"&gt;sitter&lt;/a&gt;, who was to come at 2.30pm. Then Charlie was astride his bike and heading down the street and so was I and away we went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until we got to a fairly busy intersection, I felt a sense of ease skimming down the street, Charlie in front of me. As we neared the intersection, and he started to veer into the middle of the street, I was more than reminded of why I'm so grateful that Jim takes Charlie on these rides. Cars were turning, signalling, speeding up, slowing down, honking. I called out to Charlie to stop at the sign (he did) and go left (he did) and we went down some side streets, the breeze to our backs. We passed a street that would bring us in a nice circle back home if we made a left onto it: Charlie kept going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And going and going, till we hit an ever busier intersection. He stopped and, on seeing me getting off my bike, did too. "This way," he said and pointed to the right. Instantly images of all the streets, and all the cars and SUVs and trucks, we'd have to ride by en route to various destinations "this way" (a playground we once visited a lot, a bridge Jim and Charlie habitually ride over) filled my mind. Without Jim's finely honed sense of how to guide Charlie in the streets and direct traffic, I knew we could be in some very sticky (and dangerous) situations. Plus, the sitter was probably at our house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told Charlie I needed to call her; of course, I didn't have her number saved on my phone. I thought and kept my words minimal, and to the point: &lt;em&gt;She was waiting at our house. Dad would be home very soon and take him on ride. I was just not able to do it.&lt;/em&gt;  Charlie was very consternated [understatement]. Thinking he's going one way and then being told he has to turn around, back track, is a transition that's especially difficult for him to negotiate his way through. He cried out and grasped the handlebars tighter, shook them, and started to get back on his bike. A trio of tweenage girls walked down the street as Charlie sounded&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246347049652"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3670">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bb2d86fe9c86826c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion and Public Policy"/><category term="Amy Sullivan"/><category term="Barack Obama"/><category term="church"/><category term="Washington DC"/><title type="html">Has Obama chosen a church?</title><published>2009-06-30T06:37:35Z</published><updated>2009-06-30T06:37:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/06/29/has-obama-chosen-a-church/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myjewishlearning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/obama_praying.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.myjewishlearning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/obama_praying.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="140"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Apparently, there’s a whole group of people who have been on the edge of their seats waiting for Obama to pick a church in which to attend on a regular basis. Well, if you read &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/time/20090629/us_time/08599190761000"&gt;Amy Sullivan’s article at &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you might be under the impression that Barack Obama has indeed chosen a church:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in an unexpected move, Obama has told White House aides that instead of joining a congregation in Washington, D.C., he will follow in &lt;span style="background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/span&gt;’s footsteps and make his &lt;span style="background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;primary place of worship&lt;/span&gt; Evergreen Chapel, the &lt;span style="border-bottom:1px dashed #0066cc;background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;nondenominational church&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span style="background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;Camp David&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, The &lt;em&gt;Christian Science Monitor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/24323.html"&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2009/06/obamas_church_hunt_work_in_pro.html"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; other sources disagree:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White &lt;a style="text-decoration:underline!important" href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/24323.html#"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#004276!important;font-weight:400;font-size:13.0167px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#004276!important;font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-weight:400;font-size:13.0167px"&gt;House&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said Monday that President Barack Obama continues “to &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0109/17583.html"&gt;look for&lt;/a&gt; a church home,” and said a magazine report that he has stopped is erroneous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White &lt;a style="text-decoration:underline!important" href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/24323.html#"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#004276!important;font-weight:400;font-size:13.0167px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#004276!important;font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-weight:400;font-size:13.0167px"&gt;House&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deputy press secretary Jen Psaki said by e-mail: “The president and first family continue to look for a church &lt;a style="text-decoration:underline!important" href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/24323.html#"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#004276!important;font-weight:400;font-size:13.0167px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#004276!important;font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-weight:400;font-size:13.0167px"&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They have enjoyed worshiping at Camp David and several &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0409/21153.html"&gt;other congregations&lt;/a&gt; over the months, and will choose a church at the time that is best for their family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, one thing that nobody in the media seems to be saying is, who cares? We’re supposed to be a secular nation with a wall separating church and state. There’s also not supposed to be any religious tests. So why is this decision to pick a church regarded as if it’s some legitimate rite of passage for any president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if Obama chose no church at all, or simply chose to only worship in the privacy of his own home, opting out of the pagentry of gaudiness that comes with putting his religious observances on public display for all to see? Of course, we all know what would happen. The Religious Right would condemn Obama even more (if that’s even possible) and proclaim this yet another sign that the nation has lost its values and that we’re approaching certain doom. And many on the Left looking to score some easy brownie points would join in on the outrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course Obama wouldn’t do that. Even if he were the closeted atheists some would like to believe, Obama’s always been a bit of a panderer to religious interests. Rick Warren anybody? So I guess that if he is going to choose a church, I’d actually prefer that Sullivan was right and that it was the &lt;span style="border-bottom:1px dashed #0066cc;background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;nondenominational church&lt;/span&gt; at Camp David. Of all the choices, that’s the least offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because I don’t want to just use this platform to bitch, I’ll propose the best of both worlds. Obama has already publicly embraced the message of multi-culturalism in numerous speeches, even including atheists. Obama should pull a Ben Franklin and instead of picking one church, he should join them all. And I don’t mean just the Christian churchs but also the Jewish temples, etc. The president of the United States doesn’t just represent Christians, but every American. So why should he choose? If attending a religious ceremony instead of doing something actually useful is so important to the religious, Obama should declare that he’ll make time to visit every place of worship in Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with his charisma and elequance, he could potentially even pull it off with only minimal criticism from the Right. I imagine that criticism would mainly come from the same people who were outraged when Obama had the audacity to defend the Founding Fathers’ values and declared that America is not a Christian nation. But he has the likability to get through it without ruining his reputation. I think there are far more people who are receptive to such multi-cultural messages now than ever before (Thank you legal immigration). I really think that this is a brilliant compromise that will please the most amount of people. And it also says all the right things. Our nation was founded on diversity, and considering I’m left with the impression that Obama isn’t really very religious at all anyway, this is a spectacular way to honor the spirit of diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

This time around, the story isn&amp;#39;t too awful — it focuses on the recent NAPC meeting, in which several professional paleontologists paid a visit to the creationist carnival to be alternately appalled and amused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several people have asked when I'm going to visit Ken Ham's temple. It's been settled! It's all arranged, but no thanks at all to Ham. Here's the deal: I'm going to be speaking at the &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/conference"&gt;Secular Student Alliance conference&lt;/a&gt; in August, which is being held in Columbus, Ohio…only two hours away from the museum! Sharp-eyed and chronologically aware Phil Ferguson noticed this interesting conjunction, and suggested that I adjust my travel schedule a tiny bit and come down a day early, and we&amp;#39;d take a little side trip. The SSA was amenable and tweaked my flight dates, and it is all happening!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, 7 August, a small group of godless people, including yours truly, will be at the &amp;quot;museum&amp;quot; when it opens at 10am on Friday, 7 August. Everyone is welcome to join in—we&amp;#39;ll pack the joint with quietly chortling science-minded people. When I get back from Lindau, I&amp;#39;ll also write to Ken Ham and request the pleasure of an audience, inviting him to come on out and evangelize to secular students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be great fun. I&amp;#39;ve got a long list of questions to ask the docents…so long that I&amp;#39;m going to have to prune it down a lot. Come on out and join the party! And as long as you are, you might want to think about signing up for the &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/conference"&gt;SSA conference&lt;/a&gt;, which should be more informative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, a half-hour at a nearby sewage treatment plant would be more informative. The SSA meeting will be &lt;i&gt;even better&lt;/i&gt; than that!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/freakshow_highlighted_in_ny_ti.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/iYLabckuaVs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246342365103"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3667">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cbe55112b2b0004b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Freedom of Speech"/><category term="Paranormal"/><category term="Psychics"/><category term="Astrology"/><category term="Mahinda Rajapaksa"/><category term="Ranjith Gunasekera"/><category term="Sri Lanka"/><title type="html">The less obvious dangers of astrology</title><published>2009-06-30T05:57:41Z</published><updated>2009-06-30T05:57:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/06/29/the-less-obvious-dangers-of-astrology/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/26/sri-lanka-arrests-astrolo_n_221424.html"&gt;&lt;img title="astrology - the fool" src="http://skepacabra.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/astrology-the-fool.jpg?w=171&amp;amp;h=300" alt="astrology - the fool" width="171" height="300"&gt;A Sri Lanka astrology was arrested for publicly predicting the death of the President Mahinda Rajapaksa&lt;/a&gt;. And okay, I know I should be devoting this blog to condemning this kind of censorship but that goes without saying and I do find this particular story kind of amusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s wrong for a government to arrest a citizen for saying something they don’t like. I don’t know exactly what the astrology said, so it is possible that it was reasonably viewed as a threat on the life of the president…though I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police spokesman Ranjith Gunasekera confirmed Friday that Chandrasiri Bandara has been arrested so police could investigate the source of his prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I would like to know the source of this prediction too. I suspect it originated from the suspect, Chandrasiri Bandara’s ass.&lt;/p&gt;

It feels like about 11:30 in the evening, my biological time, but it's actually 6:30am Lindau time. Today is actually tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My strategy was actually planned. Yesterday was mostly travel through the night, and I got no sleep. I noticed as I was flying east and getting very, very tired that, as the sun came up at what was an unnatural time for me and started zapping my photoreceptors, I woke up very nicely…and then kept going through the agonizing day of missed flights and boring waits. Then last night (local time) I finally got to Lindau in time for some of the social events and just kept my brain going through the evening. I finally went to bed about 10:30 Lindau, and slept wonderfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had set an alarm, but didn&amp;#39;t need it — again, the first rosy light of dawn comes in through my window, and I was up and feeling pretty good. I think I&amp;#39;ll take the next step in completing my adjustment to this 7 hour shift in time, and I suspect it&amp;#39;s one the circadian researchers haven&amp;#39;t contemplated (I shall have to ask &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/"&gt;Bora&lt;/a&gt;): a fine breakfast of German pastries. That should keep me going through the morning talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, this is the &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/"&gt;Lindau Nobel conference&lt;/a&gt;, and the topic this year is &lt;i&gt;chemistry&lt;/i&gt;. I am not a chemist, which means I may not have a clue what anyone is talking about. However, I&amp;#39;ve got one angle that may help: I am a microscopist. This morning, I&amp;#39;m looking forward to Neher talking about caged compounds — there&amp;#39;s also some juicy stuff on protein degradation and renewable energy. Later this week, of course, it&amp;#39;s Shimomura, Chalfie, and Tsien on bioluminescence, which is all grist for the microscopist mill. I might just come out of this with some new understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Und Bier! Tonight I must find a good dunkel — last night the conference only provided a so-so bottled Pils. Then this evening I shall try to post some summaries of the day&amp;#39;s science while under the influence. It should be entertaining!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/clock_reset_in_progress.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/NELg5wS6Gz8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246336242159"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/06/30/radio-the-takeaway-learns-to-speak-firefly/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/de000ecd002a062a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Talks"/><category term="Writing Elsewhere"/><title type="html">Radio: The Takeaway Learns to Speak Firefly</title><published>2009-06-30T04:29:59Z</published><updated>2009-06-30T04:29:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/06/30/radio-the-takeaway-learns-to-speak-firefly/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I will be on the public radio show &lt;a href="http://www.thetakeaway.org/"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/a&gt; at 720 am EST Tuesday to talk about &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/06/29/fireflies-the-invertebrate-opera/"&gt;fireflies&lt;/a&gt;.

It’s the result of a visit I paid last Friday evening to a meadow in Massachusetts, where I listened to &lt;a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/biology/labs/lewis/index.html"&gt;Sara Lewis&lt;/a&gt; of Tufts University explain the sultry, complex tale of sex, deception, and death that was playing out in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first got to know Lewis’s work last summer, when I decided I wanted to include fireflies in my next book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0981519474?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0981519474" width="1" height="1" border="0" style="border:medium none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tangled Bank: An Introduction to Evolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Lewis co-authored a fascinating &lt;a href="http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ento.53.103106.093346"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of firefly biology last year (free &lt;a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/biology/labs/lewis/pdf/2008%20Ann%20Rev%20Ent.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt; from Lewis’s web site). I particularly liked this chart, which shows how different species have evolved different flash signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/06/firefly-code.jpg" alt="firefly-code.jpg" align="left"&gt; The male, flying around, releases a certain pattern of flashes–a single one second pulse followed by a five secondin the case of Photinus pyralis, for one example. And if a female P. pyralis, sitting on a blade of grass, likes what she sees, she responds three seconds later. Not one. Not six. Three. If she responds at the right interval, he knows he’s found a female of his own species and zeroes in, sending more flashes. She may also be signalling other males at the same time; which male she chooses may come down to subtle features of the flash pattern–for example, a rapid series of pulses as opposed to a slow one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can, as I discovered, speak their language with a penlight. You can even play the male or the female, depending on your mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s lots of strange business going on out among the fireflies. I didn’t have room in the article to describe some of Lewis’s new areas of research. Because female fireflies mate with several males, they can end up with sperm from several males inside them at once. Studies on other animals have suggested that females can choose which male’s sperm they’ll use to fertilize their eggs. Males can also inject chemicals with their sperm that increase their odds of fertilization. It’s clear that in many species, female preferences and male competition can continue after mating ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one knows how this struggle plays out in fireflies. Adam South, one of Dr. Lewis’s graduate students, is investigating this side of the evolutionary equation. He is mating female fireflies with two males apiece and then collecting the eggs they lay. Using DNA tests, he’s determining the paternity of the eggs. Perhaps the males with more attractive flashes have more offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What scientists like Lewis know about fireflies is remarkable, but it’s dwarfed by what they don’t know. Are fireflies on the decline, for example? Unfortunately, there’s no good long-term data. But that’s now an opportunity for some citizen-science you can get involved in. Lewis and some former students have helped organize &lt;a href="https://www.mos.org/fireflywatch/"&gt;Firefly Watch&lt;/a&gt;, based at the Boston Museum of Science.

It’s a sign of their desperation that the best argument they have is not that atheism is wrong, or that god does exist (supported by evidence of course), but that atheism is a religion too. A strange argument for a religious person to make on the face of it.  Is it supposed to strengthen the atheist’s position or weaken the theist’s one? In reality it’s a sign they have run out of arguments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, this argument is widely made, and so it needs to be addressed. Atheism (and here I mean the so-called “weak atheism” that does not claim proof that god does not exist), is just the lack of god-belief – nothing more and nothing less. And as someone once said, if atheism is a religion, not collecting stamps is a hobby.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That really ought to end the discussion right there. Clearly, a mere lack of belief in something cannot be a religion. In addition, atheism has no sacred texts, no tenets, no ceremonies. Even theists making this argument must know all that. So they must have something else in mind when they trot this one out, but what is it? What are they really thinking? Well, if you look at various definitions of religion, the only things that could possibly apply to atheism would be something like &lt;a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/religion"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;6. Something one believes in and follows devotedly&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/religion"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;4. A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously I don’t know if that’s what they mean – I don’t read minds. But I can’t see what else it could be. They must be referring to certain activities of atheists – writing books and blogs, financing bus ads, joining atheist groups, etc. They think atheists are “religious in their atheism” as one person put it to me – the word “religious” being used here colloquially to mean something felt very strongly, or followed enthusiastically. But this definition of religion is so broad that virtually anything people enjoy doing very much, or follow strongly or obsessively, is a religion. It’s a definition of religion that is so broad that it’s meaningless. In reality, most of the things that people follow enthusiastically, are just hobbies. And ironically, although not collecting stamps is not a hobby, getting involved in atheist activities (writing books and blogs, attending atheist meetings) might well be a hobby for some people. But it is a hobby, not a religion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What Is Religion?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m sure that argument won’t convince all theists to abandon this rhetorical trope they love so much.  To really address the argument, we have to define religion, and then see if atheism fits the definition. While I don’t think I can define religion completely, I think I can state the minimum that religion has to have to still be a religion. And it seems to me that there is one thing at least that is common to all religions. It’s this. In my view, religion at a minimum, has to have the following characteristic:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Religion must include something you have to accept on faith – that is, without evidence commensurate with the extraordinary nature of the belief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most religions will include other things too, but they must require faith. Of course, not all things that require faith are religions, but all religions must require faith.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The minimum definition covers all the religions I’m familiar with. For example, it includes any religion that involves belief in god or gods – something you have to believe in without evidence. Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism… all require you to believe in god or gods as a minimum, without evidence. The minimum definition would also include religions that don’t require belief in god, but require faith in other things. For example, I believe it would include Buddhism, which (for example) includes the belief that living beings go through a succession of lifetimes and rebirth. It would also include Scientology – no evidence for Xenu, that I’m aware of. Maybe you can think of some actual religions that would be excluded, but I haven’t been able to so far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So religion requires belief without evidence. And by that definition atheism cannot possibly be a religion because atheists do not have to believe in anything to be an atheist – either with or without evidence. QED.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, some religious people may say, “but that’s not my definition of religion”. To which I say, OK, then give me your definition. Give me your definition of religion, that doesn’t require belief without evidence, that includes your religion, the others I named, &lt;em&gt;and atheism&lt;/em&gt;. And it needs to be better than the two dictionary definitions I cited above.  Give me that definition. Because here’s the thing. The problems I have with religions are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;They are not based on fact or on any reasonable evidence commensurate with the claims they make. In many cases, the claims they make are plainly absurd and are actually contradicted by the evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Religious proponents demand respect, and adherence to their delusions by others. This despite (1) above.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Those are the aspects of religion that I object to. Clearly atheism doesn’t fit 1 (or 2) above, so it is nothing like any of the religions I object to. If your religion does not require belief without faith, then I probably wouldn’t have a problem with it. Assuming, of course, all the tenets of your religion are actually backed up by evidence extraordinary enough for the extraordinary claims your religion makes. But they never do.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my view, theists will have their work cut out to deny this minimum requirement for religion.  Come on – they even refer to their religion as “my faith”.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Evidence and Extraordinary Evidence&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some religious people will claim that their religious beliefs are backed by evidence. This is where it gets tricky, because many religious people genuinely believe their religion is rational and backed by evidence. For example, one Christian I debated cited that the evidence Christianity was real, was (and I quote), “the resurrection of Christ”. Of course, the resurrection of Christ, if it had actually happened, would be pretty good evidence for Christianity. But, unfortunately, there is no good evidence for the resurrection. Certainly, nothing close to the extraordinary evidence we would need to accept this extraordinary claim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Extraordinary Claims&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;This needs explaining in more detail. Why do &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/01/extraordinary-c.html"&gt;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&lt;/a&gt;? Well, all claims require exactly the same amount of evidence, it’s just that most &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; claims are already backed by extraordinary evidence that you don’t think about. When we say “extraordinary claims”, what we actually mean are claims that do not already have evidence supporting them, or sometimes claims that have extraordinary evidence against them. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence because they usually contradict claims that are backed by extraordinary evidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So why is Jesus’ resurrection an extraordinary claim, and why is the Bible not extraordinary evidence for it? Well, the resurrection goes against all the evidence we have that people do not come back to life, spontaneously, after two days of being dead. Modern medicine can bring people back from what would have been considered in earlier years to be “dead”, but not after 2 days of being dead with no modern life support to keep the vital organs working. In fact, it is probably reasonably safe to say it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that people cannot come back to life after being dead for two days without modern life support. So, extraordinary claim it is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the evidence we are offered in support of this extraordinary claim consists only of accounts written decades after the event, by people who were not there when the events described were purported to have occurred. We are offered nothing but hearsay anecdotes from superstitious people with a clear reason for wanting others to think the story true. This is hardly acceptable evidence to counteract the fact that &lt;strong&gt;this never happens&lt;/strong&gt;. Christians might ask, what evidence would an atheist accept for such an extraordinary claim? And in reality, it is hard to imagine that there could possibly be any evidence good enough for us to accept the resurrection as true. Christians may claim that this is unfair, or that we are closed minded, but the fact that you are unlikely to find extraordinary evidence for this event 2,000 years after the fact, is hardly the non-believer’s fault. The real question, considering the weakness of the evidence, and the wildly extraordinary nature of the claim, is why would anyone believe any of it in the first place?  The truth is, they accept it on faith.  In fact, the acceptance of this story on faith alone is usually considered to be essential to the true believer. And although that was just Christianity, the same lack of evidence, and belief based on faith alone, applies to the claims of all the other religions that I’m familiar with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Religions require belief in extraordinary claims without anything close to the extraordinary evidence that is required.  Atheism requires no belief in anything.  The contrast couldn’t be clearer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the believer has one final shot – one last desperate rhetorical item to fling at the atheist.  Here we go.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;More Faith To Be An Atheist?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The final argument many religious apologists throw into the mix is &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/07/atheism-requires-no-faith.html"&gt;it takes more faith to be an atheist&lt;/a&gt; than it does to believe in god. That certainly took me by surprise the first time I heard it. I think what they’re trying to say is this. Atheists think matter just appeared out of nowhere, that something came out of nothing. But where did the matter come from? To think that matter appeared out of nowhere requires more faith than to think a creator made everything. Why is there something rather than nothing? To think that matter just appeared by itself, requires faith.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Atheists don’t think matter came out of nowhere. Atheists say we don’t know where matter came from; we don’t know why there is something rather than nothing. Maybe one day we’ll know, or maybe we won’t. But we don’t know now. Theists are exactly the same. They don’t know either, but the difference is they make up an explanation (god). But it’s just a made up explanation – they have no reason to suppose it’s true, other than that they just like it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it’s a useless explanation. Unless they know something about this “God” – how he created everything; why he created it; what he’s likely to do next - it’s a lack of an explanation. It’s just a placeholder until a real explanation comes along. Except that the theist won’t be open to the real explanation when and if science is able to provide one. The god placeholder prevents investigation into any real tentative explanations. The theist who says god created everything, is the one with the faith – faith that “god” is the explanation and that no other is possible. The atheist is content to say “we don’t know”. For now, anyway. And it’s obvious that saying “we don’t know,” requires no faith.  That may be a hard thing to do for people who want all the answers, but it certainly isn’t religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing.  Some theists have responded to the “if atheism is a religion, not collecting stamps is a hobby” argument by pointing out that non stamp collectors (aphilatelists?) don’t write books or blogs about not collecting stamps, don’t post anti stamp collecting ads on buses, don&amp;#39;t ridicule stamp collectors, etc.  This is meant to demonstrate that the “stamp collecting” analogy is weak.  It actually demonstrates that the analogy is very good, since it highlights one of the main problems atheists have with many religious people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing they are missing, and the real problem most atheists have with religion.  If stamp collectors demanded that people who don’t collect stamps obey their stamp collecting rules, started wars with groups who collected slightly different types of stamps, denied non-stamp collectors rights or discriminated against them, bullied them in school, claimed you had to collect stamps to be a suitable person to run for public office, tried to get stamp collecting taught in schools as science in opposition to real science, demanded that people be killed for printing cartoons that made fun of stamp collectors, claimed that non-stamp collectors lacked moral judgment, made up ridiculous straw man positions they claimed non-stamp collectors took, and then argued against those straw men positions etc etc, - then non-stamp collectors probably would criticize stamp collectors in the way atheists criticize many religious people. And with good reason. Not collecting stamps would still not be a hobby.  Or a religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246334724098"><id gr:original-id="http://themaroon.wordpress.com/2009/06/30/bad/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bcc22bd172def521</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="TV, Movies, Music, and Why They All Suck"/><title type="html">Bad</title><published>2009-06-30T01:45:18Z</published><updated>2009-06-30T01:45:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com/2009/06/30/bad/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://mattmaroon.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Michael Jackson died, and I wasn’t going to say anything about it because at this point, who cares? I was tired of that story within 10 minutes of it breaking. The real Michael Jackson died some time in the early ‘90s anyway. Some record label executives found a way to keep his body going with what I can only assume was a complex system of solenoids and carbon nanotubes topped with horsehair just so they could cash in on his half of The Beatles catalogue and ensure that Leno and Letterman would have an easy joke on a slow night. But the guy whose cassette tape I listened to in my Walkman until both of them broke was long gone anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then lo and behold, in my Facebook feed I found the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACPsfcsg4ZE"&gt;video for Bad&lt;/a&gt; (YouTube isn’t letting me embed so you’ll just have to click the link) and it instantly hit me: that’s the gayest thing I’ve ever seen. If you type “gay” into Google and hit I’m Feeling Lucky and you don’t land on that video then Sergey and Larry need to work on their ranking algorithms some more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, it’s that gay. It’s like the rumble scene from West Side Story, but with 20% more gay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when we were in elementary school (ironically about the time when that song was on top of the charts) we used to call each other gay and not have any clue what it meant until we got yelled at by a teacher. If my family weren’t too poor to have MTV at the time, I’d have known from watching that video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I realized that even the lyrics are gay. It starts with &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your Butt Is Mine     &lt;br&gt;Gonna Take You Right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In later years a number of men claimed to have been Michael Jackson’s lover, and some had what a number of people close to him said was photographic evidence. I’m starting to wonder if that song wasn’t his way of trying to tell the world something, only to be talked out of it by Quincy Jones because, let’s face it, the ‘80s weren’t exactly what you’d call an enlightened period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here, in what I can only assume is the song’s original form, are the lyrics to Gay by Michael Jackson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Gay&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your butt is mine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gonna take you right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just show your face&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In broad daylight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m telling you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On how I feel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gonna hurt your mind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t shoot to kill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lay it on me all right…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m giving you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On count of three&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show your stuff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or let it be . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m telling you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not a man&lt;/p&gt;

With "alt. med" it is often easy to explain the drawbacks of the uncritical view - most people know someone who has had to deal with a very serious disease like cancer.  Once you explain something inane like homeopathy and its history, most folks will agree that it is potentially dangerous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A slightly more touchy area is the paranormal.  When you talk to people about ghosts, for example, most who believe are not at all willing to give that up because it is so closely tied to a personal belief in the afterlife and religion.  It's much deeper.  While ghosts are still hip here, the stigma in the "first" world with regard to witches has dropped off to the point where you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who truly believes that people can cast spells and the like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is not the case in a place like Kenya.  I would recommend reading &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8119201.stm"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; and listening to the linked BBC radio show at the bottom called &lt;i&gt;African Perspectives&lt;/i&gt;.  It is disturbing to say the least to hear first-hand accounts of village elders being accused of witchcraft, beaten, and burned alive.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The The DEO (District Education Officer) of Malindi, Kenya (a small costal town about halfway between the borders of Somalia and Tanzania) was asked by the interviewer if she believes in witchcraft, to which she replied:&lt;blockquote&gt;Witchcraft is there, even the Bible says in the time of Moses there were issues of witchcraft...I don't believe I can be bewitched because I believe in God and he is the one who is in control of the universe...&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is a huge problem.  When the people who are supposedly &lt;i&gt;educating&lt;/i&gt; the population believe in nonsense, you end up with a whole lot of people buying into (obviously extremely dangerous) bullshit from a very young age.  She apparently read the Bible closely because the only two times "witch" appears is in Exd 22:18 (the famous, randomly out-of-place, &lt;i&gt;"thou shalt not suffer a witch to live"&lt;/i&gt; line, and also in Deut 18:10-12 which says:&lt;blockquote&gt;There shall not be found among you [any one] that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, [or] that useth divination, [or] an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.  For all that do these things [are] an abomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations &lt;b&gt;the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee&lt;/b&gt;. (My bolding, here's the &lt;a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Deu&amp;amp;c=18&amp;amp;v=10&amp;amp;t=KJV#10"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;So being a witch, according to the damn Bible, should be handled by God himself, not by his followers.  So sayeth the Book.  Maybe she didn't read it all that closely after all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The DEO said that there is a "witchcraft act" in Kenya that can fine or imprison people who accuse others of witchcraft.  It, obviously, is not enforced with any sort of rigor, however, as there are videos of lynchings and burnings with no authorities in sight.  Quite frankly, if the "authorities" are anything like the woman quoted above, you probably wouldn't want her there anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the danger of ignorance.  This is where it leads.  It turns &lt;i&gt;The Crucible&lt;/i&gt; into a documentary, only with more fire and agony and ending up with no village elders to consult in times of need.  There is a telling part of the audio where a man tries to explain why villagers think the old people are witches; he says that at about 60 years of age, some physical changes occur in the population, one of which is that their eyes often turn a reddish colour - a side-effect of smoke from a particular wood used.  That, plus wrinkled skin equals accusation and violent death.  There is a perfectly reasonable explanation for the visible changes and yet no one is launching an education campaign, no one seems to be taking charge, and the elderly are being savagely abused and killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not saying that this is going to happen in Canada anytime soon, but the fact that it is happening ANYWHERE in the world in 2009 indicates that something is horribly wrong with us.  Beliefs can and do kill.  Brutally.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

This week, the honor goes to &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovery.com/twisted_physics/2009/06/carnival-of-space-109.html"&gt;Jennifer Ouellette at Twisted Physics&lt;/a&gt;, and my article on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1950s_the_t.php"&gt;the 1950s and Fred Hoyle&lt;/a&gt; gets top billing!  There are a bunch of other highlights to check out.  Here are my top 3 CoS picks of the week:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. &lt;/b&gt;Ever what would have happened in the 1960s if the Apollo program had failed?  &lt;a href="http://beyondapollo.blogspot.com/2009/06/rands-apollo-backup-plan-1965.html"&gt;Beyond Apollo&lt;/a&gt; takes an in-depth look at a secret backup plan from the RAND corporation that was NASA's number 2 option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/carnival_of_space_109_is_live/Ap4-s67-50531.jpg" width="500" alt="Ap4-s67-50531.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. &lt;/b&gt;All planets that can support life may have their possibly habitable lifetimes &lt;a href="http://21stcenturywaves.com/blog/2009/06/27/co2-and-the-prospects-for-extraterrestrials-an-absorbing-story"&gt;greatly extended once life exists&lt;/a&gt;, since life helps regulate Carbon Dioxide and offset changes in their Sun's output.  Bruce at 21st Century Waves has the scoop.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/carnival_of_space_109_is_live/070424_gliese581c_02.jpg" width="500" alt="070424_gliese581c_02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. &lt;/b&gt;I thought I had Moon Maps down, but &lt;a href="http://potentiatenebrasrepellendi.blogspot.com/2009/06/google-lunar-x-prize-fan-map.html"&gt;The Power to Push Away the Darkness&lt;/a&gt; has a map of Moon-related enterprises, courtesy of the Moon's fans on Earth, that I've never seen before.  Worth a look if you'd like to see what people are thinking and doing about good ol' Luna.

&lt;p&gt;I was therefore ecstatic to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/28/atheism-camp-uk-richard-dawkins"&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; that the trend has caught on back in my home country, and that there is now a &lt;a href="http://www.camp-quest.org.uk/"&gt;Camp Quest UK&lt;/a&gt;. The web site lays out what it is all about, and it just makes you smile to read it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camp Quest’s purpose is to build a strong, healthy community among the young participants aged 8-17. In addition to fun camp activities such as swimming, canoeing, fishing, archery, campfires, stargazing and outdoor sports. Camp Quest’s knowledgeable counsellors and guest volunteers will lead the youth in learning activities that teach them about science, free thought and humanist principals. Activities cover critical thinking, science, history, human rights and ethics. Campers develop and improve their rational thinking skills in fun, hands-on learning activities and programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the Director, Samantha Stein, discussing the event&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first year is sponsored by &lt;a href="http://richarddawkinsfoundation.org/"&gt;the Richard Dawkins Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and the theme is Evolution (since this is &lt;a href="http://darwin-year-2009.org/"&gt;Darwin year&lt;/a&gt;). The associated activities all sound like fun, but I particularly liked this one, reported in &lt;em&gt;the Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of cooking, hiking and canoeing, activities for campers include a competition to disprove the existence of the mythical unicorn – with the winner receiving a £10 note on which Dawkins, the author of The God Delusion, has signed his name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because it was popular, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2008/01/why_chiropractic_is_patently_r.php"&gt;I moved it over here&lt;/a&gt;.  Well, a chiropractor has come to bravely defend his field and&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2008/01/why_chiropractic_is_patently_r.php#c1743907"&gt; left us a comment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A study in the May 2007 issue of the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics reports health plans that use Chiropractors as Primary Care Providers (PCPs) reduce their health care utilization costs significantly.

&lt;p&gt;The study covers the seven-year period from 1999 to 2005. Researchers compared costs and utilization data from an Independent Physicians Association (IPA) that uses Chiropractors as PCPs and a traditional HMO that doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chiropractic PCPs had 59 percent fewer hospitalizations, 62 percent fewer outpatient surgical cases and 85 percent lower drug costs compared with the HMO plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patients in the Chiropractic PCP group also reported higher satisfaction with their care than the HMO group. Over the seven-year period, Chiropractic patients consistently demonstrated a high degree of satisfaction with their care that ranged from 89 percent to 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study co-author James Winterstein, D.C. says that patients using Chiropractic PCP health care groups "experienced fewer hospitalizations, underwent fewer surgeries and used considerably fewer pharmaceuticals than HMO patients who received traditional medical care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm...interesting assertions.

The trip was OK. Terminal 2 at RDU rocks - I was there far too early (due to trip-excites) and spent 3 hours online on my iPhone. At Heathrow, wifi is pay-only, and I could not detect any at the Zurich airport. There is no AT&amp;amp;T signal to be picked up at Heathrow, Zurich or Lindau, so I am not using the iPhone at all. The wifi at the hotel is decent (a little slower than at home) and they say that it is much better at the conference center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lindau 001.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Lindau%20001.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, AA switched airplane types. I was looking forward to sleeping 7 hours on the B777 (it is never completely full so I can usually find a line of 3, 4 or even 6 seats to spread my length and sleep. But this time they used a B767-300 so I sat cramped and got only a few quick bursts of sleep that was not very restfull. A big group of exchange student from Meredith college on their way to a summer in London, as sweet as they were, did not help my sleeping by chatting all night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lindau 002.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Lindau%20002.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the trip was uneventful - as Heathrow is so large, by the time we landed, docked at the gate, walked miles of corridors, passed passport check and security, I only had about 10 minutes waiting at the gate for the Zurich flight (which was more comfortable). I then quickly got on a train to Lindau and a bus driver, not speaking English but understanding I am "with the Nobelists" and "did not get yet to get any Euros" took me to the hotel for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lindau 003.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Lindau%20003.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I should not complain, especially comparing to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/in_lindau_at_last.php" title=""&gt;PZ's trip&lt;/a&gt; which lasted twice as long and did not go as smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lindau 004.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Lindau%20004.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PZ and I arrived at around the same time and made plans to meet via Twitter. We were accompanied by &lt;a href="http://ashutoshchemist.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Ashutosh Jogalekar&lt;/a&gt; for a nice hour-long walk around Lindau - both the old part on the island on Lake Constance and the newer, bigger town on the coast. Got some cash, bought some essentials, and went to the Social event at the Inselhalle on the island, where I met the rest of the blogging/press team and saw some 600 people including 20+ Nobelists. It was the Indian night, with their food, dances, music and customs, which all together got everyone off their seats and socializing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lindau 005.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Lindau%20005.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, exhausted and jet-lagged, I need to go to try to sleep as tomorrow is the work-day for me here: liveblogging, interviewing participants, and myself being on an Open Access session in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lindau 006.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Lindau%20006.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He talked to us about a  movement he and other people from Detroit are hoping to get going called &lt;a href="http://www.grassrootsatheism.info/"&gt;Grass Roots Atheism&lt;/a&gt; (In the link Chris is on the left of your screen). He'd like to see atheists take to the streets, not as the street preachers do who preach to people, but to simply hand people some literature if they're receptive and to let them know we atheists are good people. It's a worthy goal.

In plain English, this means that California residents can opt-out of "affiliate sharing" among banks.  Thus, if you have an account at Bank of America, you can ask the bank not to share information about your account with the company's 2,000 affiliates!  This sets the stage for other states to limit affiliate sharing, and in all likelihood, it means that some banks will simply stop affiliate sharing without direction from the consumer.  Why is this important?  Say that you are in charge of buying drinks for office parties, and that you regularly purchase large amounts of beer on your credit card for that purpose.  Later, you apply for life insurance at Traveler's.  These entities are jointly owned, and they can make inferences from your purchase history information.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court also refused to review an important case from the 1st Circuit, involving the use of prescription records.  In IMS Health, marketers challenged a prescription confidentiality law, which prohibited the sale of prescriber-identified prescription records.  The 1st Circuit upheld the law, holding that it did not violate the free speech rights of prescription drug marketing companies.  The 1st Circuit decision is important in particular because the court viewed the sale of records as mere conduct, rather than expression.  If the sale of personal information is viewed in this way, marketing companies will have great difficulty framing privacy laws as restrictions on free speech.  It also will mean that marketers will no longer see what drugs are prescribed on a per-physician basis in New Hampshire.  Will this lower drug prices?

&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty cool. It’s a little unexpected to me, too. One of the key aspects of the Moon is that it’s not as dense as the Earth — in fact, it’s just a bit more than half the Earth’s density — so you don’t expect it to have a lot of denser materials. Also, dense materials tend to sink and lighter ones float in a liquid, and we know the Moon was once entirely molten. So most of the uranium (which is among the densest of all elements) should be near the Moon’s core, not on the surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most&lt;/em&gt;, but not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;. It appears there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; some on the surface! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Update: I received some comments and email (hi Emily!) about this. I was trying to simplify the story about dense stuff sinking and I suppose I left off too much; of course, since we find uranium on the Earth’s surface it can’t all sink down. Basically, uranium likes to bind with oxygen, and that makes it into a less dense molecule which doesn’t just drop all the way down to the core, and that’s why it can be found on the Earth’s surface. I appreciate the comments on this — they keep me honest and usually give me a chance to learn something.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/moon_uranium.jpg" alt="Uranium on the Moon"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way you detect uranium is by gamma rays (having an old prospector pan for it probably won’t get you far, even if he has a Geiger counter). The nucleus of a uranium atom is packed with protons and neutrons; Uranium-238, for example, has 92 protons and 146 neutrons all coexisting in a little ball. Because of the weird ways of the quantum mechanical world, this nucleus is unstable, and after a while &lt;a href="http://www.wise-uranium.org/rup.html"&gt;it spontaneously ejects a little clump of two protons and two neutrons&lt;/a&gt;: a helium nucleus, or what’s called for historical reasons an alpha particle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with this alpha the uranium also emits two gamma rays, photons of light with very high energy. These photons go screaming off in some random direction. In this case, enough gamma rays were sent to the then-still-orbiting Kaguya’s gamma ray detector that it was able to see them. Different elements decay in different ways, and so they send off gamma rays with different energies, too. Kaguya’s detector was built to distinguish between these different gamma rays, and that’s how the scientists knew they had found uranium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s also how they found other elements like thorium, potassium, oxygen, magnesium, silicon, calcium, titanium, and iron, too. We already knew that there was oxygen and a few of those others on the lunar surface, but this method of mapping from orbit is effective in finding these particular flavors (OK, isotopes) of the elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? Practically, not a whole lot for now. It’s not like the first astronauts to go back to the Moon will get rich mining uranium, or even have enough to use it for power. In the future, however, any colonists will have to do large-scale mining to get access to aluminum, oxygen, and other things they need to build and survive on the Moon. Maybe they’ll find uranium in useful quantities then. It’s not a good reason to go back to the Moon, but it’s something for future space travelers to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what this does do is give us more clues into the birth, history, and evolution of the Moon; how it’s changed since it formed over 4 billion years ago. We’re pretty sure the Moon formed when a Mars-sized object slammed into the Earth, and the ejecta coalesced into our satellite. But we can always learn more details, and those help us understand just how this happened, and what has changed since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More knowledge is always good. You never know where it may lead. This is another step in understanding the Moon, and one day it’ll be the home for a lot of people. The more we know, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

This means accessibility for things like: public transportation and private taxi companies, court houses and retail outlets, and public hospitals and private clinics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three things I learned that I did not know before were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. You do not need to hire a lawyer to file an ADA complaint.  You can &lt;a href="http://www.ada.gov/t3compfm.htm"&gt;complain directly to the Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;.  For education-related complaints, you can go directly to the &lt;a href="http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/index.html"&gt;Department of Education&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. One of the things that can be directly requested in a complaint is that staff wherever the complaint has occurred be trained on ADA / disability / access / sensitivity, and even that they receive ongoing training on such.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. A requirement to comply with the ADA is that all government services and institutions provide &lt;strong&gt;Effective Communication&lt;/strong&gt;, including any "auxiliary aids and services" (this could include picture-based communication and communication devices).  This is really quite huge for those of us who struggle with conventional communication, take a look at what the &lt;a href="http://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap3toolkit.htm"&gt;ADA toolkit says about Effective Communication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of good stuff out there that isn't always well-known!  This is a powerful tool we have; need to use it more often.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246316709362"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/06/dr_isiss_shoe_of_the_week_11.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/62d7926ba80a51fc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weekly Shoe"/><title type="html">Dr. Isis's Shoe of the Week...</title><published>2009-06-29T21:03:10Z</published><updated>2009-06-29T21:03:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/6KSMJ7UEe6o/dr_isiss_shoe_of_the_week_11.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/06/dr_isiss_shoe_of_the_week_11.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;div align="justify"&gt;

    &lt;p align="justify"&gt;I know before we begin that this week's shoe will be controversial. Still, before you all start losing your junk, allow me to explain... I love science. I promise you that I really, really do. That doesn't mean that there aren't days that I don't look out of my window and dream of my escape. In my mind I run off to a small bungalow in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia"&gt;Andalucía&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There I spend my evenings working as a flamenco dancer and my afternoons drinking wine and eating tapas.

The relative of an autistic girl asks if there's such a thing as "therapy fatigue" in a letter published in the &lt;a href="http://www.mb.com.ph/node/204732"&gt;Manila Bulletin Publishing Corporation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;.....I noticed that the child is always tired of attending one therapy after another. She becomes cranky and would be moody at the end of the day. Sometimes, she even refuses to go out as if she doesn’t want any therapies anymore. Is there such thing as “therapy fatigue”? If yes, should I tell her parents to stop or lessen giving the child therapy session? If none, can you tell me until when should a child with autism continue to attend therapies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responds Dr. Myra V. Altonaga, a neurodevelopmental pediatrician based in Cebu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...herapy fatigue often occurs in children who are subjected to daily therapies (not just one therapy). In other words, their daily routine would include going from one therapy to another.&lt;br&gt;
In my clinical practice, I’ve encountered parents who would not be contented with the therapy in the center alone but would also get home service therapy within the day either just to fill up the schedule of their children, or to maximize the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have to remember that they are also children who want to play and do things that they enjoy. We have to give them enough time for these also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessening the therapy sessions would be helpful. Anyway, the big factor for the success in the intervention would be the follow through and the active participation of the family members and not the frequency of the therapy sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not hard for a parent to go into autism-therapy-overdrive with so many therapies and treatments, educational, biomedical, medical, etc.. When my son was younger, we tried many things; sometimes it felt (&lt;i&gt;felt&lt;/i&gt;) that there was an unconscious feeling among parents that "the more we're doing, the more it shows how hard we're trying. Gradually---after seeing what helped Charlie and what not---we let go of the alternative biomedical treatments and focused on his education. The only doctors we visit now are the pediatrician (inevitable colds and minor ailments), the neurologist, the dentist. (And I think we all felt a sense of relief at not driving him every which way to yet another therapy appointment.)&lt;/p&gt;

So much of it exists here on Earth, that if you were to add up all the oceans on Earth together, it would weigh more than &lt;b&gt;10^18 tonnes&lt;/b&gt;, more massive than &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)"&gt;the biggest asteroid ever&lt;/a&gt;, and about as massive as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon_(moon)"&gt;Pluto's giant moon, Charon&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/water_in_space_what_happens/1219_07_5---Sunset-over-the-Pacific-Ocean--California--USA_web.jpg" width="500" alt="1219_07_5---Sunset-over-the-Pacific-Ocean--California--USA_web.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But water only has a very small window in which it can be a liquid.  For instance, if you took some warm water up to a very high elevation, it would start to boil, and become a gas!  The higher up you took it, the lower and lower your boiling point would be.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/water_in_space_what_happens/svp_boiling_point.jpg" width="500" alt="svp_boiling_point.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why?&lt;/b&gt;  Because higher altitudes on Earth mean &lt;i&gt;lower pressure&lt;/i&gt;.  If there's not enough force pressing the water into a liquid phase, then there's no force binding the water molecules together.  If you simply allow them to diffuse away, they will.  And that's the definition of a gas, which is what you'll wind up with.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, water has no business being a liquid at low temperatures, either.  You can see -- from this diagram below -- that if you start with liquid water, you can turn it &lt;i&gt;into a gas by lowering the pressure&lt;/i&gt;, but you can also turn it &lt;i&gt;into a solid by lowering the temperature&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/water_in_space_what_happens/water-phase-diagram.jpg" width="500" alt="water-phase-diagram.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my question is &lt;a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/118/would-a-glass-of-water-in-space-freeze-or-boil"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If you took a glass of water into outer space, would the water &lt;i&gt;freeze&lt;/i&gt; or would the water &lt;i&gt;boil&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is a question that seems awfully tough, because in addition to knowing about water:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/water_in_space_what_happens/s_glass_of_water1.jpg" width="500" alt="s_glass_of_water1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need to know about outer space.  Space is a lot of things: cold, dark, and empty come to mind right away.  And they come to mind, pretty much, as soon as you leave the Earth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/space1.jpg" width="500" alt="space1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the temperature of space is, at its coldest, just the temperature of the leftover glow from the Big Bang.  This radiation, known as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation"&gt;Cosmic Microwave Background&lt;/a&gt;, bathes the entire Universe in a temperature of only 2.7 Kelvin.  That's less than 3 degrees above absolute zero, or -455 degrees Fahrenheit!  But there's also -- literally -- no pressure in space.  So, what happens?  Who wins?  Does the water freeze or boil?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, the answer is &lt;b&gt;first one&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;then the other&lt;/b&gt;!  It turns out that having a pressure vacuum will cause the water to boil almost instantly.  In other words, the effect of boiling is much, much faster than the effect of freezing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the story doesn't end there.  Once the water has boiled, we now have some isolated water molecules in a gaseous state, but a very, very cold environment!  These tiny water vapor droplets now immediately freeze (or, technically, &lt;a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Wath_is_desublimation"&gt;desublimate&lt;/a&gt;), and become ice crystals.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/ice-crystal2.jpg" width="500" alt="ice-crystal2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've observed this before.  According to &lt;a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/118/would-a-glass-of-water-in-space-freeze-or-boil"&gt;astronaut observations&lt;/a&gt;, where they've observed their urine get expelled from the ship:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When the astronauts take a leak while on a mission and expel the result into space, it boils violently. The vapor then passes immediately into the solid state (a process known as &lt;i&gt;desublimation&lt;/i&gt;), and you end up with a cloud of very fine crystals of frozen urine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sounds like it would be a fantastic thing to watch, doesn't it?  Well, we've done &lt;b&gt;almost&lt;/b&gt; the same thing on Earth.  What happens if you take boiling water and, on a very, very cold day, throw it up into the air?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/wJ3CKgZEitw%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water finishes boiling and becomes a gas, the gas freezes (or desublimates), and ice crystals -- a.k.a. snow -- results!  And that's what happens to water in space.  Oh, to be able to try this at home...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/water_in_space_what_happens.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246309533008"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-26613182.post-5224253177034264216">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c8fc0ee56cec0311</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Help a friend out</title><published>2009-06-29T20:38:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-12T16:48:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/06/help-friend-out.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/07/bed.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/07/bed.jpg" height="334" width="500" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hi all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Just a quick note here. A &lt;a href="http://www.mandikaye.com/"&gt;blogger &lt;/a&gt;who I have been reading for a while is in need of some help. She recently had some gall bladder problems and she had it removed in the emergency room. She is in pain and needs a couple of bucks to get a bed. She recently moved and has been sleeping on the couch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I "met" Amanda through her blog as she was writing her thoughts as she deconverted from a pretty strong fundamentalist faith into agnosticism. It was a very hard journey for her (as I understand it is for many who go through similar trials). In the process she lost some friends and most of her readership. As I said, &lt;a href="http://www.mandikaye.com/face-the-strange/"&gt;its a tough road&lt;/a&gt;. One I never had to go through.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can already imagine the fundies reacting with some heartwarming responses such as "You deserve it for turning your back on god". I don't know if anyone said that, I can just imagine it. &lt;a href="http://www.mandikaye.com/2009/06/26/i-need-your-help/"&gt;Throw a couple of bucks her way,&lt;/a&gt; she doesnt need much, show her how helpful the atheist community can be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.mandikaye.com/2009/07/03/good-slumber-is-finally-here/"&gt;Mandi has got her bed&lt;/a&gt;!

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend DuWayne Brayton &lt;a href="http://debrayton.blogspot.com/2009/06/help-vaccinate-child.html"&gt;did me one better with his plea&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been where a lot of those families are. While $25 may not seem like a hell of a lot to most people, when you are to the point where you have to ration your eating to five or six meals a week, to ensure your children get enough to eat, that works out to being a lot of meals you will miss that month. And I can also attest, trying to functionally work when you're only eating one meal, ever day or so is not easy and certainly not healthy. These are folks who cannot afford to lose a single damned dime. And so there are a lot of kids not getting the vaccines that will not only keep them safe - they keep their communities safe too.

&lt;p&gt;And so as bad as things are right now, I managed to throw down $25 dollars and will sleep somewhat more soundly tonight, knowing that I just ensured that a child in Nevada who wouldn't have been vaccinated will be now. And dammit, if I can manage that, what can you manage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excellent question. What can you manage? DuWayne reminded me that I'm in the very fortunate position where it's been a long time since $25 represented much money to me at all. Not everyone is so lucky. In fact, to a lot of people, $25 is a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/help_vaccinate_las_vegas_again.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/_hSj40nomkg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246305943052"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=14107">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9e68bb3938ac0379</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="contest"/><category term="Harvard"/><title type="html">Where Harvard Grads Live: The Answer to the Freakonomics Quiz</title><published>2009-06-29T18:09:29Z</published><updated>2009-06-29T18:09:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/29/where-harvard-grads-live-the-answer-to-the-freakonomics-quiz/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Last week I posed a question: what five cities are home to the greatest number of my Harvard classmates?

(Actually, blog reader &lt;strong&gt;Len&lt;/strong&gt; sort of had the right answer earlier, but it is totally obvious, if you've ever seen the red book that is my data source, that he cheated.)

&lt;p&gt;As you may recall, my fellow Hive Overminder Sheril Kirshenbaum &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/06/08/the-kissing-experiment/"&gt;is writing a book about kissing&lt;/a&gt;. She ran an experiment a few weeks ago about it, asking people to rate different pictures of people osculating. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/08/kiss-and-tell/"&gt;I posted about it&lt;/a&gt;, and apparently BABloggees are an affectionate lot, as she got an overwhelming response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, she got so many emails that can’t possibly respond to them all, so she has decided to use Twitter to keep people updated on recent events. If you want to stay on top of kissing, then &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/thekissingbook"&gt;follow her on Twitter at thekissingbook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you don’t like this idea, that’s fine; just don’t give me any lip about it.&lt;/p&gt;

I have lots of ideas about how this might work, but I’ll have to do a spot (haha) of research on it. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246298593758"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/megaconference_special_5_of_6_ada-aa_whyfor_in_employment">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1dfd2c94e5bafba1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Megaconference Special #5 of 6: ADA-AA Whyfor in Employment</title><published>2009-06-29T17:53:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-29T17:53:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/megaconference_special_5_of_6_ada-aa_whyfor_in_employment" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thinkpublic/3042807321/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3185/3042807321_c39158c632_m.jpg" alt="close up of a chalk board that reads &amp;#39;SOCIAL EQUALITY&amp;#39; the person&amp;#39;s fingers writing the final &amp;#39;Y&amp;#39; are visible in the lower right corner" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Saturday ended up being "ADA Day" for me at the Megaconference, both sessions I attended being on the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act).  The first was called "The ADA Amendment Acts of 2008" and focused on the definition of "disability" according to the ADA and employment (Section I).  The key item stressed in both ADA presentations is that the ADA is &lt;em&gt;civil rights&lt;/em&gt; legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who followed the ADA-AA as it was being worked on last year, I was already familiar with the basics--that the power of the ADA had been weakened and that the ADA-AA was to restore the original intent of congress.  What I was less familiar with were the concrete examples behind why this was so: over and over, people were being deemed "too disabled" to work at their jobs, but "not disabled enough" to be protected under the ADA.  So people were being fired, demoted, discriminated against, and then dismissed.  Imagine a woman who is fired for being female and then told she's not "womanly enough" for the ERA to apply to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the really fascinating bit to me was the speaker's rundown of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; this happened (I'm always so interested in the whys!).  Especially as this "why" has a lot to do with perspectives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADA is, again, civil rights legislation.  It is not a government service, it is not something one "applies for."  However (at least according to the speaker), when the &lt;a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/"&gt;Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&lt;/a&gt; first got a hold of it to create regulations, they came immediately from the perspective of social security and workman's compensation--government programs that require a person "prove" some "level" of disability--not from the perspective of civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lead to bickering over whether an individual was "qualified" rather than seeing the person as a member in a protected group, even to the point of going to people's houses to make sure they were "disabled enough" at home to qualify as protected in the workplace under the ADA.  Imagine a religious discrimination case involving someone going to your home to make sure you had the "right amount" of religious items in your house and following you to make sure you regularly attend religious services!  This is especially problematic as the ADA doesn't just protect people who are disabled, but people who are considered to be disabled (but aren't actually) or who are associated with someone else who is disabled!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADA-AA hopefully has changed this perspective around to make sure that the focus of anti-discrimination cases is on the discrimination rather than the "level of disability" of the person.  This is one of many examples of how perspectives and attitudes toward people on the spectrum, or people with disabilities, need to change and modernize to see us not as medical problems but as human beings with human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to watch how regulations and application of the legislation unfold as we move into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on the ADA-AA, see the U.S. Department of Labor's &lt;a href="http://www.dol.gov/esa/ofccp/regs/compliance/faqs/ADAfaqs.htm"&gt;ADA FAQs&lt;/a&gt;.

An excellent discussion of the NYT article can be found &lt;a href="http://dimer.tamu.edu/simplog/archive.php?blogid=3&amp;amp;pid=6771"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (and is well worth reading in its entirety). In it, Jim Hu did something I should have done, namely check the CRISP database in addition to PubMed. A couple of key points follow about the examples cited in the NYT article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding Dennis Slamon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I hate to criticize Dennis Slamon, because the HER2 to Herceptin story is a great one. But the image one gets of his research program being saved by a friend from Revlon while the NCI ignored him isn't consistent with what you get when you search for his grants in the CRISP database. Slamon got an NCI grant in 1984 to work on "oncogenes in physiologic and pathologic states". Two NCI grants are cited in the 1987 Science paper showing HER-2 amplification in breast cancer (one was probably for the collaborator's lab), and he's been pretty continuously funded by NCI since then. So I'd love to know what this story applies to.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me too. Regarding Ellen Jaffe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eileen Jaffe has studied the enzymology of porphobilinogen synthase under a 20-year multiply renewed grant from the National Institutes for Environmental and Health Sciences. Recently, she's been working on an idea called morpheeins, which she's patented as the basis for drug discovery. I have no idea what was in the grant, but what I see doesn't scream "missed opportunity to cure cancer" at me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which was my thought, too, looking at her publication record. Finally, regarding Louise R. Howe's studies on signaling and cancer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The plan, said the investigator, Louise R. Howe, an associate research professor at Weill Cornell Medical College, is first to confirm her hypothesis about the pathway in breast cancer cells. But even if it is correct, the much harder research would lie ahead because no drugs exist to block the pathway, and even if they did, there are no assurances that they would be safe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what Kolata has against Dr. Howe's project. The same could have been said about HER2 in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or about any number of oncogenes and targeted therapies. Yikes! The same could be said about what I'm working on. Oh, no, that must mean I'm not sufficiently innovative for Kolata's taste...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/are_we_playing_it_too_safe_in_cancer_res_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/_cQOXh6fCXQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246295331896"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4280">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a7766f0a71de2e49</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="1000words" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="1000 Words"/><title type="html">Trichoglossus haematodus moluccanus</title><published>2009-06-29T17:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-22T18:46:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/06/trichoglossus-h.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;

Not bad, but the catch? You have to sign over your immortal soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I think this is a bad deal for them in many cases. I know that as collateral, for example, my soul may not be worth all that much. It’s been through a lot and is no longer in mint condition — more like poor-to-fair, with some tears, and stains… and I’m pretty sure the binding is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, um, how do they collect? I’m sure we’ve all heard of harassing phone calls and the occasional broken knee from the collection guys. I don’t see how this might work though. What kind of extraction tool would they use? A scythe? A golden trump? Beating me with a Pearly Gate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And third: if they did try to collect, I would declare moral bankruptcy. What can they do? In my case, it’s an act of God.&lt;/p&gt;

Pricing the bathroom would reduce the quantity demanded; some people would wait and race off the plane to the airport bathrooms (unless airports started charging also).

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Glendon Mellow of the &lt;a href="http://glendonmellow.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;The Flying Trilobite&lt;/a&gt;, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm yet another Canadian atheist artist-illustrator recovering goth-punk who blogs about incorrectly drawn fossil arthropods. We should have a lobby group. I grew up and live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and attended York University for Fine Arts.  I'll actually &lt;a href="http://glendonmellow.blogspot.com/2009/06/im-student-again.html" title=""&gt;be returning&lt;/a&gt; to complete that degree this fall after many years away. Evolution was always an interest, but after reading &lt;i&gt;River Out of Eden&lt;/i&gt; by Richard Dawkins, I was far more inspired by that book than post-modern painting. It's been pretty much a straight line from there to where I am now, blogging at &lt;a href="http://glendonmellow.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;The Flying Trilobite: art in awe of science&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm also a contributor at the group paleo-art blog, &lt;a href="http://blogevolved.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Art Evolved: Life's Time Capsule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="GlendonMellow pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/GlendonMellow%20pic.jpg" width="336" height="448" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Making a full time career out of illustrating and art-making is my eventual goal. It's getting closer all the time, and I desperately would love to illustrate a book with surreal scientific images. Perhaps for children. I'd like to work on another degree, and I'm torn between a biology undergrad and post-undergrad concept art courses. I could see myself using my management background to become an art director for a scientific group or institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massive online amateur research programs like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioBlitz" title=""&gt;BioBlitz&lt;/a&gt; I think have a potential to somehow become fused with a game like World of Warcraft  or maybe Facebook groups.  People join WoW and Facebook groups for a sense of accomplishment and belonging -they make a statement about you- so I could see amateur research projects fusing with those in some way.  That's been on my mind since hearing &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/" title=""&gt;GrrlScientist&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Nature_blogging/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline09&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/%7Ejsachs/" title=""&gt;Joel Sachs&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://scibarcamp.org/SciBarCamp2_-_Toronto" title=""&gt;SciBarCamp&lt;/a&gt; Toronto. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Relating to art, I think the quality of scientific illustration and indeed all illustration is rapidly going up.  You're competing with everyone.  Artists are better at younger ages because there is a higher bar. And with something like Art Evolved, even though it's only a few months old, we have enthusiastic, largely unpublished (thought that's changing) artists &lt;a href="http://blogevolved.blogspot.com/2009/06/dr-mark-witton-weighs-in-on-pterosaur.html" title=""&gt;engaging in a debate&lt;/a&gt; about pterosaur wings with paleontologists.  That's not something I would expect to see outside the blogosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You are an artist - why is your art science-related? What motivates you and what are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People enjoy the feeling of the sublime, like you're in the presence of something greater than yourself, and art has often dealt with that through myth and metaphor.  I like exploring what new, awe-inspiring visual metaphors can be created with this wealth of real information and imagery that science gives us. Why use an image of a halo to enhance beauty in a portrait when you can use diatoms? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your most famous picture is the Darwin Took Steps, features already in many places including the cover of Open Lab 2008. What gave you the idea for this work? What does it mean?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Open Lab 2008 cover came out lookin' sweet, thanks to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/worldsfair" title=""&gt;David Ng&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The painting is about the pattern of thought the starts building a memetic structure, taking those first steps up into the idea of evolution by natural selection and through Charles Darwin's thoughts, elevating the rest of us into that place so we can build on the idea with evidence.  I could have used any amount of stairs, but I chose 5 to represent Darwin's main lines of evidence: biogeography, morphology, embryology, and paleontology, with the last step open to represent natural selection, or the elevation of reason over dogma.  That's the type of symbolism I don't think a viewer could get from the painting itself, but it is important to me to make sure I have a reason in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept actually came from a much older painting I did for a never-saw-print cd cover, with "random old wise man" with a staircase head. Marrying the idea to Darwin produces a strong reaction of familiarity in people who understand his theory. I didn't set out to create this painting to be popular, or to resonate more than my others.  I just thought it was a neat drawing, Darwin Day was coming up and I wanted to &lt;a href="http://glendonmellow.blogspot.com/2008/02/making-of-darwin-took-steps.html" title=""&gt;try speed painting&lt;/a&gt;.  I painted it in three hours.  It's since appeared on numerous websites, a magazine and a couple of book covers. It &lt;a href="http://theflyingtrilobite.deviantart.com/art/Darwin-Took-Steps-textversion-95006021" title=""&gt;caused a ruckus&lt;/a&gt; on DeviantArt as a featured painting this year and led to a full-on argument between the science crowd and creationists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I can throw in a plug, I'm donating portions of the sales bearing this image to &lt;a href="http://thebeagleproject.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;The Beagle Project&lt;/a&gt;, and I have cards, prints and shirts available in my &lt;a href="http://flyingtrilobite.redbubble.com/sets/12783/works" title=""&gt;Reproduction Shop&lt;/a&gt;. Let's build a ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various options online can be daunting for a new artist.  It's so easy for people to rip off artwork and claim it as their own, but on the other hand, it's an unparalleled medium for sharing images.  There's never been anything close to this in history.  After Science Online I was waiting with other participants at the airport, and &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/henrygee/blog" title=""&gt;Henry Gee&lt;/a&gt; asked me if blogging had changed my life.  It absolutely has.  It yanked me out of a deep, lightless artistic depression.  I'd been sitting on paintings for years, occasionally making something new, frustrated with work that few people I knew liked. Using the blogging platform, I can display my, um, let's say niche artwork and still have a decent audience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried liveblogging a painting for Darwin Day shortly after the conference.  I burned out on it.  Painting for two hours, then 20 minutes of uploading and colour-correcting the image, then painting 2 more hours...I spiralled into a strange place with that image.  It felt as though I let people following down.  It's sitting in my studio glaring me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I participate on &lt;a href="http://theflyingtrilobite.deviantart.com/" title=""&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/glendon-mellow/11/915/2b1" title=""&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.redbubble.com/people/flyingtrilobite" title=""&gt;RedBubble&lt;/a&gt; which has an excellent online &lt;a href="http://flyingtrilobite.redbubble.com/" title=""&gt;print shop&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/flyingtrilobite" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; has actually gotten me back into Facebook. People who've never commented on my blog were &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Flying-Trilobite/12564141562" title=""&gt;becoming fans&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook: are they lurkers, quietly enjoying the paintings?  I don't know. You start thinking about all of the eyes on you.  It becomes a responsibility to become a better artist.  I began posting new art every Monday as a way to discipline myself toward my blogpeeps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a Richard Dawkins fan, I really discovered blogs through links on his website, maybe 5 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriving at the hotel, &lt;a href="http://deepseanews.com/" title=""&gt;Kevin Zelnio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://southernfriedscientist.com/" title=""&gt;Southern Fried Scientist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://theoystersgarter.com/" title=""&gt;Miriam Goldstein&lt;/a&gt; yanked me into conversation, and I let some of my imposter syndrome fade away.  &lt;a href="http://datanotshown.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Karen James&lt;/a&gt; exudes cool. Talking with &lt;a href="http://almostdiamonds.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Stephanie Zvan&lt;/a&gt; between sessions helped me remember this was real somehow. I follow a ton of the blogs from the conference attendees. Anything in my sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You led two sessions at the conference - what did you learn from that experience?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unconference format took the edge off, easier to be yourself. In the first session, the audience wanted to overwhelmingly move past the "two cultures" discussion about art and science - a huge contrast to the group at SciBarCamp here in Toronto in May. It hit me during the talk that maybe the distance of art and science is something you only see when standing in your own present - looking back across the decades of art past, it's easy to see art inspired by science standing tall above its history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brought up what I had largely been thinking about at the time - that much of art based on scientific inspiration is somewhat parasitic, not giving much back. The group was vocal, emotional about the contribution of art to inspiring scientists. I'm still trying to absorb that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second session artist/scientist/force of nature &lt;a href="http://www.tanjasova.com/" title=""&gt;Tanja Sova&lt;/a&gt; and I tried to lend some tips on image making.  The unconference format was good, but if we do a follow-up next year, I think blogging some step-by-steps in advance, a call for potential volunteers for a step-by-step would be helpful.  I also learned that the best way to close a conference with laughs is to have your volunteer tech-person accidentally pull up nudity onscreen due to a mis-typed url.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Roger_Harris/" title=""&gt;Roger Harris's session&lt;/a&gt; and comments from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/" title=""&gt;Greg Laden&lt;/a&gt; made me re-think my whole blog look.  I changed it immediately.  Follow-up email exchanges after the conference have my mind ticking about visualization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bora, there was so much - !  If blogging changed my life, then Science Online 09 did just as much.  I have been massively discontented since leaving the unconference.  Casting about for a new direction. There was a heady optimism in the attendees.  The feeling of being around that many people doing what they love to do left me frustrated and hopeful that I can do the same with illustrating some day soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great to meet you too!  &lt;/p&gt;

Let's say you're on the latitude of Northern Europe and you've become a locavore, someone who avoids foodstuffs that must be transported far from their production site. Let's also say that you don't like greenhouses. And finally, let's say you're hooked on coffee or tea. Is there a caffeine source that can be grown outdoors in Northern Europe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most psychoactive substances only occur in a small group of closely related plants. But caffeine pops up in widely divergent branches of the floral kingdom. Does anybody know of a caffeine-producing plant that, say, a Dane or a Canadian could grow in his back yard?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/06/north_european_natural_caffein.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/1gQeCa30cs0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246292010053"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/06/current_archaeology_232.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6937141826cd4227</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">Current Archaeology 232</title><published>2009-06-29T13:21:57Z</published><updated>2009-06-29T13:21:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/0lRxLp3JyTg/current_archaeology_232.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/06/current_archaeology_232.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.archaeology.co.uk/issues/ca-232.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/06/current_archaeology_232/001_COVER232.jpg" width="150" height="204" alt="001_COVER232.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Archaeology's&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.archaeology.co.uk/issues/ca-232.htm"&gt;July issue&lt;/a&gt; offers a lot of good reading, of which I particularly like the stories on human origins (see below) and garden archaeology at Kenilworth Castle. But I have two complaints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First point of criticism. The editors of CA have this weird habit of doing "media tie-ins" without any clear indication of authorship. In the past three issues were excerpts from a forthcoming book by Barry Cunliffe. They weren't billed as written &lt;i&gt;by&lt;/i&gt; Cunliffe. Instead you got the impression that a nameless writer had read his book manuscript and paraphrased it for the magazine. "Cunliffe believes this", "Cunliffe says that".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current issue this gets taken even further. Here's a really interesting eight-page feature on the predecessors and origin of &lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt;. It has no by-line, but its intro hints that it's got something to do with a BBC documentary hosted by University of Bristol anthropologist Alice Roberts. The piece is illustrated i.a. with three pictures of Roberts. But she isn't the author of the piece, nor is one Chris Stringer who is mentioned in a box at the end as advisor to the series. Roberts hardly gets to say a word in the text, and Stringer isn't quoted at all. To learn who is talking in this magazine article, you have to flip to the table of contents where we finally learn that CA features editor Neil Faulkner wrote it. But whose opinions is he relaying? His own? Alice Roberts's? Chris Stringer's? Other people's mentioned in the piece?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear CA editors, it would strengthen the credibility of your excellent work if every piece in the mag had a clear indication of authorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second point of criticism. On p. 26 editor Lisa Westcott gives a garbled (folk?) etymology of the word "bereaved". In modern English it means "recently struck by the death of a loved one". Westcott traces the origin of the word to Early Modern raiders on the Scottish border, "reavers", suggesting that "bereaved" entered the English language as meaning "having been attacked by reavers". This is a case where correlation does not entail causation. Both "reaver" and "bereaved" instead hark back to a common ancestor, the ancient verb "&lt;a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O27-reave.html"&gt;to reave&lt;/a&gt;" (cognate with Sw. &lt;i&gt;röva&lt;/i&gt;), meaning "to rob". The entry of "bereaved" into English thus has nothing to do with Early Modern Scottish robbers in particular.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/06/current_archaeology_232.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/0lRxLp3JyTg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246291811163"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-6001611693644646243">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/44859fc6dfeb25a4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Nitpickers Have Started to Attack</title><published>2009-06-29T16:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-29T19:01:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/TYDRwjFVLW0/nitpickers-have-stated-to-attack.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/6001611693644646243/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=6001611693644646243" title="22 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/06/nitpickers-have-stated-to-attack.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">The more educated and intelligent a scholar is then the more that scholar argues against the main argument of his opponent. You can actually tell from what they attack whether they are scholarly or not. They do not nitpick at minor points unrelated to the main argument itself, unless they have first dealt with his main argument. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, the nitpickers have started attacking my book.&lt;span&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Layman over at &lt;a href="http://christiancadre.blogspot.com/2009/06/john-loftuss-research-or-lack-thereof.html"&gt;Christian Cadre&lt;/a&gt; wrote something about a list of professing Christians I claimed who don’t believe in the empty tomb. He disputes some of them, and he may be right, but I don’t think so. Nonetheless my argument in that chapter stands on its own merits and he has said nothing about it. Nothing. Yup, that's right. Nothing was said against the arguments I laid out in that chapter. That's nada, zip, zilch, zero. Big deal if he’s right on a couple of these names. If all that's required is to nitpick a book for errors in a list of names then have at it, as I said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But some people have come away thinking with Brad Haggard, that I have "no credible sources" and therefore my "whole argument is undercut." And so it must be that "the list was blatant mischaracterization." Why does he conclude this? Because he has not read my book to know what my argument is, that’s why.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My book covers the topics of God, man and the universe, using the disciplines of science, theology, apologetics, philosophy, history, Biblical studies, and so forth. No mere mortal can have a good grasp of it all, as I told Layman in an email. I even admitted that &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/11/ive-concluded-that-i-am-wrong.html"&gt;I know I'm wrong about some things&lt;/a&gt;, so I'm willing to learn. Whether Layman is correct or not I'm not sure, and that's my final word on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's what John Beversluis wrote about my book: &lt;blockquote&gt;"No review can begin to do justice to an ambitious book of this scope or to the sustained theological, philosophical, scientific, textual, and historical critique of Christianity that it contains. Suffice it to say at the outset that I have never read a book that presents such a massive and systematic refutation of the claims of Christianity, and I have seldom read a book that marshals evidence (from such a wide variety of disciplines) and documents its claims in such painstaking detail." &lt;/blockquote&gt;But along comes Layman nitpicking about a detail. Others will do likewise. I am a mere mortal. I did the best I could with what I was doing. I do not have to defend the minutia. Deal with my larger case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My contention is that at best so far for the most part, all I have seen are mischaracterizations of my book, personal attacks on me, nitpicking at small details, and sloppy reasoning in trying to refute it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another nitpicker is Matt Flanagan who wrote a post &lt;a href="http://www.mandm.org.nz/2009/06/sunday-study-slavery-john-locke-and.html"&gt;about slavery&lt;/a&gt; claiming with others that the slavery in the American South was not Biblical and should never have been justified from the Bible. He quotes me in it where I say the results were horrific for Frederick Douglass and his aunt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can read our exchange there, but I said this: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I find interesting, Matt, is that you have not addressed my main question in my book: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Why didn’t the Christian God ever explicitly and clearly condemn slavery?...why didn’t God tell his people, “Thou shalt not own, buy, sell, or trade slaves,” and say it as often as he needed to? Why was God not clear about this in the Bible? Just think how Copan’s own arguments would resonate with him if he were born into the brutal slavery of the South! What would he think then as his blood was spilled at the hands of a Bible-quoting master? Sam Harris claims, ‘Nothing in Christian theology remedies the appalling deficiencies of the Bible on what is perhaps the greatest—and the easiest—moral question our society has ever had to face.’”&lt;/blockquote&gt;Was your God as clear on this issue as he was about murder? Oh, that's not a good analogy because, well, you know, genocide, the witch hunts, heresy trials and the crusades. Hmmmm. Okay, let’s try this one: Was your God as clear about this as he was that we should love our neighbors? Oh, that's not a good analogy because, well, you know, the question was "who is my neighbor?” right? But once you get my point you'll have no good answers to this problem and you know it, so instead you side-step it as you did here. That's what it takes to believe, Matt, side stepping problems because you cannot reasonably explain them. Skeptics say believers are ignorant, and they are, but they’re not unintelligent. It takes a great deal of intelligence to find ways around these types of problems in order to resolve the &lt;em&gt;cognitive dissonance&lt;/em&gt; they create. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I find your post absolutely pathetic. Oh, that's right, everyone should've seen the truth about slavery as you do based on hindsight. Does this require that believers should be able to study the Hebrew and Greek? They had the King James Version. They came to their own conclusions as Protestants without requiring Catholic ecclesiastical interpretive authority. So, what does God require here?...that they become scholars and figure out by hindsight like you have on these issues? Yeah, right. In fact. I'll bet you think your views on women, heresy trials and the crusades should’ve been plainly obvious to the historic church too. They were just stupid on a par with a rock, right? No, better ease your mind with the idea that they just did not care to follow God, that they purposely twisted the Bible knowing they were wrong for, oh, three centuries when it came to the witch trials. No, they weren't sincere, were they, or Christians, because Christians always understand the truth and they always behave godly, right? Yes, there are insincere professing Christians, but in my experience people agonized over knowing what God's will was for them--the overwhelming majority did. And given the threat of hell why wouldn't they?

If not, why not? Do you know there is an entire skeptics track planned again this year, bigger and better than last year (and it pretty much &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=2653"&gt;kicked ass last year&lt;/a&gt;). This year, we have more space, more speakers and more Skepchicks coming.  We also have a special event happening the day before Dragon*Con starts so make sure you plan ahead.  The Atlanta Skeptics are planning a star gazing party, hosted by none other than Phil Plait and Pamela Gay.  We’ll have drinks, dinner, and of course, some star gazing once the sun goes down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hope you can join us. This event is in honor of our friend and fellow skeptic, Jeff Medkeff. Jeff was the astronomer who discovered and &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=1166"&gt;named an asteroid after Rebecca&lt;/a&gt;. We were all devastated when Jeff lost his battle with liver cancer last year and proceeds from this event will go to the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will also be a rocking good time. In addition to Phil and Pamela, we have a bunch of skepchicks and skeptics who have already signed up to attend. Brian Thompson from &lt;a href="http://www.amateurscientist.org/"&gt;Amateur Scientist&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Saunders and Rachel Dunlop from &lt;a href="http://www.skepticzone.tv/"&gt;The Skeptic Zone&lt;/a&gt;, plus our own Rebecca Watson, ARealGirl and Carr2d2 will all be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are limited and &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; sell out. So head over to the &lt;a href="http://www.atlantaskeptics.com/2009-star-party-a-full-moon-for-cancer/"&gt;Atlanta Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; site to buy tickets now!

It's been a harrowing, overlong day and a half of travel, with late flights leading to missed connections leading to long periods standing in lines with Germans, who were all very nice and helpful, except that I learned that even if your flight is leaving in &lt;i&gt;ten minutes&lt;/i&gt; they will politely tell you that no, you cannot move to the front of the line. And now at last, though, I have finally arrived at my lovely funky hotel in &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/"&gt;Lindau&lt;/a&gt;, and it's a beautiful afternoon, and I'm going to take a pleasant walk down to the lake, and maybe I don't need those rude German words after all.&lt;/p&gt;

But I wanted to share with you some pictures of clouds that, you’ll agree, look pretty amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I showed these pictures of clouds to a few people to get their reaction, and they all pretty much said the same thing, that it looked like The Rapture, or The Apocalypse, or the end of the world was at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="asperatus-cloud-over-hanm-002" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/asperatus-cloud-over-hanm-002.jpg" alt="asperatus-cloud-over-hanm-002" width="520" height="390"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear not, gentle readers. Nothing so radical is afoot, however, in the world of clouds, something might occur that hasn’t occurred in almost 60 years. These clouds are deserving of a new cloud classification, according to the folks at the &lt;a href="http://cloudappreciationsociety.org/june-09/"&gt;Cloud Appreciation Society&lt;/a&gt; based out of Somerton, England. They are making a push to have these types of could formations to be officially classified as “asperatus”, which means “rough” in Latin. CAS is reportedly working with the Royal Meteorological Society to have it officially classified by the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva. The WMO has the final say on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the CAS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our proposed new cloud variety shares some similarities with existing formations such as the more regular waves of undulatus clouds and the hanging pouches of mamma clouds, but we feel that this cloud is different enough from them to be classified as a variety of its own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safe to say that because the WMO has not assigned a new classification of could since 1951, then the acceptance of asperatus would be a pretty big deal to meteorological science, and a big-time feather in the cap of the CAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="asperatus-cloud-over-ceda-0011" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/asperatus-cloud-over-ceda-0011.jpg" alt="asperatus-cloud-over-ceda-0011" width="630" height="354"&gt;One of our listeners brought this news story to my attention. He sent me a Facebook message asking me if I thought any of these pictures were fakes, and why wouldn’t there be thousands of pictures like them over the course of the years and decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is always possible that fake photos could mingle in with some of the legitimate photographs. This news story has been around for a few weeks, and there are no serious allegations of any trickery that I can find. I think it is reasonable that anyone who had proof of any of these being faked would step forward loudly and proudly, and that day might still come. In the meantime, I think we need to accept these as legitimate photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="asperatus-cloud-over-schi-006" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/asperatus-cloud-over-schi-006.jpg" alt="asperatus-cloud-over-schi-006" width="536" height="390"&gt;Why haven’t thousands of photos of clouds like this been taken? One reason might be, according to the CAS, that these cloud formations do not linger. They form and move rapidly, and in as short a span as 15 minutes, they have come and gone. Now that this news story has made it around the press circuit, bringing a new level of attention to groups such as the CAS, I think we will soon start to see new photos of “asperatus” cropping up on the internet by those who have the patience it takes to be cloud hunters.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Evan Bernstein</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246285680321"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=14061">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a088838f79da429f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="Baseball" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="game theory" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><title type="html">The Failure of Yankees Fans (and Mets Fans Too)</title><published>2009-06-29T14:09:54Z</published><updated>2009-06-29T14:09:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/29/the-failure-of-yankees-fans-and-mets-fans-too/" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/29/the-failure-of-yankees-fans-and-mets-fans-too/#comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/29/the-failure-of-yankees-fans-and-mets-fans-too/feed/atom/" type="application/atom+xml"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/wp-atom.php" xml:lang="en" type="html">I took the family to last night's Yankees-Mets game at the new Citi Field.

In my book &lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/em&gt;, I talk about the many ways our galactic neighborhood can wipe out life on Earth: nearby supernovae, magnetar hissy fits, episodic oscillations of the Sun carrying us into a stream of dangerous intergalactic cosmic rays, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that litany of disastrous scenarios, you wish to breathe a momentary sigh of relief that perhaps one of these things can be scratched off the list: the Earth plowing into the galaxy’s spiral arms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Milky Way is a disk galaxy, a flattened circle of stars, gas, and dust. The spiral arms are like traffic jams of material; gravitational speed bumps where gas can pile up and form stars. There aren’t that many more stars in the arms than between them, it’s just where the biggest and brightest tend to be, so they light the place up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are more and denser gas clouds in the arms on average, and every few hundred million years the Sun drifts into and out of these regions. It’s been supposed that wandering into a nebula like this can potentially affect the Earth’s environment. If the dust is dense enough it can block sunlight, cooling the Earth, causing an ice age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a new study shows this may not be the case. &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/06/26/past-climate-change-cannot-be-tied-to-earth-passing-through-galactic-plane/"&gt;Universe Today has the details&lt;/a&gt;, but basically there appears to be a 140 million year period to changes in Earth’s climate, which was suspiciously close to the period between encounters with our galaxy’s arms. The new study — using actual data of how dense clouds of gas and dust orbit the Milky Way to calculate when our Sun moves into the spiral arms —  finds this period does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; line up with any galactic goings-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does that mean we’re safe? Well, no. First, all those other impending disasters are still out there, though of course the good news is that they are incredibly rare and basically won’t happen for millions of years (in other words, don’t fret). Second, the period of climate change is still apparently real, it’s just that it’s not tied to the Sun’s orbit around the center of the Milky Way. If it is real, then something must be causing it. We’ve taken one cause off the list, but what else are we missing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I won’t be rushing to edit that chapter in my book just yet. This study looks good, but I’ll wait and see what other scientists say. With another few dozen million years to go, I have plenty of time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246282675200"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7942">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/45ecba0d3b8edd65</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies, June 29</title><published>2009-06-29T13:16:24Z</published><updated>2009-06-29T13:16:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7942" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7bda4e42383a577e6de747739e15649f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

I have been fortunate to have excellent condensed matter colleagues at both my recent institutions, and quite a number of them are interested in soft condensed matter - classical physics that describes the behavior of large numbers of particles, far from equilibrium, often when entropic considerations dominate the dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field covers such diverse systems as the behavior of biological membranes and the dynamics of grain in silos, and contains many examples in which nontrivial geometry and topology lead to the possibility of discovering new phenomena that, unlike in my own field, can increasingly often be checked in a laboratory experiment designed and built in a relatively short time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story that caught my eye (via &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/"&gt;Wired Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) recently concerns the behavior of a system that is so simple that you would think we know all that there is to be known about it - falling sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;



&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/vD4PbSbxA3w%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video above, a stream of sand is allowed to fall over several feet, and is filmed using a high speed video camera that falls at the same speed as the sand. The result, as you can see, is that the sand forms “droplets” just as water would, even though most people would not think of granular materials as anything like a liquid. The work was performed by &lt;a href="http://jfi.uchicago.edu/~jaeger/group/"&gt;Heinrich Jaeger&lt;/a&gt;’s group at the University of Chicago, and &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7250/abs/nature08115.html"&gt;published in the current issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which also deemed it worthy of a &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7250/full/4591064a.html"&gt;News and Views article&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7250/edsumm/e090625-07.html"&gt;Editor’s Summary&lt;/a&gt; (subscription required for all these things, unfortunately).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this system is still not fully understood - although it is clearly displaying liquid-like characteristics, the scales of the droplets and the forces involved are very different from the traditional regimes in which liquids are described - so there’s still work to be done. You can see many other examples of behavior like this on&lt;a href="http://jfi.uchicago.edu/~jaeger/group/granular.html"&gt; Jaeger’s granular materials page&lt;/a&gt;, with even more videos. The one I liked best is this granular jet one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember - that ball isn’t falling into a thick liquid - that’s sand!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are apparently all kinds of applications of this kind of work. but I just think it’s beautiful all on its own.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246281065458"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/clocktutorial_1_-_what_is_chro.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/27ff18ea6f3f5f25</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Tutorials"/><title type="html">ClockTutorial #1 - What Is Chronobiology</title><published>2009-06-29T11:22:29Z</published><updated>2009-06-29T11:22:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/pMTXocuecdE/clocktutorial_1_-_what_is_chro.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/clocktutorial_1_-_what_is_chro.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://circadiana.blogspot.com/2005/01/clocktutorial-1-what-is-chronobiology.html" title="ClockTutorial #1 - What Is Chronobiology?"&gt;&lt;img alt="ClockWeb%20logo2.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2006/06/ClockWeb%20logo2.JPG" width="104" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://circadiana.blogspot.com/2005/01/clocktutorial-1-what-is-chronobiology.html" title=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is the first in a series of posts from Circadiana designed as &lt;a href="http://borazivkovic.blogspot.com/2005/01/clock-tutorials.html" title=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;ClockTutorials, covering the basics of the field of Chronobiology.

It was a rather poorly argued bit of polemic, backed up only with anecdotes that came across as sour grapes by scientists whose grant proposals the NIH had decided not to fund, and based on  many misconceptions she had regarding basic science versus translational research, journal impact factors, and how journals actually determine what they will publish. Not suprisingly, Begley's article caught flak from others, including &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2009/06/begler_mistakes_the_symptom_fo.php"&gt;Mike the Mad Biologist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=522"&gt;Tim Kreider&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=776"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt;, and, of course, yours truly, who &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/academia_slowing_down_the_search_for_cur.php"&gt;laid down some serious Respectful Insolence&lt;/a&gt; upon the entire article--and deservedly so, I might add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To follow up on the same theme, an article appeared on the front page of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; yesterday proclaiming that the NIH is "playing it too safe" when it comes to funding cancer research. Basically, it is a variant of the same complaints I've heard time and time again. Now, don't get me wrong. By no means am I saying that the current system that the NIH uses to determine which scientists get funded is without problems or a well-oiled machine. Those who complain that the system is often too conservative have a point. The problem, all too often, however, is that the proposals for how to fix the problem are usually either never spelled out or rest on dubious assumptions about the nature of cancer research--indeed, of research itself. Indeed, the NYT article strikes me as simply &lt;em&gt;"Why are we losing the war on cancer?" 2009 edition&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, they look like more than that. As &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2009/06/oh_this_will_be_fun_kolata_on.php"&gt;Mike the Mad Biologist&lt;/a&gt; speculates, one has to wonder if there is some sort of coordinated effort to pressure the government to change the policies at the NCI to be more nurturing of "risky" projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/are_we_playing_it_too_safe_in_cancer_res.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/are_we_playing_it_too_safe_in_cancer_res.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/XKq0pdPCQio" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246278797509"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticblog.org/?p=3182">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/db22dff27280df5f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Superstitions"/><category term="celebrity"/><title type="html">Celebrity Deaths</title><published>2009-06-29T12:10:46Z</published><updated>2009-06-29T12:10:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/06/29/celebrity-deaths/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.skepticblog.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week saw four celebrity deaths – well, at least four that were prominent enough in the news that I heard about them: Farrah Fawcett, Ed McMahon, Billy Mays, and Michael Jackson. We pay attention to celebrity deaths because we pay attention to celebrities, and we pay attention to celebrities because they are celebrities. This is a trite answer, but essentially there is something in our culture and hard wiring that makes us fascinated with fame. Most of us will get a little weird when we are in the presence of a famous person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple celebrity deaths in such a short period of time often provokes the superstitious to engage their pattern recognition and hyperactive agency detection. This usually results in the notion that “celebrity deaths always occur in threes.” This is a classic example of open-ended criteria leading to confirmation bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this skeptical jargon means is that the notion that celebrity deaths happens in sets of three is not bound by any specific criteria – who counts as a celebrity, and over what period of time do the deaths need to occur to count as happening together? If after one celebrity death you simply wait however long it takes for two more to occur, you will have confirmed the belief that the grim reaper does indeed kill celebs in spurts of three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Also, many of you may be wondering who Billy Mays is. Everyone knows who Michael Jackson is. My daughters had no idea who Farrah Fawcett or Ed McMahon were, so I guess there is a generational factor to their fame. But when I told people that Billy Mays had died, I had to follow up with, “You know, that loud pitchman who sells Oxyclean.” If you want to hold onto your belief in the trifecta principle of celebrity demise, you could discount Billy Mays as not famous enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is  a fairly mundane example of the principle of open-ended criteria, but it is a belief that most people have heard, and therefore much of the public has likely engaged (with varying degrees of seriousness) in this bit of confirmation bias. It is therefore a good everyday example of this principle. It points out why scientific experiments need to have objective and rigorously determined criteria every step of the way. Clinical studies, for example, are more reliable when their endpoints are predetermined and completely objective. Death is a good endpoint. Feeling better is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the celebrity deaths that is interesting is that many people want to use the death of a prominent person as a moral lesson. I am not claiming innocence in this either. If a celebrity dies at the hands of pseudoscience, I will happily (although tactfully) exploit their death to warn the public about the dangers of pseudoscience. I try to do this only when the story is public and unambiguous. Peter Sellers decided to have psychic surgery for his coronary artery disease, and as a result died prematurely of a heart attack. People should know that psychic surgery is a pure scam, and one that can kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farrah Fawcett had anal cancer for which she received standard treatment, including chemotherapy, but also went to Germay to receive a pseudoscientific “immune boosting” nutritional treatment for her cancer. I decided not to use her as an example of the dangers of cancer quackery because she did receive standard care and I did not have the specific details to know if the alternative treatment interfered with her science-based care at all. Her case is therefore an ambiguous anecdote, not a clear cautionary tale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was therefore intrigued (i.e. disgusted) by &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-12517-Miami-Holistic-Health-Examiner~y2009m6d28-Michael-Jackson-Farrah-Fawcett-and-pharmaceutical-drug-hazards"&gt;this absurd commentary&lt;/a&gt; by “holistic” promoter Jed Shlackman. He actually argues that Farrah was being helped by the nutritional therapy and was harmed by the chemotherapy – if only she had forgone scientific treatment in favor of psuedoscience. He thinks that her story is a cautionary tale against chemotherapy. It is a sign of the times that the mainstream media will publish such dangerous rubish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, chemotherapy is an imperfect treatment, very toxic and not always successful. But we have decades of scientific research to inform us about the risks and benefits of chemotherapy (you have to consider both risks and benefits), and it has saved many lives. Alternative cancer clinics and their gurus can never produce scientific evidence to back up their claims – they are always “too busy saving people” – a lame excuse, and ethically dubious even if it were true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlackman also offers us Michael Jackson as a cautionary tale about prescription medicine – when will the public finally realize that prescription drugs are dangerous. He claims that doctors push drugs to make money, a slanderous and false charge. What does appear to be the case with Michael Jackson (and I want to emphasize I can only surmise from information that has been made public) is that wealthy celebrities can easily manage to surround themselves with yes-men and enablers. Jackson appears to have become addicted to several medications, including pain medications and sedatives. Addiction is a powerful thing. Some people can only be saved by tough love, often in the form of an intervention. I get the feeling that Jackson’s inner circle was devoid of any tough love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen this situation with patients who were not celebrities, just wealthy enough to be used to being in charge and able to be self-sufficient – therefore no one had any leverage on them they could use to force them to deal with their addiction. No one but their doctors, of course, who had the leverage of the prescription pad. The standard of care is to assess patients for addictive potential and to limit the use of addictive medications as much as possible. I avoid them almost entirely – except in highly selective cases. But, unfortunately, some patients get savvy at working the system. There is no national database for prescription meds, so patients can evade detection for a time by going to different doctors, using different pharmacies, and going out of state if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually their behavior is picked up and their addiction can be dealt with. But there really is no system to force patients to go in patient, get detox, or to deal with their addiction. So they can simply go entirely underground (get street drugs) or move to another state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this excuses those who were possibly enabling Michael Jackson’s alleged addiction. If this turns out to be the case, investigations are appropriate. But his somewhat extreme situation is not a cautionary tale against the proper use of prescription medications. That is absurd. It is perhaps a cautionary tale about the risks of addiction and the excesses of fame and fortune.  It’s also not the first one – this is a story we have seen before from Elvis Presley to Anna Nicole Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess we will have to get used to the fact that celebrities who live their lives in the public eye will have their deaths be a public spectacle as well. In writing this very blog post I am as guilty of that as anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DNR has been releasing ospreys in the lower peninsula since 1998:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ospreys are listed as a threatened species in the state.  Along with  bald eagles and peregrine falcons, they were hard hit by the liberal use of  pesticides shortly after World War II. Unlike peregrines, Michigan never lost  its entire osprey population; the species managed to persist  in small numbers in the state. Since the ban of DDT and other similar persistent pesticides,  they have  rebounded in the Upper Peninsula and northern Lower Peninsula. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ospreys got a double whammy; in addition to the effects of organochlorines, they are also migratory, and lost habitat along their entire trip–North America, Central America, and South America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned before the important role of an MSU biologist in the &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2008/10/04/dying-to-be-heard/"&gt;collection of evidence of DDT Bioaccumulation&lt;/a&gt;.  (You can actually read an original article by &lt;a href="http://www1.umn.edu/ships/pesticides/library/wallace1963.pdf"&gt;Wallace in Audubon Magazine from 1963&lt;/a&gt; here.)  Michigan is still home to the &lt;a href="http://greatlakeswiki.org/index.php/Pine_River_Superfund_Site"&gt;Pine River Superfund&lt;/a&gt; site–a toxic waste dump of DDT manufacturing leftovers, as well as other industrial waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I’m pretty geeked that there are some signs of recovery, however small.  You can help by reporting sightings in lower Michigan with &lt;a href="http://www.dnr.state.mi.us/wildlife/pubs/osprey_obsreport.asp"&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mullhaupt/"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[Thank you to C. A. Mullhaupt&lt;/a&gt;, who took this lovely photo of a nest in Michigan in 2008.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and since every time I mention DDT a whole host of right-wing people show up to flog their political agenda:  save us all some time, and read these posts first, ‘kay?&lt;/p&gt;

The story is always the same, only the names and details change. The allure of free energy, it seems, is just too great. There will always be someone to get snared in its beguiling charms, or to exploit it to ensnare others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around the name of the company is &lt;a href="http://www.steorn.com/"&gt;Steorn&lt;/a&gt;, an Irish company that announced in 2006 that it had created “a technology that produces free, clean and constant energy.” The typical news cycle ensued. The company touted its innovative technology, with a promised demonstration. The press covered the story with a mixture of wonder and skepticism, depending upon the savvy of their journalists and editors. The free energy community starting buzzing - sure that this time the Great Pumpkin would finally makes its appearance.  The scientific and skeptical community scoffed and used the episode as an opportunity to remind the public of the conservation laws, thermodynamics and all that - you cannot get energy from nothing. Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s one of those few actual laws in science that cannot be violated. It’s just the way nature works. In order to overturn this law something new and fundamental would have to be discovered about the universe, and the burden of proof would be enormous. History is now littered with the stories of those who believed they had found a loop hole in physics (or pretended to) only to crash and burn, or simply fade into obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July of 2007, true to the script of such stories, Steorn promised to demonstrate their “Orbo” free energy technology. However, the demonstration never happened. &lt;a href="http://www.steorn.com/news/releases/?id=1001"&gt;On their website&lt;/a&gt; the next day they explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further to Steorn’s announcement yesterday (5th July) regarding the technical difficulties experienced during the installation of its “Orbo” technology at the Kinentica Museum in London, Steorn has decided to postpone the demonstration until further notice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean McCarthy CEO stated that “technical problems arose during the installation of the demonstration unit in the display case on Wednesday evening. These problems were primarily due to excessive heat from the lighting in the main display area. Attempts to replace those parts affected by the heat led to further failures and as a result we have to postpone the public demonstration until a future date.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the way these stories go - promises followed by excuses, but never the product itself, never the free energy. Free energy claimants can produce experts to verify their claims, schematics of their machines, elaborate explanations for how they work, and copious excuses when they don’t - but never free energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August of 2006 Steorn appointed a jury of 22 scientists and experts to evaluate their technology and their claims. This was an independent group of experts, not invested in the company, and with the expertise to evaluate the Orbo technology to see if it actually works. They recently &lt;a href="http://stjury.ning.com/forum/topics/jury-announcement"&gt;announced their results&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-two independent scientists and engineers were selected by Steorn to form this jury. It has for the past two years examined evidence presented by the company. The unanimous verdict of the Jury is that Steorn’s attempts to demonstrate the claim have not shown the production of energy. The jury is therefore ceasing work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That certainly seems like a thorough evaluation - 22 experts over two years, and they unanimously concluded that the company indeed has not produced free energy.  So far, that is how every single free energy claim has ended - without free energy. The story is more predictable than Murder She Wrote. What is also predictable is that the company and the free energy community will not simply abandon the claims. Now it’s excuse time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments to the jury verdict is filled with skeptics and believers (there does not appear to be any middle ground). One commenter, who runs a free energy news site and is commenting under the nym of 007, wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not sound to me like the jury seen the review process through to it’s conclusion – far from it. If they had followed this process to a full conclusion then the statement would have read “The jury have completed their work”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did they cease work? That’s an interesting choice of words, don’t you think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is always something to nitpick - something to focus on other than the huge giant fact that the jury found no evidence of free energy. The company CEO, Sean McCarthy, &lt;a href="http://www.steorn.com/news/releases/?id=1151"&gt;has this to say&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Due to these difficulties we had focused on providing the Jury with test data relating to the underlying magnetic effect behind Orbo. This work concluded at the end of 2008.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy concluded by stating that “during 2009 the company had resolved the key technical problems related to the implementation of Orbo and is now focused on commercial launch towards the end of this year, at which time academic and engineering validation would be released concurrent with public demonstrations”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah - so the jury had information only up to the end of 2008, and since then the company fixed their technical problems. Got it.  That is what the script says - make an excuse for the lack of evidence, then push back the date for the promised results. Repeat this cycle as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are then several possible endings to choose from. Some free energy claimants just fade away. The final promised date comes and goes, but nary a peep is heard. Others will continue to endure on the fringe, in the free energy subculture, perhaps limping along on whatever investments they can find. Still others, those who I think fit into the conscious fraud category, simply migrate over to new claims to sucker in a new crop of “investors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think Steorn fits into this latter group, so we’ll see how long they can limp along without actually producing anything. As for the true believers, they will bluster and bloviate until this claim is forgotten and the next one comes along. As one &lt;a href="http://stjury.ning.com/forum/topics/jury-announcement?id=2720216%3ATopic%3A484&amp;amp;page=1#comments"&gt;believer commenter wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The science is not so bad - just delayed a bit. If you publish a sarcastic piece on this you may be in for rude awakening end 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Delayed a bit” as in forever.  And, the thing they don’t get, is that the skeptics would love to have the “rude awakening” that someone has solved the world’s energy problems and launched our civilization into the next, and presumably better, phase. They also don’t get that scientists (at least collectively) are not afraid of being wrong - being wrong is an almost constant state of affairs as new information is discovered and ideas change. If someone could demonstrate free energy, any embarrassment over being wrong would be overwhelmed by the excitement of new science - the universe is even more interesting than we thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And - no one could reasonably blame any scientist for being skeptical about an idea that has failed hundreds of times in the past and is at odds with pretty solid science. Skepticism is the appropriate stance to such claims. The key is - if it can be adequately proven, we will accept it, just not before. That’s where the line is between skeptics and believer, the placement of adequate proof before acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

This isn’t one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I’m working with the &lt;em&gt;results&lt;/em&gt; of science, rather than generating it myself, I don’t get to play much with really cool equipment (although I do seem to be getting introduced to lots of new ideas, which is also cool but in a different way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do, through my network of spies, maintain access to at least looking at cool gadgetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/3667938529/" title="chick40h by Pommiebastards, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2593/3667938529_debe1d9d24.jpg" height="376" alt="chick40h" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stage 11 chick embryo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, if you like, a kind of vicarious lab life. The forty hour embryo in the picture above for example: one of my spies is learning how to dissect them. As you might imagine, this is quite a fiddly job, and decent scissors are necessary. It’s just as fiddly when they’re a bit bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/3667939143/" title="chick3days by Pommiebastards, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3417/3667939143_b3fc744db7.jpg" height="376" alt="chick3days" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stage 14 chick embryo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the thing about scissors. The thing about scissors is that, basically, they’re clumsy. It’s difficult to see what you’re cutting for one, especially when you’re looking down a microscope. But enter the &lt;a href="http://obanpi.co.uk/products/bioscissor/"&gt;Lumsden BioScissors&lt;/a&gt;, the coolest kids on the block for micro-dissection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/3667820723/" title="DSC01610 by Pommiebastards, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3409/3667820723_8e0e1c6493.jpg" height="237" alt="DSC01610" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yet another use for pipette tips&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance they look like forceps, but instead of gripping ends they have &lt;em&gt;blades&lt;/em&gt;. You use them just like forceps, in that you squeeze and the very ends come together first, then they slide against each other just like scissors. But from the distal end. Which means you can actually see what you’re cutting: you can place the blades over where you want to cut without guessing and tearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/3668628570/" title="DSC01611 by Pommiebastards, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3340/3668628570_37906795bf.jpg" height="197" alt="DSC01611" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Lumsden BioScissors. Apparently belonging to Clemens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. Cool kit. Cool &lt;em&gt;titanium&lt;/em&gt; kit. Which leads me onto something else:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine was telling me about her experiments last week and said that it was a pain, having to do a certain thing, and that it’d be really neat to have a tool that would do this certain thing. How to do it actually came to me in a flash, right there and then. I haven’t made any sketches yet, but I should, because it’s amazingly simple in concept and lots of &lt;del&gt;people&lt;/del&gt; molecular biologists would buy it. And then, one day, I might actually be able to afford to go to SciFoo.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Richard Grant</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/posts.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/posts.rss</id><title type="html">Confessions of a (former) Lab Rat</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.nature.com/rpg/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246263771073"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=544">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/af3aaf36a65b7f79</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Basic Science"/><category term="Cancer"/><category term="Medical Academia"/><category term="Politics and Regulation"/><title type="html">Cancer research: Going for the bunt versus swinging for the fences</title><published>2009-06-29T08:00:14Z</published><updated>2009-06-29T08:00:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=544" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, our resident skeptical medical student Tim Kreider wrote an &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=522"&gt;excellent article&lt;/a&gt; about an &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/200599"&gt;op-ed in NEWSWEEK&lt;/a&gt; by science correspondent Sharon Begley, in which he pointed out many misconceptions she had regarding basic science versus translational research, journal impact factors, and how journals actually determine what they will publish. Basically, her thesis rested on little more than a few anecdotes by scientists who didn’t get funded or published in journals with as high an impact factor as they thought they deserved, with no data, science, or statistics to tell us whether the scientists featured in her article were in fact representative of the general situation. Begley’s article caught flak from others, including &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2009/06/begler_mistakes_the_symptom_fo.php"&gt;Mike the Mad Biologist&lt;/a&gt; and our very own &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=776"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, as the resident cancer surgeon and researcher, I had thought of weighing in, but other issues interested me more at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I rather regret it, given that this issue crops up time and time again. In essence, it’s a variant of the lament that pops up in the press periodically, when science journalists look at survival rates for various cancers and ask why, after nearly 40 years, we haven’t yet won the war on cancer.  Because of his youth, Tim probably hasn’t seen this issue crop up before, but, trust me, every couple of years or so it does. Begley’s article and the NYT article strike me as simply &lt;em&gt;“Why are we losing the war on cancer?” 2009 edition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the New York Times has given me an excuse both to revisit Begley’s article and discuss yesterday’s front page article in the NYT &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/health/research/28cancer.html"&gt;Grant System Leads Cancer Researchers to Play It Safe&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, they are variants of the same complaints I’ve heard time and time again. Now, don’t get me wrong. By no means am I saying that the current system that the NIH uses to determine which scientists get funded. Those who complain that the system is often too conservative have a point. The problem, all too often, however, is that the proposals for how to fix the problem are usually either never spelled out or rest on dubious assumptions about the nature of cancer research themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sharon Begley’s lament: Those nasty scientists hinder translational research&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Begley produced an article that, quite frankly, annoyed the crap out of me, called &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/200599"&gt;From Bench To Bedside: Academia slows the search for cures&lt;/a&gt;. It never ceases to amaze me how some pundits can take an enormously flawed idea as to why a problem exists and run right off the cliff with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begley begins by pointing out that President Obama has not yet appointed a Director of the NIH. That’s a fair enough criticism. Personally, I’m not happy that there’s no permanent NIH Director yet. I’d like to think, as Begley hopes, that it’s because Obama realizes how important this pick is and wants to get it right. But that’s about all I agree with Begley on. After that introduction, she runs straight off the cliff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIH has its work cut out for it, for the forces within academic medicine that (inadvertently) conspire to impede research aimed at a clinical payoff show little sign of abating. One reason is the profit motive, which is supposed to induce pharma and biotech to invest in the decades-long process of discovering, developing and testing new compounds. It often does. But when a promising discovery has the profit potential of Pets.com, patients can lose out. A stark example is the work of Donald Stein, now at Emory University, who in the 1960s noticed that female rats recovered from head and brain injuries more quickly and completely than male rats. He hypothesized that the pregnancy hormone progesterone might be the reason. But progesterone is not easily patentable. Nature already owns the patent, as it were, so industry took a pass. “Pharma didn’t see a profit potential, so our only hope was to get NIH to fund the large-scale clinical trials,” says Stein. Unfortunately, he had little luck getting NIH support for his work (more on that later) until 2001, when he received $2.2 million for early human research, and in October a large trial testing progesterone on thousands of patients with brain injuries will be launched at 17 medical centers. For those of you keeping score at home, that would be 40 years after Stein made his serendipitous discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I see a story like this, I always wonder exactly why it took so long to move an idea from concept to clinical trial to clinical use. Indeed, recently John Ioannidis (who is most famous for an article a couple of years ago entitled &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=16060722"&gt;Why Most Published Research Findings Are False&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=8"&gt;Steve blogged about&lt;/a&gt; at the time it was first published) published a study that showed that it takes between 14 and 44 years for an idea to make it “&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/the_life_cycle_of_translational_research.php"&gt;from bench to bedside&lt;/a&gt;.” In any case, when in doubt, do a PubMed search to see what the person describing his research has published. So I did just that for Dr. Stein. He has a healthy publication record (162 publications), as well as a number of publications from the late 1960s on brain injury in rodent models. Clearly, Dr. Stein has been a successful and well-funded rsearcher. However, when I searched his name and “progesterone,” I didn’t find a single publication until 2006. So I dug a little deeper, and the first paper I could find by him postulating a sex difference in healing after head injuries was &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3689284?ordinalpos=104&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;published in 1987&lt;/a&gt;. In 1986, he coauthored a review in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; on the pharmacological attenuation of brain injury after trauma, and didn’t once mention progesterone. The point here is not to cast doubt on Dr. Stein’s contention that he first noticed this finding in the 1960s, but rather to point out that it’s hard for me not to wonder whether this particular line of research was a  high priority in his career, because he doesn’t appear to have published on it for 20 years and didn’t really start doing a lot of work on it until the last few years, with a flurry of interesting publications since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other point is, as I have said time and time again, that a scientist can’t just go to human studies (unless, of course, one believes animal rights activists who &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=61"&gt;deny that animal research contributes anything&lt;/a&gt; to medical advancements). There has to be solid preclinical evidence. In other words, there has to be a lot of cell culture, biochemical, and animal work that all support your hypothesis, and it can take a minimum of several years to develop that evidence. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=467"&gt;Medical ethics and the Helsinki Accord demand it&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, the sort of preclinical work that would have been needed to lay the groundwork for clinical trials of progesterone as a neuroprotective agent in trauma is exactly the sort of research that the NIH has funded all these years. One wonders why Dr. Stein, who clearly has a well-funded lab, didn’t divert a bit of that funding earlier to do some pilot experiments to use to pursue NIH funding. Maybe he didn’t have enough extra funds lying around or couldn’t find a way to relate the project to one of his existing projects sufficiently to justify doing so. In any case, at the risk of sounding too harsh, I will say that the whole big pharma thing struck me as very self-serving. Whatever the case was, I strongly suspect that the full story is far more complicated than the “big pharma won’t fund it because it can’t patent it” hyperbole that Begley is laying down (and that sounds very much like the same sorts of excuses purveyors of “natural” therapies use to justify why they don’t do any research to show that their “cures” work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not what irritated me the most about Begley’s article. This is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The desire for academic advancement, perversely, can also impede bench-to-bedside research. “In order to get promoted, a scientist must publish in prestigious journals,” notes Bruce Bloom, president of Partnership for Cures, a philanthropy that supports research. “The incentive is to publish and secure grants instead of to create better treatments and cures.” And what do top journals want? “Fascinating new scientific knowledge, [not] mundane treatment discoveries,” he says. Case in point: in research supported by Partnership for Cures, scientists led by David Teachey of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia discovered that rapamycin, an immune-suppressing drug, can vanquish the symptoms of a rare and sometimes fatal children’s disease called ALPS, which causes the body to attack its own blood cells. When Teachey developed a mouse model to test the treatment, he published it in the top hematology journal, Bloodin 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief aside: Wow. Surgeon that I am, I didn’t know that &lt;em&gt;Blood&lt;/em&gt; was such a top tier journal. The reason I’m amazed is that I published in &lt;em&gt;Blood&lt;/em&gt; last year. If &lt;em&gt;Blood&lt;/em&gt; will take one of my manuscripts, it can’t be that awesome, can it? (Queue false modesty.) Now, back to Begley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the 2009 discovery that rapamycin can cure kids with ALPS? In the 13th-ranked journal. The hard-core science was already known, so top journals weren’t interested in something as trivial as curing kids. “It would be nice if this sort of work were more valued in academia and top journals,” Teachey says. Berish Rubin of Fordham University couldn’t agree more. He discovered a treatment for a rare, often fatal genetic disease, familial dysautonomia. Given the choice of publishing in a top journal, which would have taken months, or in a lesser one immediately, he went with the latter. “Do I regret it?” Rubin asks. “Part of me does, because I’m used to publishing in more highly ranked journals, and it’s hurt me in getting NIH grants. But we had to weigh that against getting the information out and saving children’s lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s boil down Begley’s thesis here. The cool basic science stuff appeared in the top hematology journal, but the first report of the application of that basic science to treat patients appeared in only in the 13th-ranked journal. Obviously journals value basic science over clinical science! Those bastards! They don’t care about curing children! To them curing kids is “trivial.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begley seems blissfully ignorant of two things: How journal rankings work and the fact that different scientific journals fill different niches. Ranking of scientific and medical journals are in general based on something called the “impact factor” (IF). The IF is often used as a proxy for the importance of a journal in its field, with the higher the IF number the better. Although the algorithm that determines the IF is proprietary, it is calculated based on a two-year period and is based on the average number of citations in a year given to papers in a journal published during the two preceding years. In general, higher IF journals are viewed as more desirable to publish in. Thus, what makes the IF a proxy for a journal’s importance is the presumption that more citations of its articles equates to more interesting science and novel findings that more scientists cite. This may or may not be a valid assumption. Finally, one aspect of the IF is that journals designed for a more general readership tend to have higher IFs than subspecialty journals. In other words, &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; have high IFs. Within a field, &lt;em&gt;Cancer Research&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Clinical Cancer Research&lt;/em&gt; has a higher IF than &lt;em&gt;Breast Cancer Treatment and Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s where niches come in. Different journals have different niches. For example, the example mentioned by Begley, &lt;a href="http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/"&gt;Blood&lt;/a&gt;, is not primarily a clinical journal. True, it does publish some clinical trial results, but its main emphasis is clearly on basic and translational research. It’s simply silly to get all worked up because &lt;em&gt;Blood&lt;/em&gt; didn’t publish a small pilot study with six patients and conclude that journals don’t value clinical research. They do, just not journals that are primarily basic and translational science journals. Publishing clinical trials is not their &lt;em&gt;raîson d’être&lt;/em&gt;. However, I think I know why Teachey’s second study was not viewed as being interesting as his first study. A mouse model that provided proof of principle that rapamycin can treat a rare blood condition, complete with scientific mechanism is indeed interesting for a wide range of researchers, basic science, translational, and clinical. A small pilot study tends to be less so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19208097?ordinalpos=4&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;Teachey’s BJH article&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a nice study, but clearly a very preliminary pilot study. Such pilot studies do not generally make it into the top tier journals, no matter how interesting the science is, because, well, they’re so preliminary and small (and thus could be wrong). Begley seems to think that not considering such studies as being top tier is akin to considering curing children of deadly diseases to be “trivial.” She also seems to think that not placing such a study in a top tier journal will fatally delay the application of such cures. However, no treatment is going to be approved on the basis of such a small pilot study; at a minimum, a larger phase II study would still have to be done, and that is the study that would be likely to show up in the higher tier journals, particularly if it was well-designed to include some cool correlative science studies that confirmed the mechanism in humans. In either case, Begley doesn’t make a good case that Teachey’s study’s not being published in &lt;em&gt;Blood&lt;/em&gt; has somehow delayed the fruits of his research from reaching sick children. Much work still needs to be done before Teachey’s discovery becomes common practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begley is closer to the mark (albeit still exaggerating) when she discusses how the importance of IFs can distort how and where scientists decide to publish. In brief, scientists tend to want to publish in the highest impact journals because articles in such journals are viewed as being more meaningful than in lesser journals. Where she goes off the mark is her assumption that it is those horrible basic scientists, with their insistence on knowing molecular mechanisms that keep clinical research in the ghetto of lower tier journals, are somehow &lt;em&gt;keeping teh curez from teh sick babiez!!!!&lt;/em&gt; (Sorry. I’ll try to restrain myself from using &lt;a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com"&gt;LOL Cat&lt;/a&gt;-speak.) For instance, after lionizing  Berish Rubin for having chosen to publish in the lesser journal rather than keep teh curez from teh babiez (oops, I did it again), she castigates an unnamed scientist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all scientists put career second. One researcher recently discovered a genetic mutation common in European Jews. He has enough to publish in a lower-tier journal but is holding out for a top one, which means identifying the physiological pathway by which the mutation leads to disease. Result: at least two more years before genetic counselors know about the mutation and can test would-be parents and fetuses for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is so vague as to be useless. “A genetic mutation common in European Jews”? What mutation? What is the significance of this mutation in carriers? To what disease or defect does it predispose?  Begley doesn’t say. I realize she’s probably doing so in order not to give a huge clue as to who this evil careerist scientist who doesn’t care about patients may be, but without that information I have no idea whether this discovery is so potentially important to patients that delaying its publication until he figures out how this mutation does its dirty work is unconscionable. Clearly Begley seems to think so, but there’s nowhere near enough information in her column for me to hazard even a wild guess. Validating a new genetic mutation as a risk factor to the point of developing a reliable screening test for it is an incredibly difficult task, requiring epidemiology and clinical trials to confirm the basic science. The process of FDA approval for a new genetic test is not trivial. In any case, all we’re left with is a bunch of self-serving anecdotes to support her dislike of basic science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a deeper problem, though, with Begley’s essay. Having both an MD and a PhD and doing translational research myself, I think I have some perspective on this. The problem is that Begley seems to buy into the Magic Bullet model of scientific progress, a.k.a. the “big breakthrough.” While it’s true that big breakthroughs so sometimes occur (think Gleevec, for instance), the vast majority of science and scientific medicine is incremental, each new advance being built upon prior advances. It’s also very frequently full of false starts, dead ends, and research that looks promising at first and then peters out. If a big breakthrough could be conjured by willpower and risky research, we’d have the cure for cancer by now. These disease processes are incredibly complex, and sometimes the research to understand and treat them are even more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s more than that. Begley may have a point when she mentions that clinical researchers are often stymied when their their grants are reviewed by basic scientists, but I can tell you that this goes both ways. If you’re a basic scientist and want to get funded by the NIH, your project had better have a practical application to human disease. Just studying an interesting biochemical reaction or a fascinating gene because it is fascinating science is not enough. If you can’t show how it will result in progress towards a treatment for a disease, it is incredibly unlikely that your grant will be funded by the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discoveries can’t be mandated or dictated, no matter how much Begley seems to think that just changing the emphasis of the NIH to more translational research or funding riskier projects would do it. Again, don’t get me wrong; there’s no doubt that the NIH has often been far too conservative in what grants it funds, and that risk averseness becomes worse the tighter its budget gets and the tighter the paylines it can fund. However, the NIH is also the steward of taxpayer money. Fund too many risky projects, and it is likely that nothing will come of the vast majority of them. As in everything, there needs to be balance. Ideally there should be a portfolio of research that is balanced between the solid, but not radical, science that is likely to reliably lead to incremental progress and riskier projects with a higher potential payoff but a much higher risk of producing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a perfect point to segue to yesterday’s &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/health/research/28cancer.html"&gt;NYT article&lt;/a&gt;, which takes a different perspective on the same old complaint but still manages to fail to avoid many of the same pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The New York Times: Are researchers “playing it too safe”?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NYT article, written by Gina Kolata, comes at the question of how the NIH funds research and what research is done in our academic medical centers from a different viewpoint than Begley. Kolata argues that the system is broken but sees the answer not in the sort of clinical research and comparative effectiveness research beloved by Begley, which in her ideal world would rapidly translate basic science findings into treatments and new tests, but in another mantra that seems to be going around, namely “high impact” research, which, we’re told piously and solemnly, we are not doing nearly enough of because the NIH doesn’t encourage it or fund it. Indeed, whenever I see an article entitled something like Grant System Leads Cancer Researchers to Play It Safe, I know exactly how it’s going to start, and this article &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/health/research/28cancer.html"&gt;follows the playbook almost exactly&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the recent research grants awarded by the National Cancer Institute is one for a study asking whether people who are especially responsive to good-tasting food have the most difficulty staying on a diet. Another study will assess a Web-based program that encourages families to choose more healthful foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other grants involve biological research unlikely to break new ground. For example, one project asks whether a laboratory discovery involving colon cancer also applies to breast cancer. But even if it does apply, there is no treatment yet that exploits it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cancer institute has spent $105 billion since President Richard M. Nixon declared war on the disease in 1971. The American Cancer Society, the largest private financer of cancer research, has spent about $3.4 billion on research grants since 1946.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the fight against cancer is going slower than most had hoped, with only small changes in the death rate in the almost 40 years since it began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I’m not saying that it’s ridiculous to question why all that money and all these breakthroughs have not made a greater impact on cancer mortality than they have. On the other hand, there is a false premise in the whole question. Specifically, there is an unspoken assumption that “riskier” research is inherently more likely to result in “breakthroughs” than the more incremental model of building on previous results. The expectation is that all of that money should have produced “blockbusters” that make huge dents in cancer mortality. Unfortunately, science and biology are hard. They conspire to frustrate even the most ambitious wishes for cures, whether they come from scientists, politicians, or journalists reworking a tired old script yet another time. It also disturbs me to see the clearly derogatory tone directed at the study of diet and health, which, quite frankly, seems at odds with the argument that the NIH doesn’t spend enough on research into diet, exercise, and prevention, which by its very nature tends to consist of studies of this sort which are highly unlikely to produce anything other than incremental results leading to incremental improvements to our knowledge of how to use diet as a tool to prevent disease. Quite frankly, research of this nature isn’t viewed as being as “sexy” as the sort of research Kolata thinks we should be doing more of. After all, it doesn’t involve new genes, new proteins, or novel science, but rather deals with the application of what we have known for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get to the crux of the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These grants are not silly, but they are only likely to produce incremental progress,” said Dr. Robert C. Young, chancellor at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia and chairman of the Board of Scientific Advisors, an independent group that makes recommendations to the cancer institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, note the contempt for such projects. “These grants are not silly”? Talk about damning with faint praise! But I digress. Let’s get back on track:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The institute’s reviewers choose such projects because, with too little money to finance most proposals, they are timid about taking chances on ones that might not succeed. The problem, Dr. Young and others say, is that projects that could make a major difference in cancer prevention and treatment are all too often crowded out because they are too uncertain. In fact, it has become lore among cancer researchers that some game-changing discoveries involved projects deemed too unlikely to succeed and were therefore denied federal grants, forcing researchers to struggle mightily to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we go again. Everything old is new again. This is the very same complaint that pops up periodically. Again, I’m not saying that it doesn’t have merit, only that it tends to be made in the absence of any hard evidence that (1) innovative ideas don’t eventually get funded and (2) that funding “riskier” ideas will inevitably lead to more home runs (more on this later). Also, very conveniently, this sort of complaint always seems to pop up the most in lean times. Indeed, I remember back when I was a graduate student in the early 1990s (when Tim was in grade school). That is the last time the funding situation got as bad as it has been at the NIH for the last few years, and I remember reading articles very similar to this one. Inevitably, tight fiscal times appear to lead to a sort of funding conservatism for exactly the reason above: The NIH doesn’t want to risk precious grant funds on projects that are too risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As evidence of this problem, does Kolata dig into the grants system and try to put together data showing that conservative funding policies are leading to the shutting out of game-changing research? What do you think? Of course not! Instead she relies, just as Begley did, on anecdotes from scientists who produced great work but were not funded initially. First up in the anecdote parade is Dennis Slamon. Personally, I admire Dr. Slamon’s work greatly. Through science and determination, he truly did change breast cancer therapy, and for the better. Specifically, he is the person who developed &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab"&gt;trastuzumab&lt;/a&gt; (trade name: Herceptin); i.e., a humanized monoclonal antibody against the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"&gt;HER-2/neu&lt;/a&gt; oncoprotein, which was &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6095109?dopt=Abstract"&gt;discovered by Robert Weinberg’s group in 1984&lt;/a&gt;. HER-2 in general portends poorer prognosis and is generally a marker for more aggressive cancers with lower survival rates with conventional therapy. The reason is that HER-2 encodes a cell surface receptor that is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. When it is amplified, as it is in &lt;a href="http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/4/320??&amp;amp;dcbflag=1"&gt;approximately 22% of human breast cancers&lt;/a&gt;, its activity can result in &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17471238?dopt=Abstract"&gt;increased cell proliferation, cell motility, tumor invasiveness, a higher likelihood of regional and distant metastases, accelerated angiogenesis, and reduced apoptosis&lt;/a&gt;. All of these are bad things. Consistent with this biological effect, HER-2 amplification, the presence of HER-2 amplification correlates with nastier appearing tumors on histology, decreased disease-free survival, increased metastasis, and decreased overall survival. Indeed, for overall survival and disease-free survival, the relative risk of death for women with HER-2-positive cancer versus HER-2-negative cancer is in the &lt;a href="http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/content/full/14/4/320#B1"&gt;1.8 to 2.7 range&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, women with HER-2-positive breast cancer are more than two times more likely to recur and die of their disaease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also true that the addition of Herceptin, which blocks the HER-2 receptor, to standard chemotherapy of HER-2-containing cancers improves the prognosis in women with such cancers, although Kolata overstates how much it does so. For all its usefulness, Herceptin is not a magic bullet; it is not a cure. Indeed, the original &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/344/11/783?ijkey=fdf0ff1ca51a3b2bfaef290b28f62ccc7eed2688&amp;amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha"&gt;phase III trial reported in the New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 found that in patients with HER-2-postive metastatic breast cancer, the addition of trastuzumab to conventional chemotherapy resulted in a longer time to disease progression  (median, 7.4 versus 4.6 months; p &amp;lt; .001), a higher response rate (50% versus 32%; p &amp;lt; .001), a longer duration of response (median, 9.1 versus 6.1 months; p &amp;lt; .001), and an increase in median survival from 20.3 months to 25.1 months (p=0.008). Consistent with this, the addition of Herceptin resulted in a 20% lower risk for death. These are all very good things, but not a cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kolata’s article, Slamon complains that he had difficulty getting the NIH to fund his studies and that it took a grant from Revlon for him to continue his research. His story is a bit too convenient, as a perusal of the Internet using my mad Google skillz found that the story is a bit more complex than what Kolata tells. Indeed, a made-for-TV movie about Slamon and Herceptin aired on Lifetime in 2008 called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Proof_(film)"&gt;Living Proof&lt;/a&gt;, which was based on a book by Robert Bazell called &lt;a href="http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/91/15/1329"&gt;HER-2: The Making of Herceptin, A Revolutionary Treatment for Breast Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, tells a more complex story than just the NIH’s not funding his research. For example, this &lt;a href="http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/91/15/1329"&gt;passage from a review of Bazell’s book&lt;/a&gt; is illuminating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, another stroke of dumb luck occurred in 1986. Ullrich accidentally met Dennis Slamon in a Denver airport. Slamon, a practicing oncologist at UCLA’s Jonsson Cancer Center, is a dogged and devoted cancer researcher. Throughout the next 2 years, Slamon and Ullrich pursued the hypothesis that HER-2 neu played a role in the growth of breast and ovarian cancers. By 1987, they published their results, which suggested that cancers overexpressing HER-2 are more likely to recur and spread more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But could their work be reproduced and their conclusion be confirmed? More delays ensued as their colleagues failed to reproduce their experiment. These delays were dumb bad luck. Two long years later, Slamon and Ullrich proved that the failure to reproduce their work was due to the “use of contaminated chemicals, faulty techniques, and idiotic mistakes by the laboratories conducting the experiments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1988, Slamon and Ullrich looked to Genentech for support to take their promising experiment to the next level of development. Support was not forthcoming. Genentech was no longer focused on cancer drug development. Their oncology staff had been disbanded following the unsuccessful interferon-alfa trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herceptin’s development languished until more dumb luck occurred. In late 1989, the mother of a senior Genentech vice president was diagnosed with breast cancer. “Just like that, one man flipped the switch on HER-2″ and convinced his colleagues that HER-2 was worth Genentech’s investment. Again, and not for the last time, an unexpected player would rescue Herceptin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just sloppy reporting not mention this background and simply buy into the image of the “brave maverick doctor” whose work wasn’t appreciated by the NIH. Why did the NIH decide not to fund Slamon’s work? Without seeing the pink sheets (the summary statement that all applicants for a grant receive containing reviewers’ evaluations of the grant appplication), it’s impossible to know for sure. In the absence of having read Bazell’s book, however, I can still speculate a bit, at the risk of looking foolish. If, for example, Slamon and Ullrich (the latter of which was a Genentech scientist) had submitted their HER-2 grants around the time other researchers were having difficulty duplicating their results, the reviewers at the NIH study section responsible for reviewing Slamon’s grants would almost certainly have known about it. Moreover, if a pharmaceutical company had been developing Herceptin, it is possible that reviewers would have been less enthusiastic about it, wondering quite reasonably why the NIH should fund the development of this drug if Genentech would no longer do so. As much as I love a story of a scientific maverick overcoming the hidebound system (why else would Judah Folkman be one of my scientific heroes?), I’m not sure that Slamon’s case represents as pure an example of such a scientist as this article would have you believe. (Maybe I should get a copy of Bazell’s book and read it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also rather odd that Kolata would focus on Slamon first. It is true that Herceptin represents the first successful example of a molecularly targeted therapy for breast cancer. (Well, not quite. One could equally well argue that the anti-estrogen drug Tamoxifen, which blocks the proliferative effect of estrogen due to its binding with its receptor, were the first.) However, only 20% of women with breast cancer can be expected to benefit from it, and it is an incredibly expensive drug, and it is not without its toxicities, the worst of which is toxicity to the heart, which precludes its use in many women with heart disease. In any event, the high cost of Herceptin (several thousand dollars a month, with the usual duration of treatment for breast cancer being one year). Indeed, when research suggested a benefit for extending the use of Herceptin for adjuvant therapy against early stage tumors, in contrast to its initial uses in more advanced tumors, some European governments &lt;a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/34346.php"&gt;balked at the cost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two more anecdotes follow, which are more interesting but less convincing, namely because we don’t have the benefit of history to tell us that the investigator was definitely on to something, as we do with Dennis Slamon. Because one of the researchers whose anecdote is told didn’t even bother to try to apply to the NIH for funding because he figured it wouldn’t be fundable. Whether he’s right or wrong, who can tell? Instead, I’ll concentrate on the other anecdote, that of Eileen K. Jaffe of Fox Chase Cancer Center:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dr. Jaffe stumbled upon results that went against textbook explanations, suggesting that it might be possible to find an entirely new class of drugs that could disable proteins that fuel cancer cells. Now she wants to find chemicals that might be developed into such drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But her grant proposal was rejected out of hand by the institutes of health, not even discussed by a review panel. She had no preliminary data showing that the idea was likely to work, something reviewers always want to see, and the idea was just too unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is not the least bit unreasonable, if indeed her idea was that novel. Indeed, even Dr. Jaffe acknowledges this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jaffe is just conceiving her project; it is much to soon to know whether it will result in a revolutionary drug. And even if she does find potential new drugs, it is not clear that they will be effective. Most new ideas are difficult to prove, and most potential new drugs fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Dr. Jaffe was not entirely surprised when her grant application to look for such cancer drugs was summarily rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They said I don’t have preliminary results,” she said. “Of course I don’t. I need the grant money to get them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, that’s not quite true. It is, for example, close to true for the gold standard of NIH grants, the R01. These grants generally provide around $150,000 to $250,000 a year for three to five years to fund a project, and it is usually about these grants that most of the complaints are made. That’s because reviewers do tend to be pretty conservative about such grants. The reason is that these grants provide a lot of money for a lot of years and can be renewed at the end of each grant through a process known as competitive renewal, in which the investigator reports on the progress made in the previous grant period and proposes where he wants to go over the next five years. In other words, an R01 is a huge commitment, and, again not unreasonably, reviewers want to see a lot of preliminary data to suggest that the project is feasible and likely to produce results that improve our understanding of a disease and lead to strategies for therapy. It’s exactly the sort of grant mechanism designed to look at a question like this one described in the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study asking whether a molecular pathway that spurs the growth of colon cancer cells also encourages the growth of breast cancer cells, the principal investigator ultimately wants to find a safe drug to prevent breast cancer. She received a typical-size grant of a little more than $1 million for the five-year study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan, said the investigator, Louise R. Howe, an associate research professor at Weill Cornell Medical College, is first to confirm her hypothesis about the pathway in breast cancer cells. But even if it is correct, the much harder research would lie ahead because no drugs exist to block the pathway, and even if they did, there are no assurances that they would be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually agree to some extent with Kolata’s thesis, namely that much of the grant funding at the NIH is too conservative and that the NIH should find a way to fund more innovative and “risky” grants. Indeed, I tend to approve of various initiatives to fund innovative research, such as “pioneer awards,” which are designed to fund research examining “ideas that have the potential for high impact but may be too novel, span too diverse a range of disciplines or be at a stage too early to fare well in the traditional peer review process,” and the so-called “transformative R01 grants” for “proposing exceptionally innovative, high risk, original and/or unconventional research with the potential to create or overturn fundamental paradigms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One difference between me and those calling for reform of the NIH grant process is that I openly admit that I don’t have any data to support my bias that the current system is too conservative and that a way needs to be found to fund more innovative (or at least different) research. What bothers me is that neither Begley, Kolata, nor any of the scientists interviewed by both of them seem able to present any hard data or science to support their bias either. They &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; that funding more risky projects will result in better payoffs than sticking with the slow march of incremental science. They have anecdotes of scientists whose ideas were later found to be validated and potentially game-changing who couldn’t get NIH funding, but how often does this really happen? The vast majority of “wild” ideas are considered “wild” precisely because they are new and there is no good support for them. Once evidence accumulates for them, they are no longer considered quite so “wild.” More importantly, we are looking through what we doctors like to call the “retrospectoscope,” which, as we say, always provides 20-20 vision. We know today that the scientists whose anecdotes of woe describing the depradations of the NIH were indeed onto something. How many more proposed ideas that seemed innovative at the time but ultimately went nowhere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also don’t know exactly how the NIH would choose between so many “risky” projects. &lt;a href="http://hardsci.wordpress.com/2009/06/28/improving-the-grant-system-aint-so-easy/"&gt;Sanjay Srivastava&lt;/a&gt;, writing about the NYT article, asks an excellent question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practical problem is that we would have to find some way to choose among high-risk studies. The problem everybody is pointing to is that in the current system, scientists have to present preliminary studies, stick to incremental variations on well-established paradigms, reassure grant panels that their proposal is going to pay off, etc. Suppose we move away from that… how would you choose amongst all the riskier proposals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People like to point to historical breakthroughs that never would have been funded by a play-it-safe NCI. But it may be a mistake to believe those studies would have been funded by a take-a-risk NCI, because we have the benefit of hindsight and a great deal of forgetting. Before the research was carried out — i.e., at the time it would have been a grant proposal — every one of those would-be-breakthrough proposals would have looked just as promising as a dozen of their contemporaries that turned out to be dead-ends and are now lost to history. So it’s not at all clear that all of those breakthroughs would have been funded within a system that took bigger risks, because they would have been competing against an even larger pool of equally (un)promising high-risk ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, a lot of the current crop of criticisms of the way the NIH selects grants of the sort put forth by the NYT rest on a large measure of selective memory and confirmation bias. Science that is successful is remembered; proposals that go nowhere are lost to the mists of time. Scientists whose work was later validated after the NIH didn’t fund it are remembered and make good press copy. The many more scientists whose work wasn’t funded and went nowhere aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it’s easy to make grand claims that all that nasty preliminary data isn’t necessary, that we should fund “plausible” studies that sound promising. However, it is the preliminary data supporting them that turn studies from speculative to plausible. Without that data, the possibilities are virtually endless, with little to distinguish truly plausible proposals from interesting but implausible ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, given that the conservatism of the NIH grant process always tends to be more of a complaint when funding is tight, I could envision a way of testing the hypothesis that funding more “risky” research results in more breakthroughs. It would be imperfect, but it might provide enough evidence to justify further exploration of this idea. Specifically, I’m referring to the period from fiscal year 1998 to 2003, during which the NIH budget, thanks to bipartisan support, doubled. The NIH could look at funding data from that period and ask some questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Were more “risky” grants funded?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What was the result of those grants?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Were “riskier” grants more or less likely to result in new treatments that impacted the survival of cancer patients?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that it would be difficult to come up with measurements to answer such questions that would be truly objective, but even imperfect data on this score would be better than what we have now, which is in essence no data. Or, at least if there is such data, I couldn’t find it. Perhaps that’s because the assumption that more “innovative” research must be needed because we haven’t impacted cancer survival rates as much as we think we should have during the last 37 years, which means we need more innovative research. Circular reasoning at its finest, at least without some hard data. Given that what happened in response to the doubling of the NIH budget was in essence a spending spree that attracted more applications than ever to the NIH and spurred more building of research facilities by universities, I rather suspect that such a study would not show what proponents of altering how the NIH decides what research to fund would want it to show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The symptom or the disease?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogger Mike the Mad Biologist has asked on two occasions, first in r&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2009/06/begler_mistakes_the_symptom_fo.php"&gt;esponse to the NEWSWEEK article&lt;/a&gt; and then in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2009/06/oh_this_will_be_fun_kolata_on.php"&gt;response to this NYT article&lt;/a&gt;: Are these critics mistaking the symptom for the disease? As Mike points out, the problem goes beyond funding levels. Rather, it is incentives. It is where the money goes and what is funded. On that score, the NIH is profoundly schizophrenic these days. The sorts of promising high risk proposals do not in general come from large, multi-institutional, collaborative groups. There are too many interests, and such groups tend to have too much at stake to take many risks. The very sort of researcher who will propose the risky projects that all these reformers is the small, independent researcher funded by an R01. Yet, what has the NIH been shifting its funds to lately??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big science. Large projects. Walter Boron put it well in a &lt;a href="http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/21/5/300"&gt;commentary in &lt;em&gt;Physiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; three years ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is still one more piece to the pay-line puzzle: the allocation of NIH dollars, sometimes mandated by Congress, and often following the advice of committees of independent investigators. The fraction of the NIH budget devoted to research by independent investigators (Table 1) steadily fell from 1998 to 2003. Conversely, spending for other programs including “big science”—the sequencing of genomes, clinical trials, and other costly and lengthy projects—steadily rose. Where does one draw the line between shifting funds to big science and yet maintaining a healthy portfolio of independent-investigator research? When the NIH is afloat in money (e.g., pay lines 25th percentile for research by independent investigators), such a shift may make sense. An example is the sequencing of the human genome, which has been invaluable. But what about sequencing the squid genome, which I personally would love to see? Before addressing this question, let us examine the value of investigator-initiated research and the dangers of interrupting it for even a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific engine that drives translational research—and that drives big science as well—is the independent investigator. It is the independent investigator who trains the next generation of researchers. Moreover, discoveries almost always come about when bright independent investigators stumble over unexpected findings and then sort them out. Such stumbling is unpredictable. The bigger the discovery, the more unpredictable. As unnerving as it may seem, the best way to invest in discovery is to fund the best independent investigators and turn them loose to stumble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Dr. Boron doesn’t really have any data to support his thesis, either, but he does illustrate the conflict between “big science” and the innovation that NIH reformers are pushing for. Also, if anecdotal evidence counts, then let me place my own personal anecdote on the table. One of the two projects I’m working on now came about from a completely serendipitous discovery on the part of my collaborator, who pursued a completely unexpected observation. Based on that discovery, the NIH has funded two R01s, and the ASCO Foundation has funded me. Based on my anecdote, the NIH must fund risky and innovative research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, two can play at the anecdote game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All snarkiness aside, though. One problem is that the public has a rather distorted view of how science works. Science generally does result in incremental progress. Sometimes, there are even periods of stagnation, during which, or so it seems, very little is discovered and few advances made. Breakthroughs, such as the discovery of HER-2 are much less common than the gradual accumulation of knowledge and understanding that builds on what has been done before. Indeed, even a breakthrough like HER-2 was built on what came before, as Dennis Slamon’s work could not have occurred were it not for Robert Weinberg, who discovered HER-2 in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the issue is better put by &lt;a href="http://www.med.upenn.edu/camb/faculty/cgc/eldeiry.html"&gt;Wafik el-Deiry&lt;/a&gt;, the physician-scientist who discovered p21&lt;sup&gt;WAF1/CIP1&lt;/sup&gt; a very important cell cycle regulator whose expression p53 activates. What I consider to be cool about Dr. el-Deiry is that &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/weldeiry"&gt;he’s on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, where he &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/weldeiry/status/2369599970"&gt;Tweeted&lt;/a&gt; in response to the NYT article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major advances in cancer research have come from basic research without expectations of immediate impact on patients’ lives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And followed up with &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/weldeiry/status/2372600867"&gt;this Tweet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I worry about change that may set us back by putting less value on basic science &amp;amp; more on hi risk pie in the sky&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree and share Dr. el-Deiry’s concern. Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, HER-2, intracellular signaling molecules, all of these and more were discovered by basic scientists working because they simply wanted to know how cells work and what goes wrong to turn them cancerous. What I worry about is that, in the rush to fund more “innovative” and “translational” research, basic science will be left out. Why this worries me is that, without basic science, there can be no translational science. Translational research depends upon a constant flow of new observations and new discoveries in basic science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, it can’t be predicted &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; those new discoveries will come from. Sometimes they come right out of left field, like the aforementioned project I’m working on now, which resulted from a serendipitous discovery by my collaborator and has the potential to result in a great new treatment for not just breast cancer but melanoma as well. It was not the sort of discovery that could have been foretold, and it may never have been noticed if it hadn’t been for a basic scientist following curiosity where it led. In any case, those who advocate for funding more “risky” research must have a lot of faith in current scientists who serve on NIH study sections to identify what proposals are truly innovative. I’m not sure I share that faith. In fact, I’m sure that I don’t. At the risk of belaboring the point, I will repeat that many breakthroughs could not have been identified in a research proposal beforehand. Moreover, it can’t be emphasized enough that translational research depends upon a steady stream of interesting science from the laboratories of basic scientists. Dry up that stream, and translational research will slow to a crawl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why, going back to the baseball-inspired title of this post, I would argue that no radical overhaul of how the NIH distributes grants is necessary. Rather, the portfolio of research funded by the NIH needs to be better balanced than it is now. Just like a good hitting lineup, the NIH research portfolio needs the right mix of “hitters,” including the high average hitters who tend to hit nearly all base hits (”safer science” proposals); the clever utility hitters, who make things happen by putting the ball in play a lot by various methods, such as bunting, little bloopers, line drives (the more eclectic proposals who can span multiple disciplines); and the sluggers who can hit the ball out of the park but tend to strike out a lot (high risk, high payoff proposals). Finding the right mix is difficult, and there will naturally be disagreement over what the “sweet spot” is. Indeed, what constitutes that “sweet spot” could very well change over time. Right now, it’s probably true that the NIH has a lineup that’s too full of bunters and base hit hitters, although we shouldn’t forget that a lineup full of such hitters can still score a lot of runs. It’s just that a slugger or two who can hit the occasional grand slam can result in even more runs, if placed in the correct place in the lineup. The risk is that the NIH has to be careful not to end up with a lineup of home run hitters who strike out a lot without getting anyone on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fear that’s what we’ll end up with, though. I also have to wonder whether, if critics got their way and the NIH were to put a lot more money into funding “high risk studies,” there would be so many failures that the press would suddenly start saying, as Sanjay put it, “&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2009/06/oh_this_will_be_fun_kolata_on.php#comment-1742308"&gt;Grant System Funds Too Many Dead Ends&lt;/a&gt;.” And, no doubt, Sharon Begley would still be be complaining about the NIH not funding enough clinical research and that it’s still devaluing clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADDENDUM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent discussion of the NYT article can be found &lt;a href="http://dimer.tamu.edu/simplog/archive.php?blogid=3&amp;amp;pid=6771"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (and is well worth reading in its entirety). In it, Jim Hu did something I should have done, namely check the CRISP database in addition to PubMed. A couple of key points follow about the examples cited in the NYT article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding Dennis Slamon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate to criticize Dennis Slamon, because the HER2 to Herceptin story is a great one. But the image one gets of his research program being saved by a friend from Revlon while the NCI ignored him isn’t consistent with what you get when you search for his grants in the CRISP database. Slamon got an NCI grant in 1984 to work on “oncogenes in physiologic and pathologic states”. Two NCI grants are cited in the 1987 Science paper showing HER-2 amplification in breast cancer (one was probably for the collaborator’s lab), and he’s been pretty continuously funded by NCI since then. So I’d love to know what this story applies to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me too. Regarding Ellen Jaffe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eileen Jaffe has studied the enzymology of porphobilinogen synthase under a 20-year multiply renewed grant from the National Institutes for Environmental and Health Sciences. Recently, she’s been working on an idea called morpheeins, which she’s patented as the basis for drug discovery. I have no idea what was in the grant, but what I see doesn’t scream “missed opportunity to cure cancer” at me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which was my thought, too, looking at her publication record. Finally, regarding Louise R. Howe’s studies on signaling and cancer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan, said the investigator, Louise R. Howe, an associate research professor at Weill Cornell Medical College, is first to confirm her hypothesis about the pathway in breast cancer cells. But even if it is correct, the much harder research would lie ahead because no drugs exist to block the pathway, and even if they did, there are no assurances that they would be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what Kolata has against Dr. Howe’s project. The same could have been said about HER2 in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or about any number of oncogenes and targeted therapies. Yikes! The same could be said about what I’m working on. Oh, no, that must mean I’m not sufficiently innovative for Kolata’s taste…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priest claimed to be tee-total, except for the fact that he had celebrated four masses that day and obviously there's wine in that. Whether there's the amount of wine necessary to put you over the limit (or on the U.K. limit) isn't necessarily the point. Having drunk the wine in some sort of cannibalistic cult ritual rather than in a bar with friends doesn't make you any less dangerous on the motorway.

While feeling saddened by the passing of two pop icons who were media fixtures throughout my childhood (and of that of many of us), the inevitable focus on them has led me to reflect how little our little household follows trends and "the latest," and how Charlie himself has less than little interest in the "latest." Charlie seems certain about what he likes, and what not, and lets us know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all apologies to those who follow/like various teeny bopper types, it's been ok for Jim and me as parents that Charlie has no idea who Hannah Montana or the Jonas Brothers is (not that I do, either). Maybe some think it's sad that Charlie's not sharing in the cultural icons of his generation, but (the secret is revealed) I had zero interest in most celebrities when I was his age, preferring my own interests (which, for a time, meant Bach). There's a part about parenting a child who's different, a child with disabilities, that is, if I can may it, freeing because &lt;i&gt;we don't have to be typical parents&lt;/i&gt;. We can be more of who we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, again and again in life with Charlie, it's been necessary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) for Jim and me to learn to think outside the proverbial box (regarding employment and services for adults, as a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/when_everything_isnt_shiny_anymore"&gt;friend reminded me in a recent comment&lt;/a&gt;). I think of all the times we've heard "can't do that" or "it's not possible" or "that program does not exist" or "he's never going to do that." Life raising a child who's got some pretty big needs means, we hear a lot of such statements. We try, want, and need to be positive and upbeat and in "we can do it!" mode most of the time, but sometimes it seems that you exhaust every option and there's no energy left, barely even enough to hope.&lt;/p&gt;
It's been equally necessary &lt;p&gt;(2) to be in sync with Charlie who walks his own path away from most every trend and gossipy concern. I cannot measure it, but a constant piece of our lives is trying (not always getting it right, but still trying) to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/art_speaks"&gt;understand his communication on his own terms&lt;/a&gt;. One hears regularly about how autistic individuals "lack empathy" and are unable to put themselves into another person's shoes, but are those of us who aren't on the spectrum any better able to do that? How hard have you, we, tried to see things from the perspective of someone on the spectrum?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday we did something not terribly extraordinary, but certainly out of the ordinary. A friend of Jim's is directing &lt;a href="http://www.peopleslight.org/season/show.php?id=6"&gt;Doubt&lt;/a&gt; by John Patrick Shanley at a &lt;a href="http://www.peopleslight.org/"&gt;theater outside Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; and we thought we'd try to see it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A good friend who lives in Philadelphia joined us. Jim got three tickets and thought we'd try, somehow, to each see part of the show with our friend (we've actually seen the play performed in New York years ago). This was something of an ambitious plan, as it meant that Charlie was going to have to in essence wait the time out, getting a late lunch, hanging in the car and parking lot and walking around (on the very pleasant grounds of the theatre, but it was a pretty hot day). Charlie got through it all (though he didn't want to eat in an unfamiliar Friendly's and he mostly sat in the car, while we talked (too long; other friends appeared; he became agitated). Charlie was glad to head back to Jersey, wanted a bike ride after being home for five minutes, and got very upset before going to bed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was very tough, as things have been quite well and peaceful with Charlie for the past couple of weeks, even with &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/summertime"&gt;vacation from school&lt;/a&gt;. We knew we had diverged quite a bit from the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_same_old_same_old"&gt;same old same old&lt;/a&gt; last week, with Saturday's trip being the second to a brand new place (after going to Grantville and Hershey PA) and doing some unusual, first-time things. Had we sought to "stretch" Charlie too much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where the doubt comes in: We try so hard to see things with Charlie as they are and to state them honestly; we try to think of how things might effect him, and of what accommodations we might make. But I don't think we can ever be 100+ % certain. Belief can feel assured, and yet be imperfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, with that doubt in mind, we did our best to be extremely attuned to Charlie and the ebbs and flows of his moods, the impact of any noise, slight or loud, on his easily-jarred system. (A pair of noise-canceling headphones such as you wear to mow the lawn seemed to help.) We made another long car ride but this time to a very familiar place, the beach, and Charlie (and Jim and I) were as glad as ever to be there, and to be back in the waves in the one place where (so far) Charlie always seems glad to be, the ocean, vast and always changing, and always the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Charlie always be at home there? This is something I hope we---but who can be sure?---never have to doubt.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246262147850"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/06/29/flying-spaghetti-monster-blesses-seattle-gay-pride/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a1d0605334854f86</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Sex"/><category term="atheism"/><category term="Flying Spaghetti Monster"/><category term="Gay Pride Parade"/><category term="Seattle"/><title type="html">Flying Spaghetti Monster blesses Seattle Gay Pride</title><published>2009-06-29T07:41:46Z</published><updated>2009-06-29T07:41:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/06/29/flying-spaghetti-monster-blesses-seattle-gay-pride/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/06/29/flying-spaghetti-monster-blesses-seattle-gay-pride/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/uBl6oIpYOFs/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The premise of the show is that every week a group of different group of atheists will be brought before religious leaders of the various major religions as those religious leaders try to convert them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I’m serious. That’s actually the premise of the show. At first when I heard about it, I was appalled. But in retrospect, I think I might kinda like it. Not only does it bring the religious debate into people’s living rooms but I surmise that it will implicitly also bring an atheist perspective into people’s living rooms. I only wish there were an American version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it’s very possible that the atheists chosen to appear on the show won’t be very well informed atheists and will be highly susceptible to convertion. In which case, this could give atheists even more bad press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the $64 million question is, will the atheists be converted or will they bring about the apostacy of others in the process…or more likely, will nobody change their views?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, religion will likely continue to bare remarkable resemblance to the Wheel of Morality:&lt;/p&gt;

They're still out there, in fact an interesting &lt;a title="new one that depicts Pi" href="http://a11news.com/222/crop-circle-depicts-pi/"&gt;new one that depicts Pi&lt;/a&gt; was recently discovered.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;They may have done so prematurely. You see, there is new evidence that a non-human lifeform is responsible for at least some crop circles appearing recently in Tasmania, and it's not what you think.</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246258419484"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3660">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/30629c656ca637f2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Intelligent Design/Creationism"/><category term="Charles Darwin"/><category term="Creation Ministries International"/><category term="Creation Museum"/><category term="Expelled"/><category term="Voyage That Shook the World"/><title type="html">Expelled 2: Electric Boogaloo</title><published>2009-06-29T06:47:05Z</published><updated>2009-06-29T06:47:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/06/28/expelled-2-electric-boogaloo/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="creationists" src="http://skepacabra.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/creationists.jpg?w=224&amp;amp;h=171" alt="creationists" width="224" height="171"&gt;Apparently, Expelled wasn’t bad enough. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/expelled_redux.php"&gt;Creationists are putting out yet another pseudo-documentary about evolution, &lt;em&gt;The Voyage That Shook the World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But this time it looks like they’re being subtler. Althought the trailer for the film comments Darwin’s ideas &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; being controversial, there’s not much there that would give one the impression that the film was anti-evolution. However, with very little effort, you can find out that the film was produced by &lt;a href="http://creation.com/"&gt;Creation Ministries International&lt;/a&gt;. And according to PZ Myers, they’re also using the same old tricks employed in &lt;em&gt;Expelled&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They got several Darwin experts (Peter Bowler, Sandra Herbert, and Janet Browne) to appear in the “documentary” by &lt;a href="http://jmlynch.wordpress.com/2009/06/21/creationists-lie-to-historians-and-deny-subterfuge/"&gt;concealing their motives&lt;/a&gt;. And then they admit to &lt;a href="http://jmlynch.wordpress.com/2009/06/27/more-on-creationists-lying-to-historians/"&gt;cherry-picking the interviews to put together their story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is of course one of the many reasons why no one should take creationists seriously. THEY LIE. They lie whenever it is convenient to manipulate the audience. And they’ll even admit to deceptions while at the same time downplay the seriousness of their being dishonest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in related news, &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/06/28/actual-scientists-visit-the-creation-museum/"&gt;six dozen paleontologists visited the Creation “Museum” recently&lt;/a&gt;. Their reaction was not surprising:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like a theme park, but the problem is it masquerades as truth,” said Derek Briggs, a Yale University paleontologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critique of scientists even extends to the gift shop, where among the DVDs for sale is one entitled, “The Cure for a Culture in Crisis: It doesn’t take a Ph.D.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all had Wednesday’s visitors shaking their heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Faith is one thing,” said Mark Terry, a high school science teacher from Seattle, “but when it comes to their science statements, they’re completely off the wall.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Science works slowly, even though we wish it would work in nanosecond breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1764970"&gt;In 1913&lt;/a&gt;, for example, a Russian scientist named Nikolai Anichkov ran an experiment in which he had egg yolks fed to rabbits. On this cholesterol-heavy diet the rabbits developed atherosclerosis. The more cholesterol the rabbits ate, the bigger the deposits on their blood vessels became. It was a tremendous discovery, considered &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=k4O1H3JdwyMC&amp;amp;lpg=PP1&amp;amp;dq=medicine&amp;#39;s%2010%20greatest%20discoveries&amp;amp;pg=PA155"&gt;by some&lt;/a&gt; one of the greatest in medical history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it did not lead overnight to a treatment for heart disease. In fact, it did not even lead, on its own, to a clear understanding of how cholesterol ends up in the blood vessels. Instead, it focused the attention of later scientists on the question of cholesterol. It took many years for scientists to figure out the steps by which enzymes produce cholesterol molecules. Then scientists began searching for drugs that might interfere with those enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971, six decades after Anichkov ran his egg-yolk experiments, Akira Endo of Tokyo Noko University and his colleagues, decided to see if microbes made natural cholesterol-fighting compounds (&lt;a href="http://www.jlr.org/cgi/reprint/33/11/1569"&gt;free pdf&lt;/a&gt;). They reasoned that such a compound would be a potent weapon against microbial competitors, since cholesterol and related molecules are essential for building cells. In 1973 they found a fungus that blocks a key enzyme in the cholesterol pathway. It took more than another decade before drugs based on Endo’s explorations, known as statins, reached the market. Today drugs like Lipitor are prescribed to millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a journalist wrote an article on Anchikov’s intial research, the most accurate headline would have been something like: “RUSSIAN SCIENTIST DISCOVERS LINK BETWEEN MOLECULE AND HEART DISEASE. WILL LEAD TO POWERFUL NEW MEDICINE IN EIGHTY YEARS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it would be a rare journalist who would be able to see eighty years in the future like that. And headlines about events readers won’t be alive to see can seem awfully remote. Anchikov’s discovery did not change the lives of the people who could have read about it at the time. Their grandchildren, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about Anchikov recently, after having read a &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/360/17/1699"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. It’s by Joel Hirschhorn of Harvard, on the subject of genomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade ago a complete sequence of the human genome was still a dream, although a dream close to becoming real. In a typical &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/29/business/the-race-to-cash-in-on-the-genetic-code.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from 1999, a reporter wrote that “scientists hope to treat diseases in much the same way that software engineers fix faulty computer programs, by isolating flaws in the code.” Once we could read the entire human genome, the article promised, nothing would be the same: “By identifying the genetic roots of illnesses like cancer and heart disease, some experts say, the science of the genome, or genomics, may make it possible for a child born today to live to 150–or, some say, much longer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a &lt;a href="http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2009/01/19/ten_years_after_the_genomics_frenzy.php"&gt;difference&lt;/a&gt; a decade makes. Scientists have been finding many genetic markers for common diseases like heart disease and diabetes, but they’re not pointing the way to obvious treatments. The falling cost of DNA is letting scientists sequence genomes left and right–not just people’s genomes, but the genomes of their cancer cells and their microbes. And for now, scientists are drowning in data rather than plucking out new cures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hirschhorn wants the growing number of skeptics to keep history in mind. In his NEJM letter he writes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New biologic insights do not guarantee a rapid translation into clinical practice; the latter will require great effort by basic, translational, and clinical researchers. The difficulty in translation is not unique to genetic discoveries: nearly a century and three Nobel Prizes separate the determination of the chemical composition of cholesterol from the development of statins. Each discovery of a biologically relevant locus is a potential first step in&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;a translational journey, and some journeys will be shorter than others. With a more complete collection of relevant genes and pathways, we can hope to shorten the interval between biologic knowledge and improved patient care.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;ne plus ultra&lt;/i&gt; of scientific drinks is, of course, the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=1617#comment-23346"&gt;Buzzed Aldrin&lt;/a&gt; (TANG made with vodka).

&lt;p&gt;If you have gin readily available, and if you can find a Martini glass among the debris, you could try the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pour the gin into the Martini glass.  Put Orbital's "Halcyon And On And On" on the stereo.  Set your desktop background to a picture of Antonio Benedetto Carpano, the inventor of vermouth, after running the picture through the "invert" and "posterize" colour filters of a graphics program.  Add a pickled onion.  Drink.&lt;/p&gt;

State funding for educational programs for students over the age of 21?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds too good to be true, especially in light of general realizations about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/when_everything_isnt_shiny_anymore"&gt;when everything isn't as shiny anymore&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to adult services. An article in the June 26th &lt;a href="http://www.contracostatimes.com/health/ci_12698824"&gt;Contra Costa Times&lt;/a&gt; describes the two-year-old &lt;a href="http://www.collegeinternshipprogram.com/"&gt;College Internship Program&lt;/a&gt; for young adults with Asperger's and similar disabilities in &lt;a href="http://www.cipberkeley.org/"&gt;Berkeley, CA&lt;/a&gt;. Students share&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...  two-bedroom apartments in downtown Berkeley, cook cooperatively and attend morning classes together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day starts with a reframing exercise, and a series of questions — am I hungry, tired, angry, depressed, anxious? — that serves as a sensory check-in. Students grade themselves in each area and discuss how they might cope by getting more sleep, eating a better breakfast or being more gentle and forgiving with themselves. It's an exercise, Miller notes, that might stand everyone in good stead, not just these young adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tutoring sessions, social peer counseling, and career and executive functioning classes, none of which carry a small price tag, not with a staff-student ratio of one to one. About 95 percent of the California students' tuition is covered by &lt;a href="http://www.dds.ca.gov/RC/RCList.cfm"&gt;Regional Center&lt;/a&gt; funding — the same funding that helped cover their special education costs in high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For actual classwork they head off to lecture halls at Berkeley City College, Holy Names, Peralta College and other local campuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students can also take online courses at local colleges. &lt;a href="http://www.cipberkeley.org/tuition.htm"&gt;Tuition&lt;/a&gt; is $38,500.00, plus room and board, and also college / vocational courses; assistance with 95% of costs would certainly be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priest claimed to be tee-total, except for the fact that he had celebrated four masses that day and obviously there's wine in that. Whether there's the amount of wine necessary to put you over the limit (or on the U.K. limit) isn't necessarily the point. Having drunk the wine in some sort of cannibalistic cult ritual rather than in a bar with friends doesn't make you any less dangerous on the motorway.

There's a new movie being released, &lt;a href="http://www.thevoyage.tv/default.aspx"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Voyage That Shook the World&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that you can tell from the tagline — &amp;quot;One man, one voyage, one book ignited a controversy that still rages today&amp;quot; — is creationist trash (hint: there is no scientific controversy anymore on this matter). Look a little further, and you&amp;#39;ll find it&amp;#39;s produce by &lt;a href="http://creation.com/"&gt;Creation Ministries International&lt;/a&gt;, which tells you right there what their agenda is: to tell lies for Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's where the parallel to &lt;a href="http://expelledexposed.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Expelled&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lies…in the lies. They got several Darwin experts (Peter Bowler, Sandra Herbert, and Janet Browne) to appear in the &amp;quot;documentary&amp;quot; by &lt;a href="http://jmlynch.wordpress.com/2009/06/21/creationists-lie-to-historians-and-deny-subterfuge/"&gt;concealing their motives&lt;/a&gt;. And then they admit to &lt;a href="http://jmlynch.wordpress.com/2009/06/27/more-on-creationists-lying-to-historians/"&gt;cherry-picking the interviews to put together their story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, if they actually had an honest message, if they could be trusted to present the opinions of the experts accurately, they wouldn't need to deceive to get people to contribute to their projects. As it is, all we can trust them on is their ability to mangle the facts. Doesn't this tell you something about the credibility of the creationist movement?&lt;/p&gt;

Both the panel, and the audience, consisted primarily of people with physical disabilities, and, in the audience, a few parents of younger children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one side of things, the issues surrounding personal assistants are pretty universal: How do I find someone I can trust?  How do I &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/megaconference_special_1_of_6_violence_and_abuse"&gt;protect myself from abuse&lt;/a&gt;?  How do I find someone who is able to work well with me?  How do we maintain good employer / employee boundaries?  How do I fire someone without  a mess?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of things, how these issues are resolved is pretty individual.  Relying on one's interview skills to initially determine if someone is trustworthy is only a good idea if one has excellent interview skills.  Understanding when one is being taken advantage of requires a certain amount of skill as well--and just because a person doesn't realize they are being abused or taken advantage of does not mean the abuse isn't happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often look to the broader disability community, especially to people who have been successfully living a high quality of life for many years, for ideas and information.  There is a lot of wisdom out there to draw from, and one should not discard knowledge just because it does not come from "within the autism community" (&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/what_defines_community"&gt;whatever that means&lt;/a&gt;).  I have a professor who says, "a systems scientist is a person who looks at birds flocking and fish schooling and realizes they are both the same."  There are many repeat patterns like this between the Autistic community and other disability communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet--there is also significant divergence in strategies that work for people whose differences fall in a physical rather than mental and/or social realm.  We may need different strategies for learning how to hire, who to hire, how to protect ourselves.  We may need a panel and audience that is populated more by people who have social or mental differences so that we can learn strategies for hiring and maintaining a personal assistant that work with our specific strengths and around our specific weaknesses.  I didn't end up getting as much out of the personal assistant panel as I hoped for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do have to say that of all the presentations I attended, I found that panel and that audience the most inclusive, welcoming, and accommodating of any in the whole three days.  They made sure my questions were voiced and answered, they gave me time to communicate at my own slow pace, and they took the extra time to make sure we were all understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the most valuable thing that I get from cross-disability interactions isn't the shared information but the shared sense of, yes for real, belonging to a community.

One project I have been putting off is for an article about your favorite diva of bench and hearth. I am supposed to provide a biographical sketch of all of my many, many, vast accomplishments and degrees. But, here's the thing. I have been putting it off because, for some reason, I have been having a really difficult time writing two paragraphs of nice things about myself. My science? Fine. Myself? Not so fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has come over me lately? Am I feverish? Have I caught some kind of strange virus which selectively infects the ego? I'm just not sure, little muffins. In an effort to get something on the page to get me started I have written, "Dr. Isis is a pretty cool chick. Also, her shoes are basically always amazing"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To distract myself, I have been looking online at fabrics to redecorate my dining room. I am considering these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img height="300" alt="Fabric 1.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/06/more_confessions_of_a_domestic/Fabric%201.jpg" width="265"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Sounds to me like I got duped, and I apologize to everyone for forwarding this story. Hopefully more info will come out soon, and I’ll update as I hear it.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Update: &lt;a href="http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum29/HTML/000617.html"&gt;folks at CollectSpace are saying this article is a hoax&lt;/a&gt;. I have no evidence either way, which is why I wrote this post using the &amp;quot;allegedly&amp;quot; format. Hopefully more evidence one way or another will come out soon.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 20, just weeks from now, it will be the 40th anniversary of the moment a human stepped foot on another world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve seen the footage: Neil Armstrong in his bulky suit, stepping off the lunar module’s footpad. Ironically, though, for such a momentous occasion, the video looks &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt;. Noisy, low-res, and washed out. Well, it turns out that’s because this iconic scene, shown millions of times in the ensuing years, is not the original footage. It was actually taken using a 16mm camera aimed at a screen at NASA’s Mission Control room. And the screen was only showing highly compressed data, so the end result is the lousy stuff we’ve grown used to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/apollo11footage.jpg" alt="Apollo 11 still from Moon landing"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZOMG! I can see right through NASA’s lies!&lt;br&gt; And through Neil Armstrong, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all that may now change. &lt;a href="http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/110442/WORLD-EXCLUSIVE-NASA-finds-missing-moon-landing-tapes"&gt;The UK Sunday Express is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that the original tapes have been found! This means that we may finally, after four decades, get the high-quality footage of Neil Armstrong’s small step that we’ve always wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is this: the video stream from the Moon was of a decent quality, but far too large too be able to be be sent to TVs around the country and the world. Using the Parkes radio telescope in Australia, astronomers recorded the video beamed from the lunar surface in high quality, but what they transmitted to NASA was necessarily compressed. It’s the latter we’ve all seen. The thing is, the high quality tapes were then lost somehow. NASA admitted it a few years ago, and the search was on! According to the article the tapes were finally found recently in a storage facility on Perth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very exciting, and I certainly hope it’s true. I’d love to see this moment once again, but this time with a beautiful clear picture!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, me being who I am, I have to add this part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, [the tapes] could once and for all dispel 40 years of wild conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is so wonderfully naive! First,&lt;em&gt; conspiracy theories about the Moon landings aren’t based on facts&lt;/em&gt;. If they were, the hoax idea would have dried up and blown away 30 years ago. They have no facts. All they have is a zealous fervor and a gross misunderstanding of reality. Finding the tapes won’t help; you could fly a conspiracy theorist to the Moon and &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt; them the equipment lying on the desolate surface, and they’d accuse you of drugging them. My advice: if you try this, leave that goofball on the Moon. That’ll give him plenty of time to think over his ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the use of the word &amp;quot;crucial&amp;quot; made me laugh. I’ve talked with dozens of people at NASA about the Hoax theory, and it’s hardly something that’s critical to them. They all regard it as an irritant, like a tiny pebble in your shoe or a pesky fold in your underwear you can only feel when you sit a certain way. Ignorable, but irksome when you’re reminded about it. And though they’d never admit it, I bet every single person at NASA loves &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrgglDVmm_g"&gt;how Buzz handled it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And third, what the article author forgets is that, to a conspiracy nut, &lt;em&gt;everything in the whole Universe is part of the conspiracy&lt;/em&gt;. So the fact that the tapes were missing is evidence of a coverup, and NASA finding the tapes is due to the massive pressure of the hoax community, and if the tapes aren’t exactly as promised that’s because NASA has doctored them, and if they are pristine and perfect then you can look just &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt; and see the wires holding up the astroNOTS, and you still can’t see stars in the footage, and and and.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a few weeks before the 40th anniversary of this incredible moment in history, here’s what I think about the Moon Hoaxers: &lt;em&gt;screw them&lt;/em&gt;. Let them gripe and moan and try to pee in the punch bowl of NASA. In reality, that punch bowl is way, way over their heads. &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; can see the magnificent achievement of Apollo for what it was, and I think the vast majority of people out there do as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Saturday I invited friends old and new over: we played a game of &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42"&gt;Tigris &amp;amp; Euphrates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, two games of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubb"&gt;kubb&lt;/a&gt; (no, it is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; an old Viking game), made a lovely barbecue dinner and took an evening walk to Lake Lundsjön. Our kubb court was laid out meticulously with the aid of two tape measures and Pythagoras&amp;#39; Theorem, just like when you lay out an excavation trench or grid. Later that night I watched a 2006 concert by Max Raabe &amp;amp; Palast-Orchester on TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday me &amp;amp; Juniorette visited some old friends of mine: we had lunch in their garden and walked to Lake Järlasjön where the kids went swimming. I type these lines sitting in our yard, hoping that Junior will show up soon. Though I think I&amp;#39;ll have a nap first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a very long while since I've updated &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/science/medicine/cancer_basics/"&gt;my series on cancer&lt;/a&gt;.  I keep meaning to, but you know how things go.  Lately, though, I've been curious about radiation oncology, the use of ionizing radiation to treat cancers.  What set me off was &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/health/21radiation.html"&gt;a recent Times article&lt;/a&gt; about some pretty crappy practices.  Radiation oncology requires a very thorough education in physics and medicine and the field attracts some of the best minds, but no field is immune to unethical behavior (which in this case I feel is more important than the incompetence itself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, radiation---it scares the crap out of people.  We call magnetic resonance imaging "MRI" instead of the original "NMR" (nuclear magnetic resonance) mostly because the idea of being in a machine with the word "nuclear" on it freaks people out.  Of course, radiation is a normal part of living.  We are exposed to high energy electro-magnetic radiation daily, both from the Earth and from space.  If fact, ionizing radiation from the sun is the primary cause of skin cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very shortly after ionizing radiation was discovered in the late 19th century, it was applied to the treatment of cancerous tumors, albeit in a very crude way.  As knowledge of physics and medicine grew, so did the sophistication of treatments.  Early on, of course, it wasn't understood exactly how radiation damaged living tissue.  If you aim x-rays at healthy skin for long enough the skin starts to turn red in a way similar to a sun burn.  If you want to get that radiation to a tumor somewhere under the skin, then simply aiming an x-ray at the skin above it is going to kill skin long before it kills tumor.  Thankfully, people are rather clever.  In the early 20th century, doctors tried inserting radium directly into tumors, and tried fractionating treatments of external beam radiation so that each individual dose was not too toxic to the overlying structures. These techniques allowed killing more tumor cells than normal cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let's back up a little here and examine some of the basics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/06/cancer_202---radiation_therapy.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/06/cancer_202---radiation_therapy.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/SoY6cgHUcE8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246207856359"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1545">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/079305e774eb2c93</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and culture"/><category term="Language and sports"/><title type="html">Vuvuzela</title><published>2009-06-28T16:37:29Z</published><updated>2009-06-28T16:37:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1545" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/vuvuzela.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="151241"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/vuvuzela2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/vuvuzela2.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; When the U.S. soccer team &lt;a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/9693152"&gt;plays Brazil this afternoon&lt;/a&gt; in the Confederations Cup final,  the stadium will be buzzing with the sound of plastic trumpets called &lt;em&gt;vuvuzelas&lt;/em&gt;. (See Delia Robertson "&lt;a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-06-25-voa40.cfm"&gt;Vuvuzela: Popular Symbol of South African Football&lt;/a&gt;", VOA News, 6/25/2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example (with simulated crowd noise) of how a vuvuzela sounds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In normal South African games, there would apparently be hundreds or thousands of them. There's a more realistic-sounding recording at the site of &lt;a href="http://www.boogieblast.co.za/"&gt;www.boogieblast.co.za&lt;/a&gt;, which claims that the device originated  with a &amp;quot;women&amp;#39;s Chinese basketball team&amp;quot;; reminds us to &amp;quot;REMEMBER… YOU ONLY HATE THEM, IF YOU DON’T HAVE ONE…&amp;quot;; and observes that your vuvuzela can also be used as a cricket bat, hearing aid, petrol funnel, water sprayer, drinking funnel, 4G mobile communication device, walking stick, light saber, and jousting stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that outsiders are mostly less enthusiastic (Robyn Dixon, "&lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-soccer-trumpet28-2009jun28,0,7291960.story"&gt;South Africa abuzz over talk of banning soccer fans' favorite horn&lt;/a&gt;", LA Times, 6/28/2009):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Hatred of the &lt;em&gt;vuvuzela&lt;/em&gt;, the noisemaker wielded by South African soccer fans, ignited the blogosphere even before the FIFA Confederations Cup, the country's dry run for 2010, which ends today when the U.S. national team plays Brazil for the championship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;During the current tournament, foreign players, coaches and journalists have called for a ban of the &lt;em&gt;vuvuzela&lt;/em&gt;. There is debate about whether it's a unique part of South African culture, and therefore untouchable, or just a cheap plastic import that makes a lot of noise, like an electric air horn or a whistle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;One vuvuzela — a loud, tuneless blast — sounds something like a foghorn. But a stadium full of vuvuzelas, all tooting simultaneously, is either a most exhilarating and exciting sound or a noise so irritating that it borders on being painful, depending on the listener.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It's been compared to a deafening swarm of wasps. Or a herd of flatulent elephants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.southafrica.info/2010/vuvuzela.htm"&gt;SouthAfrica.info page&lt;/a&gt; says that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;There's uncertainty on the origin of the word "vuvuzela". Some say it comes from the isiZulu for - wait for it - "making noise". Others say it's from township slang related to the word "shower", because it "showers people with music" - or, more prosaically, looks a little like a shower head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuvuzela"&gt;wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; offers the alternative names &lt;em&gt;lepatata&lt;/em&gt; (said to be the term in Setswana), and &lt;em&gt;stadium horn&lt;/em&gt;, and quotes some other European vuvuzela hatas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;During the match between United States and Italy, BBC 3 commentator Lee Dixon referred to the sounds as "quite irritating". FIFA received complaints from multiple European broadcasters who want it banned for the 2010 FIFA World Cup because the sound is drowning out the commentators. Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk and Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso also called for a ban, the latter saying the horns make it hard for players to communicate and concentrate while adding nothing to the atmosphere&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American players are &lt;a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/9693152"&gt;taking a positive attitude&lt;/a&gt;, however:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;And the deafening blare of the vuvuzelas that some teams at the Confederation Cup have complained about? The Americans don't mind them one bit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"I think we've shown a spirit and competitiveness that people love, and that's infectious for people," [Landon] Donovan said. "We expect the same for tomorrow night, too, that people will be out there wanting to see us do well, and we thrive off that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OED hasn't added &lt;em&gt;vuvuzela&lt;/em&gt; to its online lexicon yet, but the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=885"&gt;Word Induction Ceremony&lt;/a&gt; can't be far off, given the word's &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&amp;amp;ned=us&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=vuvuzela"&gt;prominent role&lt;/a&gt; in international sports reporting over the next couple of years. (Note also that &lt;a href="http://www.uticaod.com/sports/x1885872855/The-Fan-You-can-enjoy-the-game-but-leave-your-vuvuzela-home"&gt;&lt;em&gt;vuvuzela&lt;/em&gt; is worth 23 scrabble points&lt;/a&gt; even before bonuses — or would be, if it were added to the official word list.)&lt;/p&gt;

The Big Picture &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/06/recent_scenes_from_the_iss.html"&gt;once again does the International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;. My favorite picture? No contest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/06/recent_scenes_from_the_iss.html#photo7" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/iss_moon.jpg" alt="The Moon, from ISS"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh how I love this picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I love shots of the Moon, but this speaks volumes. Note the Earth just below the Moon; the ISS was seeing the Moon through the top of Earth’s atmosphere. As you may know, light bends when it passes from one medium to another, like from water to air, which is why a spoon in a glass looks bent. The same is true when light passes from a vacuum through air; it bends. In fact, the amount the light bends depends on the angle it intercepts the boundary; so that light coming in from one direction may get bent more than if it comes in from another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here comes the cool part: the Earth’s atmosphere follows the curve of the Earth, so you can picture it as a thick shell of air around us. Here’s a diagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/iss-moon_los.jpg" alt="ISS Moon line of sight diagram"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth’s surface is the lower arc, and the air above the upper arc. The Moon is to the left, the ISS to the right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red lines indicate the line-of-sight view to the Moon. When an astronaut looks at the bottom of the Moon, the angle of the air/space boundary is a bit different than it is when he or she looks at the top of the Moon. In my diagram that angle is close to being 45 degrees for the bottom line, but is more like 30 degrees for the top line. That means the light coming from the bottom of the Moon gets bent more than the top. As it happens, the light from the Moon gets bent &lt;em&gt;upward&lt;/em&gt; as it passes through our air… so the bottom of the Moon looks like it’s getting pushed into the top. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This squashes the view of the Moon! All of the light is getting bent, but by different amounts; the upper part of the Moon is &lt;em&gt;closer&lt;/em&gt; to being a circle but is still distorted significantly. Making it worse, the Moon was not quite full in this picture, so the &amp;quot;left&amp;quot; side looks off, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a mess! But it’s an explainable mess, and one that’s not even all that hard to do. The math is really just a bit of trig and a bit of algebra. In detail it gets more complicated, because the Earth’s air gets thinner with altitude, and I didn’t account for that. And I bet there are a hundred other variables as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But making some quick assumptions explains the gross characteristics of this picture just fine. And to me, that adds to my amazement of such a shot. Knowing more about it doesn’t detract from its beauty and its wonder; it &lt;em&gt;enhances&lt;/em&gt; them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really love that about science. It’s easy to be awed when you don’t know how something works, but when you get a glimpse into the machinery behind it, get an idea of how it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; works, what you see becomes that much more beautiful. &lt;/p&gt;

I am unimpressed. He makes six points that I briefly summarize here, with my reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's the job of the religious to reconcile their beliefs with science, and atheists don't get to "&lt;i&gt;insist&lt;/i&gt; that nobody else can make the claim that their religious belief is consistent with science."&lt;/b&gt; The first part is obvious — we aren&amp;#39;t going to compromise science with superstition, nor are we going to make excuses for them. The second part makes no sense. Nobody has been making that demand…but we will point out how silly the excused people make are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The usual excuse that making nice with religion is strategic, coupled with the claim that religion is always going to be around.&lt;/b&gt; Other people can be strategic. Scientists just ought to be honest. As for the tired argument that religion will always be around — no. Some of us have shed the old myths. More will follow. I don&amp;#39;t have any problem seeing a coming future where religious belief is an irrelevant minority position. Of course, if you start out with a defeatist attitude, it becomes a bit more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some scientists are religious, and we don't have the right to insist that they give it up.&lt;/b&gt; I have not heard a single atheist insist that &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; must give up their religion. I can imagine a majority voluntarily giving it up, but my imagination fails at the idea of going up to some believer and &lt;i&gt;ordering&lt;/i&gt; them to stop believing. How do we do that? So, sorry, Wilkins — it&amp;#39;s another complaint about something no one is proposing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientific institutions shouldn&amp;#39;t be asserting that science is compatible with religion — let the religious do that themselves.&lt;/b&gt; That's the very same thing the atheists have been saying all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Religion has always been wrong about the natural world, but religion is seeking knowledge of something different.&lt;/b&gt; Again, first part fine, second part weird. What knowledge? Can you even call it "knowledge" if it's nothing that anyone can know? Why should we accept &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; claims by religion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOMA is wrong, and there is no war between religion and science.&lt;/b&gt; Wilkins continues his pattern of being half right. I agree that NOMA was a false attempt at reconciliation. I disagree that there is no conflict between religion and science. Religion is an archaic, failed mode of thinking that continues to demand greater respect than it deserves, and exploits tradition, fear, and emotion to maintain its undeserved position. Wilkins tries to compare it to two dancers jostling for space on a dance floor, I prefer to think of it as one dancer, humanity, afflicted with lice, religion, and twitching and squirming unpleasantly while struggling with a persistent parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a resounding "eh". However, then he tosses out this bizarre bit of philosophical insipidity that irritates, like an annoying bit of grit in my shoe. It's one of those superficially &lt;i&gt;reasonable&lt;/i&gt; comments that, with just a little thought, looks awfully stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only those who are completely without self-knowledge think they are entirely rational on every subject, and that this licenses attacking others for their perceived failings in that respect. I know I won't change their mind either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grrr. Once again, we've got a caricature of the atheist position: who among us claims perfect self-knowledge and flawless rationality? We're human beings, last I looked. However, to imply that we can therefore have no license to criticize irrationality is to claim that no one can say anything ever against foolishness. It's an abdication of intellectual responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to announce that I were absolutely rational and that I had perfect knowledge, I would expect to be rightfully attacked by people like John Wilkins for my obvious failing. Hey, he just did — even though I&amp;#39;ve never made such an assertion. But I think we&amp;#39;d both agree that such an extravagant claim would most definitely be an astonishing foolishness that ought to be smacked down. What a crazy idea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John clearly thinks some philosophical claims are &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt;. But the curious thing is that he thinks certain other claims are beyond our capacity to criticize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, for instance, someone believes that a god gave us magical absolution by turning into a man and dying temporarily, well, heck—that may not be an irrational, wacky idea at all. If this someone claims that they have a magical communication line to an omniscient superman who assures him that the 36-hour death absolution was really, really true, we should step back, take a charitably philosophical view of the idea, and abstain from calling him a very silly man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;i&gt;limits&lt;/i&gt; to what we can attack as bad ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, apparently, there are no limits to the absurdities that the religious can advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an asymmetrical situation that will be maintained as long as we have people insisting that we grant religious ideas a specially protected status. I reject that — I&amp;#39;m going to insist that it is fair game to attack the &lt;i&gt;obvious&lt;/i&gt; failings of religion. And it's not because I am unaware of the limitations of my knowledge, or because I believe I'm flawlessly rational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's because the invisible monkeys in my pants dart out every once in a while to whisper the truth in my ear, in the ancient language of omniscient primates. And that is a source of knowledge nobody can attack me on, by Wilkins' rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Has anyone come across a good source of information on providing nest support for alternative pollinators such as bumblebees, digger bees, and the like?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I have!  Xerces has an excellent PDF download, &lt;a href="http://www.xerces.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/nests_for_native_bees1.pdf"&gt;Nests for Native Bees&lt;/a&gt;.  There are also additional detailed instructions in their publication &lt;a href="http://www.xerces.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/farming_for_bees_guidelines_xerces_society.pdf"&gt;Farming for Bees&lt;/a&gt; (starting on page 25).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href="http://nativeplants.msu.edu/pdf/E2985ConservingNativeBees.pdf"&gt;Michigan specific advice in a PDF here&lt;/a&gt; (and any day now I’ll get around to reviewing the  &lt;a href="http://www.landislab.ent.msu.edu/pdf/Landis%20PDF%20Collection/1.Isaacs.Tuell.Fiedler.Gardiner.Landis.2009.Maximizing%20arthropod-mediated%20ecosystem%20services%20in%20agriculturel%20landscapes.pdf"&gt;awesome paper&lt;/a&gt; those authors published in Ecology Frontiers….)  There is also a plant list for Michigan in this &lt;a href="http://nativeplants.anr.msu.edu/pdf/E2973.pdf"&gt;PDF publication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find a list of &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the excellent &lt;a href="http://www.xerces.org/pollinator-conservation-publications/"&gt;Xerces Society publications online here&lt;/a&gt;, downloadable free as PDFs!&lt;/p&gt;

It enables a claimant - here the BCA - to set out its response to the Defence of the defendant - here Simon Singh. It is not a document addressed to the world. It is not even a document which is addressed to the Court generally, other than in response to the pleaded Defence. The summary and (importantly) the quotations which now follow need to be put into this context.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form and Content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My initial reaction to the Reply was to its size. The Defence was just twelve pages long; the Reply runs to some thirty-six pages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Often a Reply is quite short - usually shorter than the Defence - just picking up points in the Defence which may not have been anticipated when the &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2008/11/on-bcas-case-against-simon-singh.html"&gt; Claim&lt;/a&gt; was originally made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The length of the Reply is a testament to how much work was required by the BCA to meet Simon Singh's &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2008/11/on-putting-chiropractic-on-trial.html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Defence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You may recall that the Defence set out full defences on fair comment and justification, and in both respects putting the BCA to test on the evidence for chiropractic for various children's non-spinal ailments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, it appears that pleading "Fair Comment" led to the BCA creating the (now discredited) &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/06/bcas-worst-day-yet.html"&gt; "plethora"&lt;/a&gt; list of evidence. I understand the BCA served this list on Simon Singh on the same day as the Reply, so to put him to test as to the evidence of which he was aware when he wrote the original article: the BCA would have to show that he hadn't reviewed the appropriate evidence to displace the Fair Comment defence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The High Court, however, ruled that the Fair Comment defence &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/05/bca-v-singh-official-ruling.html"&gt; was not available&lt;/a&gt; to Simon Singh and so, technically (and subject to Appeal), the "plethora" is no longer relevant to the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nonetheless, the "plethora" probably would never have been created had Simon Singh not pleaded the Fair Comment defence; a defence - of course - the BCA has consistently maintained he was not even entitled to plead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Start of the Reply&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Reply commences with a general attack on the Defence. For example:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"It is open to the Defendant to apologise for and to withdraw the defamatory allegations he made. The Defendant has not offered to do so. Further, the Defendant has not offered to make the position as to the Claimant clear publicly; he has not even offered to clarify publicly that (it it were to have been the case) he had not intended to impugn the integrity of the Claimant as the Claimant complains he had."&lt;/em&gt; (Para 2(3) of the Reply.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there is a passage which, out of context, seems extraordinary:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Instead, the Defendant has sought to mount a defence to different allegations (not the ones complained of in this action); and, in order to mount such a defence, he has resorted to place [sic] a strained and unnatural interpretation on the plain word, "evidence", he used. The Defendant seeks to depart from its ordinary meaning (as it would have been understood by readers of his article) and to treat "evidence" as if it meant only "evidence from randomised controlled trials". This artificial approach departs from the proper approach of medical scientists."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would rather appear that the BCA regards RCTs constituting the appropriate evidence base for assessing chiropractic to be a &lt;em&gt;"strained and unnatural interpretation..[an] artificial approach"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This may well be the case, but please remember that in this paragraph the BCA are not directly making such an admission to the public, but are instead seeking to head off Simon Singh's pleaded&lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2008/11/on-putting-chiropractic-on-trial.html"&gt; Defence&lt;/a&gt; as to what &lt;em&gt;"not a jot of evidence"&lt;/em&gt; meant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reply on Chiropractic generally&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Reply then provides a lengthy ten page exposition on chiropractic generally, its regulated nature in the UK (statutory regulation is mentioned frequently), and the background of the BCA and the ill-fated "&lt;em&gt;Chiropractic Awareness Week&lt;/em&gt;".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this plethora of detail, most of which is not directly related to the Defence, the following information is provided:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- the BCA define Chiropractic as &lt;em&gt;"a health profession concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal systems and the effect of those disorders on the function of the nervous system and general health"&lt;/em&gt; (Para 3(1) of the Reply);&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- and Chiropractors are defined by the BCA as &lt;em&gt;"independent practitioners, with responsibility for patients in the primary care setting. Chiropractors take a holistic approach to health and wellbeing, considering its physical, psychological and social aspects. By restoring normal function to the musculo-skeletal system, chiropractors can play a major part in relieving disorders, and accompanying pain or discomfort, arising from accidents, stress, lack of exercise, poor posture and everyday wear and tear."&lt;/em&gt; (Para 3(2) of the Reply);&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- the BCA states that the over-riding consideration in chiropractic is that &lt;em&gt;"[t]he treatment and techniques used by a chiropractor in any individual case will depend upon the health and health needs of the patient"&lt;/em&gt;, but subject to this consideration, there is an emphasis on manual treatments, including manipulation or adjustment, and that other forms of treatments regularly used include &lt;em&gt;"exercise and rehabilitation; preventative measures; advice, explanation and reassurance (for example, as to the kinds of activity and behaviour that promote recovery and advice as to nutrition and diet)"&lt;/em&gt; (Para 3(3) of the Reply);&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- the GCC Code of Conduct &lt;em&gt;"lays down standards of personal and professional conduct expected of registered chiropractors. Chiropractors must meet high standards of conduct and practice."&lt;/em&gt; (Para 3(9)(a) of the Reply);&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- the BCA state that &lt;em&gt;"chiropractors take great care that any treatment they administer to patients is effective and safe" &lt;/em&gt;(Para 3(10) of the Reply), and this includes that &lt;em&gt;"Chiropractors will explain the care and treatment proposed to the patient, including any known risks in any particular form of assessment or care. The chiropractor will also explain any need to refer the patient to another health professional."&lt;/em&gt; (Para 3(10)(d) of the Reply);&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- the BCA list the additional requirements for the care of children, including obtaining consent (Para 3(12) of the Reply) and that there are various "red flags" which mean the child should be referred to a GP or hospital; the BCA also notes that chiropractors &lt;em&gt;"have regard to the fact that a child's neuro-muscular-skeletal structure is less rigid and more flexible than that of an adult; and that young and developing tissues are more susceptible to damage and injury".&lt;/em&gt; (Para 3(13) of the Reply;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- the BCA &lt;em&gt;"is committed to the highest standards of excellence in chiropractic, patient care, standards of practice and continuing professional development" and that it has a "professional statement"&lt;/em&gt; (not quoted) and a professional standards committee (Para 4(3) of the Reply);&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- the BCA is not, and does not purport to be, "&lt;em&gt;a research establishment offering a complete guide to all research information published and/or available in relation to chiropractic."&lt;/em&gt; (Para 4(6) of the Reply); and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- the BCA "&lt;em&gt;generally promotes chiropractic on behalf of its members&lt;/em&gt;" (Para 4(7) of the Reply).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The BCA and Simon Singh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA then issue a couple of challenges to Simon Singh. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having stated that they do not purport to be "&lt;em&gt;a research establishment offering a complete guide to all research information published and/or available in relation to chiropractic&lt;/em&gt;" they nonetheless assert that Simon Singh &lt;em&gt;"is put to strict proof as to the extent of his research into, and the extent of his knowledge about, chiropractic...and, in particular, what research papers he had read and the extent of his consideration and independent evaluation of them"&lt;/em&gt; (Para 5(1) of the Reply).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, Simon Singh &lt;em&gt;"had a duty, as a scientist with Cambridge PhD, to acquaint himself with the state of the published literature as to the effectiveness and risks of chiropractic before making public claims about it."&lt;/em&gt; (Para 5(2) of the Reply.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a remarkable line of argument.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BCA are stating that Simon Singh has to meet a far higher standard of knowledge of chiropractic research in criticising the BCA than the BCA itself has to meet in promoting chiropractic in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA later in the Reply make this contrast clear. In Paragraph 9(20), they state that whilst their website &lt;em&gt;"does not purport to cite, and does not cite, all available evidence in respect of chiropractic...it is for the defendant to establish,on the basis of a comprehensive review of all available evidence (whether published or unpublished) that there was not a jot of evidence that chiropractic can help with the specified matters"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, the BCA will accept only a lesser duty to &lt;em&gt;"acquaint itself with the state of the published literature as to the effectiveness and risks of chiropractic and that, in terms of what it publishes, the claimant has a moral duty not to mislead the public&lt;/em&gt;." (Para 9(29) of the Reply.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(In passing, I fail completely to see the relevance of the PhD being from Cambridge University. Whilst I am - in principle - all for Cambridge graduates having a more onerous time in life than the rest of us, holding a Cambridge PhD should not really create an obligation which, say, a Durham or Middlesex PhD would not have. And, presumably, with my simple MA, I would escape this duty altogether.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BCA and Professor Ernst&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA also attack the research of Professor Ernst to which Simon Singh refers in his Defence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, in respect of Ernst and Cantor's important &lt;em&gt;"A systematic review of systematic reviews of spinal manipulation"&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, we get the quite wonderful:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The JRSM is a peer review publication, but does not have a high impact factor; it is not, for example comparable to the British Medical Journal or Spine in scientific quality."&lt;/em&gt; (Para 9(19)(a) of the Reply.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which leads to the rather brilliant:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"the authors' approach was subjective; their assessment of the quality of the reviews included in the study was loose, although more robust and clinemetrically sound approaches were available. This may have led to the paper being published in the JRSM, rather than a higher-status publication"&lt;/em&gt; (Para 9(19)(b)(ii) of the Reply).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BCA and "Research"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now we come to a really interesting part of the Reply: what the BCA has to say about evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA admit that &lt;em&gt;"a systematic review of studies can be a valuable means of assessing the published evidence for and against the effectiveness (or lack of effectiveness)of interventions. However, a systematic review is valuable and effective only if there is sufficient data available to be reviewed. Where, as in the case of chiropractic, there is very limited RCT data available, it is difficult to extract any definitive conclusion from a systematic review of that data"&lt;/em&gt; (Para 9(15) of the Reply).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA then proceeds to state that Simon Singh's approach in his Defence to evidence &lt;em&gt;"is wrong in principle and fundamentally misguided" &lt;/em&gt;(Para 9(18) of the Reply).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, &lt;em&gt;"the proposition that 'evidence' is meaningful only if it comes from RCTs is wrong and not supported by good medical practice"&lt;/em&gt; (Para 9(18)(c) of the Reply).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"RCTs are one form, but by no means the only form, of evidence. other forms of evidence include: historical control trials, non-randomised contemporaneous controlled trials, case control studies, before and after designs and case series and case reports. All of these constitute 'evidence', as is recognised by various systems that have been devised to reate (or grade) forms of 'evidence' in the medical context."&lt;/em&gt; (Para 9(18)(c)(i) of the Reply.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA further state that the primary role of RCTs has been in the context of new drug treatments where a placebo can be used, but that RCTs are not the only form of evidence. Moreover, &lt;em&gt;"Trials without placebo are a standard part of the UKs Medical Research Council's funding policy." &lt;/em&gt;(Paras 9(18)(c)(ii) and (iii) of the Reply.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chiropractic and the Children's Ailments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is page 26 of the Reply before the BCA finally address the actual points made by Simon Singh about the efficacy of chiropractic for the six children's ailments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This part of the Reply begins with a stunning concession by the BCA in respect of three of the ailments:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Prolonged crying, sleeping problems and feeding problems may (together or separately) be a symptom of colic or otitis media. Those conditions are dealt with further below, including the evidence that chiropractic has helped."&lt;/em&gt; (Para 9(21) of the Reply.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words, the BCA does NOT have any separate evidence for three of the six ailments listed in the original &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070206003656/http://www.chiropractic-uk.co.uk/gfx/uploads/textbox/Happy+families.pdf"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Happy Families&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; leaflet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We then turn to &lt;strong&gt;Asthma&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"So far as the treatment of asthma is concerned, there is some positive evidence and some negative evidence. While, on the one hand, there is insufficient evidence to prove definitively that treatments is effective, there is, on the other hand, insufficient evidence to prove that it is not effective."&lt;/em&gt; (Para 9(22) of the Reply.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA then discusses Balon/Aaker (1999), the Kukurin lettter, Bronfort (2001), Bockenhauer (2002), Balon/Mior (2004), Hondras (2005), Guiney (2005), and Ernst (2006). (I will set out this discussion out in a future post.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then &lt;strong&gt;Colic&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"There is positive evidence that chiropractic can help to treat infantile colic."&lt;/em&gt; (Para 19(23) of the Reply)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here the BCA rely on Klougart (1989), Mercer &amp;amp; Nook (1999), Wiberg (1999), and Olafsdottir (2001).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Again I will set out what the BCA says for each of these studies in a future post.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, &lt;strong&gt;frequent ear infections&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"It is admitted that the reference on the website was to the ongoing Eisenberg trial, which has not published results."&lt;/em&gt; (Reply 19(24) of the Reply.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA then cite a single study: Mills et al (2003) on the use of osteopathic manipulative treatment (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; chiropractic). After summarising this study, the BCA states: &lt;em&gt;"There is, therefore, good evidence from this single trial that chiropractic can help treat frequent ear infections".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No other study for ear infections is mentioned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(The BCA then move on the Reply to discuss the research as to the general safety of chiropractic, relying on the Thiel Report (2007) and the Cassidy Report (2008).)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, in stark terms:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- the BCA cannot produce any separate evidence for the efficacy of chiropractic for three of the six named ailments and seek to merge these ailments with the others;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- the BCA cannot produce any evidence for the efficacy of chiropractic for ear infections, other than one dealing with osteopathy;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- the BCA admits the evidence for for the efficacy of chiropractic for asthma is inconclusive; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- on their "strongest" ground - colic - the BCA relies on evidence which (presumably) failed to even satisfy the &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/05/bca-v-singh-what-advertising-standards.html"&gt; ASA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The heart of this case has been the efficacy of chiropractic for six particular children's ailments. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buried under the sheer mass of legal paperwork has always been a quite simple issue: what was the quality of evidence for the claims of the BCA in their now-withdrawn and discarded &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070206003656/http://www.chiropractic-uk.co.uk/gfx/uploads/textbox/Happy+families.pdf"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Happy Families&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; leaflet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Until and unless this basic evidential issue was squarely addressed by the BCA, any legal action would be misconceived.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By casting his defence in wide terms - putting chiropractic on trial for those ailments - Simon Singh forced the BCA to address these points. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together the Reply and the "plethora" indicate that the BCA's claims may have had no proper evidential basis all along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;One wonders why the BCA did not spend a fraction of the legal costs on just providing this "evidence" in the first place; and then we all could have assessed whether it constituted a "jot of evidence" and whether the happily promoted treatments were "bogus". &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please no personal attacks on the parties or the Court.

D'Souza is the author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1414326017?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1414326017"&gt;What's So Great about Christianity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1414326017" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt; The students at &lt;em&gt;Virginia Commonwealth University &lt;/em&gt;are in the planning stages of this now. Chief organizer Larry M wrote about it in a message to people &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=83079252698#/group.php?gid=83079252698"&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Outside of the many attempts from Loftus to get Craig to debate him, others have tried to weigh in. Landon has asked Craig to debate Loftus three times and Craig has denied. We even tried to get Tony from Biola University to ask some of Craig's colleagues to weigh in and they did not put much weight on this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, we will keep this group going and hopefully growing for now. Maybe we can convince Craig to a debate as more people join in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the mean time... We have an agreement from Dinesh D'souza to debate Loftus. Dinesh has read Loftus' book and was going to write a review...but never did, according to Loftus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm working, as we speak, to get this debate going. I will keep everyone up to date on the progress. The only issue here is that Dinesh requires 10 grand plus travel expenses. Although I find this objectionable, I am working on finding funds for him. Loftus is requiring 2 grand plus travel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We will try to have this debate at &lt;em&gt;Virginia Commonwealth University&lt;/em&gt;, sponsored by the United Secular Alliance (affiliated with the Secular Student Alliance, the Atheist Alliance International, and the Rational Response Squad) and any other christian student club from VCU that would like to help, if money permits. Loftus and D'souza are in agreement and I'm going to try to meet with some Deans at VCU for funding as well as try to lobby some christian groups on campus to fork up some money. If you know anyone who would like to contribute, please contact me. Thank you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the meantime, spread the word. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Please do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-5959975657475511327?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It's actually because of something that not's about Charlie, but about me. (The &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autism_in_mice_animals"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt; come in a bit later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/MgRPXiP7SWI%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was no talker when I was a child. Indeed I was quite the antithesis of a talker. I was extremely shy (my mom has told me that I would burst into tears if someone said "hi" to me or just looked my way; only my parents and one favorite uncle were "allowed" to carry me, or I'd really cry). I just really did not like talking and it wasn't until I was a junior in college that I started to raise my hand to answer questions. (In other words, I spent years and years desperately hoping that I wouldn't be called on.) And, when I did start to try to volunteer answers to questions, from the moment I raised my hand my heart would be beating doubly or triply fast, my face and palms got hot, my stomach caved, and by the time when (if) I got called, I started by mumbling out something incoherent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In college, I was an editor for an "alternative newspaper." Many member of the staff were much more verbally dexterous than me and I suspect that trying to keep up with them during regular all-nighters to get the paper out honed my own ability to talk. Jim hails from the part of (northern) New Jersey where many of those college friend were from, so I guess you could say I've had many more years to finesse my verbal sparring skills, and teaching students from the age of middle school teaches one to be quick on one's feet, and with words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe some of this is why, while always wishing that Charlie was able to talk more (how different things would be if he could just tell us what bothered him at school), I've often felt that, talking or not, he's always communicating something, even if in fragments and bits of words and sounds. And so I had a bit of an odd feeling about some things in a recent &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=fact-or-fiction-dogs-can-talk"&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt; article about whether or not dogs can talk.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The general consensus among scientists is that some dogs can do a pretty good job mimicking the sounds that humans make, but whether or not they are really saying "I love you" (&lt;i&gt;"Ahh rooo uuu!"&lt;/i&gt;) and meaning it, is not likely. Rather, a dog may have learned to make those certain sounds (&lt;i&gt;"Ahh rooo uuu!"&lt;/i&gt;/"I love you") at certain moments (after getting the Science Diet). (Sorry if that was a bit flippant; we don't have a dog and Charlie continues to keep a healthy distance between &lt;i&gt;optimus amicus hominis&lt;/i&gt; and himself; hearing a dog barking while he's on his bike has been known to make him get off the bike, put down the kickstand, and start running.) (Yes, Jim is following close by.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=fact-or-fiction-dogs-can-talk"&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt; article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's more appropriate to call it imitating than talking, says Gary Lucas, a visiting scholar in &lt;a href="http://psych.indiana.edu/"&gt;psychology at Indiana University Bloomington&lt;/a&gt;. Dogs vocalize with each other to convey emotions—and they express their emotions by varying their tones, he says. So it pays for dogs to be sensitive to different tones. Dogs are able to imitate humans as well as they do because they pick up on the differences in our tonal patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas likens this behavior to that of bonobos, primates that can imitate some tonal patterns, including vowel sounds, pitch changes, and rhythms, studies show. "The vocal skills of some of the dogs and cats on YouTube suggest that they might also have some selective tonal imitation skills," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's happening between dog and owner-turned-voice-coach is fairly straightforward, [&lt;a href="http://www.stanleycoren.com/"&gt;Stanley] Coren&lt;/a&gt; says: Owner hears the dog making a sound that resembles a phrase, says the phrase back to the dog, who then repeats the sound and is rewarded with a treat. Eventually the dog learns a modified version of her original sound. As Lucas puts it, "dogs have limited vocal imitation skills, so these sounds usually need to be shaped by selective attention and social reward."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Letterman video "a pug says, 'I love you' and it's very cute, but the pug has no idea what it means," Coren says. "If dogs could talk, they would tell you, 'I'm just in it for the cookies.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And certainly what do people think of when behavioral science---ABA, the basis of Charlie's education since he was 2---is mentioned? Yes, Pavlov's dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving criticisms of ABA as "dog training" aside (done right, it is nothing of the sort), Charlie's learning to talk followed similar steps. He learned to imitate and then to imitate sounds. As he struggled with apraxia, his articulation of syllables and sounds (and so of words) was very unclear; Charlie's "I love you" was just as likely to sound like "Ahh rooo uuu." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe I'm reading too much into his words, but I do think he knows what he means when he says that phrase.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246174352991"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10900970.post-3083746093409334850">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bfbdb6c9346ad5d1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Martial Arts Retardedness</title><published>2009-06-28T04:06:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-28T04:06:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2009/06/martial-arts-retardedness.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/" type="html">You must watch this video.  It's from 2006, something called the "Pathgate Summer Retreat".  We'll talk after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/KJr2BdUTYkU%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok?  Now, firstly, did you get through the whole thing?  I know, it's hard because it's so goddamn stupid, but it shows a really nice parallel between martial arts believers and faith healer believers.  When you get people who believe in you, they'll do whatever it takes to keep the myth alive.  &lt;i&gt;"Oh, you're a lama?  Cool.  You can throw people around and make them bounce like monkeys with your special lama energy?  Cool.  Oh, like those people...I see.  Well, sure, I guess I'll try...I mean, there's been so many bouncing around already, it can't hurt."&lt;/i&gt;  And off you go.  Stupid belief, a couple true believers, mutual reinforcement, closed off from mainstream society.  That's a recipe for...wait for it....&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/mDKEG4j3NKc%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;Benny Hinn!  Aren't the similarities interesting?  I know, this one was harder to get through, even with the annoying, chanty, brain-washing "hallelujah" muted.  There are a couple of things to notice about Hinn, however, as he's working with a very large audience and has to find the believers that will most persuasively make his case for everyone else.  He's a professional, after all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check out how he finds a live one at about the one minute mark and gets his ushers to grab him so Benny can fuck with him in front of the crowd.  That gets everyone else primed to know what to do when Hinn waves his arms in front of them.  Then he takes the three true believers up on stage so everyone can see.  It's nice that he's got his ushers trained to fall and convulse when his arm waves happen to pass by them.  It's sweet, really.  By the 3:45 mark, he's not even putting effort into it anymore; the overweight couple just get nonchalantly dropped twice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok, skip ahead (if you didn't watch it all yet) to about 5:45 and watch him drop what looks like the choir.  Well, all except for the one guy in front row who, apparently, wasn't on script.  He won't be back next show (although I'm assuming that because there was a translator telling them what to do - i.e. hold hands - he's probably a local there for his wife or something).  Near the end of the clip (around 9:18 or so), he tries to drop a group on stage and a man and a woman don't fall.  Hinn does his usual grab-the-motherfucker-by-the-face routine he pulls out when folks don't fall, but he's a believer so he falls easily.  The woman next to him just sort of sways backwards and doesn't go all the way down.  I guess the "FIRE" didn't fully flow over her....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These two embarrassing videos are a testament to the gullibility of our species and our desire to believe what feels good, to our eventual detriment.  Benny Hinn steals money from these people for what amounts to a couple hours of "entertainment".  The crappy part is that the people in these clips lose so much more than their money - they lose what is overlooked when the shruggies&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; say, &lt;i&gt;"What's the harm?"&lt;/i&gt;.  They lose their ability to &lt;a href="http://www.noah.org/science/reason.html"&gt;detect baloney&lt;/a&gt;, and that can cause untold amounts of harm, like to that woman who went the "lama" for her back pain and was up "throwing" students around afterwards.  I'd be interested in seeing her the next week....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. &lt;b&gt;Shruggie&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;(noun): a person who doesn’t care about the science versus pseudoscience debate. When presented with descriptions of exaggerated or fraudulent health claims or practices, their response is to shrug. Shruggies are fairly inert, they will not argue the merits (or lack thereof) of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) or pseudoscience in general. They simply aren’t all that interested in the discussion, and are somewhat puzzled by those who are.&lt;/i&gt;  From &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=238"&gt;Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, proponents have touted the benefits of embryonic stem cell research, but the potential therapies still face hurdles. Side effects such as tumor development, a lack of an effective and long-term animal model to test new therapies, and genetic incompatibility between the host and donor cells are some of the problems faced by researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists at the University of Missouri have developed the ability to take regular cells from a pig’s connective tissues, known as fibroblasts, and transform them into stem cells, eliminating several of these hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090626191301.htm"&gt;Platypus Helps Illuminate Ovarian Cancer&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Adelaide geneticist, Dr Frank Grutzner says DNA mapping of the platypus has uncovered an interesting relationship between their sex chromosomes and DNA sequences found in human ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve identified DNA on the sex chromosomes of the platypus that is similar to the DNA that is affected in ovarian cancer and other diseases of reproduction like male infertility,” Dr Grutzner says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited by the fact that the analysis of the platypus genome gives us new directions in investigating the molecular basis of ovarian cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

the nonsense-syllable chant at the end of Michael Jackson's &lt;em&gt;Wanna Be Startin Somethin&lt;/em&gt; back to its roots in Manu Dibango's &lt;em&gt;Soul Makossa&lt;/em&gt;, a 1973 Cameroonian hit that played a role in the origins of disco in New York City. The chants in these songs are nice examples of a phenomenon that I discussed a couple of years ago ("&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005154.html"&gt;Rock syncopation: stress shifts or polyrhythms?&lt;/a&gt;", 11/26/2007), where linguistic accents and musical beats start off aligned at the beginning of a phrase, and then go out of sync, typically with one or more of the later textual accents shifted "to the left", i.e. ahead in time, relative to the apparent musical beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Soul Makossa&lt;/em&gt;, the basic background rhythm has a period of 16 units of about 1/8 second each, with a drumbeat on 1, 5, and 13; a stronger accent on 9; and upbeats on 4 and 12. (Beats 2 and 6 are weaker and are omitted in some repetitions of the pattern.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Makossa1.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Makossa1.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowed down by a factor of two, it sounds like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a simplified schematic form, we could represent it as something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;X&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;x&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;X&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;x&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;x&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;X&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, this can be interpreted as a fairly vanilla form of 4/4 time, with the 16 minimal time units notated as 16th notes, and the quarter-note pulse on 1, 5, 9, 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Makossa1c.mp3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dibango's language, Duala, probably doesn't have anything that corresponds to English stress, but (at least to the ears of a native English speaker) the refrain seems to be accented as "ma ma KO, ma ma SA, ma ko MA ko SA", and so according to the traditional norms of European tune-text alignment, where accented syllables line up with stronger musical beats, you'd expect to see the four most strongly accented syllables lining up with the quarter-note beat, i.e. on the 16th-notes 1, 5, 9, and 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s where the first three end up — but not the final SA, which ends up one 16th-note earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schematically,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;15&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;16&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;3&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;4&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;5&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;6&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;7&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;ma&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;ko&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;MA&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;ko&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;SA&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At half speed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Jackson&amp;#39;s version of the chant has one fewer syllables, but still four perceptible accents: &amp;quot;ma ma SE ma ma SA ma MA ku SA&amp;quot;. And the background percussion has four square beats per bar. But only the first two of the chant&amp;#39;s accents align with the quarter-note beat — on 1 and 5 of the 16 implicit time-units. And the others line up in two (mostly alternating) different ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schematically, the first alignment is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;X&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;X&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;X&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;X&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ma&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ma&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ma&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ma&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SA&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ma&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;MA&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ku&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SA&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(ma&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ma&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the second one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;X&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;X&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;X&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;X&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ma&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ma&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ma&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ma&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SA&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ma&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;MA&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ku&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SA&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(ma&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ma&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two versions at half speed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that Michael Jackson's first alignment divides the measure into the series of time intervals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2+1+1)+(2+1)+(2+1)+4+2 =&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4+3+3+4+2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is a cyclically permuted version of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clave_%28rhythm%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;son&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;clave&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: 3+3+4+2+4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the second alignment has the interval sequence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2+1+1)+(2+1)+(2+2)+3+2 =&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4+3+4+3+2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is a similarly-rotated version of the &lt;em&gt;rumba clave&lt;/em&gt; 3+4+3+2+4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should emphasize my opinion, explained at greater length &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005154.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005166.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, that the key to understanding text-setting in African-influenced popular music — which is most of the music of the past century or so — is to recognize that the underlying metrical pattern is often not just a regular beat created by hierarchical binary or ternary subdivisions, but rather something more like the habanera or the son. On this view, the &amp;quot;syncopations&amp;quot; are not just random interesting shifts of accents &amp;quot;off the beat&amp;quot; in performance, but are rather accents placed &amp;quot;on the beat&amp;quot; relative to a different rhythmic pattern (of which several may be going on in parallel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have any larger point to make about this, for now — but I think this stuff is interesting and deserves further study. Of course, it makes more sense to look at English lyrics where we know where the lexical stresses are — it&amp;#39;s plausible to doubt my perceptions of accent patterns in these chants. But I enjoyed listening to the examples that Ben brought up yesterday, and I thought the metrical details were worth a post.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246159356995"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2535">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9d97fc50b6c95189</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Time for a cordon sanitaire?</title><published>2009-06-27T23:22:06Z</published><updated>2009-06-27T23:22:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/x9jj2SJCvk4/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Anthony Cox</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246159356995"><id gr:original-id="fKlwSynj3RGeI1v_PhJ3AQ_1e5fc8325476ff057bc99c588c56cc0c">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/de7816bc03efb699</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">‘Waterless’ washing machine cleans using nylon beads</title><published>2009-06-27T22:12:12Z</published><updated>2009-06-27T22:12:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.gizmag.com/xeros-washing-machine/12088/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Hmm...

We talked mainly about science journalism, but also about journalism in general, about the future of the book, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Dave's half of the file got broken beyond repair, so the show never aired. I kept my half of the file and did not really know what to do with it. So, recently I downloaded Audacity and tried my hand at editing the audio part of the file, trying to cut out the silences (during which Dave was talking) and dialogues that would be intelligible without Dave's part of the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the very first part, just a brief (1 minute and 38 seconds) introduction to myself and my job. Thus, my very first podcast, which (after popular vote on FriendFeed decided) will be called ClockCast. I will try to find some time (as I am learning to tackle Audacity!) to edit and post the rest of the file in the near future (I am not, for now, promising any kind of regularity for posting these, until I feel comfortable with the medium and the technology):&lt;/p&gt;

Having posted about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/2_new_genetics_studies"&gt;two new genetic studies&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, here is, somewhat as a coda, &lt;a href="http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(09)00449-8"&gt;one more&lt;/a&gt;. This one is from &lt;a href="http://www.cell.com/"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt; and is not, strictly speaking, about autism as generally discussed on this blog, but about autism in mice. From the &lt;a href="http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(09)00449-8"&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substantial evidence suggests that chromosomal abnormalities contribute to the risk of autism. The duplication of human chromosome 15q11-13 is known to be the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality in autism. We have modeled this genetic change in mice by using chromosome engineering to generate a 6.3 Mb duplication of the conserved linkage group on mouse chromosome 7. Mice with a paternal duplication display poor social interaction, behavioral inflexibility, abnormal ultrasonic vocalizations, and correlates of anxiety. An increased MBII52 snoRNA within the duplicated region, affecting the serotonin 2c receptor (5-HT2cR), correlates with altered intracellular Ca2+ responses elicited by a 5-HT2cR agonist in neurons of mice with a paternal duplication. This chromosome-engineered mouse model for autism seems to replicate various aspects of human autistic phenotypes and validates the relevance of the human chromosome abnormality. This model will facilitate forward genetics of developmental brain disorders and serve as an invaluable tool for therapeutic development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also see the write-up from the June 26th &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/60-second-science/post.cfm?id=changing-a-chromosome-makes-mice-au-2009-06-26"&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The autism-like traits idenfied in the mice are, again: "poor social interaction, behavioral inflexibility, abnormal ultrasonic vocalizations, and correlates of anxiety." While these are aspects of autism in humans, there's a bit more too it than "abnormal" communications (if I'm interpreting that one right) and certainly anxiety and inflexibility are associated with other conditions besides autism. And so the question: Is autism in mice the same as it is in humans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one more, keeping in mind &lt;a href="http://www.jkp.com/catalogue/book.php/isbn/9781843104810"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; about cats and Asperger's Syndrome: Does autism exist in animals? &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246144502810"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticblog.org/?p=3123">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/df62b221833377a2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Crytpozoology"/><category term="Journalism"/><category term="Superstitions"/><category term="TV Entertainment"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Urban Legends"/><category term="pseudoscience"/><category term="skepticism"/><title type="html">Shunnnnnnnnnnnnnnn</title><published>2009-06-27T22:56:50Z</published><updated>2009-06-27T22:56:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/06/27/charlie-the-unicorn/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.skepticblog.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Charlie" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Charlie1.jpg" alt="Charlie" width="300" height="169"&gt;Don’t worry too much about believing in unicorns or whether or not they have wings for a moment or two. Better to check out the skeptical adventures of an unsure cartoon character whose critical thinking dilemmas have to be heard to be believed. I’m taking a break this week folks. Time to chill and laugh at the craziness that we skeptical folks feel sheeting over us like fast running lava.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sincere thanks to Susan Gerbic and her two kids Stirling and Caspian for opening my tired skeptical third eye. We need something like Charlie in our universe! If you aren’t already connected to Jason Steele’s tongue in cheek episodes 1, 2,and 3; immediately go to &lt;a href="http://www.charlietheunicorn.com"&gt;www.charlietheunicorn.com&lt;/a&gt; and get with it. Charlie is my new hero. Who else do we have in contemporary society that dispels myths and superstitions with a Bronx accent and lives in a fairytale world of pastel colors? I’m advocating for Charlie to become the official mascot of the Skeptologists. I would really like to see this kind of satirical social comment woven into the fabric of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already know about Charlie, you will also know what I mean when I say that I sometimes feel like him. Don’t you?  I’m frequently surrounded by woo and forever drawn against my will into the insidious vortex that it spreads – whether or not I want to become involved. Everywhere I turn some lunatic is trying to sell me a charm to ward off evil spirits and now the self-appointed “paranormal investigators” among us are trying to push a new agenda to further twist and spin their version of ghost hunting by marketing a &lt;em&gt;“Dangers of the Paranormal”&lt;/em&gt; website. &lt;a href="http://www.thedotpproject.com"&gt;www.thedotpproject.com&lt;/a&gt;. They are offering their services and admonish,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Investigating the paranormal can be hazardous to your health. It can follow you home and destroy your life. TV doesn’t tell you that. So we will.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:100px"&gt;&lt;img title="MV5BMTI5MDIxNTg3OV5BMl5Bghostbusters" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/MV5BMTI5MDIxNTg3OV5BMl5Bghostbusters.jpg" alt="Hello Again, I&amp;#39;m baaaack... for real." width="90" height="90"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Again, I&amp;#39;m baaaack... for real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uhhh, thanks guys, but what does something like that cost and what kind of skeptical protocols do you have set in place to guide you? Or are the blind merely guiding the blinder? With this ridiculous new angle of hucksterism, we find those gullible enough to believe in the reality of ghost hunting slipping deeper and deeper into a glossy commercialized world of darkness that allows the most outrageous theories and un-scientific claptrap to masquerade as some sort of honorable and accepted social service program. Truly, Ivan Reitman’s “Ghost Busters” (1983) have finally arrived – for real!  Dunning and Shermer’s recent “punked” experience with the Shirley Ghostman Experience was pure Charlie: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charlie &lt;/strong&gt;(groans) “Oh, God, you guys. This had better  &lt;br&gt;
be pretty freaking’ important. Is the meadow on fire?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our meadow &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;on fire. But as the world snooozes on some still manage to keep smiling. If we can all just lighten up for a few minutes, that would be good medicine for everybody (alternative though it may be.) Humor is the great leveler and Jason and his cohorts at FilmCow have captured the ennui that might be a real problem if you happen to be the thinking person’s unicorn. Yes Randi, unicorns do exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie the Unicorn is a series of viral videos that at last count continue to be viewed by more than &lt;strong&gt;50 million people.&lt;/strong&gt; And yes again, Charlie and his adventures carry a wry skeptical message to beware of the woo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And we can’t get a single episode of The Skeptologists on the boards.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this tell us about Charlie and his magical adventures? What should this be telling us about viral marketing and the skeptical movement? The average person probably thinks Charlie is just plain weird, but the underlying cynicism to things wooish gets relayed in a palatable manner just the same: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charlie:&lt;/strong&gt; “Alright guys, you do know that there’s no actual candy mountain, right?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other unicorns reply:&lt;/strong&gt; “Shun the nonbeliever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s hope for all of us who are frustrated and exhausted with trying to push this big stone called critical thinking up the ever slippery Sisyphean Candy Mountain slope. Don’t stick a banana in your ear, watch these short flash videos on contemporary society  – and pass it on. We need all the help we can get; even if it comes from a unicorn.&lt;/p&gt;

I felt disgust, repulsion and hatred, but I couldn&amp;#39;t immediately figure out why it bothered me so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise is pretty simple, as you'd expect from a Mens' Magazine. Scientists do some of the coolest things in the world, yet they don't get the recognition of their rock star peers. So why not set up a kind of weird cultural-exchange buddy system, where scientists pose with rockstars? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, what's the logic here? It's eerily reminiscent of the first days of the Blair administration in the late 90s, when a succession of rock stars were invited to Number 10 for... well nobody really knows what for. Is the rock-stariness supposed to somehow rub off on the hapless scientists? Is coolness contagious? How does standing someone next to a rock star in any way promote them or their profession?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I spoke to some fellow writers and spent some moments in quiet contemplation of the pictures. Ah, the pictures. Here's one of them now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/sheryl.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rock star, in case you were wondering, is the one in the middle. Sheryl Crowe her name is, and she is unquestionably cool. The other two, the ones who are fawning over the guitar-wielding goddess, are the scientists. As &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/06/how_gq_got_it_all_backwards.php"&gt;test-tube-wielding goddess Dr. Isis notes&lt;/a&gt;, images like this promote rock stars, not scientists. Crowe's expression isn't one of respect, it's saying: &lt;i&gt;"Who are these losers, and why do they have to stand so close to me?"&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact it's hard to look at the picture and not imagine that you're watching 'first contact' taking place between two species on some even-lower-budget version of Star Trek. Things look to be going reasonably well, but one of the suit-wearing aliens appears to have stolen the blonde alien's guitar pick, and it's probably only a matter of time before the phasers come out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/seal.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get a similar effect from Seal. Here, the photographer artfully plays on racial stereotypes by having Seal pose with a menacing expression, holding the microphone cable as though he's about to strangle somebody with it while the two clever white folk cower in the background. The one of the left bravely does an impression of Seal, with a pose that may get him further fame on a laxatives commercial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being serious for a moment, let's just look at the statistics here. GQ assembled 11 scientists, and 5 rock stars. Of the rock stars, two are black, one is a woman. Of the scientists, 11 are middle-aged white males. For a campaign that wants to attract new young people into science in a country where around half of young people are women and probably nearly half are from ethnic minorities, that's just moronic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, okay, you've got your middle-aged white guys in suits into the studio and you're ready to take some photos that promote science. It doesn't take a marketing genius to tell you that the scientists should be in the centre, and the rockstars should be fawning over them. I'll repeat the words of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/06/how_gq_got_it_all_backwards.php"&gt;Dr. Isis&lt;/a&gt; here because she's right and I'm too lazy to bother rewriting it in my own words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems to me that if you want to have an effective campaign then what you do is put Sheryl Crow in a lab coat and take pictures of those guys teaching her to pipet or culture some cells or use a microscope.  Don't take pictures of talented, gifted scientists -- scientists whose talents make them as unique and talented as the rockstars they are pictured with -- trying to be musicians.  Take a picture of a musician aspiring to be a scientist."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase Marvin the Android, it hurts to think down to the level of the guy that put these photos together. &lt;/p&gt;

This one I thought I'd share with readers of DC.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The name of the person who wrote to me is Esteban Roth from Newport Beach, CA. What he wrote is in quotes below.&lt;blockquote&gt;Kudos on the book and blog. Thus far you've been the ONLY author to convince a number of friends and acquaintances to reassess their beliefs. That you caused such a challenge for them is remarkable considering that Dawkins, Hitchens, and Russell provided my pals with no uncertainty!&lt;/blockquote&gt;Really!? That's fantastic! Please spread the word.&lt;blockquote&gt;What is also surprising me about your book is that I have yet to see a reputable Christian blog or 'name' attack it (there may have been some but I haven't seen them). Groups like Reformation21 and Justin Taylor's &lt;em&gt;Between Two Worlds &lt;/em&gt;have been silent regarding you. Which is both surprising and not. Surprising in that the Reformed tradition prides themself on being intellectually superior and having a ready response. No mention of you by D.A. Carson, the Westminster Theological Seminary crew, Albert Mohler, etc. Not surprising in that they seem to avoid serious threats to the faith by either ignoring the threats or engaging in strawman tactics (see the treatment of Peter Enns and Kenton Sparks).&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'm not really well-known, that's probably why. My book is scheduled for review in the &lt;em&gt;London Times Literary Supplement&lt;/em&gt; though, so they won't be able to ignore it for long. ;-)&lt;blockquote&gt;My question: Are you surprised that the Reformed crowd is ignoring you thus far? (By 'Reformed Crowd' I mean those who have degrees, teaching positions, and some level of 'fame' in the theological world...not their delusional fans whose education consists of apologetics books and nothing more.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;My book is being used in both Christian and secular college classes on atheism and apologetics. Still, I'm rather unknown at this point. We'll see in the future.&lt;blockquote&gt;I think you DESERVE their attention as you have the best contemporary critique around. I'd be interested in how someone like Timothy Keller, K. Scott Oliphint, D.A. Carson or Carl Trueman would respond to your work. Unfortunately, I can imagine their underwhelming response (despite the mentioned men being rather intelligent).&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thanks so much! Silence can sometimes be the best response. I think this is the real reason William Lane Craig won't debate me, because by doing so it would make people aware of me and my book, which he just doesn't want to do. Maybe it's just better not to let people know of it. Dinesh D'Souza got my book and read it when it first came out in August. He told me he was planning on writing a review of it. But the last I heard from him about it in September he said "it contained some new thoughtful stuff I hadn't considered before," and he never wrote that review! Again, silence can sometimes be the best response. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are Christians who are responding by personally attacking me, however. These believers never actually engage my arguments. It's as if they can't deal with them so they think attacking me is the next best thing. One Christian just recently nitpicked at a small detail and made a big deal about it without also dealing with the case I presented in a particular chapter. Big deal. To him I say nitpick away if it makes you feel better.&lt;blockquote&gt;Your book is quite popular at the local library here in Newport Beach, CA. It's often checked out and with several hold requests following it. And some people are fond of putting your book in the center of the "Atheist" section at the local Barnes and Noble. It's often blocking other books in the "Religious" section as well! Small moves that show people are interested in and promoting you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Well, isn't that interesting!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Thanks for writing. Let me know how your friends are dealing with my book. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Best,&lt;br&gt;John W. Loftus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-5127659303676880953?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosetta Stone claim they are used by NASA and the US Army, and that their method “unlocks your natural ability to learn a language.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having taught Applied Linguistics, teaching linguistics to teachers who teach language, I’d have to say that the claims  made by Rosetta Stone are overstated for the most part, but it’s what they &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; say that consumers need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin:5px" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Rosetta-Stone-software.jpg" alt="Rosetta Stone software" width="216" height="216"&gt;Rosetta Stone, Berlitz, etc. are Computer-Assisted Language Learning programs. These companies claim their products can be used as stand-alone methods for learning a second language. However, I would say that they would be most useful as a tool used in conjunction with face-to-face classes. NASA and the US Army might well use Rosetta Stone, but this software would be complementary to classes. The US Military use organizations like the &lt;a href="http://www.miis.edu/"&gt;Monterey Institute of International Studies&lt;/a&gt; for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that a student couldn’t develop skills in a second language solely through software, although autonomous learning makes the task considerably more onerous. It’s not comprehensive learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosetta Stone reviewers &lt;a href="http://www-writing.berkeley.edu/chorus/call/reviews/archives/rosettagerm.html"&gt;Donald McRae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www-writing.berkeley.edu/chorus/call/reviews/rosetta_russian/index.html"&gt;Mark Kaiser&lt;/a&gt; see some limited pedagogical value in the software. However, they both encountered linguistic errors in the software, culturally inaccurate information, an English-language bias, and a lack of conversational instruction. Hmm…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer &lt;em&gt;assisted&lt;/em&gt; learning is all good and well, but Rosetta Stone also claim they offer &lt;em&gt;accelerated&lt;/em&gt; learning – and this is utter codswallop… Learning a second language is subject to the student’s effort or lack thereof -  it can take several hundred hours to develop a basic vocabulary, pronunciation and the foundational elements of grammar. It takes many hundreds more to become fluent in a second language. (The saying is ‘about 800 hours’, but this depends on the quality of learning.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The myriad of “Speak in a Week” books and websites make for catchy titles, but this is marketing, not reality. If you’re parachuted into Russia with one of these books, by the end of the week you’d still only be able to order a vodka, find the Kremlin, and swear at a few people in Ruski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claims would be far less amazing if they called the books by the more fitting titles: “Learn how to speak ten words in French, conjugate the copula and make some clumsy attempts to mimic the French accent in a week”, or, “Learn Swahili in 128 weeks”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accelerated language-learning courses are a bit like supposed speed-reading. If you ’speed read’ you’ll only pick up key words and concepts; and if you speed learn you’ll speed forget.&lt;img style="margin:5px" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Rosetta-Stone-217x300.jpg" alt="another Rosetta Stone" width="195" height="270"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important factor in learning a second language is motivation; economic, political or personal factors are likely to influence your drive to learn, and the speed with which you learn. For example, do you need to learn English because you’ve moved to a foreign country, you’re immersed in English, but can’t speak or understand it and won’t find work without it? Do you need to learn French fast because the only language you and your boyfriend speak is the lingua franca of love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosetta Stone’s claim that their product “Unlocks your natural ability to learn language” is a marketing euphemism for ‘humans have the evolved ability to create, learn and produce language – now get off your arse and learn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply, there’s nothing quick and easy about acquiring a second language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These (expensive) programs can be somewhat useful, if you do in fact &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; them… a lot, over time, and only as an aid.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Karen Stollznow</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246134340012"><id gr:original-id="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=344">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e361516fb12b9e2a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><category term="General"/><category term="Human Rights"/><title type="html">Beyond Awareness at USD</title><published>2009-06-27T20:00:55Z</published><updated>2009-06-27T20:00:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=344" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the end of this past week, I was fortunate to be invited back to the &lt;a href="http://www.sandiego.edu/soles/centers/autism_institute/conferences/index.php"&gt;USD Summer Austism Institue&lt;/a&gt; to participate in a presentation with other &lt;a href="http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/"&gt;Autism-Hub&lt;/a&gt; bloggers. The most memorable couple of hours for me, without a doubt, were the ones spent at dinner on San Diego Harbor with fellow bloggers Steve D (&lt;a href="http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/"&gt;One Dad’s Opinion&lt;/a&gt;) and Bev (&lt;a href="http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/"&gt;Asperger Square 8&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://autismstreet.org/images/blog/2009jun/usd_ipj.jpg" alt="University of San Diego"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At USD, and with some updated content, we were given the opportunity to talk about the &lt;a href="http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/"&gt;Autism-Hub&lt;/a&gt;. Steve D provided some background about the hub and blogging in general, as well as opening with some excellent selected pieces (my humble opinion of course):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=161"&gt;A Little Left Rudder&lt;/a&gt; (video)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/10/best-story-ever.html"&gt;The Best Story Ever&lt;/a&gt; (reading)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/03/i-am-joes-functioning-label.html"&gt;I am Joe’s Functioning Label&lt;/a&gt; (reading)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=682"&gt;Dear Dr. Kartzinel&lt;/a&gt; (video)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I was given the opportunity to talk about a few different subjects. As I’ve &lt;a href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=189"&gt;done in the past&lt;/a&gt;, I’d like to add some notes here, to several things mentioned - five minutes each, for a few different topics, just doesn’t leave sufficient time to cover the relevant original articles and referenced material. Although I did not dig into the science this time, I did mention that I’d been writing about hyperbaric oxygen as an autism treatment (Autism Street and Left Brain/Right Brain) - you can find links to those articles and recent commentary at BMC Pediatrics at the following link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=331"&gt;Mild HBOT For Autism - A Brief Skeptical Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I noted that place in Arizona where it snows “special snow for autistic children” every year. The original post this is based on can be found at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=323"&gt;Snow! Baby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following that, I very briefly presented some autism “epidemic” mythology. Firstly noting &lt;a href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=333"&gt;media mentions&lt;/a&gt; of one California study from earlier this year, I followed by presenting the graphs from the Autism Street original article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=297"&gt;California’s Invisible Autism Epidemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As promised, source data for my graphs can be found at the following links (the USDE data is available and free to the public). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re one of the many educators who attended the conference, and would prefer to have a copy of my spreadsheet with the data, graphs, and relevant links included, simply send me an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I had an opportunity to discuss “Autism and Divorce” mythology with the audience. Content from this portion of my presentation was derived from the original article at &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/index.php"&gt;Left Brain/Right Brain&lt;/a&gt; about the Easter Seals Living With Autism study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1943"&gt;Autism And Divorce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as mentioned, a link to the actual study (and some additional details) are provided there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of my short presentations, we had time for a very short audience-included activity about inclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following these things, it was my pleasure to introduce Autism-Hub blogger Bev from &lt;a href="http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/"&gt;Asperger Square 8&lt;/a&gt;. Bev started by providing a riveting multi-media presentation that carefully dissects misrepresentation of human beings by so-called “autism advocates” (from the use damaging words and descriptions to the prevalence of that god-damned puzzle piece). Then, she clearly illustrates the problem with the hijacking of autism conversation. She notes the relentless irrelevancy, but most importantly, the implications of missing what really needs to be discussed amongst the cacophony of bombardments focused on cause/cure and in the name of “awareness”. Just a few of the important things that are often lost in the din?  Inclusion, the use of restraints, appropriate supports and accomodations, and employment for adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a parent or an educator/professional (and besides simply reading her blog), if you ever have the opportunity to catch a presentation by Bev, I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the last day, we were given the opportunity to participate in a panel discussion with the audience. During that segment, I mentioned the TED talk about “The Hole In The Wall Project”. You can find that video here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=209"&gt;One Reason Inclusion Matters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for now. I’d certainly like to extend a heartfelt “thank you” to Steve D and Bev for welcoming me as a co-presenter, and of course, our particpation at USD wouldn’t have been possible without the support and opportunity extended to us by USD’s School of Leadership and Education Sciences, Anne Donnellan, Ph.D., and Jodi Robledo, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The more TV on DVD, podcasts and torrent technology separate me from the traditional television/radio experience, the less relevant the ads seem to me.   Which makes me wonder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does advertising have any influence over your spending habits?  Has it become completely irrelevant?  Which direction do you see the market shifting to adapt to changes in media consumption?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

was a joke.  (Sadly, it wasn’t.  Well, not in the conventional meaning of “joke”.)  Now, from reader Joe, I learn that a hospital in Australia is planning to use acupuncture in emergency departments to treat acute migraine, back pain and ankle injuries after its “success in lowering pain levels in patients attending a busy public hospital”.  What was this “success”, you ask?  This is the &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/acupuncture-gets-trial-in-casualty-20090625-cya5.html"&gt;description of the pilot study&lt;/a&gt;, as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr Parker said patients who turned up at casualty were given the option to be treated by final year or graduate acupuncture students from RMIT in conjunction with standard medical treatment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Regular readers will have no problems seeing the problems with this study, and the reasons that it does not show that acupuncture does anything, which are:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not randomized&lt;/strong&gt; – participants self-select to receive acupuncture, meaning that probably only those who start off believing it will do something, will be included in the trial. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No blinding&lt;/strong&gt; – participants know which group they were in (acupuncture or no acupuncture).&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No sham acupuncture&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standard medical procedures were used&lt;/strong&gt; in addition to acupuncture – so patients received the benefits of pain medication that actually works in addition to the magic needles. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And yet on the basis of this patently useless pilot study, more than $400,000 (Australian) has been allocated for a three-year clinical trial.  This despite the fact that we know acupuncture is a placebo that provides &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2009/05/19/acupuncture-penetration-needles.html"&gt;no difference in pain intensity&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, yet another useless acupuncture pilot study followed by (undoubtedly) another useless acupuncture study.  And after that, you can bet that yet “more studies” will be called for.  I’d put money on it.&lt;/p&gt;

I felt disgust, repulsion and hatred, but I couldn&amp;#39;t immediately figure out why it bothered me so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise is pretty simple, as you'd expect from a Mens' Magazine. Scientists do some of the coolest things in the world, yet they don't get the recognition of their rock star peers. So why not set up a kind of weird cultural-exchange buddy system, where scientists pose with rockstars? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, what's the logic here? It's eerily reminiscent of the first days of the Blair administration in the late 90s, when a succession of rock stars were invited to Number 10 for... well nobody really knows what for. Is the rock-stariness supposed to somehow rub off on the hapless scientists? Is coolness contagious? How does standing someone next to a rock star in any way promote them or their profession?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I spoke to some fellow writers and spent some moments in quiet contemplation of the pictures. Ah, the pictures. Here's one of them now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/sheryl.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rock star, in case you were wondering, is the one in the middle. Sheryl Crowe her name is, and she is unquestionably cool. The other two, the ones who are fawning over the guitar-wielding goddess, are the scientists. As &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/06/how_gq_got_it_all_backwards.php"&gt;test-tube-wielding goddess Dr. Isis notes&lt;/a&gt;, images like this promote rock stars, not scientists. Crowe's expression isn't one of respect, it's saying: &lt;i&gt;"Who are these losers, and why do they have to stand so close to me?"&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact it's hard to look at the picture and not imagine that you're watching 'first contact' taking place between two species on some even-lower-budget version of Star Trek. Things look to be going reasonably well, but one of the suit-wearing aliens appears to have stolen the blonde alien's guitar pick, and it's probably only a matter of time before the phasers come out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/seal.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get a similar effect from Seal. Here, the photographer artfully plays on racial stereotypes by having Seal pose with a menacing expression, holding the microphone cable as though he's about to strangle somebody with it while the two clever white folk cower in the background. The one of the left bravely does an impression of Seal, with a pose that may get him further fame on a laxatives commercial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being serious for a moment, let's just look at the statistics here. GQ assembled 11 scientists, and 5 rock stars. Of the rock stars, two are black, one is a woman. Of the scientists, 11 are middle-aged white males. For a campaign that wants to attract new young people into science in a country where around half of young people are women and probably nearly half are from ethnic minorities, that's just moronic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, okay, you've got your middle-aged white guys in suits into the studio and you're ready to take some photos that promote science. It doesn't take a marketing genius to tell you that the scientists should be in the centre, and the rockstars should be fawning over them. I'll repeat the words of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/06/how_gq_got_it_all_backwards.php"&gt;Dr. Isis&lt;/a&gt; here because she's right and I'm too lazy to bother rewriting it in my own words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems to me that if you want to have an effective campaign then what you do is put Sheryl Crow in a lab coat and take pictures of those guys teaching her to pipet or culture some cells or use a microscope.  Don't take pictures of talented, gifted scientists -- scientists whose talents make them as unique and talented as the rockstars they are pictured with -- trying to be musicians.  Take a picture of a musician aspiring to be a scientist."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase Marvin the Android, it hurts to think down to the level of the guy that put these photos together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rock star, in case you were wondering, is the one in the middle. Sheryl Crowe her name is, and she is unquestionably cool. The other two, the ones who are fawning over the guitar-wielding goddess, are the scientists. As &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/06/how_gq_got_it_all_backwards.php"&gt;test-tube-wielding goddess Dr. Isis notes&lt;/a&gt;, images like this promote rock stars, not scientists. Crowe's expression isn't one of respect, it's saying: &lt;i&gt;"Who are these losers, and why do they have to stand so close to me?"&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact it's hard to look at the picture and not imagine that you're watching 'first contact' taking place between two species on some even-lower-budget version of Star Trek. Things look to be going reasonably well, but one of the suit-wearing aliens appears to have stolen the blonde alien's guitar pick, and it's probably only a matter of time before the phasers come out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/seal.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get a similar effect from Seal. Here, the photographer artfully plays on racial stereotypes by having Seal pose with a menacing expression, holding the microphone cable as though he's about to strangle somebody with it while the two clever white folk cower in the background. The one of the left bravely does an impression of Seal, with a pose that may get him further fame on a laxatives commercial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being serious for a moment, let's just look at the statistics here. GQ assembled 11 scientists, and 5 rock stars. Of the rock stars, two are black, one is a woman. Of the scientists, 11 are middle-aged white males. For a campaign that wants to attract new young people into science in a country where around half of young people are women and probably nearly half are from ethnic minorities, that's just moronic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, okay, you've got your middle-aged white guys in suits into the studio and you're ready to take some photos that promote science. It doesn't take a marketing genius to tell you that the scientists should be in the centre, and the rockstars should be fawning over them. I'll repeat the words of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/06/how_gq_got_it_all_backwards.php"&gt;Dr. Isis&lt;/a&gt; here because she's right and I'm too lazy to bother rewriting it in my own words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems to me that if you want to have an effective campaign then what you do is put Sheryl Crow in a lab coat and take pictures of those guys teaching her to pipet or culture some cells or use a microscope.  Don't take pictures of talented, gifted scientists -- scientists whose talents make them as unique and talented as the rockstars they are pictured with -- trying to be musicians.  Take a picture of a musician aspiring to be a scientist."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase Marvin the Android, it hurts to think down to the level of the guy that put these photos together. &lt;/p&gt;

I like reading all of the anonymous little secrets people mail in because, secretly, I'm just a little creepy that way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I would disclose my own little secret as I sit and have breakfast, traveling back to the family.  Early last semester the girls in the lab were all reading &lt;a href="http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/twilight.html"&gt;Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.  I scoffed at them, telling them that my life was sufficiently dramatic without having to worry about the drama of some starcrossed teenagers.  I think I even once scolded them for discussing the tribulations of &lt;a href="http://www.edwardandbella.net/"&gt;Bella and Edward&lt;/a&gt; instead of paying attention to what we were doing and for coming to work sleepy because they had been up all night reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I bought a copy before the fight down and read it in about 24 hours, ending up feeling sleepy the next day.  Before I board my next flight to return home, I am going to buy a copy of &lt;a href="http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/newmoon.html"&gt;New Moon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's all not judge Dr. Isis.  Let's not judge.  And if the lab women are reading this, let's all agree not to discuss my dirty little secret in the open.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/06/confessions_of_a_domestic_and.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/Dtw-GrstT50" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246110461286"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7918">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aa235c43477921bd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="9/11"/><category term="inside job"/><title type="html">An Inside Job?</title><published>2009-06-27T13:04:16Z</published><updated>2009-06-27T13:04:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7918" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;amp;id=1560"&gt;today’s Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it all led up to was a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/i_get_email_37.php"&gt;marriage proposal from Jodi Haynes to Jason Thibeault&lt;/a&gt;, which would have been a bit of a bummer if he'd said "No", but we're all pleased to hear that he said "Yes!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few people seem to be baffled by the business of a pair of proud atheists going through this "marriage" stuff. Isn't that a religious ritual?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No! It's an example of &lt;i&gt;human&lt;/i&gt; values and &lt;i&gt;human&lt;/i&gt; commitment that has been coopted by religious institutions — just as they want you to think you can&amp;#39;t be born and you can&amp;#39;t die without an attending parasite from some superstitious dogma, they also want you to believe you can&amp;#39;t stand up and declare your love for another person without a holy gatekeeper. No gods intervene, no priests can sanctify, and no government can dictate when two people care enough about each other that they willingly and publicly declare that they have a lasting bond. Nothing else matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So good godless congratulations to Jodi and Jason, from one happily married pair of atheists to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, the people of Oklahoma have a strong tradition of reliance upon the Creator of the Universe; and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, we believe our economic woes are consequences of our greater national moral crisis; and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, this nation has become a world leader in promoting abortion, pornography, same sex marriage, sex trafficking, divorce, illegitimate births, child abuse, and many other forms of debauchery; and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, alarmed that the Government of the United States of America is forsaking the rich Christian heritage upon which this nation was built; and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, grieved that the Office of the president of these United States has refused to uphold the long held tradition of past presidents in giving recognition to our National Day of Prayer; and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, deeply disturbed that the Office of the president of these United States disregards the biblical admonitions to live clean and pure lives by proclaiming an entire month to an immoral behavior;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that we the undersigned elected officials of the people of Oklahoma, religious leaders and citizens of the State of Oklahoma, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world, solemnly declare that the HOPE of the great State of Oklahoma and of these United States, rests upon the Principles of Religion and Morality as put forth in the HOLY BIBLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the only solutions she proposes to her perceived problem of immorality is 1) pray for a day, and 2) read her holy book. Even if you grant that her declared problems are real moral problems (and I do not: I find it incredibly offensive and obtuse that she would lump same sex marriage together with sex trafficking) these are solutions that &lt;i&gt;do not work&lt;/i&gt;. If you want to find a hotbed of divorce, illegitimate births, child abuse, alcoholism, etc.…just look for a high density of churches.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/sally_kern_is_at_it_again.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Ox9Ji78N-Cs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246105574356"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/jason.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/71d2f691a1b9aea0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Jason?</title><published>2009-06-27T11:00:28Z</published><updated>2009-06-27T11:00:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/IWtnnJM8Q0E/jason.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/jason.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In any case, try &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/i_get_email_37.php"&gt;over here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/jason.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/IWtnnJM8Q0E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246100625860"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/i_get_email_37.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/69cd05c6dcce75d0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">I get email</title><published>2009-06-27T11:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-27T11:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/sSJussFfVjc/i_get_email_37.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/i_get_email_37.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Man, I get some strange email.

Rosie the Riveter!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
One of the most iconic images, spawned by this song:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.odeo.com/flash/audio_player_standard_gray.swf&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=52&amp;amp;flashVars=valid_sample_rate%3Dtrue%26external_url%3Dhttp://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/weekend_diversion_the_real_ros/RosieThe.mp3" width="300" height="52"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is that of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosie_the_Riveter"&gt;Rosie the Riveter&lt;/a&gt;.  For the first time in the United States, women were not only entering the workforce, they were doing &lt;b&gt;men's&lt;/b&gt; work, and doing it completely, competently, and basically driving the production of the American manufacturing industry.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/weekend_diversion_the_real_ros/wecandoitposter1.jpg" width="500" alt="wecandoitposter1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This started in around 1939/1940, when American resources were starting to get sucked into World War II, and was in full swing by 1943.  I had seen some pictures of women in the workforce from that time, and thought they were pretty neat.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/weekend_diversion_the_real_ros/rosrail.gif" width="229" height="173" alt="rosrail.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, I read this week about &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-kodachrome23-2009jun23,0,5125640.story"&gt;the discontinuation of Kodachrome film&lt;/a&gt;, the world's first commercially available color film.  In the late 30's/early 40's, it started reliably producing color photos, bringing the black-and-white world of the olden days:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/weekend_diversion_the_real_ros/Documentary_photography01.JPG" width="192" height="247" alt="Documentary_photography01.JPG"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;into modern, full-color.  The difference is breathtaking.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/weekend_diversion_the_real_ros/bg0020.jpg" width="500" alt="bg0020.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, I present to you some images of real-life Rosie the Riveters for your enjoyment, in &lt;i&gt;brilliant Kodachrome color!&lt;/i&gt;  Check out one in a machine shop,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/weekend_diversion_the_real_ros/241824231_32ae91eedc.jpg" width="500" alt="241824231_32ae91eedc.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and, as far as I can tell, &lt;b&gt;the real-life Rosie the Riveter&lt;/b&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/weekend_diversion_the_real_ros/04272009_kodachrome.jpg" width="500" alt="04272009_kodachrome.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still need to read &lt;a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061136665/Boy_Alone/index.aspx"&gt;Boy Alone: A Brother's Memoir&lt;/a&gt; by writer Karl Taro Greenfeld, about growing up with his &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_story_of_noah_greenfeld"&gt;severely autistic brother Noah&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s and, indeed, growing up very much in the shadow of Noah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People might think things were just the opposite, with Karl, not being disabled, being the sibling who was more dominant. But, as he writes in the June 8th &lt;a href="http://autismsciencefoundation.wordpress.com/2009/06/08/why-it-took-me-so-long-to-write-boy-alone/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://autismsciencefoundation.wordpress.com/2009/06/08/why-it-took-me-so-long-to-write-boy-alone/"&gt;Autism Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, Noah and his needs determined where the family lived and, indeed, their whole lives. Karl's and Noah's father, Josh Greenfeld, also wrote about the family in books like &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Child-Called-Noah-Josh-Greenfield/dp/0671826514"&gt;A Child Called Noah&lt;/a&gt;, books that, as that title suggests, were centered around Noah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son Charlie is an only child so Karl Greenfeld's is a perspective that Jim and I have not had to consider as far as our daily lives. Charlie has always had our undivided attention and he indeed seems to have needed it (still does). Certainly, he still requires the 24/7 supervision of at least one of us. How would a younger child have felt to be constantly dragged to doctor's or speech therapist's waiting rooms?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In considering why it took him so long to write a memoir about his brother and, too, about a difficult (and quite public) childhood, Karl Greenfeld notes how the experience of having his own children (two daughters) has shown him what he missed growing up as the only sibling of a "child like Noah." Greenfeld even notes that he wondered if, had he "vanished from the earth at some point during our childhood," would Noah have noticed? Maybe, but he would not have been "saddened," Karl Greenfeld suspects. His aren't sugar-coated feelings; he notes that he has received &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; .....letters and notes from parents—almost always parents, by the way, rarely siblings—who lecture me for not recognizing the gift that Noah has given me. He is a blessing of some kind, these folks insinuate, and I have stubbornly refused to accept it. I looked for that gift in my own life and see the sacrifices my family made: My parents moved us across country to a better program at UCLA. They opened their own day care center for the developmentally disabled. Our home, as the parents of low functioning autistics can probably envision, was a jumbled-up mess.  We were not a happy family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can only speculate how Karl Greenfeld's, and his family's, experience might have been different had Noah been born (as my son was) in the late 1990s. Many more siblings of individuals on the autism spectrum have made &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/todays-man-a-documentary-about-nicky-gottlieb/"&gt;movies&lt;/a&gt;, written &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ride-Together-Brother-Sisters-Memoir/dp/0743423364"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, shared their stories; individuals on the spectrum have also talked about how &lt;a href="http://rettdevil.blogspot.com/2006/04/siblings-in-nyt-ugh.html"&gt;they felt about their non-autistic siblings&lt;/a&gt;. There are programs like &lt;a href="http://www.siblingsupport.org/sibshops"&gt;Sibshop&lt;/a&gt; that are meant to provide support for siblings too and there is certainly much more public discussion about autism and life with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I know, a sibling of Charlie's would not have found it easy to be told, ok, tomorrow we are moving into two rooms in your grandparents' basement so Charlie can go to school in their town's school district. Of course we would have done everything we could so that a hypothetical sibling would not feel, well, like an afterthought and a permanent second fiddle. And often Jim and I sense a loneliness about Charlie not because he's on the autism spectrum, but because he's an only child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if, what if, what if?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;And yes I know, I've done a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_story_of_noah_greenfeld"&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autism_isnt_only_for_children"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; about the book. Based on Karl Taro Greenfeld's other writings and the place that his father's books hold in the history of parent memoirs about autistic children, &lt;a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061136665/Boy_Alone/index.aspx"&gt;Boy Alone: A Brother's Memoir&lt;/a&gt; isn't one to miss.

But when I clicked on keynote speaker &lt;a href="http://www.broadreachtraining.com/"&gt;Norman Kunc&lt;/a&gt;'s web site and skimmed through it I actually made a conscious decision to get up early and attend Kunc's keynote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I was not the least bit disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kunc is a master at assumption busting.  He is also an enormously entertaining speaker.  And he also detailed four perspectives on disability that have given me a tidy new model and language for deep issues surrounding the interplay between society and disability.  Individuals can view disability (or, substitute autism for the word disability, the model works just as well) as--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;strong&gt;deviance&lt;/strong&gt;.  The response to which is marginalization, segregation, ostracization, anger, and cruelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;strong&gt;deficiency&lt;/strong&gt;.  The response to which is an urgency to reform, remediate, assimilate, normalize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;strong&gt;tragedy&lt;/strong&gt;.  The response to which is benevolence (yes, this means "charities" too), overburdened woe-is-me, patronization, and pity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;diversity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  The response to which is to value, respect, support, and reciprocity.  To innovate instead of remediate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I'll take number 4 pls? k thx!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could share the entirety of Kunc's presentation with y'all.  I can't do that, but, via the marvels of this here Internet technology, I can share a part of what I saw this morning as the following video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Steorn took out a full page ad in &lt;a href="http://www.freeenergyphotos.com/steorn/steorn-economist-advert-magazine-page.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; promising "free, clean, and constant energy.” This was notable not only because it was at odds with the known laws of physics, but also because &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; is an unusual place to announce a breakthrough that would change just about everything we know about the world around us. Randi commented on their follies &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/80-swift-july-27-2008.html#i1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the promised test of their “Orbo” device came… and sadly, the device couldn’t handle the “hot lights” of the test environment. Later, they blamed an “internal greenhouse effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair enough (not really), what’s happened with the device since?&lt;/p&gt;

Did you hear about the guy who died in his sleep, killed by his own farts? Can you believe that racist jerk Elvis Presley once said: "The only thing a nigger can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes." And,guess what--Scholars at the Smithsonian have found Nostradamus predictions that relate to Barack Obama! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you may have guessed, the above statements are false. But that hasn't kept them from circulating the internet for years. Each of them is part of a viral email message, which means that each has some quality that makes people forward it, over and over and over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first is a kind of message commonly known as "glurge," too-sweet-to-be-true stories that give people a warm feeling or even chills. The second makes us laugh and piques our sense of curiosity. The third plays with our contradictory fascination with celebrities, which includes a desire to tear them down. The fourth appeals to our yearning for magic. These stories all are drawn from the urban legends fact-finding site, Snopes.com. What is the common theme? Emotional arousal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comparing religion to chain mail seems crass, but the kinship is real. And as Francis Bacon said, "The eye of the understanding is like the eye of the sense; for as you may see great objects through small crannies or holes, so you may see great axioms of nature through small and contemptible instances."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Viral email has a variety of reproductive strategies. Like computer viruses, many chain mail messages contain explicit "copy-me commands." Some promise us good luck if we forward the message to ten people before the day is up - or a week of happiness, or even prosperity. Some threatens us with bad luck if we don't. Some tries to shame us: "If you care about your friends, you'll send this information about cervical cancer/visa fraud/brown recluse spiders . . ." But most viral emails simply contain something that makes us want to pass them on. They may make us laugh or feel validated and righteous. Many delight us. A few tap our sense of magic or mystery or transcendence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The term "viral marketing" has itself gone viral recently, popularized by books like Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point, or Made to Stick by Chip and Dan Heath. Corporations have discovered that their best sales staff are satisfied customers, and they've been experimenting. Can we figure out the formula for starting a fad? Can we seed the virus with a few hired hands who create buzz? The Heath brothers offer communications professionals a simple formula which they call the "Six Principles for SUCCESs:" SIMPLE UNEXPECTED CONCRETE CREDIBLE EMOTIONAL STORIES. Look at the formula. Now think back about what I said regarding the boundaries of supernaturalism and the born again experience. The fit is remarkably tight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of medicine, epidemiologists study patterns of contagion. They might track, for example, how an influenza virus spread across one region and how it jumped from country to country in the bodies of specific carriers. Based on the way infections fan out, they may even be able to identify the “epicenter” of a disease. Some of the tools of epidemiology are now being applied to study the spread of viral ideas. But whereas diseases spread passively, meaning people rarely try to infect each other, viral ideas, also known as “memes” spread by harnessing the human desire to share what we know and to learn from each other. Memes get transmitted through established social networks. They spread horizontally within a generation, and vertically from generation to generation. That is why specific religions are concentrated in one part of the world or another and children tend to have the same religion as their parents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For developmental reasons, children are particularly susceptible to simply accepting the ideas of their parents and community. If a parent says stoves burn you, cars can squish you, and bathing keeps you from getting itchy, kids tend to do best if they simply trust what their parents say. Nature has designed children to be "credulous." This allows them to learn from the mistakes of their elders. It makes them more efficient in acquiring valuable information and adapting to cultural norms. It is also why evangelical parents are encouraged to convert their children. Research on identity development shows that if children can be contained within an enveloping religious community through their transition into young adulthood, few will ever leave. Bring up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it. (Proverbs 22:6)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A successful religion needs to have the qualities of a successful virus. In a changing environment, this means it must have the ability to mutate and adapt. In the past, religions were spread largely by edict and conquest. This is how Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire and into the Americas. Today, though, religion is perceived as an individual choice and religions must gain share by attracting adherents. This is why, today, the religions that are gaining mindshare are those that have good marketing, high birthrates, and what economists call “appealing &lt;a href="http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/14359/"&gt;club goods&lt;/a&gt;”. In the current environment, Christianity has been able to produce offshoots that need no edict or conquest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Significantly, the religions that are growing right now are ones with strong copy-me commands. Evangelical Christianity is centered on what Christians call the Great Commission: "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature, baptizing them in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost." In addition, just as the Roman church latched onto the strategy of competitive breeding (keep women home, sanctify a high birth rate), so Evangelicals have begun to explicitly add this form of copy-me command to the mix. By contrast, modernist Christianity is more often centered on what Christians call the Great Commandment: "Love the Lord your god with all your heart, soul and mind, and . . . love your neighbor as yourself." In a straight up competition, the copy-me command wins out, and in fact, evangelicals are gaining mindshare, while modernists are losing it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the fastest changing aspects of our world is the growth of information. As knowledge grows, some varieties Christianity accept new scientific or historical findings and reinterpret their sacred texts and traditions in light of our best understanding of the world around us. Tangentially, this is the approach taken by Tibetan Buddhism. The 14th Dalai Lama &lt;a href="http://www.dalailama.com/news.5.htm"&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt;, "If science proves some belief of Buddhism wrong, then Buddhism will have to change. In my view, science and Buddhism share a search for the truth and for understanding reality. By learning from science about aspects of reality where its understanding may be more advanced, I believe that Buddhism enriches its own worldview." This kind of adaptation is common for forms of Christianity that, like Buddhism, are more centered in praxis (practice) than belief. For those that are centered in belief, adapting to new knowledge is more difficult, and the survival strategy more often is a sort of fundamentalist retrenchment. Karen Armstrong's book, &lt;em&gt;The Battle for God, &lt;/em&gt;describes this retrenchment in the Abrahamic religions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The need to adapt may seem at odds with the recent success of fundamentalism, but in actual fact, fundamentalism is an adaptation to a changing world. Rather than revising dogmas, fundamentalists develop stronger defenses against external threats to a traditional homeostasis. An extreme example of this can be seen in the case of the Amish or Hassidic Jews: the belief system sustains itself relatively unchanged by engaging people to re-create an ancestral environment in which the belief system emerged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But most theological fundamentalists have a more hybrid approach. They protect their children from external influence by home schooling or parochial schools, but don't mind accessing creationist materials from interactive websites. They expand in-house social services that include pop psychology. They promote hierarchy and sexism but are willing to have women and children as spokespersons for these views. They play up the risks of inquiry and doubt and use scientific findings and follies to make their arguments convincing. Fundamentalist populations resist ideological change, but they have learned to exploit popular culture, best business practices, new technologies, and even scholarship itself to maintain the survival of their beliefs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since a virus and host fit together &lt;a href="http://www.lucifer.com/virus/virus.98/3214.html"&gt;like a lock and key&lt;/a&gt;, understanding viral ideas helps us to understand the human mind, and vice versa. Retro-viruses and influenza mutate rapidly, which makes it hard to develop immunizations against them. On the spectrum of religions, Christianity shows a similar flexibility, regularly spinning off new sects, denominations, and even non-denominational renegades. And yet each of these taps a familiar range of emotions and social mechanisms and is constrained by the cognitive structures that place bounds on human supernaturalism. Christianity has adapted to a broad range of human minds and cultures, a strategy that has resulted in success beyond the wildest visions of the patriarchs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn More:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lucifer.com/virus/memlex.html#MEME"&gt;Memetic Lexicon &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richard Brodie - &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Virus-Mind-New-Science-Meme/dp/0963600125"&gt;Virus of the Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chip Heath &amp;amp; Dan Heath, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.madetostick.com/"&gt;Made to Stick:Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (New York: Random House, 2007), 253-257.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you don't want to miss any of this series, subscribe to Valerie Tarico at this blog or send email to vt at valerietarico.com and request to be added to her weekly articles list.

I will be traveling on Sunday and arriving at Lindau, Germany on Monday for the &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/2009_Meeting_Chemistry.AxCMS?ActiveID=1338" title=""&gt;59th Meeting of Nobel Laureates&lt;/a&gt;. The list of Nobel Laureates (23 of them) and the list of about 600 young researchers from 66 countries are very impressive. Of course, not being a chemist, I'll have to do some homework before I go (I printed out the complete list of descriptions of all of them to read on the airplane), learning what these people did to get their prizes and what the younger ones are doing hoping to get a Nobel in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My SciBling &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/auf_wiedersehen.php" title=""&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt; will also be there, so we will both blog about the sessions and panels and people and, well, beer. Of course, beer, it is Bavaria!  Apart from the two of us, there will be a lot of blogging about the meeting on the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.de/lindaunobel/" title=""&gt;Scienceblogs Germany&lt;/a&gt; site, as well as some on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/seed/" title=""&gt;Page 3.14&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I will also do some work - I will be on an &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/open_access_panel_at_lindau.php" title=""&gt;Open Access panel&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I hope to do is conduct brief (1-2 minutes) interviews with people using a Flash camera, and later upload the files on YouTube and embed them here on the blog. Then I would follow up with a little longer (5-10 minutes) interviews with the same people using a digital audio recorder, upload the files somewhere (probably Odeo.com but I'll test a few sites to see which one works the best) and embed the podcasts here on the blog. I will also be taking pictures and posting some on Flickr and Facebook and others via Twittpic to Twitter (which then goes to FriendFeed and Facebook as well). So you will be able to see them wherever you follow me online. Note the FriendFeed widget on the bottom of the left side-bar on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lindau meeting is from June 28th to July 3rd, after which I'll fly to Belgrade for a few days, to visit my Mom and meet some friends (especially those I missed last year). &lt;a href="http://ncrcbiblioteka.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Ana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/02/openness_is_essential_freedom.php" title=""&gt;Vedran&lt;/a&gt; and some others are already trying to organize the bust program for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will give a talk at the University Library on Tuesday, July 7th at noon, and then at the Oncology Center at the Medical School at the University of Belgrade at noon on Wednesday, July 8th. I'll be meeting my high-school friends on the 5th, and two different sets of elementary/middle school friends on the 9th and 11th of July (a bunch of expats are coming from abroad to the July 11th reunion as well). The horse-y friends will be at the Mediterranean games, so I will miss them this time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in contact with some people there who may be able to tell me more about the newly discovered &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/a_beautiful_mammoth_fossil_dis.php" title=""&gt;mammoth fossil&lt;/a&gt; (I am not sure I will be able to actually go and see it, but I'll try) as well as the people who put together the &lt;a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2009&amp;amp;mm=06&amp;amp;dd=18&amp;amp;nav_id=59927" title=""&gt;new exhibit of Argentinian dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt; (a traveling exhibit that just moved from Germany to Belgrade last week). I am also hoping to give some interviews at local radio and/or TV. More information about the Belgrade leg of the trip will be available on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=116723016118" title=""&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am likely to be online a lot nonetheless. Apart from blogging the trip and uploading interviews, I will probably also schedule (for automatic posting) ClockQuotes and some reposts of old stuff from the Archives. And I will be in touch with the PLoS HQ and will convey all the exciting news coming from there. And on the 1st of July I will announce the &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/tag/blog-pick-of-the-month/" title=""&gt;Blog Pick of the Month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/programing_note_next_two_weeks.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/vmsw74lha5I" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246075908377"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_172.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fe39b2d30fe2d571</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">New and Exciting in PLoS ONE</title><published>2009-06-27T03:07:05Z</published><updated>2009-06-27T03:07:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/7SA5-tGWUik/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_172.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_172.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browse.action?month=6&amp;amp;day=29&amp;amp;year=2009&amp;amp;field=date" title=""&gt;15 new articles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; today.

You can now also easily place articles on various social services (CiteULike, Mendeley, Connotea, Stumbleupon, Facebook and Digg) with just one click. Here are my own picks for the week - you go and look for your own favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006022" title=""&gt;A Principal Component Analysis of 39 Scientific Impact Measures&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The impact of scientific publications has traditionally been expressed in terms of citation counts. However, scientific activity has moved online over the past decade. To better capture scientific impact in the digital era, a variety of new impact measures has been proposed on the basis of social network analysis and usage log data. Here we investigate how these new measures relate to each other, and how accurately and completely they express scientific impact. We performed a principal component analysis of the rankings produced by 39 existing and proposed measures of scholarly impact that were calculated on the basis of both citation and usage log data. Our results indicate that the notion of scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be adequately measured by any single indicator, although some measures are more suitable than others. The commonly used citation Impact Factor is not positioned at the core of this construct, but at its periphery, and should thus be used with caution.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006070" title=""&gt;Cool Sex? Hibernation and Reproduction Overlap in the Echidna&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;During hibernation there is a slowing of all metabolic processes, and thus it is normally considered to be incompatible with reproduction. In Tasmania the egg-laying mammal, the echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) hibernates for several months before mating in mid-winter, and in previous studies we observed males with females that were still hibernating. We monitored the reproductive activity of radio-tracked echidnas by swabbing the reproductive tract for sperm while external temperature loggers provided information on the timing of hibernation. Additional information was provided by camera traps and ultrasound imaging. More than a third of the females found in mating groups were torpid, and the majority of these had mated. Some females re-entered deep torpor for extended periods after mating. Ultrasound examination showed a developing egg in the uterus of a female that had repeatedly re-entered torpor. The presence of fresh sperm in cloacal swabs taken from this female on three occasions after her presumed date of fertilization indicated she mated several times after being fertilized. The mating of males with torpid females is the result of extreme competition between promiscuous males, while re-entry into hibernation by pregnant females could improve the possibility of mating with a better quality male.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006074" title=""&gt;More than 9,000,000 Unique Genes in Human Gut Bacterial Community: Estimating Gene Numbers Inside a Human Body&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Estimating the number of genes in human genome has been long an important problem in computational biology. With the new conception of considering human as a super-organism, it is also interesting to estimate the number of genes in this human super-organism. We presented our estimation of gene numbers in the human gut bacterial community, the largest microbial community inside the human super-organism. We got 552,700 unique genes from 202 complete human gut bacteria genomes. Then, a novel gene counting model was built to check the total number of genes by combining culture-independent sequence data and those complete genomes. 16S rRNAs were used to construct a three-level tree and different counting methods were introduced for the three levels: strain-to-species, species-to-genus, and genus-and-up. The model estimates that the total number of genes is about 9,000,000 after those with identity percentage of 97% or up were merged. By combining completed genomes currently available and culture-independent sequencing data, we built a model to estimate the number of genes in human gut bacterial community. The total number of genes is estimated to be about 9 million. Although this number is huge, we believe it is underestimated. This is an initial step to tackle this gene counting problem for the human super-organism. It will still be an open problem in the near future.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_172.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/7SA5-tGWUik" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246075689156"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3653">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/12f0051be8fb0c55</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="religion"/><category term="Ark"/><category term="Rome"/><title type="html">Warning: this blog may melt your face…</title><published>2009-06-27T04:02:36Z</published><updated>2009-06-27T04:02:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/06/26/warning-this-blog-may-melt-your-face/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/06/26/warning-this-blog-may-melt-your-face/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/g3ythpzsu18/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;…actually, more likely, it’ll just make your head hurt from all the stupidity. Here’s &lt;a href="http://wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;amp;pageId=102200"&gt;the latest report passing itself off as legitimate news from World Net Daily&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ark hunters and Bible enthusiasts are buzzing about a report that the Ark of the Covenant, the ancient container that holds the Ten Commandments, is expected to be unveiled in Rome today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;First, let me just say that I find “Bible enthusiasts” adorable. I myself am a Sneatches enthusiast. It’s kinda the same thing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And second, really? Are we really going to have to go through this whole “I think I found the Ark of Covenent” thing again? This story is also discussed in great detail &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/examiner/x-8928-Philadelphia-Atheism-Examiner~y2009m6d27-The-Ark-of-the-Covenant-has-been-found"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My advice to these Ark hunters is to accept reality. God is imaginary. Quit wasting your life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I am seeing some troublesome stirrings here. A certain demented ex-commenter is morphing to avoid his banning, we've just had a flood of weird spam (a &lt;i&gt;dental office&lt;/i&gt; using spam tools?

I was invited here to learn a particular technique used at this MRU that I think is going to change how we do things in our laboratory for the better.  We do a lot of novel things, but there are some things that are done at this MRU that, as I mentioned, are absolutely outstanding.  Still, I learned during this visit that there are a couple of things about being a scientist that I still haven't gotten used to.&lt;br&gt;

More findings about the genetics of autism from researchers at the &lt;a href="http://www.chop.edu"&gt;Children's Hospital of Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://med.upenn.edu"&gt;University of Pennsylvania Medical School&lt;/a&gt;, among others. Like recent previous studies, these new findings have found &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/a-unified-theory-of-autism/"&gt;de novo&lt;/a&gt; (spontaneous, vs. inherited) deletions or duplications that affect the "brain circuitry'''---&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/autisms-cause-at-the-synapse/"&gt;synaptic functioning&lt;/a&gt;---in early childhood. Some 27 different genetic regions with rare copy number variations---missing or extra copies of DNA segments---were found in autistic children, but not in controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a &lt;a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-06/chop-mgm062509.php"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared genetic samples of 3,832 individuals from 912 families with multiple children with ASDs from the AGRE cohort against genetic samples of 1,070 disease-free children from The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. This study also uncovered two novel genes in which variations were found, BZRAP1 and MDGA2 – thought to be important in synaptic function and neurological development, respectively. Interestingly, key variants of these genes were transmitted in some, but not all, of the affected individuals in families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are published in &lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/home.action"&gt;PloS Genetics&lt;/a&gt; (June 26).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's &lt;a href="http://news.scotsman.com/health/Scottish-scientists-find-autism-gene.5404477.jp"&gt;Scotsman&lt;/a&gt; reports on another study about genetics and autism and is quite a bit more upfront in suggesting that these findings could lead to some sort of (drug) treatment for autism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scottish scientists have paved the way for potential new treatments for autism after discovering a link between the condition and abnormalities in a gene important for learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link was established by researchers at &lt;a href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/"&gt;Aberdeen University&lt;/a&gt; following a study of four children with severe autism in the North-east of Scotland. They discovered that the children each had a rare re-arrangement of chromosomes that had disrupted a gene known as EIF4E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is published in the &lt;a href="http://jmg.bmj.com/"&gt;Journal of Medical Genetics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe talking about treatment from the findings is a bit too soon---and are we ready for it?

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why doesn't the Space Needle, a top-heavy skyscraper, ever tip over and fall?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is reasonable, and there's precedent for this.  After all, the &lt;a href="http://startswithabang.com/?p=540"&gt;Leaning Tower of Pisa was falling over&lt;/a&gt;, and needed significant foundation-work just to keep it upright.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/how_stable_are_skyscrapers/e15_Pisa_leaning_tower.jpg" width="512" alt="e15_Pisa_leaning_tower.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when you take something like the Space Needle, it looks like most of the weight is in the top:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/how_stable_are_skyscrapers/space_needle.jpg" width="500" alt="space_needle.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it looks even more significant if you stand at the bottom and look up:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/how_stable_are_skyscrapers/0707SPA-108-110pan-Space-Needle.jpg" width="324" height="800" alt="0707SPA-108-110pan-Space-Needle.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, in actuality, the Space Needle is one of the most stable structures ever, and will be one of the last buildings standing in the event of a disastrous earthquake.  How is this possible?  It's pretty simple, and requires just one little physics concept: &lt;b&gt;center of gravity&lt;/b&gt;.  In a human being, your center of gravity is somewhere in your abdomen.  The &lt;i&gt;higher&lt;/i&gt; your center of gravity is above the floor, the tougher it is to balance.  Riding a unicycle, for instance, is particularly difficult:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/how_stable_are_skyscrapers/unirope.jpg" width="297" height="437" alt="unirope.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if you do something to tweak this, to &lt;i&gt;lower&lt;/i&gt; the center of gravity, it becomes much easier to balance.  The easiest case is if your center of gravity is &lt;b&gt;below your floor&lt;/b&gt;.  This makes it so easy that even an inanimate playmobile toy, if you put enough mass beneath the unicyclist's tightrope, will automatically balance:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/how_stable_are_skyscrapers/PLA053.jpg" width="495" alt="PLA053.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is what they did when they built the Space Needle.  They build, underground, a foundation so strong and so massive, that its center of gravity is actually &lt;b&gt;beneath the ground!&lt;/b&gt;  This is actually pretty straightforward to do if you can drill into some bedrock and sturdily anchor there.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/how_stable_are_skyscrapers/skyscraper_foundations.jpg" width="250" height="695" alt="skyscraper_foundations.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this stable?  Because if your building starts to tip, its foundation will rise, and therefore its center of gravity will rise.  &lt;b&gt;But this can't happen!&lt;/b&gt;  Gravity pulls things down, and so Newton's simple laws (and the conservation of energy) forbid the Space Needle from tipping over so long as it stays anchored to its foundation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to see a simpler example?  Simply head out to your local public body of water, and look for a buoy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/how_stable_are_skyscrapers/250px-Buoy_seal.jpg" width="250" height="379" alt="250px-Buoy_seal.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know why these things stay upright?  Because their center of gravity is &lt;b&gt;below&lt;/b&gt; the surface of the water.  If you tipped one, its center of gravity would rise, which is forbidden.  Buoys actually look like this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/how_stable_are_skyscrapers/JETs.jpg" width="260" height="301" alt="JETs.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the only way to knock one over and have it stay overturned is to &lt;i&gt;detach it from the foundation&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, to conclude, this is the most important step in building a skyscraper: &lt;b&gt;anchoring it firmly to a solid foundation&lt;/b&gt;.  So long as the entire structure has its center of gravity below the ground, &lt;i&gt;it will never topple&lt;/i&gt;.

Those of us who've been on the blogospheric front lines for the last few years have sometimes been frustrated that this issue, at least until recently, got so little attention outside of our dedicated little circle and the much larger circle of anti-vaccine zealots and the quacks who enable and encourage them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not to say that there weren't some prominent skeptics who made the anti-vaccine movement one of their main causes. There's me, of course, but there are also &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/antivaccination_hysteria/"&gt;Skeptico&lt;/a&gt;, Australian skeptic &lt;a href="http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/vaxliars/mail.htm"&gt;Peter Bowditch&lt;/a&gt; (who was on the front lines against the antivaccine movement long before I discovered it), &lt;a href="http://www.blacktriangle.org/blog/"&gt;Anthony Cox&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt;. Now don't get me wrong; I'm not saying that the skeptical movement ignored the antivaccine movement. However, from my perspective it seemed that skeptics paid far more attention to issues like attacks on evolution by creationists, both the young earth and intelligent design variety, the paranormal, and various other woo than it did to the anti-vaccine movement. Maybe it's a function of my being a physician, but at times I felt as though only a hardy band of us were saying anything. This is not to denigrate efforts to combat, for example, ID, but if there's one thing about the anti-vaccine movement that is different from the ID movement it's that, while the ID movement is a profound threat to science education that endangers science knowledge in future generations, the anti-vaccine movement endangers our children and public health both &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose it's possible that I got the impression that the skeptical movement didn't dwell on the antivaccine movement as much as I thought it should because of the zeal of the converted. The shock that I experienced when I first discovered that there really were people who think that vaccines are incredibly dangerous compared to the diseases they protect against and that vaccines are responsible for the "epidemic" of autism was incredible. Whatever the case, part of the niche I made for myself in the blogosphere was to write about the anti-vaccine movement, something I have been doing regularly for four years now. It all really kicked into high gear when I made my first big splash with a deconstruction of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/06/from_the_vaults_rfk_jr_gets_hi.php"&gt;fear mongering, pseudoscience-laden screed for Salon.com and Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, why focus just on the skeptical movement? Physicians and public health officials here in the U.S. were pathetically late to respond to the propaganada pumped out now on a daily basis by &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;, Jenny McCarthy, and a number of other anti-vaccine groups and advocates. Indeed, I really think that the CDC and AAP didn't actually start to see the movement as the threat to public health and to medical science that it is until sometime last year. At least, it seemed that they didn't wake up from their torpor until late 2008. So perhaps I'm too harsh to be focusing on the skeptical movement; after all, the CDC, AAP, and physicians should have recognized this problem long before "general purpose" skeptics, particularly since we had a model to observe in the U.K. to give us a good idea what we were in for. After all, the U.K. is where Andrew Wakefield's bad science, both fraudulent and lawyer-funded, had caused MMR vaccination rates to plummet years before the anti-vaccine movement became a major problem in the U.S., leading to the measles making a startling comeback to the point of being declared endemic again a mere 14 years after having been virtually eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, however, over the last year, like the AAP and CDC, the skeptical movement has started to take note of the anti-vaccine movement and respond to it, and I hope that it does a better job. I attribute this increased interest largely to Phil Plait, a.k.a. the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy"&gt;Bad Astronome&lt;/a&gt;r, who, since taking over leadership of the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org"&gt;James Randi Educational Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, has made the anti-vaccine movement a major focus of his blogging and JREF's mission. This year, at The Amazing Meeting 7 (TAM7), he's &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/609-help-re-establish-the-herd-immunity-of-nevada.html"&gt;putting JREF's efforts into reversing the low vaccination rates in Nevada&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/help_immunize_las_vegas.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/help_immunize_las_vegas.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/DE6y3wkgfIw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246046533188"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/christian_faith_is_at_odds_wit.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8b287ba6cf6695ea</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Christian faith is at odds with science</title><published>2009-06-26T20:39:38Z</published><updated>2009-06-26T20:39:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/qDd0zbhKgb8/christian_faith_is_at_odds_wit.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/christian_faith_is_at_odds_wit.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday morning, I was in a discussion on &lt;a href="http://www.premier.org.uk/unbelievable"&gt;UK Christian talk radio&lt;/a&gt; on the topic of "Is Christian faith at odds with science?", with Denis Alexander of the &lt;a href="http://faraday-institute.org/"&gt;Faraday Institute for Science and Religion&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s going to be available as a podcast at sometime in the next day, but I may not be able to link to it right away — tomorrow I fly away to Germany for a week, so my schedule is going to be a bit chaotic for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't expect fireworks. It was the usual feeble accommodationist claptrap, but I had my nice man hat on and actually tried to get across some basic ideas. To no avail, of course, but at least I tried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have now discovered that I was trying to make the same points &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124597314928257169.html"&gt;Lawrence Krauss is doing in the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;: religion is wrong. It's a set of answers, and worse, a set of procedures, that don't work. That's the root of our argument that religion is incompatible with science.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;That word, "incompatibility", is a problem, though. The uniform response we always get when we say that is "Hey! I'm a Christian, and I'm a scientist, therefore they can't be incompatible!" Alexander was no exception, and said basically the same thing right away. It's an irrelevant point; it assumes that a person can't possibly hold two incompatible ideas at once. We &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that is not true. We have complicated and imperfect brains, and even the most brilliant person on earth is not going to be perfectly consistent. When we talk about incompatibility, we have to also &lt;b&gt;specify what purposes are in conflict&lt;/b&gt;, and show that the patterns of behavior have different results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you just like to go to church because you enjoy the company, then the purpose of religion to you is to reinforce social bonds -- so of course there is no incompatibility between science and religion there. If you go for the choir (as Stephen Jay Gould was known to do), you're there to enjoy the music, and science does not dictate that human beings are not allowed to enjoy music. For that matter, science doesn't say that someone is not allowed to enjoy the perverse circumlocutions of theology, so if someone attends for the religion &lt;i&gt;sensu strictu&lt;/i&gt;, no problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in a debate about the compatibility of science and religion, we have to put the argument in an appropriate context and define a specific shared purpose for both science and religion — it&amp;#39;s the only legitimate ground for discussion. In this case, what we&amp;#39;re trying to do is address big questions (remember, the Templeton Foundation says they&amp;#39;re all about those &amp;quot;big questions&amp;quot;) about the nature of the universe, about our history, about how we function, and then we encounter a conflict: religion keeps giving us different answers. Very different answers. They can&amp;#39;t all be right, and since no two religions give the same answers, but since science can generally converge on similar and consistent answers, I know which one is right. And that makes religion simply &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to look at what they do to see why. In order to probe the nature of the universe around us, science is a process, a body of tools, that has a long history of success in giving us robust, consistent answers. We use observation, experiment, critical analysis, and repeated reevaluation and confirmation of events in the natural world. It works. We use frequent internal cross-checking of results to get an answer, and we never entirely trust our answers, so we keep pushing harder at them. We also evaluate our success by whether the end results work: it's how we end up with lasers and microwave ovens, and antibiotics and cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religion, on the other hand, uses a different body of techniques to explain the nature of the universe. It uses tradition and dogma and authority and revelation, and a detailed legalistic analysis of source texts, to dictate what the nature of reality should be. It's always wrong, from an empirical perspective, although I do have to credit theologians with some of the most amazingly intricate logical exercises as they try to justify their conclusions. The end result of all of this kind of clever wankery, though, is that some people say the world is 6000 years old, that it was inundated with a global flood 4000 years ago, and other people say something completely different, and there is no way &lt;i&gt;within the body of theology&lt;/i&gt; to resolve which answers are right. They have to step outside their narrow domain to get an independent confirmation — that is, they rely on science to give them the answers to the Big Questions in which they purport to have expertise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what theistic scientists have to do is abandon the operational techniques of religion and use science to address those questions. The "theistic" part of their moniker is nothing but useless baggage which, if they take it at all seriously, would interfere with their understanding of the world. That is what I mean by an incompatibility between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krauss uses a marvelous and well-known quote from J.B.S. Haldane to make that point more briefly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My practice as a scientist is atheistic. That is to say, when I set up an experiment I assume that no god, angel or devil is going to interfere with its course; and this assumption has been justified by such success as I have achieved in my professional career. I should therefore be intellectually dishonest if I were not also atheistic in the affairs of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got Alexander to agree that he does not use religion in the laboratory — I don&amp;#39;t know anyone who would say that they do, other than creationist kooks — but it didn&amp;#39;t seem to sink in that that is an admission of incompatibility. Religion doesn&amp;#39;t work to answer questions in science, which always leaves me wondering…if you accept that, why do you go on thinking it might be giving you correct answers in ordinary daily life? It has an awfully poor track record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now one way the defenders of religion like to get around this empirical problem is to change the game in mid-play: one moment we're talking about tools for understanding the world, where there is a conflict, and then they switch to a completely different purpose, that of establishing a common morality, or appreciating art, or falling in love. I would be the first to admit that science does not and should not dictate morality: the cases in the past where this has happened (eugenics comes to mind right away) have been disastrous. Science is good at explaining what is and how it works, and not so great at telling us how it should work. I also wouldn't use the scientific method directly to determine whether I like some music or poetry or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I'm going to have to say that religion doesn't do a good job at that either. SJ Gould tried to partition the domains of authority for science and religion by explicitly setting a boundary, and saying religion should have the job of defining what is right and good...but I think he failed, because he gave far too much credit to religion for being able to discern and act on a reasonable morality. It's foundation on authority and its role in defining in and out groups means it is too exclusionary, too narrow and inflexible, and also too willing to ignore empirical evidence. It's why we have religion behind such immoral acts today as trying to restrict civil rights to people who have only a certain range of sexual behaviors, or facilitating the spread of sexually transmitted disease in Africa by damning sex education and condom use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when it comes to other questions than the cosmic ones about the nature of existence, I prefer that we apply just about any discipline other than religion to the problem: at least they are evidence-based, where religion is not. I'd rather consult a philosopher than a theologian on morality; they've been thinking about it with a broader scope than the pious promoters of sectarian belief, anyway, don't restrict their principles to worshippers of one particular idol, and usually don't invoke magical rewards and punishments that have never been seen to justify decisions. If I'm in love I'm better off pulling a book of poetry off the shelf than consulting a celibate. I'd rather hear about economics from an economist than from a ouija board or a pulpit, and I like the idea of policy decisions being evaluated for effectiveness, rather than ideological purity. When we're looking at communities and interactions between individuals, give me a psychologist or a sociologist over a priest any day. The only useful priests in those matters are the ones who understand the principles of psychology and sociology, and apply those, rather than pulling a quote out of their holy book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accommodationists are a problem not because accommodation is bad, but because they are pushing for the wrong kind of accommodation. Science doesn't need to conform, religion does. Religion demands a special kind of privilege in these discussions because if we actually get down to assessing views fairly and objectively, on the basis of what works, it &lt;i&gt;fails&lt;/i&gt;. I say, let it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also why so many of us object to the Templeton Foundation. Their agenda consists solely of mixing up science and religion, to the detriment of the former. They just want to compromise…but asking us to compromise science that works with faith that doesn&amp;#39;t is a fool&amp;#39;s bargain. Why should we?&lt;/p&gt;

The iTunes sales charts are overwhelmed by Michael Jackson songs: as of this afternoon, New York Magazine's &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2009/06/michael_jackson_dominates_the.html"&gt;Vulture blog&lt;/a&gt; reports,  Jackson appears on 41 songs in the iTunes Top 100 singles  chart. One of the top songs is &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPTsmswQVwg"&gt;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; the infectious opening song from the 1982 album &lt;em&gt;Thriller&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://www.allmichaeljackson.com/lyrics/wannabestartinsomethin.html"&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt; can be a bit befuddling (&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re a vegetable, you&amp;#39;re a vegetable…&amp;quot;), but there&amp;#39;s no denying  the song&amp;#39;s catchiness, especially the chant at the end: &amp;quot;Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa.&amp;quot; The story behind these seemingly nonsensical syllables is a fascinating one, originating in the Cameroonian language &lt;a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=dua"&gt;Duala&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duala is spoken in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douala"&gt;Douala&lt;/a&gt;, Cameroon's largest city, which has long been a musical hotbed. Since the 1960s, Cameroonian pop music has been dominated by a rhythmic style of dance music from Douala known as &lt;em&gt;makossa&lt;/em&gt;. The Duala word &lt;em&gt;makossa&lt;/em&gt; is often glossed as &amp;quot;(I) dance&amp;quot; (as in &lt;a href="http://www.inst.at/trans/13Nr/echu13.htm"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by Cameroonian linguist George Echu). The entry for &lt;em&gt;makossa&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/em&gt; further explains that  &lt;em&gt;makossa&lt;/em&gt; is &amp;quot;derivative of &lt;em&gt;kosa&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#39;to peel or remove the skin of (a fruit or vegetable)&amp;#39;; the name refers to the twisting and shaking movements of the dancer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Makossa&lt;/em&gt; hit the big time in 1973, when Manu Dibango&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16UUi61H3sE"&gt;Soul Makossa&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; became an international hit. The song&amp;#39;s origins were hardly auspicious: Dibango originally wrote the song as the B-side to &amp;quot;Mouvement Ewondo,&amp;quot; a praise song or &amp;quot;hymn&amp;quot; for the Cameroonian football team on the occasion of the 1972 Tropics Cup, held in Cameroon&amp;#39;s capital Yaoundé. Here is how Dibango describes coming up with the song in his autobiography, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=9tvf93QiNpQC"&gt;Three Kilos of Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one side of the 45 I recorded the hymn; on the other I recorded &amp;quot;Soul Makossa,&amp;quot; written using a traditional makossa rhythm with a little soul thrown in. In my Douala neighborhood, at my parents&amp;#39; house, I rehearsed this second piece. The house had no air-conditioning, and the windows were wide open. All the kids flocked around. Hearing me rehearse, they fell over laughing. Unbelievable — how on earth had I concocted &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;mishmash? Poor makossa really took a blow. My father was astonished: &amp;quot;Can&amp;#39;t you pronounce &amp;#39;makossa&amp;#39; like everyone else? You stutter: &amp;#39;mamako mamasa.&amp;#39; You think they&amp;#39;re going to accept that in Yaoundé?&amp;quot; The Cup organizing committee reacted the same way. The march on side one they found &amp;quot;impeccable.&amp;quot; But the other side… &amp;quot;Really, Manu has gone nuts. What possesses him to stutter like that?&amp;quot; 
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mouvement Ewondo&amp;quot; was a flop, but &amp;quot;Soul Makossa&amp;quot; found its way to New York, where it turned into an underground hit. After heavy rotation on New York&amp;#39;s popular black radio station WBLS, the obscure Cameroonian single became a hot commodity. Since the original single was so hard to find, numerous cover versions filled the void (such as &lt;a href="http://www.fileden.com/files/2006/12/3/456634/06%20Soul%20Makossa.MP3"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; from the Lafayette Afro Rock Band). The acts covering Dibango's song all imitated his stuttering syllables that playfully mangled the word &lt;em&gt;makossa&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The song is credited with helping to kickstart New York's nascent disco scene, and both the original and the countless cover versions traveled far and wide. It clearly had an effect on young Michael Jackson as he was writing the songs for &lt;em&gt;Thriller&lt;/em&gt;, since the breakdown at the end of &amp;quot;Wanna Be Startin&amp;#39; Somethin&amp;#39;&amp;quot; incorporates a variation of Dibango&amp;#39;s refrain, deleting a syllable and altering two others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dibango: &lt;strong&gt;ma ma ko, ma ma sa, ma ko ma ko sa&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Jackson: &lt;strong&gt;ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackson apparently claimed his version was Swahili, but he eventually acknowledged his debt to Dibango and worked out a compensation arrangement in an out-of-court settlement. In 2007, when R&amp;amp;B singer Rihanna released the song &amp;quot;Please Don&amp;#39;t Stop The Music&amp;quot; sampling the line from  &amp;quot;Wanna Be Startin&amp;#39; Somethin&amp;#39;,&amp;quot; Rihanna got Jackson&amp;#39;s permission but not Dibango&amp;#39;s. In response, Dibango &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/feb/04/rihanna-michael-jackson-manu-dibango"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; both Rihanna and Jackson earlier this year, seeking 500,000 euros in damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll leave you with &amp;quot;Soul Makossa&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Wanna Be Startin&amp;#39; Somethin.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From everything I read, besides the idiocy in it’s basic form, I realize the more faith you has, the worser you’re grammar is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
Too true! SpiralArchitect, your prize is to choose next Wednesday’s Afternoon Inquisition. Whisper it in Elyse’s ear tonight and she can pass it along to me, or just use the contact form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runners-up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to my teasing headline, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7841&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-65367"&gt;junco wrote&lt;/a&gt; “Damn you. No boobies makes my face rain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And concerning a transient bashing someone in the head with a skateboard during a discussion of quantum physics, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7879&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-65539"&gt;durnett opined&lt;/a&gt;, “You know, there comes a point when something happens so frequently that it isn’t even news.”&lt;/p&gt;

A few months ago I had the idea to organize a session at the upcoming &lt;a href="http://www.aaas.org/meetings/"&gt;meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science&lt;/a&gt;, in San Diego next February.  It’s a giant cross-scientific-disciplinary meeting, offering a great chance for journalists and scientists in diverse fields to catch up on what’s happening in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I couldn’t decide between two possible topics, both of which are close to my heart:  “The Origin of the Universe” or “The Arrow of Time.”  (My original book subtitle was “The Origin of the Universe and the Arrow of Time,” before that was squelched by the marketing department and replaced with “The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time.”  Quests are big these days, apparently.)  So I did the natural thing:  I &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/seanmcarroll/status/1366585999"&gt;Tweeted&lt;/a&gt; the question.  And the internet spoke with a fairly unambiguous voice:  “Arrow of Time” sounded more interesting.  So that’s what I proposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we’ve just been accepted, so it’s on for San Diego 2010.  We have a fantastic line-up of speakers (and also me), spanning quite a range of topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me, setting the stage about the arrow of time and the Second Law, and drawing some connections to cosmology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usyd.edu.au/time/price/"&gt;Huw Price&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Centre for Time, Department of Philosophy, University of Sydney, and author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Times-Arrow-Archimedes-Point-Directions/dp/0195117980/"&gt;Time’s Arrow and Archimedes’ Point&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  Huw will be talking about the arrow of time in philosophy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://physics.illinois.edu/people/profile.asp?aleggett"&gt;Anthony Leggett&lt;/a&gt;, winner of the Nobel Prize in 2003 for his work on superfluidity.  Tony will be talking about the arrow of time in quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/~lassig/"&gt;Michael Lässig&lt;/a&gt;, University of Cologne.  Michael specializes in statistical physics and quantitative biology, and will be speaking on the arrow of time in biology, in particular in evolution.  He recently gave a &lt;a href="http://online.itp.ucsb.edu/bblunch/lassig/"&gt;talk on this topic at the KITP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~dsweb/"&gt;Daniel Schacter&lt;/a&gt;, Harvard, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Sins-Memory-Forgets-Remembers/dp/0618219196/"&gt;The Seven Sins of Memory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  Dan was the leader of the studies showing that the brain &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/04/14/remembering-the-past-is-like-imagining-the-future/"&gt;predicts the future in the same way that it remembers the past&lt;/a&gt;.  He’ll be talking about the arrow of time in psychology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the fun part about this topic; it ranges naturally from the birth of the universe to the operation of your brain.  Should be a good symposium.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246038523791"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/06/26/sex-and-sex/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3b9dbcaf19d8a5a1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution"/><category term="Writing Elsewhere"/><title type="html">Sex and “Sex”</title><published>2009-06-26T16:50:42Z</published><updated>2009-06-26T16:50:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/06/26/sex-and-sex/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over at the Origins blog on &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;’s web site, I take a look at what means to have sex–especially if you happen to be bacteria. &lt;a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/origins/2009/06/sex-a-solution-to-microbial-in.html"&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Carl Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/</id><title type="html">The Loom</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246037766956"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=14025">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a9f568e6ccbf02ac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="history"/><title type="html">The Year the World Changed</title><published>2009-06-26T17:09:39Z</published><updated>2009-06-26T17:09:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/the-year-the-world-changed/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">In a new &lt;a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/06/18/the_great_backlash_1979?page=0,0"&gt;Foreign Policy article&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Christian Caryl&lt;/strong&gt; describes how the events of 1979 defined the world we live in today.

The result: very drunk skepchicks and the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=402205"&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt; of our now-on-hold-until-we-get-more-booze podcast. Oh, and a drink called “&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=1617#comment-23630"&gt;The Sylvia Browne&lt;/a&gt;” won because it was delicious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the runner-up in this contest, the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=1617#comment-23346"&gt;Buzzed Aldrin&lt;/a&gt;, has become the Official Beverage Of Skepchick. The drink is fantastic! It’s what Skepchicks are made of – vodka and bright orange mix. And, if astronauts were to get drunk in space, there is no question that this would be their drink of choice.&lt;img title="tangmonkey" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/tangmonkey.jpg" alt="tangmonkey" width="198" height="227"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, we want you to one-up &lt;strong&gt;kevinf&lt;/strong&gt;’s brill creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a drink recipe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep it simple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recipe must include Tang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recipe must include alcohol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recipe must specify whether Tang should be prepared or in its pure powder form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will be decided at TAM by Skepchickal Judging Committe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will receive a prize&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skepchick of your choice will record the outgoing message on your voicemail or answering machine.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, lexicographer Erin McKean … gave a &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/erin_mckean_redefines_the_dictionary.html"&gt;TED talk&lt;/a&gt; about the evolution of language and the shortcomings of traditional dictionaries (an hour long, well worth your while). Since then she has been working on an entirely new sort of online dictionary to address some of those shortcomings, and it's now gone live (in beta) as &lt;a href="http://www.wordnik.com/"&gt;Wordnik&lt;/a&gt; (great name). In the words of Maria Popova at &lt;a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2009/06/10/wordnik/"&gt;Brain Pickings&lt;/a&gt;, "A crowdsourced toolkit for tracking and recording the evolution of language as it occurs, its goal is to gather as much information about a word as possible — not its mere definition, but also in-sentence examples, semantic “neighborhoods” of related words, images, statistics about usage, and more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This provides a comparison of the old site with the changed one - click on 'View Changes' about half way down the page on the left hnd side. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notice on the left hand side in the yellow box, the word 'Colic' with a line through it.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked one of my SciBlings and friends, Peter Lipson, aka Pal MD of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/" title=""&gt;White Coat Underground&lt;/a&gt;, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific/medical) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a husband, dad, and internist.  An internist is a medical doctor who specializes in adult health and disease.  I've always loved science, but medicine isn't a science as much as the practical application of science. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="PalMD pic.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/PalMD%20pic.JPG" width="448" height="336" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm pretty much stuck with the three roles I mentioned, being in the middle of life and all.  I'd love to do more writing and more teaching, if the economics of medicine were to allow it.  In addition to writing on medicine, I've recently started writing &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/fatherhood/" title=""&gt;on fatherhood&lt;/a&gt; as well.  Interestingly, this turned out to be both popular and controversial.  Part of blogging, for me at least, is showing how real live professionals balance the personal and professional.  The folks who don't like it, well, they can get their own blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, i also have a podcast (called "&lt;a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/WhiteCoatUndergroundPodcast" title=""&gt;The PalCast&lt;/a&gt;") that goes out a couple of times  a month where I discuss many of the same issues as I do on my blog, but in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love writing (and strangely, I include the PalCast in that) and wish being a grownup let me do more of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have my own private practice, and I teach medical residents and medical students at a teaching hospital.  I work about 60 hours a week and squeeze blogging into the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunity to reach a wide audience is fascinating.  Seriously, the people I've "met" online are interesting, smart, knowledgeable, even outside their own fields, and they've taught me a lot.  I expected my blogging to be 1) ignored, and when i failed at that, 2) expository.  It turns out that my readers know a lot and are willing to share their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had patients discover my writing, but it's not an integrated part of my work or home life.  I do have friends who read my stuff, but not that many.  I do use twitterfeed to tweet all of my blog posts.  I accept my readers as friends on facebook, but I don't use it that much. I don't really check my friendfeed much anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science/medical blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any new cool science/medical blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't know that much at the blogosphere when I started out.  I believe my first post was sometime around March of 07 on wordpress (the original blog is inactive and in storage so no links).  As I started to follow links, I ran into Orac's blog (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" title=""&gt;scienceblogs.com/insolence&lt;/a&gt;) and followed links around the medical blogosphere from there.  I've met some terrific people, and over the last several months I've been posting occasionally at &lt;a href="http://sciencebasedmedicine.com" title=""&gt;sciencebasedmedicine.com&lt;/a&gt;, a terrific blog run by David Gorski and Steve Novella about, well, science-based medicine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met some great people at SciOnline but I think I may have been the only med blogger around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;Many medical bloggers write under pseudonyms. You don't (at least not any more). What made you decide to blog under your own name?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    You co-moderated a &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Anonymity_Pseudonymity/" title=""&gt;session about pseudonymity&lt;/a&gt; on the blogs. There is still a lot of misunderstanding, including in the mainstream media, about the role of pseudonyms and the ways of building reputation online unconnected to one's real life persona. For example, a pseudonymous blogger was &lt;a href="http://853blog.wordpress.com/2009/06/21/if-you-cant-hack-it-dont-write-it/" title=""&gt;recently outed by media&lt;/a&gt; in the UK, right after he received the George Orwell prize for journalism (forgetting that 'George Orwell' was also a pseudonym). Where do you see the future regarding this issue - will it resolve itself over time? What can be done to persuade people that pseudonymus bloggers are not automatically less trustworthy, or that pseudonymous does not equal anonymous? Did you learn something about it from your own session?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing can be done to persuade people that pseudonymous bloggers are as trustworthy as named bloggers, but that's life.  Hopefully, the writing speaks for itself.  Critics of pseudonymous blogging often have a bone to pick with the content of the blog and use the author's identity as a straw man argument.  I pretty much feel that trustworthiness is a non-issue in this regard.  There are many other reasons to use a pseudonym, however.  I "came out" because I realized that some day I would be outed anyway and I didn't want to allow myself to rely on anonymity.  I do still blog under a pseudonym because it's part of my online identity---it's associated with my writing and ideas more closely than my real name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who out anonymous bloggers are assholes.  Still, if you're anonymous, you've got to remember that there's a lot of assholes out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just meeting people from so many different fields widened the scope of my reading (one of the first things I did when I got home was change my google reader subscriptions).  I also got lots of ideas from sources that to me were unlikely, such as &lt;a href="http://cromercrox.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Henry Gee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://skullsinthestars.com/" title=""&gt;gg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sciencereligionnews.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Salman Hameed&lt;/a&gt;, and many others outside of my field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you in person and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    Me too.  Let's hope the economy perks up a little!&lt;/p&gt;

I go on and on quite enough about those topics on a regular basis, and yet keep finding new things as yet unaddressed.  Like, the divide between theory and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a really fantastic slide I'm looking at on my handout from this presentation right now.  It says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can Self-Determination mean for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the determination (or drive) to do things for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting Personal goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing when to ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the courage to dream big and go after your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning who you are, what you want and how to make it happen.  (This is a lifelong process.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really, really like this slide.  It's vibrant, strong, empowering.  Real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are questions too.  How do people who have been systematically beaten down (and many of us have been) find that drive?  Or feel empowered to have goals beyond "I want my life to stop sucking hugely."  What happens when a person asks for help and no one listens, or no one cares?  Where is the courage to be found to dream when one has experienced little more than broken promises?  Who or what will help us to make what we want happen?  (No one makes their dreams happen all alone.)  How is a lifetime of being ignored or condescended to turned around and one encouraged to take the reigns of their own life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if younger people who have grown up in a culture of self-advocacy and self-determination will struggle less with these sorts of questions than today's generations who grew up without much encouragement.  Sometimes I think yes.  But other times I look at how little we are ever invited to give any input whatsoever into the things that affect our lives most and feel less optimistic.  I field questions from social workers like "what do I do when a parent won't let their child attend their person centered planning meeting because they claim their child can't understand what's going on, even though we know the child can" and I feel like the battle for empowerment is still being mostly lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can be done to increase self-advocacy and self-determination, practically, concretely, and for all individuals?  What are the key tools of empowerment?  How do we break away from those who always do things "for" us but never "with" us to find our own way?  What in "the system" or society may still need to change?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246033104204"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=14013">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/56a6b3d458f7b623</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Are Empty Wine Bottles on eBay Being Used for Counterfeiting?</title><published>2009-06-26T15:45:13Z</published><updated>2009-06-26T15:45:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/are-empty-wine-bottles-on-ebay-being-used-for-counterfeiting/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">One of the most &lt;a href="http://www.wine-economics.org/meetings/Reims2009/programinfo/Abstracts/Schamel.pdf"&gt;thought-provoking papers&lt;/a&gt; at this year's meeting of the American Association of Wine Economics was presented by &lt;a href="http://www.unibz.it/en/economics/people/StaffDetails.html?personid=12015&amp;amp;showtype=4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Günter Schamel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the Free University of Bolzano.</summary><author><name>By Robin Goldstein</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246032998604"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/06/the_magic_of_attraction_aka_at_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/907c11274e39c99c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Chaos"/><title type="html">The Magic of Attraction (aka Attractors in Dynamical Systems)</title><published>2009-06-26T16:14:25Z</published><updated>2009-06-26T16:14:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~3/ukIypTOM_Aw/the_magic_of_attraction_aka_at_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/06/the_magic_of_attraction_aka_at_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="html">&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/upload/2009/06/the_magic_of_attraction_aka_at/images-1.jpeg" width="137" height="103" alt="images-1.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chaos is a complicated topic. There are lots of preliminaries that are useful to understand if
you really want to grasp what chaos is, and how you can usefully analyze and characterize it. One
of the really useful concepts is &lt;em&gt;attractors&lt;/em&gt;. Attractors aren't specific
to chaotic systems - most real-world dynamical systems have attractors. But attractors
are extremely useful in understanding chaotic systems, and how they different
from more tractable dynamical systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; So what's an attractor? Take a dynamical system we described in the last post, and look at its
phase space. The phase space isn't just a random cluster of points. It's got a very rich structure
to it. An attractor is a piece of structure of many systems that appears when you view the systems
evolution over time. Speaking informally, an attractor is sort of like a black hole in the
phase space: it's a region of the space where if you get sucked into it, you'll never
leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Attractors have shapes, and the shape of the attractor can tell you lots of interesting
things about the behavior of the system. One interesting bit of trivia to convince
you to read the rest of this: chaotic systems have attractors, and the attractors for
chaotic systems &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; have &lt;em&gt;fractal&lt;/em&gt; shapes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/06/the_magic_of_attraction_aka_at_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/06/the_magic_of_attraction_aka_at_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/ukIypTOM_Aw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246031199449"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-2729719045185517733">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/24b6e375acaf4ec3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The Glory for Christ Football League</title><published>2009-06-26T15:32:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-26T15:41:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/06/glory-for-christ-football-league.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/2729719045185517733/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=2729719045185517733" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Normally I don&amp;#39;t like piling on and I don&amp;#39;t like making fun of spelling errors (because I make so many myself).

&lt;p&gt;Many times, however, the injury or disease offers a unique opportunity to gather information that otherwise would not have been possible. For example; stroke victims have been and continue to greatly enrich our knowledge of neuroscience.  Strokes typically disrupt the supply of blood to a part of the brain which then disables that specific part. The disability that then manifests itself offers a unique window into the function of that part of the brain that no experiment could match without risking jail time for the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true for genetic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooke Greenburg of Baltimore Maryland suffers from a unique disorder. She is 16 years old but appears to be about 11 months old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors have examined her dna and her condition is unrelated to more common aging diseases like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progeria"&gt;progeria&lt;/a&gt;. Her condition isn’t simply that aging has stopped. Various parts of her are aging at different rates. Her mind isn’t far from that of a very young infant but her short bones resemble those of an 10 year old in terms of cell structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might imagine, she suffers from other unusual problems as well like being unable to swallow. This is because her breathing and digestion are essentially different ages which prevents their careful coordination of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully we can learn from poor Brooke’s condition to not only potentially help her and others that may be born with this but perhaps to further elucidate the nature of aging itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read more details about this fascinating case &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17379-teenage-baby-may-lack-master-ageing-gene.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Adams, regular readers of this blog, is the "intellectual force" between that repository of quackery and sheer lunacy, NaturalNews.com. I hate him because he is a vile human being who cheerfully promotes bogus therapies on his website. (You know, I think we skeptics should borrow &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/i_really_admire_english_bloggers_and_com.php"&gt;Simon Singh's phraseology&lt;/a&gt; at every opportunity.) He's also an opportunistic ghoul who never, ever misses an opportunity to take advantage of a celebrity who's suffering from or dying of cancer to make breathlessly hysterical claims that they would have lived if they had just listened to him and gone for "natural" methods instead of "burning and poisoning." He did it with Tony Snow, who died of colorectal cancer. He did it with Christina Applegate, whose choice to undergo bilateral mastectomy for her breast cancer and her possessing a gene that put her at very high risk for further breast cancer he termed "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/a_ghoul_descends_upon_christina_applegat.php"&gt;maiming&lt;/a&gt;." Particularly despicable was his use and abuse of Patrick Swayze's battle with pancreatic cancer to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/abusing_celebrities_with_cancer_to_sell.php"&gt;criticize him for having said&lt;/a&gt; he would not undergo "alternative" therapy because, if woo-meisters could actually cure cancer they'd be famous and rich. Indeed, he even claimed that Swayze could still live if he gave up conventional medicine and went with "natural" treatments. Basically, there's no crazy too nutty and no depth to which Mike Adams will not sink in the service of promoting quackery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in a perverse way, I love Mike Adams for basically the same reasons. His website and utterances are an endless source of blog fodder. His website is such a target-rich environment, so full of teachable moments about  pseudoscience, logical fallacies, quackery, and just sheer illogic, that I sometimes think that I owe him a cut of all the filthy lucre I get from Seed for blogging here. (It ought to be enough to buy him a case of beer, anyway, and seeing what a drunk Mike Adams could come up with might just be worth the chance that he'd instead take the proceeds and invest it into his website.) Now he's gone and done it again. Get a load of this article called &lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/026504_medicine_Caduceus_western_medicine.html"&gt;The Caduceus Decoded: Secret Symbols Reveal Dark Agenda of Western Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. To read it is to see into the mind of a true crank who sees dark conspiracies in a single symbol and extrapolates and speculates beyond all reason. Not surprisingly, Adams dives deep into the woo right from the beginning:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/mike_adams_brings_home_the_crazy_over_of.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/mike_adams_brings_home_the_crazy_over_of.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/cGJr6C4s1h4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246028362948"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/home_schooling_priorities.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aa3dec92777c1ab9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Stupidity"/><title type="html">Home schooling priorities</title><published>2009-06-26T15:03:47Z</published><updated>2009-06-26T15:03:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/z6Dkfdk_hfQ/home_schooling_priorities.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/home_schooling_priorities.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's very kind of this &lt;a href="http://freethoughtfortwayne.org/2009/06/26/acedemic-pursuit/"&gt;home school football league to provide their list of priorities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Astronomers — even skeptical ones with a sense of humor and an eye for pareidolia — can miss things. In this case, I can hardly believe I somehow dropped the pigskin on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in April, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/13/dune-mars-2/"&gt;I posted an incredibly beautiful picture of sand dunes on Mars&lt;/a&gt; taken by the HIRISE camera. Here’s the picture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. I mean really, wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I was so drawn to the dunes that I missed something that, in retrospect, makes moi a bit of a fool. Look to the middle right; see that raised dome? Yeah? Well, look a little closer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See it? Maybe this comparison will help vous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s so obvious! And what makes it worse is as soon as I saw it I knew why it was there… all you have to do is look at this image of the Martian surface taken by the Viking 1 orbiter back in the 1970s…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all clear to me now. It’s not easy being red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh. Pareidolia is certainly subjective, of course, but as a wise swine once said, &amp;quot;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and it may be necessary from time to time to give a stupid or misinformed beholder a black eye.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Suzan Mazur is a strange writer who runs about trying to convince the world that there is going to be a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/altenberg_meeting_next_week_ex.php"&gt;revolution in evolutionary biology&lt;/a&gt;…but her sources tend to be fringe figures &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/03/journalistic_flibbertigibbet.php"&gt;like Stuart Pivar&lt;/a&gt;, or she relies on mangling quotes from people like &lt;a href="http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/"&gt;Massimo Pigliucci&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0803/S00270.htm"&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;. Her theme, as you might guess from her fondness for Pivar, is that structuralist tropes are going to replace genetic/molecular explanations for development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is complete nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, she reads Pharyngula (hi, Suzan!), where, to her delight, she discovered &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/an_ontogeny_of_toilet_drain_be.php"&gt;Vincent Fleury&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow crackpot. She scurried off to procure an &lt;a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0906/S00277.htm"&gt;interview with Fleury&lt;/a&gt;, which turns into a weird complaint session about me mixed with boosterism for overhyped flaky science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suzan Mazur: &lt;/b&gt;PZ Myers, the Howard Stern of sciencebloggers, recently reviewed your paper Clarifying tetrapod embryogenesis, a physicist's point of view, which was published in The European Physical Journal: Applied Physics. It appears Myers is increasingly doing a &lt;i&gt;pas de deux&lt;/i&gt; with the physical approach to evolutionary science, trying to reposition himself now that a paradigm shift is afoot. In essence, so he can maybe say, well I knew it all the time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Last week he praised D'Arcy Thompson and Brian Goodwin, saying he found Goodwin's work "thought-provoking". What is your response to Myers tactics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oooh, &amp;quot;the Howard Stern of sciencebloggers&amp;quot;…I&amp;#39;m going to have to renegotiate my contract with Seed so I can get $100 million/year, and once I do, I&amp;#39;ll start live-blogging strippers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, though, Mazur gets the science all wrong. There will be no paradigm shift. I am confident that there will be a gradual integration of more developmental biology into evolutionary theory, a process that is going on right now, but that this will require no radical re-evaluation of theory — evo-devo is exciting and opens up new areas of productive research, but it doesn&amp;#39;t turn the world upside-down. It&amp;#39;s a specific subset of evolutionary theory, not a replacement. As for structuralism, it has its place, too, and this isn&amp;#39;t some sudden ploy by me — you can find me writing about it in &lt;a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/brain_size_and_allometry/"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/bone_and_pattern/"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Again, it will not replace the molecular/genetic approach to development, but it can supplement it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at this bit of amateur psychologizing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vincent Fleury:&lt;/b&gt; Well that's fine. But I have a problem with this fellow. He uses a very rhetorical technique. He starts off with some smooth positive statement and then progressively trashes the paper. I'm not so sure it's sincere.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Suzan Mazur:&lt;/b&gt; It's his way of saying I love you. He knows he can't maintain his present ground, so he's increasingly introducing the newer evolutionary science, however he can. He projects himself as a bully so he won't look like a sissy when he has no choice but to go with the flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a simpler explanation than some strange conspiracy theory where all of evolutionary biology is trembling on the verge of collapse and I'm trying to dance on the edge of the avalanche. How about this one: Fleury's paper was very poor. It proposes a mechanism that he does not support with any evidence, and implies that we need to throw out a huge and useful body of knowledge. It was far too long, and larded with superfluous information that he largely ignored in his conclusion. He relied on the fact that he published a paper on &lt;i&gt;biology&lt;/i&gt; in a &lt;i&gt;physics&lt;/i&gt; journal, where he could bamboozle a body of reviewers with no knowledge of the scientific discipline being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why I trashed the paper — because it &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/an_ontogeny_of_toilet_drain_be.php"&gt;&lt;i&gt;deserved&lt;/i&gt; to be trashed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's really that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no, Fleury's work does not represent the "flow" of modern biology. It's more like a small stagnant eddy far from the major currents of research. If I were trying to position myself in the vanguard of science, I guarantee you that I wouldn't be trying to cozy up to the likes of Fleury or Pivar or Mazur. That's the crackpot club.&lt;/p&gt;

type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some parts of the blogosphere, headed up by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2006/05/co2_we_call_it_life.php"&gt;CEI&lt;/a&gt; (”&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/05/thank-you-for-emitting/"&gt;CO2: They call it pollution, we call it life!&lt;/a&gt;“), are all a-twitter over an apparently “suppressed” document that supposedly undermines the &lt;a href="http://epa.gov/climatechange/endangerment.html"&gt;EPA Endangerment finding&lt;/a&gt; about human emissions of carbon dioxide and a basket of other greenhouse gases. Well a &lt;a href="http://cei.org/cei_files/fm/active/0/DOC062509-004.pdf" rel="no_follow"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of this “suppressed” document has been released and we can now all read this allegedly devastating critique of the EPA science.  Let’s take a look…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off the authors of the submission; &lt;a href="http://carlineconomics.googlepages.com/"&gt;Alan Carlin&lt;/a&gt; is an economist and &lt;a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/ee/epa/staff.nsf/348bbac1f87821598525647e007ba7c7/d43600ea1d3cca2c8525691c0044f4fa!OpenDocument"&gt;John Davidson&lt;/a&gt; is an ex-member of the Carter administration Council of Environmental Quality. Neither are climate scientists. That’s not necessarily a problem – perhaps they have mastered multiple fields? – but it is likely an indication that the analysis is not going to be very technical (and so it will prove). Curiously, while the authors work for the &lt;a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/ee/epa/eed.nsf/webpages/homepage"&gt;NCEE&lt;/a&gt; (National Center for Environmental Economics), part of the EPA, they appear to have rather closely collaborated with one Ken Gregory (his inline comments appear at multiple points in the draft). Ken Gregory if you don’t know is a leading light of the &lt;a href="http://sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Friends_of_Science"&gt;Friends of Science&lt;/a&gt; – a astroturf anti-climate science lobbying group based in Alberta. Indeed, parts of the Carlin and Davidson report appear to be lifted directly from Ken’s rambling &lt;a href="http://www.friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/FOS%20Essay/Climate_Change_Science.html" rel="no_follow"&gt;magnum opus&lt;/a&gt; on the FoS site. However, despite this odd pedigree, the scientific points &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; still be valid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their main points are nicely summarised thus: a) the science is so rapidly evolving that IPCC (2007) and CCSP (2009) reports are already out of date, b) the globe is cooling!, c) the consensus on hurricane/global warming connections has moved from uncertain to ambiguous, d) Greenland is not losing mass, no sirree…, e) the recession will save us!, f) water vapour feedback is negative!, and g) Scafetta and West’s statistical fit of temperature to an obsolete solar forcing curve means that all other detection and attribution work is wrong. From this “evidence”, they then claim that all variations in climate are internal variability, except for the warming trend which is caused by the sun, oh and by the way the globe is cooling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devastating eh? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can see a number of basic flaws here; the complete lack of appreciation of the importance of natural variability on short time scales, the common but erroneous belief that any attribution of past climate change to solar or other forcing means that CO2 has no radiative effect, and a hopeless lack of familiarity of the basic science of detection and attribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets worse, what solid peer reviewed science do they cite for support? A &lt;a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/05/23/evidence-of-a-lunisolar-influence-on-decadal-and-bidecadal-oscillations-in-globally-averaged-temperature-trends/" rel="no_follow"&gt;heavily-criticised&lt;/a&gt; blog posting showing that there are bi-decadal periods in climate data and that this proves &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_The_Sun_Wot_Won_It"&gt;it was the sun wot done it&lt;/a&gt;.  The work of an award-winning astrologer (one &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Landscheidt"&gt;Theodor Landscheidt&lt;/a&gt;, who also thought that the rise of Hitler and Stalin were due to &lt;a href="http://bourabai.narod.ru/landscheidt/consider.htm" rel="no_follow"&gt;cosmic cycles&lt;/a&gt;), a classic Courtillot paper we’ve &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/11/les-chevaliers-de-lordre-de-la-terre-plate-part-i-allgre-and-courtillot/"&gt;discussed before&lt;/a&gt;, the aforementioned FoS web page, another web page run by Doug Hoyt, a paper by Garth Paltridge reporting on artifacts in the NCEP reanalysis of water vapour that are in contradiction to every other reanalysis, direct observations and satellite data, a complete reprint of another un-peer reviewed paper by William Gray, a nonsense paper by &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wiki/index.php?title=Ferenc_Miskolczi"&gt;Miskolczi&lt;/a&gt; etc. etc. I’m not quite sure how this is supposed to compete with the four rounds of international scientific and governmental review of the IPCC or the rounds of review of the CCSP reports….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don’t even notice the contradictions in their own cites. For instance, they show a figure that demonstrates that galactic cosmic ray and solar trends are non-existent from 1957 on, and yet cheerfully quote Scafetta and West who claim that almost all of the recent trend is solar driven! They claim that climate sensitivity is very small while failing to realise that this implies that solar variability can’t have any effect either. They claim that GCM simulations produced trends over the twentieth century of 1.6 to 3.74ºC – which is simply (and bizarrely) &lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/graphics/graphics/ar4-wg1/jpg/fig-9-5.jpg"&gt;wrong&lt;/a&gt; (though with all due respect, that one seems to come directly from Mr. Gregory). Even more curious, Carlin appears to be a big fan of &lt;a href="http://carlineconomics.googlepages.com/whyadifferent"&gt;geo-engineering&lt;/a&gt;, but how this squares with his apparent belief that we know nothing about what drives climate, is puzzling. A sine qua non of geo-engineering is that we need models to be able to predict what is likely to happen, and if you think they are all wrong, how could you have any faith that you could effectively manage a geo-engineering approach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, they end up with the oddest claim in the submission: That because human welfare has increased over the twentieth century at a time when CO2 was increasing, this somehow implies that no amount of CO2 increases can ever cause a danger to human society. This is just boneheadly stupid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary, what we have is a ragbag collection of un-peer reviewed web pages, an unhealthy dose of sunstroke, a dash of astrology and &lt;a href="http://tamino.wordpress.com/2009/06/26/embarrassing-questions/"&gt;more cherries&lt;/a&gt; than you can poke a cocktail stick at. Seriously, if that’s the best they can do, the EPA’s ruling is on pretty safe ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were the authors, I’d suppress this myself, and then go for a long hike on the Appalachian Trail….&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>gavin</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1246019104469"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-4308786812148830017">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3cde7623dea2c5e4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Michael Jackson, Allah, and Why Certain People Should be the First to Reject Christianity</title><published>2009-06-26T09:11:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-26T09:29:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/otIlrspc-5s/michael-jackson-allah-and-why-certain.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/4308786812148830017/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=4308786812148830017" title="27 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/06/michael-jackson-allah-and-why-certain.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">Upon the sudden death of Michael Jackson, his brother Jermaine announced his death and closed by saying, "May Allah be with you, Michael, always." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wonder why African Americans would ever embrace Christianity given their history as slaves in Christian America. The same thing goes for Native Americans who were conquered by American Christians (ala &lt;em&gt;Manifest Destiny&lt;/em&gt;), as well as Mexican and Hispanic Christians who believe what they do because of the Spanish Conquistadors who killed, raped and plundered their ancestors. Why would anyone like them embrace such a faith?

&lt;p&gt;CT is nowhere near the bible belt, and is not usually a place to find fire and brimstone sermons. But there has been a subculture of demonology and exorcism here. I can’t be sure exactly why that is true, but it may have something to do with the historical connection with ghosthunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote earlier in the week about our past investigation of the Warrens - perhaps the most famous ghost hunters.  Well, Ed Warren was a self-proclaims demonologist, and as part of his schtick he professed belief in demons and evil spirits. He even occasionally worked with ministers and a defrocked priest who performed exorcisms (without the sanction of the church).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also investigated a spin-off group from the Warrens that actually specialized in exorcism and advocated it as a treatment for apparent mental illness. This group, the Hartford Office for Paranormal Exploration (HOPE) was run by a physician (ack!) and sponsored many exorcisms - some of which I was able to view on video tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing you need to realize about exorcisms is that they are extremely boring - nothing much happens. That might have something to do with the fact that demons are not real, and so what you get is a bit of bad acting from someone desperate for attention and perhaps who has issues with reality. Or, in some cases it is the parent who is delusional, and so you have kids who are sitting there being figidty - and that is taken as evidence of their demonic state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one case, absolutely nothing happened at all, and that was taken as evidence that the demons fled as soon as the exorcist came into the house. There you go - if something happens that is evidence for demons, and if nothing happens that is strong evidence for demons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So perhaps it is more the ghost-hunting and demonology tradition of CT, rather than its particular religious tradition, that has led to the local exorcisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we see a trend that has been occuring for the past decade or so - blaming any perceived “problem” on a specific demon. Apparently, there are demons of gluttony, lust, gambling, and just nautiness. Whatever ails you. In some cases we see the merger of Christianity, demonology, and the self-help industry - a winning combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of a demon of homosexuality, of course, also introduces the pseudoscientific notion, promoted almost entirely by religious traditions that frown upon homosexuality, that being gay is a moral choice or something that happens to someone - like a demonic possession. Rather - homosexuality is simply a normal biological variant seen is virtually all species. The evidence also strongly suggests that it is not a choice - any more than heterosexuality is a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the allegations are true, then I hope the hammer comes down hard on this church, for child abuse and violation of a person’s civil rights. I am all in favor of religious freedom, but there is a clear ethical and legal line to be drawn at child abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We confirmed the date - ScienceOnline'10 will be on 15-17th January 2010 in Triangle, NC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will have science and food related tours on Friday, ending with something special in the evening, followed by regular programming on Saturday (whole day) and Sunday (until noon). So, mark your calendars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll post more information as it becomes available, but briefly: we are having it, economic crisis or not. Sigma Xi is the likely venue (but not 100% sure yet - it's just so hard to find a place as nice that could accommodate perhaps 50 extra people). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll have a small registration fee (as sponsors are unlikely to shower us with riches in this economic situation), so we can be sure to have enough funds to run the conference, even if we have to cut down somewhat on the luxuries we used to shower you all with. Registration fee also ensures that people who register are committed to show up and are not just holding a place, "just in case", while 50 others are waiting on the waiting list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if your company is doing fine financially and you are willing to become a sponsor, then there will be no need to cut back on anything. Sponsor a meal, or an event, or travel costs for some poor students, or technical support (power, wifi, recording, livestreaming), though every organizer also loves to have some discretionary funds that can be used for whatever need arises in the last moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll expand our organizing committee (there is a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/north_carolina_sciencenatureme.php" title=""&gt;large pool&lt;/a&gt; of people interested) at a party/cookout in late July or early August, when we'll make a division of labor. More information about that later. We are also going to ask the community for ideas soon (not yet about sessions, but about ways to make the conference work better, go smoothly, become more attractive, etc.) using a Woofoo form or a wiki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone want to design the logo and banner for the conference? The old one says "'09" and we need one that doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So stay tuned - there will be regular updates here, on our Twitter/FriendFeed/Facebook streams, and on the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogging.com/" title=""&gt;scienceblogging.com&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2009/06/all_hail_honeybees_and_their_p.html"&gt;NPR blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Mother Nature has lots of other pollinators — typically five to ten types — that visit a single plant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still, bumblebees and bats could use tending, too, he says. To improve their lives, try to plant local wildflowers and heirloom fruits and veggies. Native plants suited to the local climate and soil are likelier to flourish and feed bees. Steer clear of the ornately ruffled sophisticates that have spent generations in a hothouse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breeding a plant for our taste often inadvertently breeds out the goodies–the sweet nectar–that pollinators seek.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe you may remember an earlier &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/01/29/time-to-buy-seeds/"&gt;rant&lt;/a&gt; here about “pollenless” varieties of plants I was finding in my seed catalogs &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/face-smile.png" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pollinator Partnership has an &lt;a href="http://www.pollinator.org/zip-map.test.htm"&gt;interactive zipcode map to suggest plants&lt;/a&gt; that will please your local native pollinators.  You’ll get a full collor multi-page PDF document to download explaining what kinds of plants different pollinators like, and some plant suggestions.  The Xerces Society also has some nice &lt;a href="http://www.xerces.org/plant-lists/"&gt;lists of plants for pollinators&lt;/a&gt; you can download, too!&lt;/p&gt;

Looks like Dora and I did it again, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/which_meds"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/maladaptive_vs_adaptive_and_insistence_on_sameness"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chicago/chi-autism-research-city-zone-24jun24,0,3324184.story"&gt;the same (Chicago Tribune) article&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. Dora's &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/maladaptive_vs_adaptive_and_insistence_on_sameness"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; focused on precisely the topic that drew me to the article, the notion of "insistence on sameness" and, in particular, on "insistence on sameness" as something as "maladaptive" and in needing of lessening or, even, outright eliminating. &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/reducing_repetitive_behaviors_with_meds_not_the_goal"&gt;Repetitive behaviors&lt;/a&gt; can rather be seen as an individual's attempts to self-calm and adapt to a world that's not so readily going to adapt to her or him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd been thinking a lot about sameness with the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/summertime"&gt;end of Charlie's regular school year&lt;/a&gt;. And, on Thursday and for half of Friday, Jim and I were encouraging Charlie to, indeed, not do "the same old same old" and veer from his routine. Yesterday, I spoke at the &lt;a href="http://www.hmc.psu.edu/ce/immunization.htm"&gt;15th Annual Pennsylvania Immunization Conference&lt;/a&gt; in Grantville, Pennsylvania, which is near Hershey (as in bar, as in chocolate), Pennsylvania. I spoke on "Autism and Vaccines: A Parent's Perspective"---on why we once (very irrationally) worried (but we did worry) that vaccines could have "contributed" to autism in Charlie; and about how, when he was 8 and everything was set for him to start in a new school district except that he was not up to date on his vaccines, we gave ourselves a good shake and got him up to date, and it was No Big Deal. I talked about the tremendous amount of energy and passion devoted to this issue and how this is, ultimately, a huge distraction from the real issues that real individuals and their families face, the need for education and schools, supports and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, I talked about &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/the-vaccine-autism-urban-myth/"&gt;the same&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/a-not-so-religious-exemption/"&gt;things&lt;/a&gt; I've been writing about while blogging at &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com"&gt;Autism Vox&lt;/a&gt; (to the point that I sometimes thought I should temporarily rename the blog Autism Vax). I won't be surprised to be referred to as a "paid Pharma shill" or some such and to be supplied (in the comments to this post and elsewhere) with numerous links to numerous articles, websites, studies studies studies pointing to a "link" between autism and vaccines (there is no link), informing me I'm wrong, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's more of the same---what is it about certain autism topics that they become so perseverated upon?---and, rather than write a post &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_vaccine-autism_scare_panic_in_the_wrong_place"&gt;like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/behind_the_vaccine_scare_parental_fear"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; I have already &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/vaccines_and_autism_a_matter_of_the_heart"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_once_and_former_warrior_mom"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, here's something about the change in Jim's, Charlie's and my routine from going to Grantville, PA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference was something over two hours away from where we live in New Jersey and I was scheduled to speak at 10.15am on Thusday morning, so we thought it best to leave on Wednesday evening. As of the past year, Charlie has been much more resistant to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/in_transition"&gt;traveling&lt;/a&gt; beyond his usual circle of places, as we realized on our last trip to California, when Charlie made it clear, he wanted to be h-o-m-e and N-O-W. In the past year, he's been generally more insistent (and communicating this to us) about keeping some things----where we eat, what he eats, what order we do things in while at the pool---the same. The past year having been &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_time_of_perpetual_transitions_adolescence"&gt;a time of perpetual transitions&lt;/a&gt; for Charlie, it makes sense to us that Charlie would be seeking to create some waystations---markers---to rely on in the midst of much turbulence both inside him (physically, certainly) and all around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are times when he and we seem to be stuck in a box, so in need of maintaining the same old same old that it feels impossible to do anything else. What do you do if the one diner he has to eat at is closed for renovations? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Or if he and Jim can't ride their usual route because a large and loud dog came running out and stood (stymied most likely by an electronic fence) barking away? (Charlie remains very wary of dogs, and keeps a safe distance.) Or if we can't swim at the pool because it's been closed due to thunderstorms?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, too, after he's been eating the same requested item over and over, Charlie only picks at the food (always odd for him) or, as has occurred in some cases, hurls it across the room. As his parents, looking him to keep him not only learning and progressing but, simply, happy, Jim and I can't help letting our thoughts fly to the future when we are, yes, gone---a huge and ultimate change that will happen to Charlie, and that we won't be around to help him through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So from Monday on, we talked a little about how, on Wednesday, we'd be driving to Pennsylvania and staying in a hotel. I showed Charlie photos of the Holiday Inn and also of nearby &lt;a href="http://www.hersheypark.com/index.php"&gt;Hershey Park&lt;/a&gt; and its water rides and ferris wheel. Charlie's eyes got big and his face serious as he said "Pennsylvania," "stay in a hotel," and "rides," very solemnly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday night we packed the black car with his iPod and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/worry_beads"&gt;worry beads&lt;/a&gt; and various other familiar items (and, yes, clothes and swimsuits). Charlie sat straight up in the back seat as Jim drove west, occasionally hunkering down into one of his blankets. He went right into the hotel and sat in a chair with a big smile, then got up wanting to eat; we walked into an Italian restaurant just as it was closing and Jim and I got stromboli, Charlie fries. (He never ate pizza for years while on the gluten-free casein-free diet, and now shows no inclination to.) Back in the hotel room, Charlie sat for a long time looking at a pack of ketchup---it wasn't the usual Heinz---and then dug in. He showered and watched YouTube on my laptop, then got under the covers and told us "bedtime."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten quiet minutes passed and Charlie leapt out of the bed and into a roller desk chair, and said "no, no, no" about going to sleep in a, yes, strange bed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim and I assured Charlie that we'd be home tomorrow (in less than 24 hours, for sure). After a couple more "no" 's, Charlie got back into the bed and went to sleep, though he twitched and frowned when the fan for the air conditioner came on, so we switched it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday morning, I went for a walk around the very large hotel parking lot to meditate on my speech. Charlie was up when I came back and, while I went to the conference, he and Jim checked out and headed for Hershey. They found a diner but it wasn't like &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/diner_date"&gt;the ones in Jersey&lt;/a&gt; and Jim, having eaten a rather greasy omelet, found himself obliged (ordered) to eat an equally greasy breakfast-Philly-cheesesteak-sandwich thing he'd gotten for Charlie. (Charlie pushed his plate towards Jim's: "Dad, eat.") They ended up under the familiar Golden Arches and so did the &lt;i&gt;eau de fast food&lt;/i&gt; waft at me as I opened the door of the black car when they picked me up in front of the hotel. Charlie requested "home" and had a big no to any amusements (such as they are) at Hershey Park, and back east we went. And spent the rest of the day hanging around the house, shopping at the usual grocery store, roaming in and out of the kitchen while I chopped green onions and ginger and vegetables, and riding bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we had a little change of scenery in our days before returning to the usual---enough to make us all (well, Jim and me at any rate) appreciate being home and, yes, the "same old same old."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's not that Charlie always does the same things or wants things to be always the same. But he does want and need to have a say in when it's time to keep the "same old same old," and when it's time to let go. He used to be very insistent on a &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/permanence-in-change/"&gt;certain ghost-face-shaped bucket&lt;/a&gt; being in his old blue backpack, and on a ragtag assortment of old photos stored therein. The bucket cracked and splintered some time ago and I spent a lot of time duct-taping it together, per Charlie's requests. At some point, water got into the backpack and many of the photos stuck together and got discolored and misshapen; Charlie insisted on keeping all of them and Jim and I, choosing our battles, said, sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a week and a half ago I found Charlie sitting on the floor of his room. He had dumped out all the photos and was looking them over. Some he tore and handed to me. Then he took the photos and put them in batches into the garbage, and the bucket too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Charlie was asleep, I dug through the garbage and salvaged what bits of photos were still intact and identifiable. We have tons of digital photos of Charlie (and my parents have boxes, albums, and many more on their computer too), but many of the photos that Charlie had in the old ghost bucket were of when he was little and I didn't yet have a digital camera. I was glad to keep what I could, to see a much smaller Charlie, pulling at a box of Teletubbies figurines I couldn't open fast enough, or astride his red trike in our living room once upon a time in St. Paul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still the same face, the same boy and yet, so very changed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245997210545"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/megaconference_special_1_of_6_violence_and_abuse">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c4fbc9b2201ce79d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Megaconference Special #1 of 6: Violence and Abuse</title><published>2009-06-26T05:53:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-26T05:53:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/megaconference_special_1_of_6_violence_and_abuse" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37205795@N03/3423976005/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3372/3423976005_90980a7b03_m.jpg" alt="black and white photo, closeup of a woman&amp;#39;s profile, her hand up palm open.  written on her palm are the words &amp;#39;SILENCE HIDES VIOLENCE.&amp;#39;  she has short, straight, dark hair." style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We are now into Dora's Funky Conference Posting Pattern (that is, deeply erratic) as I try to write around my three days attending the &lt;a href="http://www.oregonmegaconference.org/index.html"&gt;Oregon Disability Megaconference&lt;/a&gt;.  I usually try to arrange for a guest to take over for me when I'm going to be stressing my limits at conferences, but this time I was too busy to even set up a guest.  So y'all will have to put up with a change in my usual posting routine.  As well posts about what I learned at the conference and nothing else the next three days.  But hey--it's spice to keep things different and interesting?  Maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was the first day of the conference, and I attended two presentations by &lt;a href="http://asksaal.org"&gt;Self Advocates as Leaders&lt;/a&gt; (full disclosure: I'm a SAAL member and currently sit on their Editorial Board).  The first one was on violence and abuse (and how to protect yourself from such), and the second was on self-advocacy and self determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new thing for me to think about from the violence and abuse presentation was an (even) deeper appreciation for the complexity of power imbalances.  It is true that people with disabilities are more often abused than others.  It is also true that abusers are most typically abusive for reasons of power.  It is also true that people in power are more often believed or allowed to stay in power.  This puts people like me, who are typically on the lowest rung in any power situation, in a really vulnerable position.  Many times people have justified being extremely mean to me by saying I brought it on myself because I did not behave in a socially typical manner.  One way to stay out of trouble is to bring someone trusted  (best if that person is in a high power position) to any sort of confrontation about abuse or cruelty.  This can change the power balance and make it harder for the abusive person to get away with the abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also really liked this list of "red flags" that someone may become abusive: jealousy, controlling behaviors, isolation, unrealistic expectations, cruelty to animals or children, blames others for problems, history of abusive behaviors.  When I think back to the people who have been very mean to me, every one of them has exhibited one or more of the items on that list of "red flags."  Especially controlling behaviors and blames others for problems.  I'm going to be more watchful in the future; this list may help me to avoid some of the bad situations I often get into because I am too much of an optimist about people's capacity for decency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my evaluation form for the presentation, I was asked how I planned to share what I learned with others.  I answered that I would would blog about what I learned.  So there it is.  Hope some of these things I learned will be helpful to others too.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245996420967"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=540">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aa2e72664ef50fae</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Acupuncture"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><title type="html">“Acupuncture Anesthesia”: a Proclamation from Chairman Mao (Part IV)</title><published>2009-06-26T06:00:11Z</published><updated>2009-06-26T06:00:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=540" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;h3&gt;The Cultural Revolution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After investigating ‘acupuncture anesthesia’ in the People’s Republic of China in 1973, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=494"&gt;John Bonica&lt;/a&gt; wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the guarded comments made by several anesthesiologists, I concluded that this disuse [of ‘acupuncture anesthesia,’ after its introduction in 1958 until the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution"&gt;Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution&lt;/a&gt; began in 1966] was the result of disappointing failures in a significant proportion of patients. During the Cultural Revolution this “negative” trend of not using acupuncture was considered the work of revisionists, and subsequently greater emphasis was given to the widespread use of acupuncture in all hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, according to Petr Skrabanek,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who dared ask such awkward questions [about ‘acupuncture anesthesia’] were branded as “counter-revolutionary revisionists.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skrabanek’s reference for that assertion was this 37-page pamphlet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img width="428" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3378/3657285718_bd5bc19314.jpg?v=0" height="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left" style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been published by the Beijing &lt;a href="http://www.china.org.cn/english/2006/Sep/182650.htm"&gt;Foreign Languages Press&lt;/a&gt; in 1972, smack in the middle of the Cultural Revolution and only one year after &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=131"&gt;James Reston’s&lt;/a&gt; trip to China. It is the epitome of ‘revolutionary’ literature, as these excerpts and photos attest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left" style="text-align:center"&gt; &lt;img width="492" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3643/3656678605_57a0c2c351_o.jpg" height="671"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left" style="text-align:center"&gt; &lt;img width="377" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3332/3657437278_226024ca3f.jpg" height="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left" style="text-align:center"&gt; &lt;img width="497" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3308/3656652663_17511b3a98_o.jpg" height="663"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text is filled with extravagant claims for the success and widespread use of acupuncture anesthesia, which we know from Dr. Bonica’s reports are untrue. From &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=505"&gt;Kim Taylor&lt;/a&gt; we learned that the ’science’ underpinning the new TCM is not science in the usual sense, and this pamphlet bears that out. Dialectical materialism and Chairman Mao (who is praised on nearly every page) are credited with providing not only the motivation, but the conceptual basis for the practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Great Cultural Revolution, medical workers at the P.L.A. Kwangchow Units Central Hospital, the Peking Tuberculosis Research Institute, the No. 1 Tuberculosis Central Hospital in Shanghai and other hospitals conscientiously studied Chairman Mao’s philosophical works to guide their practice. Boldly experimenting on themselves with needles to determine the degree of pain, they eliminated the unnecessary points and, by grasping the main contradiction and bringing into play the role of the main points, succeeded in reducing the needles to a few and sometimes even to one…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese medical and scientific workers are making still greater efforts in studying Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tsetung Thought and are using dialectical materialism to guide their medical work and scientific research. Daring in practice and in breaking new ground, they are bending their efforts to perfect acupuncture anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pamphlet also makes extravagant claims for other uses of acupuncture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese medical workers have in the last few years discovered many new points and cured many ‘incurable’ diseases. Deep needling of the yamen point, for instance, enables deaf-mutes to hear and speak, and in some cases of infantile paralysis or paraplegia, suitable stimuli from needling certain points can, after a period of treatment, restore the functions of limbs paralysed for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skrabanek’s assertion about “awkward questions” must have been based on this passage (emphasis in the original):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; ‘New things always have to experience difficulties and setbacks as they grow.&lt;/strong&gt;‘&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No sooner had acupuncture anaesthesia appeared than it was suppressed by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Shaoqi"&gt;Liu Shao-chi&lt;/a&gt;’s counter-revolutionary revisionist line and attacked by bourgeois ‘experts.’ In a vain attempt to nip it in the bud, they raved that it was ‘not scientific,’ ‘without any practical value,’ and a ‘retrogression’ in the history of anaesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeatedly studying Chairman Mao’s teaching &lt;strong&gt;‘We cannot just take the beaten track traversed by other countries in the development of technology and trail behind them at a snail’s pace,’&lt;/strong&gt; the medical workers made up their minds to break new ground for anesthesiology. Disregarding ridicule and attacks, they persisted in accumulating experience through clinical practice and constantly raising the efficacy and widening the scope of applying acupuncture anaesthesia in operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution swept away the bourgeois trash, and revolutionary medical workers relentlessly criticized Liu Shao-chi’s counter-revolutionary revisionist line in health work and scientific research. This facilitated great development and improvement in acupuncture anaesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion: Seeking Truth from Facts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Part I of this series we saw that in many of the operations witnessed by Westerners in the 1970s, ‘acupuncture anesthesia’ had been supplemented with sedatives, narcotics, and local anesthetics. We also saw that some people seem surpisingly tolerant of surgical procedures performed without anesthesia, and that during the 19th century Western surgeons had been particularly impressed by that capacity in Chinese patients. In Part II we saw abundant, albeit indirect evidence that many patients undergoing surgery with ‘acupuncture anesthesia’ in China during the early 1970s felt substantial pain, but upon questioning denied it. Part II ended with this question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rather than being an important Chinese achievement, was ‘acupuncture anesthesia’ more a form of torture perpetrated by a totalitarian government on its own citizens, with the forced complicity of physicians?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historian Paul Unschuld, considering the time of Nixon’s visit to China, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Medicine-Paul-U-Unschuld/dp/0912111550"&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; in 1997:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attempts to use needles instead of drugs to achieve anesthesia even in major surgical operations have in the meantime slipped into deserved oblivion, just as much as collective management and public self-criticism. It was not until after the ‘Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution’ in 1976 and the opening of China in 1978 that Chinese doctors were able to report, without personal risk, about the pain that patients had been expected to endure through therapy applied in operating theaters not on the basis of scientific knowledge, but in accordance with the ideological precepts of the Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers who are familiar with the origin of the People’s Republic of China or who have read Part III of this series will recognize the subtitle of this section as a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotations_from_Chairman_Mao_Zedong"&gt;quotation from Chairman Mao&lt;/a&gt;. It was also part of the title of an essay written in 1980 by two of the doctors referred to by Paul Unschuld, Keng Hsi-chen and T’ao Nai-huang. An English translation of their essay is printed in another of Unschuld’s books and is intermittently available almost in its entirety &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MCXqmHj-fHIC&amp;amp;dq=unschuld+medicine+in+china&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=bn&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=gY9CStb1KsaJtgegyvSXCQ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=5"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, beginning on p. 360. Here are the essential excerpts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pushing of acupuncture anesthesia into large areas of clinical application cannot be separated from the peculiar historical conditions in our country of that time. During the period of the ‘Cultural Revolution,’ acupuncture anesthesia served politically as a standard to judge progress or backwardness, revolution or nonrevolution. Physicians and patients were under the pressure of the political requirements of that time. They had no choice but to have exceptional courage in order to carry out or undergo surgery, especially as the patients who felt pain could not cry out. Some resorted to shouting political slogans during surgery in a loud voice. At one place, the chairman of ophthalmology was enthusiastic about acupuncture anesthesia, and he tried the knife at his own eyelid. Finally he reached the conclusion: the effects are not good, it should not be extended. He wrote a report to higher authorities and as a result he was labeled one with three hats [i.e., an intellectual not interested in practice] and met the criticism of the masses. Under this type of political pressure, not a few people made statements against their will and acted against their conscience. Thus, in some hospitals the rate of acupuncture anesthesia utilization reached 20 percent, but among these, 80 percent were ligation operations. In other hospitals before clinical application of acupuncture anesthesia, the patients were given already sufficient amounts of anesthetic drugs through injection and then, in addition, needles were pierced into their ears pretending acupuncture anesthesia. Only joy was reported but no sorrow; one did not dare to tell the facts. This of course had decisive influence on how the concerned leadership department passed correct decisions regarding the real situation of acupuncture anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our opinions expressed here are not taken out of thin air. We, the authors, have in the past, from 1969 through 1977, as part of our work in the hospital, conducted more than thirty thousand surgical operations under acupuncture anesthesia as an exploratory practice in order to warmheartedly promote acupuncture anesthesia. This represents about 1.5% of all cases of surgery under acupuncture anesthesia in our country. This tremendous amount of practice has led us to publish the opinions offered above. Also, these opinions are not really our own original ideas, they are extensively discussed and acknowledged among medical personnel of anesthetics and surgery. It is just that due to the political pressure of the past period, nobody dared to state them openly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to the question, then, is clear. Most Westerners—Michael DeBakey and John Bonica being exceptions—who observed ‘acupuncture anesthesia’ in China during the Cultural Revolution seem to have failed to recognize what was going on right under their noses. No surprise, then, that many Westerners continued to have an insatiable appetite for the exotic ‘healing’ wares of the Mysterious Orient, and even post-Mao China has been &lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/summary/276/21/1707"&gt;only too willing&lt;/a&gt; to accomodate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Epilogue: if not Anesthesia, is there Acupuncture Analgesia?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years after his trip to China, John Bonica &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/327979?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; his experience using acupuncture to treat patients in his pain clinic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the University of Washington Pain Clinic, a self-selected series of 100 patients suffering from chronic pain refractory to other forms of conventional therapy undertook a trial of acupuncture analgesia at weekly intervals. Although the initial results were often spectacularly successful, following the third treatment, long-term benefit from acupuncture analgesia was as disappointing as other forms of therapy for this intractable group of patients. None of the 100 patients showed any continued objective evidence of pain relief, ie, medication intake and functional impairment continued despite claimed subjective relief in a small percentage of the patients. Only three out of the hundred patients claimed long-term (upwards of three months) pain relief from a course of acupuncture at approximately weekly intervals, but they did not, as a result of this claimed relief, decrease analgesic medicines or improve their activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar patterns of response to acupuncture therapy for chronic pain states have been noted by other investigators. In a well-controlled clinical trial, Lee and associates demonstrated that it did not matter if the needles were inserted in traditional meridian points or in “control” points. The results were similar: temporary relief. Only 18% of their 261 patients obtained good relief (15%) beyond four weeks after a series of four acupuncture treatments…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny: such findings are remarkably similar to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=252"&gt;those&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=492"&gt;continue&lt;/a&gt; to be &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=351"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; more than 30 years later. Is that telling us something?&lt;/p&gt;

Right on the heels of the Zicam and &lt;a href="http://industry.bnet.com/pharma/10001915/why-hydroxycut-had-to-kill-someone-before-the-fda-could-act/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydroxycut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bans,&lt;a href="http://industry.bnet.com/pharma/10002773/fda-bans-herbal-ed-pills-with-lethal-viagra-equivalent-gloves-off-in-fight-with-herbal-producers/"&gt; the latest product the FDA is pulling off the shelves is &lt;strong&gt;Stamina-Rx&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a viagra-like pill marketed to increase sexual stamina and arousal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it also contained &lt;strong&gt;benzamidenafil&lt;/strong&gt;, an unapproved drug in the same class as &lt;strong&gt;Viagra, Levitra &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Cialis&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If those drugs are taken by anyone using nitrates to treat high blood pressure the combined effect can be lethal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this is going to piss off the Alt. Med. community who will complain that this is an evil conspiracy by “Big Pharma” to bring down the poor, defenseless, mom and pop herbalist because for some incomprehensible imaginary reason that only makes sense in the minds of the self-deluded, the pharmaceutical companies couldn’t profit off of herbal products if they did really work. But in actuality, it’s not just Big Herbal that gets hurt by this measure but also the pharmaceutical companies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big losers in this push will not be consumers looking for herbal remedies. Rather, it will be the giant herbal companies and drug corporations with “nutritional” divisions. Check out &lt;a href="http://www.crnusa.org/who_omc.html"&gt;the list of member companies that belong to the Council for Responsible Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t see many hippies or mom-and-pop remedy makers, do you? The names include &lt;strong&gt;Bayer, Wyeth, Abbott, Dow Chemical, GlaxoSmithKline &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Novartis, &lt;/strong&gt;alongside &lt;strong&gt;Herbalife &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Country Life&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Farrah Fawcett has &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/arts/television/26fawcett.html"&gt;lost her three year battle with anal cancer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Farrah Fawcett, an actress and television star whose good looks and signature flowing hairstyle influenced a generation of women and bewitched a generation of men, beginning with a celebrated pinup poster, died Thursday morning in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 62 and lived in West Los Angeles.
 
Her death, at St. John's Health Center, was caused by anal cancer, which she had been battling since 2006, said her spokesman, Paul Bloch.

&lt;p&gt;To an extraordinary degree, Ms. Fawcett's cancer battle was played out in public, generating enormous interest worldwide. Her face, often showing the ravages of cancer, became a tabloid fixture, and updates on her health became staples of television entertainment news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, that battle was chronicled in a prime-time NBC documentary, "Farrah's Story," some of it shot with her own home video recorder. An estimated nine million people viewed it. Ms. Fawcett had initiated the project with a friend, the actress Alana Stewart, after she first learned of her cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I've written extensively about this on two occasions, first a year and a half ago when I learned that Fawcett had &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/10/farrah_fawcett_turns_to_alternative_medi.php"&gt;turned to woo&lt;/a&gt; after her anal cancer, which had seemingly been treated successfully, recurred; then again two months ago when she was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/farrah_fawcett_and_alternative_cancer_cu.php"&gt;admitted to the hospital due to a complicationr&lt;/a&gt; from the therapy she was undergoing in Germany, including alternative methods; and then finally when I realized that my speculation of what therapy Fawcett had undergone in Germany was way off and I had to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/orac_screwed_up_it_looks_that_way.php"&gt;admit a rare mistake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of that really matters anymore..&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/farrah_fawcett_dead_of_cancer_at_age_62.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/farrah_fawcett_dead_of_cancer_at_age_62.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/RpEgRsmSpbE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245991436723"><id gr:original-id="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/?p=767">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/36c264d7972f8809</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">I want these!</title><published>2009-06-26T03:55:10Z</published><updated>2009-06-26T03:55:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/06/25/i-want-these/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/gallery/dn17367-carnivorous-domestic-entertainment-robots"&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt; has found some awesome robotic ideas, might this mean fire ants could be used for walkway lamps and wild pigs for tractors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don't know if you actually read all the letters sent to you (you must get so many!) but I've got a kind of "life question" regarding children and so I thought I'd try you. Namely; how many is it "appropriate" to have? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm 27, and no kids yet- I'm waaay to busy with a chemistry/neurobiology postdoc that I'm just starting. My boyfriend of 5 years wants to have, and I quote, "like a million babies" when I finish my position and (funding goddesses willing) get an academic research position. He's willing to raise the little bastards and stay at home for them. (I have informed him in no uncertain terms that I will need to be in lab much of the time-- I'll spend time with them of course!, but I do want to be the "breadwinner".) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, he does want (at least) four--- and don't get me wrong, I do want kids, but I was thinking more like two! We've been talking about it for a few years now, and he's not backing down. He cites his parent's argument: for each "science" doctorate in the relationship, there should be two kids (his folks both have doctorates--- mom's a comp sci prof, dad's a surgeon-- and yes, they have four kids). Also, yes, my boyfriend's getting his (physics) doctorate as well. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you ever heard of this reasoning his parents use? Is it really all that reasonable? Or is it just an elitist form of eugenics? (That being said, I saw Idiocracy, and I must admit I was just a little bit scared.) Also, quite frankly, four kids sounds like a fuckload of work- not to mention, ah, wear and tear on my system. Also, what about overpopulation, reducing the carbon footprint, and all that good hippie stuff? Or maybe I've overthinking this? But how can you overthink a responsibility as large as children?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My own parents do each have college degrees, but no doctorates, so I'm not really all that comfortable talking to them about it. All of my academic advisers, past and present, are male, so no help there....&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of course, this will ultimately be a question only I can answer for myself. However, as someone with both a doctorate and a uterus, I would very, very much value any thoughts/insights/wisdom-for-the-ages you may have on this situation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yours Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;antistokes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy balls.  Where do I even begin with this one?  How about with a bit of a tangent?&lt;/p&gt;

Apparently the same behavior has been observed in sheep, but they’re not as funny as wallabies so they don’t make it into the headline, nor are they pictorially represented in this blog post, as such:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/697/521930displayimagephpla.jpg" alt="Wallaby"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was going to leave the dragon-chasing wallabies as good, clean Quickie-fodder, the sheer tsunami of tips people are sending convinced me a full post is needed. I have very little to add to the story, except this: from now on, when someone offers you an anecdote to support their personal wacky theory, whether it concerns aliens buzzing cornfields or ghosts haunting mansions or NASA faking moon landings, your number one response should now be “&lt;strong&gt;maybe it was a doped-up wallaby&lt;/strong&gt;.” You never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Seriously, thanks to all of you who sent this one in, and all of &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?page_id=1227/"&gt;you who continue to send in your tips&lt;/a&gt;!

&lt;p&gt;Today, Peter Binfield, the Managing Editor of PLoS ONE, published a paper entitled "PLoS ONE: Background, Future Development, and Article-Level Metrics" that covers all of that in great detail. The paper is, of course, Open Access, so you can download the PDF for free &lt;a href="http://conferences.aepic.it/index.php/elpub/elpub2009/paper/view/114/51" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the related PowerPoint slideshow &lt;a href="http://conferences.aepic.it/index.php/elpub/elpub2009/paper/view/114/94" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/06/25/plos-one-and-article-level-metrics/" title=""&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The paper goes into a lot of detail on the history and inner workings of PLoS ONE, and so if you are at all interested in where our journal came from; how it operates; and where it is going in the future, then it is required reading.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I second that! A Must Read!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as this is a peer-reviewed article, if you blog about it, and if you use the BPR3 icon, the link to your blog post will show up on the &lt;a href="http://researchblogging.org/post-search/list?search_text=journal.pone" title=""&gt;ResearchBlogging.org&lt;/a&gt; aggregator and will thus be eligible for the &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/tag/blog-pick-of-the-month/" title=""&gt;Blog Pick Of The Month&lt;/a&gt; for June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patient A, a 41-year-old Taiwanese male, suffered from intermittent dysthymia which presented with minor low mood, insomnia, anxiety, chest tightness, back pain, and subjectively mild occupational difficulty... patient A received a single chiropractic spinal manipulation. The chiropractor noticed a minor deformity in the thoracic spine, and a traction technique was administered. He experienced immediate relief from back pain. The following day he reported complete relief of chest tightness, dysthymia, fatigue, and insomnia, with HAM-D, TDQ, and VAS scores of 0 for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; series was hugely popular not just for its eye-popping special effects and epic mythology, but also for its tangled familial relationships. Darth Vader is Luke's father? Leia is his sister? It's positively Dickensian in its intricate genealogical scope.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Science has its stories, too, as evidenced by the special story-telling event held during the &lt;a href="http://www.worldsciencefestival.com"&gt;World Science Festival&lt;/a&gt; in New York City earlier this month: &lt;i&gt;Matter: Stories of Atoms and Eves&lt;/i&gt;, hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.themoth.org"&gt;The Moth&lt;/a&gt; performance space. Half the stories told by the six featured scientists -- before a rapt, appreciative audience -- dealt with family history. Of those, Nobel-Prize-winning geneticist (Sir) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Nurse"&gt;Paul Nurse&lt;/a&gt; of Rockefeller University pretty much stole the show with this charming (and moving) account of how he discovered the truth about his parentage:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/B4B6KaaRKT4%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nurse is remarkably sanguine about this twist to his family's history, regretting only that he never had the chance to talk about his origins with his biological mother before she died. "And then there is the final irony that even though I am a geneticist, my family managed to keep my genetic origins secret from me for over half a century," he writes in &lt;a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2001/nurse-autobio.html"&gt;the addendum to his Nobel Prize autobiography&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We're sure Luke and Leia could totally relate. Nor is Nurse an anomaly (although he clearly has a knack for narrative): science is filled with these sorts of fascinating untold stories. One of the goals of bringing scientists and Hollywood together is to tap into the power of those untold stories to reach the broadest possible audience, so that they can better appreciate the rich history and diversity of this field -- and its people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-7880857141735794938?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I've posted a few of the ones you find on the front page so far. This will allow people who don't have Blogger accounts to discuss our ideas. Joe has a dedicated staff there so I expect things will go smoothly. The link takes you to the DC page but don't forget to click on the banner to discuss and/or start threads of your own. To register click on the link in the upper left hand corner. For now we'll also allow comments here at DC for regular Bloggers. This is a test run.

On this individual’s profile, however, was a statement which I feel necessary to explain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if they’re one word platitudes now, hope, wonder, love, forgiveness and healing are the most beautiful ideas I’ve ever encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since nothing is not, how did this become the atheists’ primary cause?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may seem to the average theistic individual the causes of the atheistic are those of “nothing” or “lack of something,” this could not be farther from the truth. Many who are atheistic, myself included, simply wish to not be judged based upon their lack of belief. We do not want individuals automatically assuming we are amoral and cruel. Additionally, it would be quite nice to not be required (&lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt;) to worship (or pretend to worship) a deity in order to be elected to public office in our secular country. I, personally, am not seeking you to drop your belief in your superstition (although that would be wonderful). What is my mission with this blog? Why did I name it “Mors dei” and why do I constantly argue against the use of religion as a tool for censorship, violence, and imposing one’s view of morality? I can answer these in three very short (not including subordinate clauses, brackets, and parentheses) sentences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) I blog about nature, human life, politics, and so forth  [from the perspective of a young individual with a college education in the sciences who (having grown up in a semi-Catholic household and more familiarity with fundamentalists than I would care to discuss) feels evidence and understanding, not faith, should be the basis of moralities (yes, it is plural), governments, educations, and lives] when I find something interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) The answer to the name question can be found &lt;a href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/01/11/whats-in-a-name/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; additionally, it’s a catchy Latin name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Using religion for anything outside of personal use opens it up to scrutiny, [if you do not wish for your religion to be scrutinized, then don&amp;#39;t put it out in daylight (read &amp;quot;keep it to yourself&amp;quot;)--for this reason, using it as a vehicle to impose your beliefs upon others without presenting evidence (all evidence, not just cherry-picking) will result in their justifications to be ripped apart as the hot air (read &amp;quot;flatulance&amp;quot;) which it is] which means when I sink my teeth into a juicy chunk of superstitious nonsense that you hold dear and use to justify your bigotry, I won’t let go just because you scream “I’m offended.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that clarifies why I blog about religion so much, I find it offensive to use theology to justify ANYTHING. There are more parsimonious explanations for anything than your preferred deity.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been writing about using &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_little_talk_and_a_lot_of_pictures"&gt;less talk and more visuals&lt;/a&gt; to help Charlie throughout the day, and in &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/aac_again_beyond_words"&gt;communicating with him&lt;/a&gt;. It's occurring to me that these visuals and images aren't necessarily how Charlie visualizes things. They're based on what we think might be an accurate, or at least a helpful, representation, of how he takes in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know we could be really really wrong. I was reminded of this recently when I showed Charlie a card for "bike riding" and he said "black car"---I took another look and there was the back end of our car in the photo, to the left of Charlie astride his bike: Same photo, different focuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The June 23rd &lt;a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/miami_dade/beaches/story/1109426.html"&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/a&gt; reports on an exhibition of artwork created by developmentally disabled adults. There's an interesting twist in how the artists were asked to conceive of their work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn't always easy for someone with autism to communicate -- much less share their innermost feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for Miami Beach artists Stewart and Dena Stewart, helping those who are hard to reach put their emotions on canvas has become a calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, the Stewarts -- co-founders of the Beach-based Center for Folk and Community Art -- have helped a group of developmentally disabled adults create pieces of artwork that reflect their life stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''We asked everybody to write something about what they would like people to know about them,'' said Stewart. ``Then, based on what they've written, we show them how to create their own artwork to go along with the stories.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Charlie has not yet shown himself inclined to represent his thoughts, wishes, ideas in writing. So we keep looking, though I'm still regularly stumped about how to understand what he's thinking. Arrangements like &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3651915917/"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; help quite a bit: It seems that he sees things in terms of patterns of colors, textures, materials (metal and plastic utensils) and shapes. Things get placed into rows (and the hardwood floorboards help).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which gives me a lot to think about.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245970454205"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/michael_jackson_dead.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9db063fa3c7e5aa1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="News"/><title type="html">Michael Jackson dead</title><published>2009-06-25T23:36:18Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T23:36:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/2ONLpk4bThM/michael_jackson_dead.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/michael_jackson_dead.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;How strange: he was a little younger than me (but not much!), so it's sad to learn that the &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/06/25/michael.jackson/index.html"&gt;King of Pop has died of a heart attack&lt;/a&gt;.

Specifically, that they are made in stars.  These stars then explode in a variety of ways, enriching the Universe with these heavy elements, and allowing us to form glorious things, like our planet!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/makin/cosm_supernova2_large.jpg" width="498" alt="cosm_supernova2_large.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1948_gamow.php"&gt;big bang makes &lt;i&gt;light&lt;/i&gt; elements&lt;/a&gt;, but not heavy ones.  Why is this the case, and how do we know?  Let's find out.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/makin/big-bang.jpg" width="512" height="310" alt="big-bang.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;(Image credit: &lt;a href="http://www.outsideinthemovie.com/"&gt;Stephen Van Vuuren&lt;/a&gt;, created from a simulation of 80,000 star images.)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a few seconds after the big bang, the Universe is filled with protons and neutrons, in roughly the same numbers as we have today.  But, none of these protons and neutrons are bound together, they're all free and lonesome.  &lt;b&gt;Why?&lt;/b&gt;  There's certainly enough energy for them to interact with one another, and there's certainly a high enough density for them to interact frequently.  But -- in addition to protons and neutrons -- the Universe is full of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon"&gt;photons&lt;/a&gt;, or particles of pure energy.  These are important because &lt;a href="http://www.citebase.org/abstract?id=oai:arXiv.org:astro-ph/0302006"&gt;photons outnumber protons-and-neutrons by almost 2,000,000,000 to 1&lt;/a&gt;!  So even though a proton and neutron can fuse together to make deuterium at any time:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/makin/deuterium.GIF" width="500" alt="deuterium.GIF"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the photons are so energetic and so abundant that they immediately blast the deuterium back into a proton and neutron.  This continues until the Universe has cooled enough for deuterium to be stable, which doesn't happen until the Universe is a little more than &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/First-Three-Minutes-Modern-Universe/dp/0465024378"&gt;three minutes old&lt;/a&gt;.  Once the Universe cools enough, protons and neutrons can combine to not only form deuterium, but also tritium, Helium-3, and Helium-4.  And it does this pretty easily, so that relatively quickly over 99.98% of the Universe is either a Helium-4 nucleus (2 protons and 2 neutrons) or a Hydrogen nucleus (1 proton alone).  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/makin/nucleon.gif" width="500" alt="nucleon.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, we've got a problem.  We can't really go up from Helium-4.  By this point, a little more than 3 minutes after the Big Bang, the Universe is already 1,000,000,000 times less dense than the interior of the Sun.  When densities are low, it means that reactions occur at lower rates.  So let's take our Helium-4 and try adding things to it:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Helium-4 + Hydrogen = Lithium-5, which is completely unstable and decays back into a proton and a helium nucleus after &lt;i&gt;less than 10^-21 seconds&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helium-4 + deuterium = Lithium-6, which is stable, and of which trace amounts (about 1 nucleus in 10,000,000,000) still exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helium-4 + tritium = Lithium-7, which is stable, and again, trace amounts of it (again, about 1 in 10,000,000,000 nuclei) still exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helium-4 + Helium-3 = Beryllium-7, which lives about 53 days, and then decays into Lithium-7, which we observe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helium-4 + Helium-4 = Beryllium-8, which decays back into two helium nuclei after about &lt;i&gt;10^-16 seconds&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
This is a huge problem, because most of the Universe (at this point) is Helium-4 and Hydrogen!  But because there are no stable mass 5 or mass 8 nuclei, the Universe gets stuck.  It isn't until millions of years later, when nuclei have become neutral atoms, trillions and trillions of atoms have collapsed into dust clouds, and the first stars begin to form, that we can start creating interesting elements.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/makin/huge-black-holes-stifle-star-formation_2.jpg" width="512" alt="huge-black-holes-stifle-star-formation_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why?&lt;/b&gt;  Because in the interior of stars, the density is suddenly high enough that &lt;b&gt;10^-16 seconds is long enough for a third Helium-4 nucleus to come along&lt;/b&gt;, and cause this to happen:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/makin/Triple-Alpha_Process.png" width="500" alt="Triple-Alpha_Process.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally!  We can start forming heavier elements!  It's easy from here: Carbon + Helium-4 = Oxygen, Oxygen + Helium-4 = Neon, Oxygen + Carbon = Silicon, and you not only get the picture, you get all the elements capable of making this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/making_the_elements_in_the_uni/slef_aerial.jpg" width="500" alt="slef_aerial.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When these stars with all of these heavy elements in them die, they spread their elements all throughout their galaxy; everything on planet Earth, with the possible exception of some hydrogen, was once part of a star.  Not only that, but every element on Earth, again with the exception of hydrogen, was &lt;i&gt;made&lt;/i&gt; in a star.  Including every element in your body.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/making_the_elements_in_the_uni/we-are-star-stuff-21115865.jpg" width="500" alt="we-are-star-stuff-21115865.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Carl Sagan said, "We are all starstuff."  Many of the stars you see in the sky will one day give their heavy elements up to the rest of the galaxy, and will lead to new worlds, and possibly new life.  And perhaps this helps better explain why &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1950s_the_t.php"&gt;Fred Hoyle&lt;/a&gt;'s discovery of how to make heavy elements in stars was so profoundly important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/making_the_elements_in_the_uni.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245961986127"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/guess_who_else_won_toys_from_e.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/954bb2b7145c64d7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Guess who else won toys from Eric Hovind?</title><published>2009-06-25T21:02:58Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T21:02:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/v3kbiaf8KJg/guess_who_else_won_toys_from_e.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/guess_who_else_won_toys_from_e.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The list of winners of iPods of various flavors from Creation Science Evangelism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I was away in Nature – with a real capital N,  and decided to insert an allegory this week instead of a medical subject. The genesis here was a sweeping of the mind and brushing away of cobwebs and detritus called worries and other preoccupations.  The application to this here blog is - methodology. The experience is one of discovery, and of loss, and of bearing the burden of inaction.   &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Some thirty or more years ago a family member became enamored of a new book, The Teachings of don Juan by an unknown author, Carlos Castaneda. But mention the name now and one gets one of two responses: Who is that?  Or, Oh, he is that literary fraud.  But in the late 1960s – 1970s, two social movements had captured imaginations of youth, academics, and much of the intellectual world. They made fantasy seem plausible, and fraud seem believable – psychedelics and postmodernism. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Advocates of psychedelics, most of whom experienced drug-induced alterations,  promoted revolutionary psychological ideas such as drug-induced multiple realities.  The other, postmodernism, was and is the intellectual and philosophical movement originating in academia that similarly views of reality(ies) as possibly multiple.  (The relation, if any, to alternate universes and relativity theories in physics I have to leave to philosophers.) But the ‘60s and ‘70s were decades of several revolutions in social and personal thought – paradigm changes – that brought fairy tales, delusions, and irrationality onto realms of plausibility, from which we are still reeling, and trying to deal with.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Carlos Castaneda wrote eight books (or was it nine?) on the same subject. He related meeting Yaqui Indian seer and healer don Juan Matus at an Arizona bus station and following him through mountains of Mexican Sonora and a series of hallucinatory drug-induced episodes and lessons of life. Later books introduced different main characters (la Catalina, don Gennaro.) At least three books made the NY Times best seller list, and all netted him millions of dollars.  His books sold well even well after his exposure as a fraud and plagiarist.  The psychedelic and postmodern mental states apparently became dominant enough and entrenched enough in modern folklore that believers could not yield their comfort with fantasy. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Then, after mentioning the name Castaneda, state the name Richard de Mille, and chances are neither one questioned will know who that is. Richard de Mille (1924-2009 died April 9. I found this out after starting this post. Richard (most people were on first name basis with him, as was I) was author of two key books on Castaneda, both written in the 1970s: Castaneda’s Journey, the Power and the Allegory, and The don Juan Papers.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Through Richard de Milles’s diligence and intellectual power, Carlos Castaneda was exposed as a fraud, and his eight books describing psychedelic rituals and perceptions of Yaqui Indians of Sonora were proved to be mislabeled creative fiction. Castaneda did not deny the charge and never brought legal charges against de Mille. (After the first $1 million, who cares, might even have been good for business?) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I read Castaneda’s The Teachings on a ski trip in 1970 or so.  Fascinating.  Given the 1960s psychedelic experiences, don Juan Matus, the Yaqui teacher, who leaped vast distances and moved immovable objects or whose spirit could transform into an animal, kneaded and molded younger minds into trying to concurrently rationalize, imagine, and dream single experiences in differing forms. Castaneda described standard interpretations of reality as “ordinary reality” and a others as a “special reality.”  Another of his book titles was “A Separate Reality.” &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;The process of reading and following Castaneda’s odyssey required toying with mind-bending ideas.  One such was human perception itself being faulty in that it disallowed more than one form of reality at a time.   If this does not make sense to the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century mind, it didn’t make sense to this 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century mind then, either, although not for lack of trying. .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I read the first Castaneda books, and was left in a limbo between, possibility and improbability and the author’s delusional thinking or drug-induced hallucinations. The confusion was aided by the appendix of the first book, The Teachings of don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge, which was the ostensibly real summary of Castaneda’s field work with don Juan for which he was awarded his PhD in anthropology at UCLA. The method used was ethnomethodology, in which the investigator is not a distant observer of a society’s social behavior, but an active participant in it. The investigation becomes experiential.  And, in the process, scientific method becomes something other than science. But that was the new standard of the time.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Complementing such neo-ideation, was/is the takeover of academic departments and faculty by postmodernism, the neo-philosophy that formalizes varying perceptions and formulations of reality, going so far in some views to proclaim that language creates reality. It was and is an academic world where almost anything is possible, and there are no ground rules for determining the borders. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Castaneda’s PhD thesis had a ring of fantasy. Castaneda could not produce his original field notes – essential in supporting a PhD thesis – claiming that they were destroyed in a flooded basement of his Westwood residence. (Floods in Westwood?)  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I began heated discussions about the writings because I became more and more skeptical and found what I thought were some errors of timing and of psychedelic plant use (no, I never smoked, inhaled, ingested, etc.)  But just because of an error or two I could not dismiss the rest of it – a PhD, after all.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;At about that time I was introduced to skeptical thinking through a local community college symposium at which several CSICOP members from Buffalo, NY spoke – and by an ensuing subscription to Skeptical Inquirer.  It was in an early SI issue that I read a review of de Mille’s book or books, which I promptly bought and spent weeks devouring.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;The first book, Castaneda’s Journey, is itself an allegory as the title states.  Written as a partial imitation of Castaneda, de Mille introduces an imagined - or maybe not - meeting of himself and Castaneda, and an ensuing series of real-or-not meetings and dialogues in which de Mille is the student-seeker, and Carlos the mysterious shadow appearing-disappearing Teacher.  This short work is itself a masterwork of layered, allegorical story-telling.  This book is still in print, and I highly recommend it. Like good music or fine wine, enjoy the literary pleasure. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;But Richard’s other major works were as different as phyla. The don Juan Papers traces Castaneda’s academic works in cultural anthropology at UCLA, through comments from his advisers, others who had input into the granting of the degree, and outside observers.  The conclusion of most: the thesis was a work of fiction, perhaps based in some personal experiences, but mostly in works of others, knowledge of other cultural rituals and myths, synthesized into a nearly plausible epic analysis of the occult mysteries of native American tribes. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Perhaps most fascinating for us types is the inability of some academics to discard their beliefs, or to resolve their cognitive dissonance in some rational way…they continued to rationalize the episode of being taken in as good illustrative methodology, containing kernels of truth, and other face-saving imaginings. Academia. Peer review. Not always what we would like them to be. Humans run them. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; The department chairman retains his silence in the matter, as embarrassing as it is. To complement the work is a series of analyses and commentaries by other prominent social anthropologists. It is at times heavy going through anthro-sociology jargon and working concepts. Four hundred pages of it, fortunately and mercifully punctuated at crucial points by de Mille’s interpretation, and identifying of contradictions. Indexed and notated in detail, this is the work of an accomplished academician researcher.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;In both works, I marveled at de Mille’s attention to detail, to the lengths of comparing time intervals and dates of the same events in several books. It took a great memory and talent to see the contradictions, so often obscure and separated in place and context. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I asked Richard to contribute an article on his methods to Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine, which he did.  [De Mille R, How I Learned Not to Believe Carlos Castaneda. Sci Rev Altern Med 1999; 3(2):11-14.] He has a short section devoted to some of this in each book as well. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Richard’s method derived directly from his academic career, about which I had forgotten. He had both MA and PhD in psychology, spent brief times at USC and UC Santa Barbara faculties, and more time as an industrial and career psychologist, and had done considerable research in various related fields. He said to the effect of, “I merely strolled over to the UCSB library and applied what I had learned.”  He became an authority on social anthropology and ethnography – and a professional skeptic researcher along the way. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I later read his autobiographical and biographical portraits of himself and his prominent mother, (My Secret Mother, Lorna Moon.) a script writer in Hollywood, who bore him out of wedlock to Cecil B. de Mille’s brother, William. Sin and secrecy were the behavior modes at the time, not public confessions or live-in arrangements, so Cecil B. raised Richard as his son, not telling him his real father was Cecil’s brother until William’s death, when Richard was in his thirties.  Interestingly (to me) is that for part of his childhood he lived on the same L.A. street as my grandmother. We might have crossed “paths.” Perhaps not.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;The heart of this tale is that Richard de Mille, himself the guiltless player of a real life mirage, was the key who exposed the largest literary and academic fraud in history, using techniques of research, objective methodology, intelligence, and diligence.  Studying his methods I was able to construct techniques for teaching that I used years later, and that many other skeptics have developed as well. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Richard de Mille was a mild, retiring giant intellect with (insert superlative) writing talent. He was generous with time and a most gracious human being.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;The lament:  I wanted to write a re-review of one or both of Richard’s Castaneda books, but did not get around to it. I always wanted to visit him in Santa Barbara where he lived, but delayed in that also. A lesson re-learned all too frequently.     &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear PZ,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The work of my lab has been subject to questions and harsh criticisms, some reasonable, some not.  The scientific ones are dealt with in a new book &lt;i&gt;On The Origin Of Form, Evolution by Self-Organization, an alternative to the natural selection paradigm&lt;/i&gt;, This is a substantially expanded presentation of the self-organization model previously published. 
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I welcome your assessment. If you are convinced now of its plausibility, as are many others, I solicit your participation in the dissemination of the idea for further investigation. A copy is on its way.  Meanwhile, please see  www.ontheoriginofform.com&lt;br&gt;
SP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh-oh. Pivar, you may recall, is the fellow who tried to &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/08/so-sue-me.html"&gt;sue me for FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS&lt;/a&gt; two years ago, all over my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/07/lifecode_from_egg_to_embryo_by.php"&gt;review of his book, &lt;i&gt;Lifecode&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That tends to damp my enthusiasm for any more books from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not reply. He sent me an update a few days later, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear PZ,
   
The new book presents a model of self organization amplified well beyond that shown previously, addressing, among many other issues, the reasons that the idealized models are inconsistent with parts of observed embryology. Many prominent scientists have now accepted the plausibility of the model.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you plan to comment publicly kindly view this new material. You will probably find the premise plausible
as well. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
see www.ontheoriginofform.com  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Stuart  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plausible? It must have undergone significant revision, then, since in its earlier incarnation, it was best described as surreal and absurd. Then the book arrives in my mailbox; you can even &lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556438869/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;preorder it on Amazon now&lt;/a&gt;, and just look at the encomiums published on the cover!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stuart Pivar's book, On the Origin of Form, contains ideas that deserve full scientific scrutiny, especially in light of the turmoil roiling evolutionary biology at present. Pivar is presenting, in a series of brilliantly rendered graphical diagrams that show his interpretation of how modifications of a torus shape can generate a vast panoply of biotic form, a new theory of morphogenesis.... This is a seismic event for science. Conventional evolutionary biologists are right to be very worried about this, because it has the potential to trigger the complete collapse of Modern Synthesis Biology."&lt;br&gt;

The casual qualitative research that happens in one's head simply from communicating with hundreds of people who share the same experience (i.e. are all on the spectrum) makes me question this assumption, at least for some of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience of many of us is not that "insistence on sameness" jumps out unbidden and unwanted and makes our lives hard, but that "insistence on sameness" is actually a way of adapting to a confusing and chaotic environment, cueing into volitional action, or compensating for "executive function" difficulties.  Routines for some of us are the opposite of unbidden, unwanted, or difficulty-making: they are deliberate, desired, and adaptive.  (Which may explain in turn why some of us become unable to function well, or become extremely upset, when our routines are broken.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotal stories are not, in themselves, science.  They do not "prove" anything other than that a particular person has had a specific experience.  However, the starting assumptions or hypothesis that are used in science frequently do come from observation, including observation of people's first hand accounts of their experiences.  If you hear enough autistic adults talking, typing, signing, drawing about how frustrated they are about not being able to get quality health care, then you may develop a more testable hypothesis or assumption for use in a study, like "autistic adults often do not receive quality health care."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reading about these studies that assume autistic behavior is maladaptive, I always wonder if the investigators have spent much time asking autistic people about our experiences or why we may have the behavior they are interested in studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding our personal reasons for doing things is really important as it filters down to a practical day-to-day level because a therapy or medication that eliminates or suppresses an adaptive behavior could potentially be harmful, not beneficial, to a person (any person!) in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245958563372"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13953">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/487bd583f418e4ac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="fred shapiro"/><category term="quote"/><title type="html">Quotes Uncovered: Pork and Patriotism</title><published>2009-06-25T19:26:20Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T19:26:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/quotes-uncovered-pork-and-patriotism/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">A while back, I invited readers to submit quotations for which they wanted me to try to trace the origins, using &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yale-Book-Quotations-Fred-Shapiro/dp/0300107986"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Yale Book of Quotations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and more recent research by me.

Oh, I don’t fret over it for long, and I’ve never really come to a conclusion about it, but sometimes in moments of loneliness or after a relationship ends, I wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if in fact I am hard to love, it’s because of the man I have become. Perhaps my personality, my attitude, and my many vices and odd peccadillos are enough to turn people away. Perhaps the culmination of those many things is what makes it hard to love me. Me, the grown man version of Sam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But apparently it is hard to love some &lt;em&gt;babies &lt;/em&gt;for much simpler reasons. According to &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1906642,00.html?cnn=yes"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, a new study released by Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital and published in the online journal &lt;em&gt;PloS One&lt;/em&gt; suggests that uglier babies are harder to love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, men and women were randomly shown pictures of 50 healthy and attractive babies and 30 others with distinct facial irregularities. Each picture remained on the screen for four seconds, but the viewer could shorten that time by clicking one key or prolong it by clicking another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, the men in the study were less likely to click off photos of unattractive babies, but clicked quite a bit to hold on to the images of the pretty ones. Women, conversely, left the keyboard alone when they were looking at pretty babies, but hurried away from the less attractive ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;So . . . Do you see any flaws in the study? If so, how would you improve on it? Would you even bother? Is an ugly baby really harder to love? Are you now trying to recall the nature of your early relationship with your mother?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Good news, we're getting it back. The &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.savebritishscience.org.uk/"&gt;Campaign for Science &amp;amp; Engineering&lt;/a&gt; had this to say:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Campaign for Science &amp;amp; Engineering (CaSE) warmly welcomed the House of Commons&amp;#39; decision to establish the Science and Technology Committee. CaSE lobbied for it to be established following the merger of DIUS and BIS. In today&amp;#39;s debate &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/philwillismp"&gt;Phil Willis MP&lt;/a&gt; commended CaSE's efforts to bring back the Science and Technology Committee.&lt;br&gt;
Commenting Nick Dusic, CaSE's Director, said:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is great news that the Science and Technology Committee will be able to investigate science and engineering issues that cut right across government, including the science budget.&lt;br&gt;
Today's decision showed that there is strong support for proper scrutiny of science and engineering within Parliament. It is critical that future changes to government do not result in the abolition of the Science and Technology Committee. Today's decision corrects the mistake made in 2007 of abolishing the Committee.&lt;br&gt;
I look forward to working with the Science and Technology Committee in scrutinising the Government's science policies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Committee will be able to conduct wide-ranging inquiries, covering the full scope of science policy and related matters including the science budget. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/06/science_watchdog_returns_to_we.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245956893320"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13961">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fdba86f1a260263b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="employment"/><category term="wages"/><title type="html">Trading Overtime</title><published>2009-06-25T17:22:01Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T17:22:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/trading-overtime/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">The latest &lt;em&gt;Economist&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/businessfinance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13871834"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; about an Italian firm whose workers negotiated a deal during the recession for time off with no pay cut in exchange for promises to work overtime without extra pay when the firm's demand recovers.</summary><author><name>By Daniel Hamermesh</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245956494840"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/send_grrlscientist_to_antarcti.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/55d326f8dd5954cd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Send GrrlScientist to Antarctica!</title><published>2009-06-25T19:26:09Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T19:26:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/B4silXXPtUI/send_grrlscientist_to_antarcti.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/send_grrlscientist_to_antarcti.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really not being mean and trying to banish a fellow science blogger to some barren, frigid desolation — hey, that&amp;#39;s where I live! — but she&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2009/06/the_gift_of_an_adventure_of_a.php"&gt;&lt;i&gt;volunteering&lt;/i&gt; to leave New York for a month to live in Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked one of my SciBlings and friends, Scicurious of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/" title=""&gt;Neurotopia&lt;/a&gt;, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="SciCurious pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/SciCurious%20pic.jpg" width="235" height="267" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;My name is Scicurious (please, call my Sci), and I'm a grad student studying Pharmacology at a Southeastern University of Good Reputation.  Every once in a while, I think I see the end of the tunnel, but it turns out I was fooling myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Mad Scientist.  MWAH-HA-HA-HA.  Honestly, it's amazing how many of us didn't know what to do with ourselves after college, and now it's amazing how many of us don't know what to do with ourselves after grad school.  I guess I better begin thinking of that right about now, huh...it will definitely involve world domination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grad student.  It's a lot less glamorous than it sounds.  I don't suffer at all from paparazzi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really love learning in a wide variety, and sharing ideas with a large number of people.  I love that, since beginning to read science blogs, I've found out so much more about my field, and expanded my knowledge base in other fields.  I think it's the spread of knowledge to both other scientists and lay people that interests me the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my real work?  It doesn't.  I blog on my own time, and never on my Real Work.  However, you can find me on Twitter, and I hear there's a Facebook group as well.  I love blogging and sharing information and educating, but work and blogging need to stay separate for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But indirectly, there's been a massive effect of blogging on my work.  My knowledge of other areas has increased exponentially, and now it seems that the instant something big comes out in my field, I know.  So it's been a positive influence, over all.  And I've made some awesome friends and contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny, that.  See, I went to this coffee shop one day and met this guy Coturnix.  I hear you know him...  Someone had told me that he could help me break into the world of science writing.  And he told me to start a science blog.  So I spent the next day or so checking out blogs, and thinking "hey!  This is pretty sweet!"  And thus, Scicurious was born. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorites?  I hate playing favorites.  I have to say I LOVE "&lt;a href="http://whatis-wrong-withyou.blogspot.com" title=""&gt;What the hell is wrong with you, I'm mean, damn&lt;/a&gt;" because the title kills me.  I go there when I'm feeling down just to read the title and laugh.  Otherwise, I've got a LOT of blogs I read every day.  Everyone has their good and bad days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You led a &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/History_of_Science/" title=""&gt;session about History of Science&lt;/a&gt; at the conference - how did that go and what did you learn from it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I've never led a session on ANYTHING before, so I guess it went well for my first time!  It was great to have gg and Laelaps there with me, I love those guys.  Gg in particular knows SO much about the history of science, and has so much to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we started some good discussions.  One question that really interested me was "why does this MATTER?!"  I was kind of shocked, because I personally love history, and so it never really occurred to me that people wouldn't think it mattered.  But it did make me think about why people should blog about the history of science. After all, a lot of times it's not easy to do, looking up and explaining old techniques.  But I think we were able to show a little of WHY the history of science is important.  I personally think that the history of science is necessary to explain a great deal of what goes on the modern biosciences, a lot of which can be really complicated if you don't have some idea of the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It seems that blog posts on three topics - Historical Science, Weird Science, and Science of Sex - draw a lot of interest from your readers. But as you know, most of currently done science is not that sexy - how do you balance this for your audience?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALL well-done, elegant science is sexy science!  I also like to explain a lot of the more complicated topics, and try to make science understandable to a non-scientist audience.  I try to convey how excited I was when I first learned about the topics, and I hope that gets other people excited about some of the "less-sexy" science as well, when it is conveyed by people who are passionate and who can explain how the heavy stuff relates to every day life. Sure, some science is funny and weird, and some of it's not, but all of it is important and helps us to understand our bodies and the world that we live in.  New knowledge is always pretty exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You are the guest editor of the Open Laboratory 2009 anthology - any thoughts about it yet?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agreed to do what now?  Aiieeeeeeee!!!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I just hope I can do as well as the previous years have done.  We've already got boatloads of submissions coming in, many of which look like good contenders.  I'm just hoping I turn out something awesome and that I don't go insane doing it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I will say that I think there's a lot to be said for meeting bloggers in person.  When they are a disembodied series of words, it is very easy to misinterpret.  There is no tone of voice on the internet  And also, you can build up pictures in your head of these blogging gods, and in reality, we're all just people.  So it was very cool to meet some of the people I've been communicating with for ages, and see what they're really like.  Now sometimes I can even hear them talking when I read them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also really impressed with the sessions on anonymity and women and minorities in science.  Even though I AM a woman in science, it was something that I had never really thought about before.  I have since become a lot more aware of these issues, and I've been reading up a lot on them as well.  I hope that conversations about women and minority issues at conferences continue, I think there's a lot left to be discussed, and there are ALWAYS more people to educate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to see you again and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll be the moderator for the Mythbusters panel at &lt;a href="http://www.comic-con.org/cci/"&gt;Comic Con&lt;/a&gt; this year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squeeee!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comic Con is a HUGE scifi/fantasy/comic/gaming/pop culture convention held every year in San Diego. I’ve always wanted to go, and last year, &lt;del&gt;the Hive Overmind&lt;/del&gt; Discover Magazine sent me there to be on a panel about science in science fiction (I have several blog posts about it; &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/07/24/comic-con-day-1-doctor-who-panel/"&gt;start here&lt;/a&gt; and click through to the next ones, in particular &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/07/30/comic-con-my-panel-on-science-and-scifi/"&gt;this one with a video of our panel&lt;/a&gt;). They’re sending me again this year (and I’ll have more about that a little later), and I’m &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; excited to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then last week I get a call from My Close Personal Friend Adam Savage™, asking me if I’d like to moderate their panel! I said yes immediately (and then cleared it with the magazine; maybe I did that a little backwards), because despite all indications I’m not a complete idiot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/2716534115/sizes/l/in/set-72157606342123292/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3096/2716534115_c3fa52a230_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/donttrythis"&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt; will be on the panel, as well as Jamie Hyneman, Tory Belleci, and &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/GrantImahara"&gt;Grant Imahara&lt;/a&gt;. Kari can’t attend, as by then she’ll be a brand new mommy. That’s wonderful for her, of course, though a bit of a bummer for us. Adam and Jamie were on a panel at CC last year (that’s the picture shown here) and it was a riot. This year, the room is twice as big, too. Discovery Channel has more info &lt;a href="http://press.discovery.com"&gt;on their press release&lt;/a&gt; (PDF; click that link, select your location and &amp;quot;Discovery Channel&amp;quot; for network, then click the link on the right labeled &amp;quot;Mythbusters Comic Con panelists&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the panel we’ll be talking about the new season, what they have planned for the next, and how &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/08/27/mythbustin-the-moon-hoax-part-v-the-review/"&gt;their Moon Hoax testing episode&lt;/a&gt; would have been an unwatchable disaster without my science advice. I’ll really try to come up with some unusual questions for them, but I could use some help from you, me droogs. If you’ve got a good question for the ‘busters, put it in the comments below… and if I use it I’ll give you a shout-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And may I just say once again: squeee!&lt;/p&gt;

Every situation is unique, and it’s usually far more complex then just calmly explaining to the believer why they are out of their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many situations, it is possible to have a positive influence on someone who believes a con. It’s doubtful that you’ll be able to convince them in one conversation, but it’s very likely that you can give them the tools they need to eventually come to a more rational conclusion. You can encourage them to seek out the facts, teach them about common logical fallacies, or just demonstrate that it’s okay to doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some situations, though, deal with the so-called True Believer. The TB (not to be confused with tuberculosis—we’ve developed a vaccine for that) is well-known in the skeptical community as an unmovable brick wall of irrationality, someone best left alone to their delusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I agree that there are a good deal of hard cases out there, and probably even a good deal of people who will never change their minds about anything, I don’t think it’s healthy or correct to be pessimistic about the TB’s situation. For example, I’ve received lots of messages from former True Believers, talking about their journey into skepticism via blogs, podcasts, books, friends, and a good deal of inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another reason why we shouldn’t be too quick to dismiss True Believers: we may not be able to change their minds, but we may still be able to help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This occurred to me after reading &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124520056162621509.html"&gt;this Wall Street Journal article&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="http://consumerist.com/5295329/how-to-protect-susceptible-relatives-from-scams"&gt;Consumerist&lt;/a&gt;) about a very specific type of True Believer: the mentally incapacitated relative. These are mostly older parents and grandparents who have lost the batteries to their bullshit detectors, and so they fall for otherwise obvious scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article gives some extreme examples and goes into ways that you can help your loved ones, even when they refuse to believe they’re being conned. Some of their tips include putting your loved one’s phone number on the Do Not Call list, giving them a script to use when answering the phone, or filling their time with other activities. One tip is even helpful to those of us who are already skeptics: “Gather scam mail in an envelop marked ‘Forward to Post Master: suspected mail fraud’ and put it in your mailbox. No postage is necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m wondering if any of our readers have elderly or mentally handicapped loved ones who fall for scams. If so, have you taken any steps to protect them? Are you on the look-out for scammers who may target them? Do you tell your grandparents about scams in the hopes that they’ll remember?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245953679854"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/06/25/women-in-space-we-um-salute-you/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/02524f7e579c5abe</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Food and Drink"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="space shuttle cake"/><title type="html">Women in Space — We …um… salute you</title><published>2009-06-25T17:21:37Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T17:21:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/06/25/women-in-space-we-um-salute-you/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a diehard baker of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/04/30/the-physics-of-chocolate/"&gt;extreme&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/01/07/drive-by-posting/"&gt;cakes&lt;/a&gt;, I understand the difficulty in complex cake construction.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, you're right. People shout My Name when they have sex, because I am all one can think of when they're orgasmic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is all wrong, a myth that another patriarchal myth has promoted to his advantage. I have carried out extensive empirical research in this area for approximately 35 years, and not once have I encountered a woman who shouted out any deity's name at any time during sex. However, I have discovered one consistent phenomenon, a remarkably robust pattern of behavior that I've seen over and over again, in almost ten thousand encounters. There is one name that godless women frequently evoke at the height of passion.&lt;/p&gt;

I admit that I was wrong. I thought that the &lt;a href="http://ling.ed.ac.uk/grammar/passives.html"&gt;grammatical term&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=passive+voice"&gt;&lt;em&gt;passive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had developed a spectrum of everyday meanings like "vague about agency", "listless writing, lacking in vigor", and "failure to take sides in a conflict". But I've now reluctantly concluded that for some members of the chattering classes, it now means nothing at all, except maybe "I dislike this person".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence that drove me over the edge? Hank Stuever and Wil Haygood, "&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/24/AR2009062403581.html"&gt;Parsing The Book Of Mark&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, 6/25/2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Wow. Was that a press conference or was &lt;em&gt;that a press conference?&lt;/em&gt; That genteel lilt of hubris, sorrow, guilt! But other than a very slow, meandering build to &lt;em&gt;I just needed a little strange,&lt;/em&gt; what did it all mean? What language was South Carolina's Republican governor speaking yesterday as he forlornly told the world of his travels and travails, of how sorry he is to his wife, to his sons, to his staff, to "the Tom Davises of the world" (not the Virginia one, all the other ones)? Is it a new Pat Conroy novel? Is it a megachurch sermon? Is it the language of couples therapy? The metaphysics of Oprah? Shakespeare? The psychobabble of cheating husbands? (&lt;strong&gt;Note all the passive constructions, the avoidance of first person.&lt;/strong&gt;) &lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;[emphasis added]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Before we get to the "passive constructions" part of "parsing the book of Mark", let's look at that "avoidance of first person". The 2,747 words of the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/us/24text-sanford.html?pagewanted=print"&gt;NYT transcript&lt;/a&gt; of Gov. Sanford's remarks include 190 first-person singular pronouns, for a rate of 6.9%, which seems pretty respectable even for a confession. In comparison, Barack Obama was &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1495"&gt;slammed by another WaPo writer, George Will&lt;/a&gt;, for being &amp;quot;inordinately fond of the first-person singular pronoun&amp;quot; in his GM take-over speech, which contained 1.7% of the same words.  This would be a case of damned if you do (&amp;quot;inordinately fond of the first person&amp;quot;) and damned if you don&amp;#39;t (&amp;quot;avoidance of first person&amp;quot;) — except that at the Post these days, you&amp;#39;re apparently damned for doing if you don&amp;#39;t, and damned for not doing if you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my topic today is &amp;quot;all the passive constructions&amp;quot;. In the section of Gov. Sanford&amp;#39;s press conference before the question period, I count 180 tensed verbs, of which I can find only four instances of grammatical passive voice, plus one or two more adjectival passives — and none of these are in the part of the statement where he describes his affair, or are connected to anything that seems remotely like psychobabble, of cheating husbands or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In three of the genuine passives, the unnamed but implied agent is &lt;em&gt;the media&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;… what I have found in this job is that one desperately needs a break from the bubble wherein every word, every moment &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;is recorded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;… it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;was always viewed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as, "You're doing this to climb some further political office." It &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;was always based&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on that idea, that I genuinely believed that that action would be bad for the taxpayers …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the last one, the unnamed but implied agent is God:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;… if you were to look at God&amp;#39;s laws, they&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;'re in every instance designed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to protect people from themselves …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Yes, I know that I should count up all the infinitives and participles as well, but life is too short. Please feel free to contribute your labor to the cause, if you like to count things and have some spare time — for now, I&amp;#39;ll simply assert in a qualitative way that looking at infinitives and participles doesn&amp;#39;t change the picture in a material way.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, what about the currently popular interpretation of "passive voice" (or in this case "passive constructions") as meaning something like "vague about agency"? For example, when Bernie Madoff said that "I believed it [his Ponzi scheme] would end soon", Nancy Franklin in the New Yorker &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1242"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt; that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[H]e betrayed no sense of how absurd it was to use the passive voice in regard to his scheme, as if it were a spell of bad weather that had descended on him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the weird thing is, Gov. Sanford emphasized his own responsibility in first person active sentences, over and over again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;And so the bottom line is this: I have been unfaithful to my wife. I developed a relationship with a — what started out as a dear, dear friend from Argentina. It began very innocently, as I suspect many of these things do, in just a casual e-mail back and forth, in advice on one&amp;#39;s life there and advice here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;But here recently over this last year, it developed into something much more than that. And as a consequence, I hurt her. I hurt you all. I hurt my wife. I hurt my boys. I hurt friends like Tom Davis. I hurt a lot of different folks. And all I can say is that I apologize.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, he describes the progression of the affair in two impersonal sentences: &amp;quot;It began very innocently … But … it developed into something much more&amp;quot;. On the other hand, these two sentences are surrounded by no fewer than nine sentences with first-person singular subjects confessing agency: &amp;quot;I have been unfaithful … I developed a relationship … I  hurt her. I hurt you all. I hurt my wife. I hurt my boys. I hurt friends …  I hurt a lot of … folks. … I apologize.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for Sanford to describe his affair as something he alone did would have been offensively narcissistic, it seems to me — it takes two, as they say, to tango.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what in the world did Stuever and Haygood mean by all this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate to think badly of prominent members of the press corps — &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Stuever"&gt;Hank Stuever&lt;/a&gt; is said to be "a regular contributor to the Style section in the Washington Post" and "a two-time finalist for the Pulitzer Prize". But my guess is that these pundits were simply, in the technical sense of the term, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/001903.html"&gt;bullshitting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. More precisely, they were spinning out associative clichés, with no concern for any particular connection to facts.  Their thought process was apparently something like this: Public figures stereotypically avoid taking responsibility, which translates linguistically into passive (&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1246"&gt;"mistakes were made"&lt;/a&gt;) and impersonal third-person (&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1530"&gt;"things happen"&lt;/a&gt;) constructions; Mark Sanford is a public figure; His statement must therefore have avoided the first person and been full of passive constructions. Q.E.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this kind of writing, I guess, cleverness is everything and facts are not relevant at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: in the comments below, there are some complaints that the grammatical phenomena traditionally connected to the term "passive voice" are complex and confusing, across languages and within English; and that if the public is confused about what the term means, it's partly or entirely because linguists haven't put forward an analysis that is both clear and descriptively comprehensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's certainly true that most people, and even most educated people, have never encountered such an explanation. A clear, accessible, and fairly comprehensive account of "passive voice" in English can be found (for example) on pp. 1427-1447 of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0521431468/"&gt;CGEL&lt;/a&gt;; and in another context, we could talk about what it would take to make this information effectively available to people like Stuever and Haygood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the point of this post is that it probably doesn&amp;#39;t matter what their understanding of &amp;quot;passive construction&amp;quot; is. I doubt that there&amp;#39;s any significant defect in their understanding of &amp;quot;first person&amp;quot; — but this didn&amp;#39;t prevent them from tossing in an empirically contentless note about Sanford&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;avoidance of first person&amp;quot;. The problem is not that their analysis of linguistic structure and content is wrong — though perhaps it would be if they did any — but that their assertions about linguistic structure and content are empty echoes of generic prejudice.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245945878918"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/whats_wrong_with_steve_jobs_yes_jobs_did.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2b290904f6398bbe</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">What's wrong with Steve Jobs: Yes, Jobs did have a liver transplant, but was it for metastatic insulinoma?</title><published>2009-06-25T16:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T16:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/b4h5TzLhMZk/whats_wrong_with_steve_jobs_yes_jobs_did.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/whats_wrong_with_steve_jobs_yes_jobs_did.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/whats_wrong_with_steve_jobs_revisited.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the reason for Apple CEO Steve Job's five month medical leave of absence from Apple is that he needed a liver transplant, which, according to the story, he underwent a couple of months ago in Memphis. In my discussion, I assumed, for the most part, the most likely clinical scenario, namely that Steve Jobs' insulinoma had metastasized to his liver and that the liver transplant had been done for that indication, but, as some pointed out, it was possible that Jobs had somehow fried his liver without his tumor having metastasized. Unlikely, true, but possible. Unfortunately, news coming out over the last couple of days, while confirming that Jobs did indeed undergo a liver transplant, only shed a little more light on what happened and still leave a lot of questions. For instance, late Tuesday Methodist University Hospital in Memphis &lt;a href="http://www.methodisthealth.org/methodist/About+Us/Newsroom/News/Steve+Jobs+Receives+Liver+Transplant"&gt;issued a press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.methodisthealth.org/methodist/Healthcare+Services/Areas+of+Excellence/Transplant+Institute/Meet+The+Care+Team/Surgical+Staff/Eason%2CJames"&gt;James D. Eason, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, program director at Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute, chief of transplantation and professor of surgery at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center confirmed today, with the patient's permission, that Steve Jobs received a liver transplant at Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute in partnership with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis. 

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jobs underwent a complete transplant evaluation and was listed for transplantation for an approved indication in accordance with the Transplant Institute policies and United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) policies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are agreed-upon definitions of the word hero, then Joe Albietz must fit many of them. This good-natured, upbeat, intelligent, and skeptical man is a pediatrician who gets up every morning so that he can help — and succeed — in saving the lives of children. I’m proud he’s my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe’s written &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/609-help-re-establish-the-herd-immunity-of-nevada.html"&gt;a concise and informative article about the JREF’s vaccine drive in Las Vegas for The Amaz!ng Meeting 7&lt;/a&gt;. Vaccinations rates in Vegas were very low due to poverty and a transient population, and their herd immunity to diseases like measles and whooping cough is in serious trouble. Joe came up with the idea of getting donations from the skeptic community to support vaccinations in Vegas, and spearheaded the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For $25 you can support a child to get a full series of vaccinations. You don’t have to attend &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;TAM 7&lt;/a&gt; or do anything else; just send $25 and a child in Vegas will get protected against a raft of potentially life-threatening diseases. And while those children are getting their vaccinations, we will be at TAM 7 talking about how to fight people like &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/19/are-antivaxxers-liable-for-preventable-deaths/"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/26/the-australian-antivax-movement-takes-its-toll/"&gt;Meryl Dorey&lt;/a&gt;, and all the others who are so vocal in making sure that diseases we once stamped out come back with a vengeance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that vaccinations don’t cause autism, and we know they have wiped out smallpox, and put such scourges as polio on the endangered list. Help us, so that we can help others.  &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/609-help-re-establish-the-herd-immunity-of-nevada.html"&gt;Go read Joe’s article&lt;/a&gt; and see how you can easily support this effort.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245943897850"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13965">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1e1c062032dd9321</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="naming"/><category term="transportation"/><title type="html">The "Bill Golden Gates Bridge"?</title><published>2009-06-25T14:40:55Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T14:40:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/the-bill-golden-gates-bridge/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">In case you missed it, take a look at this plan for the cash-strapped New York MTA to sell off &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/nyregion/24naming.html"&gt;naming rights to subway stations&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Swedish island-province Öland's second-largest silver hoard ever was &lt;a href="http://www.barometern.se/nyheter/oland/skatt-gravdes-fram-i-majsfalt(1394185).gm"&gt;found recently&lt;/a&gt;. Dating from the 11th century and consisting mainly of about 1000 German and English coins, it also has some Islamic ones, one from Sigtuna and even one from India, a very rare occurrence. Some hack silver as well, and a piece of gold rod unless I'm mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The droning noise at the start and end of the above newsreel is a Bronze Age trumpet that had been lying in a bog for almost 2000 years at the time when the hoard was buried and would spend almost another 1000 years there before it was unearthed. Nice try, TV guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theories have ranged from the most likley…a meteor or comet…all the way to the other side of the spectrum. Regarding this event, a Dr. Ray Stantz was overheard to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have been a participant in the biggest interdimensional cross-rip since the Tunguska blast of 1909!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you familiar with the Tunguska Event?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1908,  an air burst occurred near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River in Russia. Whatever it was, the explosion was equal to about 1000 Hiroshima bombs.  It was not a good day to be a tree when this happened. More than 80 million of them were knocked down over an area of 2150 square km. Hundreds of miles away, windows were broken and people were &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event"&gt;actually&lt;/a&gt; knocked off their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:335px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://tizona.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/tunguskaartdavis-jpg.jpeg" alt="Artists Conception of event" width="325" height="384"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artist&amp;#39;s Conception of event&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, the IDR theory (Inter-Dimensional Rip) as it was called, was never taken seriously (except by movie screen writers). The comet or asteroid theories however went back and forth as one seemed more plausible than the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it seems that the comet theory may be the real winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090624152941.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for all the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research describes how the exhaust from the shuttle was tracked through the atmosphere. This was similar to Tunguska because if it was caused by a comet, then it too would have injected a lot of water vapor into the atmosphere at very high altitudes. When this happens, noctilucent clouds can be formed that are so high they reflect sunlight to the night-side of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These clouds (or at least very bright nights) were reported in 1908. Recent studies have shown that this water vapor from the shuttle also creates noctilucent clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the bottom-line of the new research but check out the link above to read about the interesting details.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bob Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245937769257"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13927">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8fc133b305ee2c89</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="internet madness"/><title type="html">LoJack for iPhones</title><published>2009-06-25T13:39:59Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T13:39:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/lojack-for-iphones/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">A while back we wrote about &lt;a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/lojack-for-laptops-the-free-version/"&gt;Adeona&lt;/a&gt;, a free tracking program that could help police locate and recover a stolen laptop.

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh’s statement already has over 10000 signatories, many very distinguished, Sign it now if you haven’t already. And getting on for 600 separate complaints about exaggerated and false claims by chiropractors have been lodged with the General Chiropractic Council and with Trading Standards offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/freedebate"&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/images/sas-libel-2.png" width="180" height="66" alt="free debate" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Click to sign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCA has exposed the baselessness of most of chiropractic’s claims more effectively than any sceptic could have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The University of Westminster is seeing the light?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only recently that the University of Westminster suspended entry to degrees in homeopathy and remedial massage and neuromuscular therapy.  Luckily for science, they have a new Dean who knows bullshit when she sees it.  I suspect than she has been instrumental in starting to restore Westminster’s reputation.  The job isn’t finished yet though.  According to &lt;a href="http://search.ucas.com/cgi-bin/hsrun/search/search/StateId/DznxSo5l-E-1c2C8bLXFFVBCTGQQA-3kKP/HAHTpage/search.HsKeywordSearch.whereNext?query=5382&amp;amp;word=COMPLEMENTARY+MEDICINE"&gt;the UCAS site&lt;/a&gt; Westminster still offers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chinese Medicine: Acupuncture with Foundation (B341)	4FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Sciences: Complementary Ther with Foundn (B300)	4FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Sciences: Complementary Therapies (B255)	3FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Sciences: Herbal Medicine (B342)	3FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Sciences: Herbal Medicine with Foundation (B340)	4FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Sciences: Naturopathy (B391)	3FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Sciences: Naturopathy with Foundation (B392)	4FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Sciences: Nutritional Therapy (B400)	3FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Sciences: Nutritional Therapy with Foundn (B402)	4FT Hon BSc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the possible exception of herbal medicine, which &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be taught scientifically. all the rest is as delusional as homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumour has it that Naturopathy may be next for the chop, so it seems appropriate to help the dean by showing a bit more of what the hapless students get taught.  Remember that, according to Westminster, this is a bachelor of &lt;em&gt;science &lt;/em&gt;degree!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychotherapeutic Approaches in Naturopathy 3CMW606&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This module is a core subject for BSc (Hons) Health Sciences: Naturopathy and option for BSc (Hons) Health Sciences: Complementary Therapies; BSc (Hons) Health Sciences: Therapeutic Bodywork; Graduate Diploma in Therapeutic Bodywork.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lectures 3 – 5 of this course are about the Theory and Application of EmoTrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMOTRANCE?  No I had never heard of it either. But it takes only two minutes with Google to discover that it yet another product of the enormous navel-gazing self-help industry. A new variant is born almost every day, and no doubt they make buckets of money for their inventors.  You can download a primer from &lt;a href="http://emotrance.com/"&gt;http://emotrance.com/&lt;/a&gt;. The web site announces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“EmoTrance REAL energy healing for the 21st Century”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are three quotations from the primer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I thought of the lady in the supermarket whose husband had died, and I spend the following time sending her my best wishes, and my best space time quantum healing efforts for her void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter how “bad”; something is or how old, it is ONLY AN ENERGY and energy can be moved with consciousness in quantum time, easily, and just for the asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is EmoTrance a Science?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Yes! But only if you can accept that all living creatures have an energetic/emotional system. Once you make that leap then EmoTrance is completely logical and just makes sense. Like all great discoveries, EmoTrance is simple, natural and you might find you have always been aware of these processes subconsciously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now back to Westminster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few slides about EmoTrance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/EmoTrance-Day2-s2-vs.jpg" alt="day 2 slide 2"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/EmoTrance-Day2-s3-vs.jpg" alt="day 2 slide 3"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/EmoTrance-Day2-s13-vs.jpg" alt="day 2 slide 13"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/EmoTrance-Day3-s9-vs.jpg" alt="day 3 slide 9"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is pure vitalistic psycho-babble.  The usual undefined use of impressive sounding words like “energy” and “quantum” with no defined meaning. Just preposterous made-up gobbledygook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting to EmoTrance, the course Psychotherapeutic Approaches in Naturopathy (3CMW606) had a lecture on Flower Essences.  The evidence says, not surprisingly, that the effects of flower essences is not distinguishable from placebo “The hypothesis that flower remedies are associated with effects beyond a placebo response is not supported by data from rigorous clinical trials.” (See Ernst Wien. Klin. Wochenschr. 2002 114(23-24):963-6).  Here are two of the slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/Flower-essences-lecture1-s19-s.jpg" alt="slide 19" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/Flower-essences-lecture1-s4-s.jpg" alt="slide 4" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last slide departs from the simply silly  to the totally mad.  Dowsing?  Kinesiology? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pendulums&lt;/strong&gt; I’m told from more than one source that the use of pendulums is not uncommon. both in teaching and by students in the Westminster University polyclinic  Apparently they provide an excellent way to choose a ‘remedy’ or make a diagnosis (well, I expect they are as good as the alternatives). If in doubt, guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course pendulums were popular with Cherie Blair &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1456688/Cherie-took-Leo-to-pendulum-healer-in-place-of-MMR-jab.html"&gt;who is reported&lt;/a&gt; to have taken her son Leo to a pendulum waver, &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1454835/Jack-Temple.html"&gt;Jack Temple&lt;/a&gt;, rather than have him vaccinated with MMR.  At least her delusions affected fewer people than those of her husband (the latest &lt;a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/"&gt;Iraq body count&lt;/a&gt; is about 100,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kinesiology&lt;/strong&gt; was originally a word that applied to the perfectly sensible science of human movement.  But &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_kinesiology"&gt;Applied Kinesiology&lt;/a&gt; more often refers now to a fraudulent and totally ineffective diagnostic method invented by (you guessed) a chiropractor.   It has been widely used by alternative medicine to misdiagnose food allergies. It does not work (Garrow, 1988: &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/garrow-kinesiology-bmj-1988.pdf"&gt;download reprint&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Chiropractic Council&lt;/strong&gt;  It is a mind-boggling sign of the incompetence of the General Chiropractic Council that they manage to include kinesiology within their definition of “evidence based care”.  Their definition is clearly sufficiently flexible to include anything whatsoever.  The incompetence of the GCC is documented in superb detail on &lt;a href="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2009/06/09/incompetence-and-the-general-chiropractic-council/"&gt;jdc325’s blog (James Cole)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence&lt;/strong&gt; (CHRE) is yet another example of the network of ineffective and incompetent quangos that plague us.. It is meant to ensure that regulation is effective but utterly fails to do so. The CHRE is &lt;a href="http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=20&amp;amp;storycode=4122930&amp;amp;c=2"&gt;quoted as saying&lt;/a&gt; “[The GCC] takes its role seriously and aspires to, and often maintains, excellence.”.   Like endorsing kinesiology and ‘craniosacral therapy’ perhaps? Quangos like the CHRE not only fail to ensure regulatory excellence, they actually endorse rubbish. They do more harm than good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reading list for the course includes the following books.  I guess the vibrational medicine (whatever that means) was covered already in the now infamous ‘&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=227"&gt;amethysts emit high yin energy&lt;/a&gt;‘ lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real magic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sylvia Hartman’s books seem to feature heavily in the reading list. I just got news of her latest effort&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to a special update to the June 2009 newsletter to announce Silvia Hartmann’s latest book “Magic, Spells &amp;amp; Potions” is now available to pre-order from our site. The eBook edition will be released this Sunday, the most magical day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://DragonRising.com/store/magic_spells_and_potions/?r=DR0609MSAP"&gt;http://DragonRising.com/store/magic_spells_and_potions/?r=DR0609MSAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do pre-order this exciting new book, not only will you be amongst the first to receive your copy, but you will also be entered into an exciting competition for Silvia Hartmann’s handmade copal amber magic pendant. Each paperback book pre-ordered will also be signed by the author and contain a unique blessing for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this is a serious book on real magic, potions and fortune telling if you are a beginner Silvia has provided ample sample spells and potions for you to practice working with before you start covering the advanced material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? No honestly, I didn’t invent that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that stuff of this sort is appropriate for a bachelor of science degree is simply ludicrous.  I have no doubt that Westminster’s new dean can see that as well as anyone else. She has the delicate diplomatic job of extirpating the nonsense,  I wish her well.&lt;/p&gt;

(National Biological Information Infrastructure)  They currently have 78 lessons related to pollination and pollinators listed.&lt;img title="pollinator" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/pollinator.jpg?w=150&amp;amp;h=135" alt="pollinator" width="150" height="135"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have some &lt;a href="http://pollinators.nbii.gov/portal/community/Communities/Ecological_Topics/Pollinators/Learn_About_Pollination/"&gt;fun resources on pollination&lt;/a&gt; and food, like this one: &lt;a href="http://www.pollinator.org/Resources/Chocolate%20and%20Pollinators.pdf"&gt;Chocolate’s Sweet Little Secret (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The cacao flower, while only about the diameter of a nickel, is complex in design and behavior, necessitating a special kind of animal to pollinate it.  Recent studies in cacao plantations indicate that midges, tiny flies that inhabit the damp, shady rain forest, are the only animals that can work their way through the complex cacao flower and pollinate it.  A member of the same insect family as the “no-see-um” flies that plague us  with their bites, this millimeter-long fly is from the family Ceratopogonidae and the genus Forcipomyia–a  very tiny animal with a very long name.  These cacao-pollinating midges are endemic not to plantations, but  to the tropical rain forest itself.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the way in which we grow cacao actually contributes to low pollination rates, since the midges aren’t very happy away from the rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy surfing!&lt;/p&gt;

This is not a mystery because of any theoretical problems - it has just been difficult so far, with the technology we have had available, to investigate this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can look at planets around other suns, but so far not with the detail necessary to identify life. This technology is rapidly progressing, however, and so we will likely have tantalizing clues in the coming years, and maybe a definitive answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been listening for intelligent signals from space, but so far have only sampled a tiny fraction of what might be out there. This is also looking for intelligent life only - and perhaps most life is not technology in a way that would lend itself to sending out radio signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best chance we have for finding extraterrestrial life is in our own solar system. Mars is a possible candidate - peharps there are microbes still clinging to existence on that dry cold world. More probes may give us an answer, but some believe we need to put scientists on the surface of Mars to do the kind of sophisticated investigation we would need to really answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is Europa, one of the large moons of Jupiter. Europa is covered with ice, and we know it gets hotter toward its core, so it stands to reason that at some depth the ice is liquid water - and where there is liquid water there is at least the potential for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years another moon has been added to the list of candidates for life - Saturn’s moon Enceladus. It was first observed that plumes of some gas or liquid was being ejected geyser style from the surface of Enceladus, immediately leading to speculation that this was liquid water. Perhaps, then Enceladus is like Europa with a liquid water interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently astronomers have made this possibility more likely by &lt;a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=CNG.1238a91ad4198d1b19148e150db81cec.5c1&amp;amp;show_article=1"&gt;discovering that the plumes of liquid being ejected from Enceladus contain crystals of salt&lt;/a&gt;.  Salt water is even more likely to harbor life. It has previously been discovered that the plumes contain organic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, astronomers say, Enceladus has the three ingredients we know are necessary for life - liquid water, organic compounds, and an energy source. The energy source is the tidal forces from Saturn itself - which stretches Enceladus as it orbits its parent planet, heating up its interior. The same is true for the large moons of Jupiter, the innermost of which, Io, is heated up so much by tidal forces that it is literally churning itself inside out with volcanic activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we have at least two candidates in our own solar system for liquid water that may contain life - Europa and Enceladus. This raises the interesting possibility that life in the universe may be more commonly found in such locations than on the surface of planets with atmospheres heated by their proximity to their parent star. Perhaps there are many more opportunities for life in moons orbiting gas giants. Perhaps there is more life living off of tidal friction than solar energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we can only speculate. That is the frustrating thing about our current state of knowledge of life in the universe - we have an “N” of 1. Until we start discovering life elsewhere we have no way of knowing what is common and what is rare when it comes to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of life elsewhere in our solar system, to me, is no intriguing and potentially important that I think it deserves dedicated missions to investigate further. I would like to see probes to Europa and Enceladus designed specifically to look for life. Perhaps we don’t have the technology yet, but I think its’ something we should start seriously working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we find life on one of these moons and it shares features with life on Earth, that would tell us something very profound about the origin of life. If the life we find is completely different, then we will have a completely separately evolved biochemistry to investigate, and we are also bound to learn a great deal about biology. Either way, the potential for new knowledge is astounding and deserves a high priority.&lt;/p&gt;

In a recently reported study, an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), &lt;a href="http://www.rxlist.com/celexa-drug.htm"&gt;Celexa&lt;/a&gt;, was shown &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/reducing_repetitive_behaviors_with_meds_not_the_goal"&gt;not to be effective in reducing repetitive behaviors&lt;/a&gt;. Another SSRI, &lt;a href="http://www.rxlist.com/lexapro-drug.htm"&gt;Lexapro&lt;/a&gt;, is to be combined with research on genetics and brain scans in a five-year study (funded with a $9.6 million federal grant). The study seeks to "explore possible mechanisms behind this craving for routine." Geneticist &lt;a href="http://www.psych.uic.edu/faculty/cooke.htm"&gt;Ed Cook&lt;/a&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://www.psych.uic.edu/ldn/"&gt;Laboratory of Developmental Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="http://www.psych.uic.edu/"&gt;psychiatry department of the University of Illinois-Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, notes that up to a quarter of individuals on the spectrum have "insistence on sameness." (My son certainly is in that number.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the June 24th &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chicago/chi-autism-research-city-zone-24jun24,0,3324184.story"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant in the study gets blood drawn for genetic tests, including an analysis of the genes related to serotonin, a neurotransmitter that is part of the brain's system for modulating mood and emotion. Participants' families are asked to donate blood samples so researchers can look for hereditary links. All the blood Cook collects from participants -- he's hoping for more than 250 -- will be shared with a national autism database for other researchers to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants with a high level of insistence on sameness are referred to the group's pharmacologist, &lt;a href="http://www.psych.uic.edu/faculty/owley.htm"&gt;Tom Owley&lt;/a&gt;. The outgoing head of UIC's Neurodevelopmental Psychopharmacology Clinic, Owley conducted a preliminary study two years ago on the antidepressant Lexapro, which affects serotonin levels. Sixty-five percent of participants who took the drug were helped, according to results of a detailed questionnaire completed by their parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/reducing_repetitive_behaviors_with_meds_not_the_goal"&gt;Celexa study&lt;/a&gt; is cited and the &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chicago/chi-autism-research-city-zone-24jun24,0,3324184.story"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt; article specifically notes that study. By combining research on Lexapro with genetics and brain scans, it's hoped that researchers can find out why a drug may help some individuals but not others, with a view to developing "medications targeted for people with specific autism symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son has been taking &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/too_many_meds"&gt;medications&lt;/a&gt; (SSRIs, though not Celexa or Lexapro; antipsychotics; others) since he was 7 years old. We've tried some other medications briefly; two of these---Ritalin and &lt;a href="http://www.rxlist.com/catapres-drug.htm"&gt;Clonidine&lt;/a&gt;---were very unhelpful and, indeed, had something more like deleterious results (as a result of which, Charlie took them only very briefly). My son having very limited speech---and being limited in his ability to identify and describe what he is feeling, physically as well as mentally---he cannot tell us how he feels taking a particular medication. Trying a new one, increasing a dosage, taking him off a medication: The only way we can gauge (guess) how he is feeling is by observing him very closely. And even then, it sometimes (most of the time) not always possible to tell what could be the medication, and what's Charlie reacting to things that have happened around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie's responses to medications have often not been what what predicted. I still remember the time I gave him an over-the-counter medication---Benadryl---after he'd gotten his arms and legs covered with flea and fly bites at the beach. Maybe it stopped the itching, but, far from getting drowsy, he stayed up past midnight and was very lively (and of course, we had company that night). So finding out ways to determine whether or how an individuals with limited communication might respond to a medication before they take it would be very helpful.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;AA’s own analysis was that 50% of all those who try AA leave within 90 days, which they describe as cause for ‘concern’. Their own data shows that is actually optimistic. In the 12-year period shown, 19% remain after 30 days, 10% remain after 90 days, and 5% remain after a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retention rate of AA is 5% after one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;60% of those surveyed were getting outside professional help. This means that any success (or failure) rate, however it is defined, can’t be attributed entirely to AA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An extensive study (Hester and Miller, Handbook of alcoholism treatment approaches) shows that peer-based 12-step alcohol treatment programs do NOT have a higher success rate than no treatment at all. Facilitated 12-step treatment (trained facilitators guiding subjects through the twelve-step process) were marginally better. “The two tests of AA found it inferior to other treatments or even no treatment but were not sufficient to rank AA reliably.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brief, non-confrontational interventions and motivational interviewing were found most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/06/25/at-long-last-i-agree-with-age-of-autism-about-something/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/KnkyZ5uOScI/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, it’s not my comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Chase survived in part because hundreds of people prayed to Father Emil Kapaun to intercede on his behalf. It was absolutely a miracle.” — Paula Kear, Chase’s mother&lt;/em&gt;People in Colwich like to touch Chase Kear’s arm or his shoulder with their fingers. Or they hug him. “Miracle Man,” they say. “Let me touch the miracle.” With anybody else in Colwich, this would be just talk. But it’s not just talk to the Vatican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among people that Ambrosi will consult on Friday will be Chase’s neurosurgeon, Raymond Grundmeyer, who said in a brief e-mail last week that he considers Chase’s survival a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psst, Chase’s family. Here’s your chance to ask then for your money back, since the neurosurgeon says he didn’t do anything. Hell, with such miraculous healings, who needs neurosurgeons at all? Maybe we should all just declare:  God is my neurosurgeon! Of course this is absurd. I don’t know the details of the case, but a person surviving a terrible accident after being treated medically makes for a pretty low-grade miracle to me. Wake me up when god does something unambiguous like healing an amputee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60% of them go to church only for weddings/christenings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60% of them don’t think religious studies should be compulsory in schools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;59% of them think that religion “has a negative influence on the world”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;55% of them are not bothered about religion (&lt;em&gt;Hemant adds: This means they’re essentially apathetic about religion.  Thanks, commenters!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50% of them have never prayed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;41% believe nothing happens to your body when you die&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30% of them (&lt;em&gt;only 30%!&lt;/em&gt;) believe in an afterlife&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16% have never been to church&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10% of them (&lt;em&gt;only 10%!&lt;/em&gt;) think they will be reincarnated as an animal/human&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is the case, then &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-8928-Philadelphia-Atheism-Examiner~y2009m6d24-Two-thirds-of-teenagers-dont-believe-in-God"&gt;this provides even more evidence against a common religious claim&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many Christian Evangelicals here in America claim that without there god there can be no morality. If that view held true, than we should expect to see these British teens to be self-absorbed brats who only care about themselves. However, the survey discovered the opposite to be the case. 90 percent of those surveyed believe that they should treat other people better than they treat themselves, trumping the “Golden Rule.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I made small fun of FoxNews, which caused a few commenters to accuse me of hypocrisy and being a “lib,” whatever that is. Some went so far as to suggest that I and the JREF had a deeply liberal agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote Sherman T. Potter: horse hockey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, to be clear, the JREF has no political stance whatsoever. We will criticize those that ignore scientific inquiry and praise those who embrace it, regardless of party. As a non-profit, we’re not permitted to endorse particular candidates or parties, and we have not done so. In the past few weeks, I have been critical of many media sources, including MSNBC, ABCNews, and yes, FoxNews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone investigating my personal political contributions on the Internet, will discover that I donated money to the campaign of Hal Bidlack, a friend of mine for some years now. I gave him a donation because I know him to be a man of honor, and I feel there are far too few of them in our government. I would have donated the money to his campaign regardless of his party, though he happens to be a Democrat. When I lived in Virginia, I registered as a Republican to support the campaign of James Burton, another man I believe would improve our government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a political independent, and I don’t know what party affiliations other JREF employees have, if any. I vote based on the issues of the day, and I care not for party. That disclosed, I have a more important message to convey: &lt;strong&gt;skepticism is not compatible with politics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245911680910"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d31594f71348f136</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Command Performance</title><published>2009-06-25T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/military/celebrities/edmcmahon.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Was sidekick Ed McMahon once Johnny Carson's commanding officer?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245908657277"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1538">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dcb451f9b2bee794</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Books"/><category term="Morphology"/><category term="Words words words"/><title type="html">Slang affixation: it's all mystery-y-ish-y</title><published>2009-06-25T05:42:26Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T05:42:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1538" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195314638?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=thevisualthes-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0195314638"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/~bgzimmer/slang.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you haven't picked up a copy of Michael Adams' new book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195314638?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=thevisualthes-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0195314638"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slang: The People's Poetry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, well, what are you waiting for? For starters, it's a lively and engaging look at English slang and its multitudinous forms. At the same time, it's a thoughtful interrogation of what "slang" actually is, and how we might determine its boundaries. One way that Michael expands traditional notions of slang is in his treatment of affixation, or what he amusingly calls "unorthodox lexifabricology." I talked to Michael about slangy affixation in the &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/dictionary/1898/"&gt;second part&lt;/a&gt; of my two-part interview with him for the &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/"&gt;Visual Thesaurus&lt;/a&gt;. An excerpt follows below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;VT:&lt;/b&gt; In your book, you have a whole section on slangy  affixes (prefixes, suffixes, and infixes). This is lexical  material that is not easily made into a dictionary entry, necessarily. For instance, there's the &lt;em&gt;-iz-&lt;/em&gt; infix (&lt;em&gt;hizzouse&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;house&lt;/em&gt;) and the &lt;em&gt;-diddly-&lt;/em&gt; infix (&lt;em&gt;scrum-diddly-umptious&lt;/em&gt;).  Is your  goal there to show that the &amp;quot;poetic&amp;quot;  productivity of  slang can work on a sort of sub-lexical level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MA:&lt;/b&gt;  In a way, I think it's both sub-lexical  and super-lexical. The  very practice of using  infixes like that can be slangy, so that's super-lexical. The same is true with  suffixes like &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt;. The slanginess comes out  of the suffixing as much as it comes out of a particular suffix that you would  define.  But it's also true that because  those structures are so flexible and they can be used so readily on the fly or in the moment, it's easy for people to use them to come up with &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/?w=nonce%20word"&gt;nonce words&lt;/a&gt;. They're infinitely productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I  argued in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195175999?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=thevisualthes-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0195175999"&gt;Slayer Slang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and argue again in this book is that we think that there are constraints on these suffixes, but there  really aren't.  Always, eventually, we  figure out a way to get outside of those constraints, so that we can make up  new words. You'd think if you were  looking historically at the language, you'd say, "Well, you can see what some of  the rules applying to &lt;em&gt;-y &lt;/em&gt;suffixing are.   You can't add the &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt; suffix to a seven-syllable word."  But you can, if somebody decides to do  it.  And in some situation where that  could be a slang opportunity,  it's not just that  somebody could do it, somebody &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; do it. We just won't know about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;VT:&lt;/b&gt; Or we'll know about it if we  Google for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MA:&lt;/b&gt; Well, exactly, and as I say in the  book,  one of my most astonishing adventures over the last several  years has been just plugging these in, really just saying, &amp;quot;Now surely, this can&amp;#39;t take the -&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;  suffix,&amp;quot; and then finding out about fifty percent of the time that it can. Fifty percent of the time it doesn&amp;#39;t, but  there&amp;#39;s no natural reason that the words that I tested that haven&amp;#39;t appeared  with a &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt; suffix yet couldn't take that &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt; suffix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Read the rest &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/dictionary/1898/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no better proof of Michael's contention about the productivity of the &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt; suffix than a recent &lt;a href="http://blog.oup.com/2009/05/y-suffix-bananas/"&gt;OUPblog post&lt;/a&gt; by Mark Peters, whose &lt;a href="http://wordlust.blogspot.com/"&gt;Wordlustitude&lt;/a&gt; blog is a never-ending morpholicious nonce-word-athon. You might think that &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt; would resist suffixation on words already ending with the /i/ vowel, but you would be wrong. Mark has found a ton of "double-y" words in the wild, like &lt;i&gt;jealousy-y&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;technology-y&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;secret identity-y&lt;/i&gt;. The nonce formation that takes the cake, though, is &lt;i&gt;mystery-y-ish-y&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;My faith tells me that marital sex, like all acts blessed with holiness, is a great mystery — and from thence comes its beauty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Well, it WOULD be wouldn’t it? Since Dawn’s not married, she can’t be having marital sex. It’s all mystery-y-ish-y. And she can imagine it’s pretty, if she wants.&lt;br&gt;
(May 23, 2006, &lt;a href="http://pandagon.blogsome.com/2006/05/23/turn-the-lights-off-youre-encouraging-the-child-molesters/"&gt;Pandagon&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mark writes, &amp;quot;After years of weird-word collecting, I&amp;#39;m pretty unfazed by words with multiple, redundant, exuberant suffixes… However, even I was gobsmacked out of my chair when I spotted &lt;em&gt;mystery-y-ish-y&lt;/em&gt;." Indeed, the mystery-y-ish-iness of English word formation never ceases to amaze.&lt;/p&gt;

Specifically, I commented about how he is not only undergoing the chemotherapy ordered by his doctors. As you may recall, Hauser is a 13-year-old boy who, after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and undergoing one round of chemotherapy, refused to undergo any more. His mother supported him, and ultimately a judge had to order Daniel's parents to make sure that he underwent standard therapy for his very curable form of cancer. Daniel's mother Colleen took off with him shortly afterward, rumored to be heading for Tijuana. Ultimately, Colleen Hauser turned herself and Daniel in, and Daniel started chemotherapy. What provoked my post was how Daniel's tumor was shrinking in response to chemotherapy after having grown while he was off chemotherapy and relying on quackery, specifically Daniel and his family's reaction. Consistent with the behavior of woo fans everywhere, Daniel and his family didn't attribute his tumor's response to the chemotherapy, but rather to the vitamins and other stuff in various "alternative" concoctions Daniel was taking in addition to chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it's so predictable that woo-fans who "integrate" quackery with their conventional science-based medical therapy almost invariably attribute any good that happens to the woo and any complications to the conventional medicine, that I'm half tempted to call it a law and come up with a name for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be that as it may, there was also a court hearing for an update on Daniel's condition in which Daniel's parents requested that the court rescind the child protection order governing Daniel's medical care and giving Judge John Rodenberg jurisdiction over his care. Given that the last time Judge Rodenberg gave the Hausers too much leeway Colleen Hauser bolted and ran with Daniel to keep him from chemotherapy, the judge's ruling was &lt;a href="http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/health/48911802.html?elr=KArksUUUoDEy3LGDiO7aiU"&gt;about what you would expect&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/update_daniel_hauser_must_continue_chemo.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/update_daniel_hauser_must_continue_chemo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/7t8S12KtjlI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245905051494"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1537">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/69e56b20d4a0b31e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and politics"/><title type="html">The biggest self of self is indeed self</title><published>2009-06-25T04:15:43Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T04:15:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1537" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Sanford1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="408764"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Sanford1a.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="45453"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Gov. Mark Sanford, back &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1526"&gt;in pocket&lt;/a&gt;, explained himself (from the NYT &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/us/24text-sanford.html"&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt; of his &lt;a href="http://video.nytimes.com/video/2009/06/24/us/1194841154720/gov-mark-sanford-admits-affair.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I'm here because if you were to look at God's laws, they're in every instance designed to protect people from themselves. I think that that is the bottom line of God's law, that it's not a moral, rigid list of do's and don'ts just for the heck of do's and don'ts. It is indeed to protect us from ourselves. And the biggest self of self is, indeed, self; that sin is, in fact, grounded in this notion of what is it that I want as opposed to somebody else?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assertion that "the biggest self of self is indeed self" makes a poetic sort of psychological and theological sense, I think, though I'm not quite sure how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this might be a (perhaps garbled) quotation or allusion of some sort. But I doubt that the governor is familiar with Gerard Manley Hopkins' unfinished fragment &lt;em&gt;On the Portrait of Two Beautiful Young People&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;21   There's none but good can bé good, both for you&lt;br&gt;
22   And what sways with you, maybe this sweet maid;&lt;br&gt;
23   None good but God—a warning wavèd to&lt;br&gt;
24   One once that was found wanting when Good weighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;25   Man lives that list, that leaning in the will&lt;br&gt;
26   No wisdom can forecast by gauge or guess,&lt;br&gt;
27   The selfless self of self, most strange, most still,&lt;br&gt;
28   Fast furled and all foredrawn to No or Yes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;29   Your feast of; that most in you earnest eye&lt;br&gt;
30   May but call on your banes to more carouse.&lt;br&gt;
31   Worst will the best. What worm was here, we cry,&lt;br&gt;
32   To have havoc-pocked so, see, the hung-heavenward boughs?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;33   Enough: corruption was the world's first woe.&lt;br&gt;
34   What need I strain my heart beyond my ken?&lt;br&gt;
35   O but I bear my burning witness though&lt;br&gt;
36   Against the wild and wanton work of men.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Poser suggests that "the biggest self of self is self" might be a bad translation of some Sanskrit scripture; but if so, I haven't been able to locate the original. And in any case, that seems even further from Sanford's style than Hopkins is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audio for the whole passage is here: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a more careful transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:smaller;color:#ff0000"&gt;But I'm- I'm- I'm here&lt;br&gt;
because if you were to look at God's laws&lt;br&gt;
uh they're in every instance designed to protect people from themselves&lt;br&gt;
um I think that that is the bottom line of God's law&lt;br&gt;
that it's not a- a- a- a moral r- rigid list of dos and don'ts just for the heck of dos and donts&lt;br&gt;
it is indeed to protect us&lt;br&gt;
from ourselves and the biggest&lt;br&gt;
self of self is&lt;br&gt;
is- is in- indeed self&lt;br&gt;
that sin is in fact grounded in this notion&lt;br&gt;
of what is it that I want&lt;br&gt;
as opposed to somebody else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see only one problem with the NYT transcript: the question mark at the end is inappropriate, since the what-clause, despite the subject-aux inversion, is not a direct question, but rather the complement of &lt;em&gt;notion of&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a lot is left out of a transcript. In this case, the performance of the phrase &amp;quot;the biggest self of self is indeed self&amp;quot; — especially the internal pausing — is consistent with the idea that the governor had something less poetic in mind, for example &amp;quot;the biggest danger to self is indeed self&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;the biggest danger to ourselves is indeed ourselves&amp;quot;. Or maybe &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1245"&gt;We have met the enemy, and he is us&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cited phrase by itself is here: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — following a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1537#comment-34600"&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; with misterfricative in the comments below, I suggest that Gov. Sanford had in mind a phrase like "the biggest source of sin is indeed self", and then performed a rare double-anticipation speech error. ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My vote for the best comment on the whole Sanford saga goes to the lolcat version &lt;a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2009/06/24/todays-lolcat-picture-dedicated-to-south-carolina-governor-mark-sanford/"&gt;offered by John Scalzi&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[But then, maybe &lt;a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2009/06/25/the-self-of-self/#comment-280624"&gt;the poem contributed by Salient&lt;/a&gt; at Crooked Timber is even better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;The biggest self of self is self:&lt;br&gt;

As usual, I tend to be open to trying new technologies, but don’t like being at the bleeding edge (where people get hurt).  There’s no doubt that electronic reading devices have a long way to go, but there’s also little doubt that they’re the wave of the future, or at least a sizable part of it.  And the technology seems to have reached a point where Kindle editions of books are a non-trivial part of the market.  My own decision to get one was definitely influenced by the number of queries I received about whether my own book would have a Kindle edition.  (Answer:  yes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now it’s arrived!  So the question is:  what’s the first book I should buy?  An obvious choice would be &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt;, as the &lt;a href="http://infinitesummer.org/"&gt;Infinite Summer&lt;/a&gt; project is underway and (as I have learned) toting a thousand-page book around on a cross-country flight is less than perfectly convenient.  But, of course, I already own that book.  And, as &lt;a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/06/infinite-pagination.php"&gt;Matthew Yglesias points out&lt;/a&gt;, you don’t want to buy Kindle versions of impressive books that you can prominently display to buff up your credentials as a person of culture.  And the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; would be to display a giant, impressive book on your shelves, but one that was clearly unread and in pristine condition, even though you really did read it, only you read it on your Kindle.  Worst of all possible worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea, then, is to find a good book that I haven’t yet read, but not one that is &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; good — not good enough that I’d rather have the dead-tree edition.  Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245901439128"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1536">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/905e14fa2b7a40e4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Semantics"/><title type="html">"The risk that the taxpayer does not bear a disproportionate burden"</title><published>2009-06-25T03:06:18Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T03:06:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1536" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/focus/2009/imf/index.pdf"&gt;IMF report on Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, point 47 of the "Staff Appraisal" (p. 28), dealing with a proposed "National Asset Management Agency" (aka "Bad Bank"), reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;47. With regard to NAMA, risk-sharing structures should be considered to address the well-known pricing problem. The pricing of distressed assets is complex and can slow down the transfer of assets from the troubled bank. Risk-sharing can potentially create better incentives for managing the bad assets. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;And they also guard against the risk that the taxpayer does not bear a disproportionate burden of the costs cleaning up the banks.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;[emphasis added]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breffni O'Rourke, who sent in this example of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=overnegation"&gt;overnegation&lt;/a&gt;, comments that "My fear is that they actually mean exactly what they say."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phrase of the form "the risk that X" suggests that X is possible but not certain, and would be a Bad Thing. Some &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22the+risk+that%22&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;examples from the web&lt;/a&gt; where X is a positive statement (X in bold):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;a hidden asteroid in a stealth-path will hit the earth&lt;/strong&gt;…&lt;br&gt;
The risk that &lt;strong&gt;HIV-seropositive drug users (DUs) transmit their HIV-infection&lt;/strong&gt;…&lt;br&gt;
… the Risk that &lt;strong&gt;Hatchery Enhancement Will Reduce Genetic Diversity of White Seabass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;mass killings occur&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;a child will develop diabetes&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;I will have a major complication after my valve operation&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22the+risk+that+*+not%22&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;examples where X contains a negation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;acquisitions might not be integrated successfully&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;she might not be able to carry a future pregnancy to term&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;Adolor may not receive regulatory approval of Entereg (alvimopan)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;DHS is not creating the institutional knowledge needed&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;Glu may not launch the mobile game as scheduled&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;there's not enough binder in the paint for it to stick&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;/span&gt; …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether positive or negative, X is something that the writer hopes to avoid. So when the IMF staffers write about "&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;the risk that &lt;strong&gt;the taxpayer does not bear a disproportionate burden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;", it's easy to see why Breffni is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

Manifested Glory removed the video, but as the Scientologists have learned, nothing stays dead on the Internet. Here’s the news report, complete with clips from the original video.&lt;/p&gt;

If you&amp;#39;ve got a little time — there is a bit of tl;dr about it all — read &lt;a href="http://www.reasonproject.org/archive/item/debate_001_sam_harris_v_philip_ball3/"&gt;Sam Harris's exchanges with Philip Ball&lt;/a&gt;. Sam Harris we all know; Ball is a very reputable science writer who is also very much one of those &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m an atheist, but…&amp;quot; fellows. It&amp;#39;s an infuriating conversation because, as usual, rather than talking about what us &amp;quot;New Atheists&amp;quot; actually think, Harris has to constantly go back and address the blithe misconceptions of the accommodationist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Harris's conclusion in particular is worth reading anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I realize that my tone of chastisement has probably grown very tedious and could be mistaken for hostility. But I can't help but feel that there is a great asymmetry between our points of view - both in how fully they have been thought out and in their degree of the moral seriousness. I see the perpetuation of ancient tribalism and ignorance (read "religion") to be a grave problem, and the source of much unnecessary suffering in the world; you claim that the problem is either not very serious or that it is unavoidable--in either case there is not much to be done. You do not seem to see what an astonishing number of the world's conflicts and missed opportunities arise from people's false knowledge about God, and when specific instances are pointed out to you, you deem them to be inevitable (if it's not religion it would be something else), or you defensively say, well of course I object to that instance of religious stupidity: parents shouldn't withhold blood transfusions from their children!... But the truth is, a comprehensive response to the problem of religious ignorance is possible, and a piecemeal response is totally unprincipled and bound to seem so. Our world has be shattered, and is reliably shattered anew with each subsequent generation, by irreconcilable claims about God and his magic books. Until we stop enabling these competing delusions--by our silence and by our silly attempts to change the subject--we will have no one to blame but ourselves when medieval ideas come crashing into public life--as they do, and will, to our great detriment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a weird thing to argue with an atheist who claims religion is unavoidable (Oh? So what's so special about &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;?) and isn't that bad or is actually beneficial (So why aren't you going to church for your health?), but they're out there and they are irritatingly inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there's the mischaracterization of outspoken atheists and the apparent contempt for theistic scientists. Here's &lt;a href="http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/religionandtheology/1433/the_two_faces_of_new_atheism_/"&gt;another example of that attitude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should not overlook the New Atheists' support for science, progressive views and legitimization of non-belief as a viable alternative. Unfortunately, their record is also marked by an intolerance of religious people and the alienation of potential progressive allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That always baffles me. So if I say that I'm proud to be an atheist, I think theism is a profound fallacy that is incompatible with scientific thinking, that's &lt;i&gt;intolerance&lt;/i&gt; and then these religious allies are going to get pissy and decide evolution isn't worth defending anymore? That's an awfully broad interpretation of intolerance, and an extraordinarily dismissive opinion of the theistic evolutionists. I guarantee you that no matter how &lt;i&gt;rude&lt;/i&gt; a New Atheist might be to religion, Ken Miller will never give up on teaching evolution or trying to explain science to creationists. The accommodationists can stop trying to scare us into silence with these goofy, unrealistic threats.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.case.edu/singham/2009/06/24/the_new_atheists_vs_the_accommodationists"&gt;Mano Singham makes a similar point&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accommodationists argue that it is a mistake to insist that science is antithetical to religion because if science is determined to be an intrinsically atheistic enterprise, then even so-called moderate religionists will turn away from science and not support efforts to oppose the teaching of religious ideas such as intelligent design in science classes. This kind of mistaken solicitousness for the sensitivities of religious people, the fear that they will take their ball and go home if others are mean to them, is not new. During the run up to the Scopes Monkey trial in 1925, there were many accommodationists of that era who did not want Clarence Darrow to defend Scopes because they felt that his scorn for religious beliefs would alienate potential religious allies. We now view Darrow's performance in that trial as one of the high points in opposing the imposition of religious indoctrination in public schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no downside to godless vigor. Nobody has come up with a reason yet why we should sit down and shut up.&lt;/p&gt;

Details are sketchy, but it's safe to say in the world of 9, something has gone horribly wrong, the world has been destroyed, and the only survivors are some &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3871736601/"&gt;cute little sack people and an army of murderous machines&lt;/a&gt;.  One can't help but think that a few squiddies from the Matrix somehow tunnelled into Little Big Planet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it tickles my fancy, if only because it checks the requisite boxes of "post apocalyptic dystopia" and "technopunk machinery".  Which is good, because some of the people behind the film have been nice enough to send me these &lt;em&gt;ludicrously&lt;/em&gt; high res images of the Fabricator, a factory robot with misfiring synapses that has been building the war machines.  Click on the pictures below for full size images - they really are massive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the beast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above image is a down scaled crop from this texture plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underneath the texturing are the bones of the machine, as lovingly illustrated in this artwork:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a detail from the above graphic, and yet it's big enough that I could make it into a desktop wallpaper, just for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also been given an exclusive piece of artwork showing 3 and 4, two of the small "stitch punks" at the centre of the film's plot.  The PR bumf says:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Communicating visually, not verbally, 3 and 4 are the scholarly twins who voraciously catalogue everything they can see and find, recording and building a massive database for the group of the world that surrounds them and the history that led up to their creation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several specific initiatives were mentioned in the press release, such as more section 8 (housing) vouchers, better interagency communication, and increased funding to independent living centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all moves in the right direction, yes.  But conspicuously absent (still) in the press release is any mention of the core issue of institutional bias in the health care system and the need for significant &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/words_or_lack_thereof_from_obama_and_harkin_on_cca"&gt;health care reform&lt;/a&gt; in order to actually realize Olmstead.  It's continuing, to me anyway, to be very hard to believe that the administration is truly "getting it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that may not be very obvious to policy makers is that many of us who rely on "the system" have been lied to and let down so many times now that to eliminate something we care deeply about from all discussion ends up feeling like "&lt;a href="http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/last+straw.html"&gt;the last straw&lt;/a&gt;."  The first time a promise is broken, OK, stuff happens, and there are complex issues at play always.  But for many of us this is just one more thing in a long line of being ignored and neglected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to see some more aggressive action on core issues in health care reform--time for the administration to "&lt;a href="http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/put+your+money+where+your+mouth+is.html"&gt;put the money where its mouth is&lt;/a&gt;."  Else, "The Year of Community Living" is just another broken promise and more "&lt;a href="http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/salt+in+a+wound.html"&gt;salt in the wound&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

Creationist cults simply &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that life must be more than matter, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/smackdown_please.php"&gt;mind-body dualists&lt;/a&gt; (which includes most alternative medicine advocates) are &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; that humans are more than an “ugly bag of mostly water” (sorry for the geek reference).  If you can stick with me here, I’ll explain to you a bit of the history surrounding this fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us intuitively feel that we are both a body and a person.  In every day life, it makes a certain operational sense to think of our “mind” as being something distinct.  From a biological standpoint, however, this doesn’t work as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biology was one of the last of the “natural philosophies” to become a science.  It was clear to those who studied chemistry and physics that certain principles seemed to explain the natural world, but those who studied living things were mostly involved in description.  Still, biology has become a science in its own right. &lt;a href="http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e01_2/autonomy.htm"&gt;According to Ernst Mayr&lt;/a&gt;, one of the greatest biologists of the last century, a number of events preceded biology being recognized as a legitimate science.  One vital event was the recognition that all biological processes were constrained by the laws of physics and chemistry.  Another important step was the rejection of two erroneous principles: &lt;em&gt;vitalism&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;teleology&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleology &lt;/strong&gt;is the idea that there is some larger end-point or goal that drives biological processes, such as the idea of the ladder of ascent where the development of life has had, as its goal, the creation of more and more complex forms.  Darwin’s synthesis of natural selection and evolution pretty much destroyed this idea.  Clearly, if stochastic processes can drive the changes we see in living beings, determinism is out the door.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2008/06/evolving_without_gods_permissi.php"&gt;Evolution has elements that are random (changes in environment, mutations, etc.) but other elements that are decidedly non-random&lt;/a&gt; (for example, convergent adaptations are difficult to call “random”—sure the processes that underlie them are random, but these processes and pressures lead to a non-random result).  But from a “cosmic” standpoint, there is no room left for teleologic explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More offensive to me as a physician is the idea of &lt;em&gt;vitalism&lt;/em&gt;.  This ancient principle says that the difference between living and non-living things is some sort of non-material vital force.  As the natural philosophers of the last few centuries became more sophisticated, they worked with this assumption and tried to define it scientifically.  For example, it was felt that organic and inorganic matter differed in that, if melted with heat, only inorganic matter could re-crystalize naturally with the removal of the heat source (since we obviously cannot add that essential vital force).  This seemed to give a “scientific” way of testing whether or not something was from a “living” source.   If this were found to be true, it might pave the way for more experiments that could help show that there must be some sort of “elan vital” that animates living matter.  &lt;a href="http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&amp;amp;ProduktNr=223979&amp;amp;Ausgabe=225203&amp;amp;ArtikelNr=13463&amp;amp;filename=13463.pdf"&gt;In 1828, a chemist named Friedrich Wohler synthesized urea&lt;/a&gt;, an organic compound, from two inorganic compounds.  In other words, he created “life” from “non-life”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, and experiments like it, effectively destroyed the best attempt to use knowledge of natural laws to divide living from non-living systems. The implications were probably unimportant to Wohler and many others, but from a modern perspective, this is seen as the beginning of the end for vitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death of vitalism, and the discovery of genetics, allowed biology to grow into a mature scientific discipline.  There are no processes in biology that have not been amenable to scientific investigation or that have required a &lt;em&gt;deus ex machina&lt;/em&gt; to fully understand.  That doesn’t mean that vitalism is dead.  Since we, as human beings, operationally see ourselves and both “mind” and “body”, we will always be tempted to think vitalistically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially true in the most anthropocentric of sciences, medicine.  All alternative medicine is based on the idea that we are more than biology, that there is some force, some &lt;em&gt;elan vital&lt;/em&gt; that animates us and elevates us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chiropractic uses the concept of “vertebral subluxation complexes” that block the flow of vital energy, despite the lack of any evidence for these things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acupuncture, &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;, and other “energy therapies” claim to affect the role of &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt;, or vital energy, a non-organic, immeasurable  force that animates us.  Such a vital force has never been found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homeopathy makes claims that some sort of magic happens to water when they shake it just right.  In this case, it’s actually the water that has some sort of vital force imposed upon it, but then this magic water is supposed to be able to affect human biology via a presumably equally invisible and immeasurable process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something is immeasurable and un-observable, either directly or indirectly, then it is not medically relevant.  Remember, if you are claiming that an intervention is helping a patient, then you are claiming that it is measurable and observable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a measurable, observable phenomenon is better explained by known physical laws than by a vitalistic explanation, then why make up a silly, non-reality-based explanation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitalism, an ancient and discredited philosophy, has become irrelevant in modern thinking with two important exceptions: alternative medicine, and religion.  That, right there, should tell you something important.&lt;/p&gt;

This week, in &lt;a href="http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b31ca2928f7cb0fba7aa3341ff400e16.html"&gt;a University of Colorado study&lt;/a&gt; of the geysers spewing from Enceladus, astronomers found the water lacked sodium. They observed it using the 10 meter Keck and 4 meter Anglo Australian ground-based telescopes, and detected very little if any sodium in the geysers. If the plumes originated from an undersurface ocean then they are expected to have sodium in them. Instead, given the unsalty nature of the geysers, they surmise there may be pockets of liquid water under the surface which evaporates into space, or it could be from crustal plates of surface ice rubbing against each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2005, the Cassini space probe orbiting Saturn surprised astronomers when it detected geysers of water spewing from the icy moon Enceladus. This week, &lt;a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/newsreleases/newsrelease20090624/"&gt;in a JPL and Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics study&lt;/a&gt; of the outermost ring of Saturn, astronomers found the ring particles contained sodium. They observed it using the Cassini spacecraft, and detected sodium salts in the rings. This ring is known to be replenished by Enceladus’s geysers.  If the plumes originated from an undersurface ocean then they are expected to have sodium in them. Given the salty nature of the rings, they surmise there must be a global ocean under the surface which shoots water into space where it replenished that ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="40%"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh, say what? Which is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beats me. I’m a violent star-explodey kind of guy, not an exooceanologist. I imagine the authors of the two papers have their opinions on both studies, and I’d love to hear what they have to say. I’d also like to see the spectra obtained by the no-salt-in-the-plumes team first (because a non-detection of something is always on shakier ground than a positive detection of something) before I would come to any conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thus is science. Two observations, two good teams, two very different conclusions. That’s what it’s like on the cutting edge… and we’ll need more observations to cut through all this. Happily, as Cassini orbits the Saturn system it will be passing directly through the plumes at least twice more, giving astronomers that many more chances to see what’s happening on that tiny little moon so far away. &lt;/p&gt;

Two different worlds: That's what services for children on the autism spectrum and services for adults on the autism spectrum are like, according to Shawn Lattanzio, Montgomery County's program manager of a Maryland initiative to help autistic students transition to adulthood. Today's &lt;a href="http://www.gazette.net/stories/06242009/poolnew181200_32541.shtml"&gt;Gazette.net&lt;/a&gt; highlights some of the post-school issues adults with disabilities face. Families are in "shock" when school services end and they see what programs for adults are like compared to that for children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlook can be grim, advocates and officials say. The waiting list for housing and other state services can be decades long. Doctors oftentimes balk at accepting Medicaid. Jobs are scarcer than for non-disabled people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several county and state agencies partner to make that transition as seamless as possible for the more than 5,500 students in Montgomery County between the ages of 14 and 21. The state gives priority to people in their first year out of school. The state's "New Directions" program, launched in 2005, lets parents decide how to spend their children's funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All but a few of the graduates will receive day service and possibly supported employment, Lattanzio said. The state pays for a fraction of the therapies, behavioral management and family supports that most had while in school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anchor that can steady the transition most is finding meaningful employment, advocates and parents say. But less than half of developmentally disabled adults in Maryland had jobs last year, according to a November report by Cornell University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are programs and plans to help with the transition. But the recurring problem is that there just aren't enough programs and, indeed, &lt;em&gt;jobs&lt;/em&gt; for adults to transition into. &lt;a href="http://www.gazette.net/stories/06242009/poolnew181200_32541.shtml"&gt;Gazette.net&lt;/a&gt; describes the situation of 22-year-old Ashley Thompson of Germantown. She received a  "certificate of attendance" in 2008, the diploma awarded students when they reach 21, and has been working part-time at a private preschool and has also been volunteering with preschoolers at Germantown Elementary School. But her training has not been deemed sufficient for the school system that educated her to hire her: "School officials balked at the idea because she had only the certificate," her mother, Holly Thompson notes, because &lt;a href="http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/"&gt;Montgomery County Public Schools&lt;/a&gt; policy requires that paraeducators to have a full-fledged high school diploma and at least one year of college. Ironically, Thompson was regularly featured in Montgomery County Public Schools publications as an example of the success of special needs programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you leave the shiny world of services for those under 21 behind, the bloom is indeed off the proverbial rose. I think we all know what is wrong with that picture.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245879572149"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/06/crossword_guy_just_doesnt_get.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/237e1b2451fe9142</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Bad Logic"/><title type="html">Crossword Guy just doesn't get math</title><published>2009-06-24T20:10:55Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T20:10:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~3/jSjzZhJtxXI/crossword_guy_just_doesnt_get.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/06/crossword_guy_just_doesnt_get.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; One of my pet peeves about people and math is that most 
people don't really have a clue of what math is. I've been writing
this blog for something over three years, and by the standards of
a lot of people, I've almost never written about math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yesterday, my son's kindergarten class had a picnic. On my way home, 
I was listening to the local NPR station, which was interviewing some
crossword puzzle writer whose name I cannot remember; I will therefore refer
to him as "crossword-boy".  (It was not Will Shortz; Shortz is much smarter than the
guy they were interviewing.) At one point, they asked him something about 
Sudoku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; His response was a bit disjointed - he couldn't decide whether to talk about
the history of Sudoku or about his opinion of it. His opinion is that it's
incredibly dull and pointless, and that designing good Sudoku doesn't require as
much creativity as designing good crosswords. (Just that much is annoying: I'm
a Sudoku addict, and I've definitely noticed dramatic differences in Sudokus
from different places. Will Shortz's Sudoku books have great ones; most computerized
Sudoku games generate rather boring ones; the ones in most newspapers are 
obviously computer generated.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In the course of babbling about how uninteresting, non-creative, and
unsatisfying Sudoko puzzles are, he let loose with the real stupidity: "You know,
Sudoku doesn't even have to use numbers, it can use any 9 symbols. It's not a
mathematical puzzle &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Because it doesn't rely on arithmetic, according to crossword-boy, 
it's not mathematical &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. He went on to say that it's 
just a &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt; puzzle, not a math puzzle at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Sorry pal, but logic &lt;em&gt;is math&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Sudoku is an incredibly mathematical puzzle. It's not an 
&lt;em&gt;arithmetic&lt;/em&gt; puzzle, but it's a highly mathematical one.
 In computer science terms, it's a moderately
complex constraint-solving puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Math is more than arithmetic. It's more than numbers. Math
is really the formal study of logic and structure. Numbers and arithmetic
are one kind of structured system described using logic which can be
studied and understood using math. But pretty much &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;
with a precise, formal structure to it has at least an element of
mathematics. The structure of crossword-boy's crossword puzzles 
is fundamentally mathematical.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/06/crossword_guy_just_doesnt_get.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/jSjzZhJtxXI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245875202388"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2518">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a76e54d814be90fa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">US Supreme Court Ruling on Special Education</title><published>2009-06-24T17:48:57Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T17:48:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/19izQXW4FIE/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245875202388"><id gr:original-id="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/?p=1634">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8b7199a7c2d09801</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Man Bites Dog!

Socially, politically, economically, and legally, among others.  There are &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/"&gt;a number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/"&gt;very good&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/"&gt;bloggers here&lt;/a&gt; who often address gender issues, and I'm not typically one of them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two things happened to me yesterday that brings up a gender issue that nobody speaks about: &lt;b&gt;a man's rights in an unplanned pregnancy&lt;/b&gt;.  I reconnected with an old friend on facebook who had knocked up his (much younger) girlfriend a few years ago, and didn't want a kid.  &lt;i&gt;She&lt;/i&gt; wanted to keep it, putting him in a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22_(logic)"&gt;catch-22&lt;/a&gt;.  Either he could be involved in this kid's life as a father but separately from the mother, he could try to make a family out of this unit, or he could choose to have nothing to do with the mother or the child.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the problem, as I see it, is this: &lt;b&gt;no matter what he chooses, he's on the hook for 18 years of financial support.&lt;/b&gt;  Legally, there &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; good reasons for setting up the system to favor the rights of the mother and the welfare of the child.  Back when the policies that govern this issue were established, the following things were true:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;women did not have significant earning power in the workforce,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;abortions were unsafe and, in most places, illegal,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being a single mom was a dreadful social stigma, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having a child was often the only &lt;i&gt;legal&lt;/i&gt; leverage a woman had against her spouse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
In other words, before women had the right to choose, the ability to work and make money, and basically to control their own destiny, this was an incredibly important legal protection granted to them by the courts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, women do have earning power, they do have access to abortions if they want them, and choice is a paramount right for them.  Yet it is &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; the case that, no matter what the man wants, he's on the hook for 18 years of financial support regardless of what &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; chooses.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this happened to my friend years ago (and he chose to go for the raise-a-family option), my wife found out that one of her friends is in this situation right now.  His ex-girlfriend is pregnant by him and wants to keep the baby.  He doesn't want it.  I think that it's early enough (2 months) that he shouldn't be on the financial hook for the next 18 years.  But legally, not only is &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; responsible, but even &lt;a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2004046062_sperm01.html"&gt;sperm donors have been legally held accountable for financial support&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href="http://www.volokh.com/posts/1199491480.shtml"&gt;multiple states&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article2994783.ece"&gt;in the UK as well&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I'm curious as to what &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; think.  What do you think a man's legal obligations should be when he impregnates a woman?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, mind you, &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; think that the choice of whether to have the kid or not should always lie with the woman (it's &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; body), but I think the man should be able to choose whether he wants to be a dad or not.  I think that if &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; chooses abortion, it's his responsibility to pay half.  But I think that if she chooses to have the child, with or without him, he should have the right to say, "without me, please."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, the courts &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; place the welfare of the child first.  Is this the right thing to do in this day and age?  What do you think?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/ethics_question_a_mans_rights.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245871761496"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13893">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/751f39ce0a0b1ff0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Google"/><title type="html">How to Get the Google Hook-Up</title><published>2009-06-24T18:47:30Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T18:47:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/how-to-get-the-google-hook-up/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">When Google opened a major routing center in Lenoir, N.C., some &lt;a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/freak-shots-is-google-the-gift-that-keeps-taking/"&gt;community members complained&lt;/a&gt; that the town gave Google to much in the way of incentives -- such as sales-tax-free electrical power.

&lt;p&gt;What those news stories I post about all have in common is they were written by an outsider reporter, by someone who is covering the protest, the town hall meeting, or the legislative decision, not by someone who is participating.  The news stories may have quotes from a parent or professional (and occasionally, very rarely, from a self-advocate), but they are not first person accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/6/21/745361/-No-one-asked-us"&gt;No one asked us&lt;/a&gt;, a blog entry by KibbutzAmiad on DailyKos, is a first person account.  It is a first person account by a support worker that includes the perspective of people who are affected by the budget cuts, but who were, for various reasons, not part of protests, town hall meetings, or giving input into legislative decisions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long quotes are considered bad form.  But KibbutzAmiad's post is so powerful that deciding what blurbs to crop out was beyond even my brutal editorial sheers.  Do read &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/6/21/745361/-No-one-asked-us"&gt;the whole thing&lt;/a&gt; as well; this is still only an excerpt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine being told that you will lose your means to get to work, your home, your means to grocery shop, and all the people that make up your daily life.  Imagine being told this and being unable to read, unable to do your own banking, unable to take care of yourself in the ways most of us take for granted.  You can't just move home with mom and dad - you are 40, 50, or 60 years old and your parents, if they are alive, are in no position to take care of you.  You have questions, you have terrible fears, and none of the people you have relied on and trusted to help you have any answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the past two weeks have been extremely difficult for all of us.  Every single person I work with is facing the loss of all the structures and components that make up their life.  They are all terrified.  They all feel helpless, and angry.  These are people who have spent a lifetime struggling to cope with a society that tells them daily that they are less than "normal", not worthy of much.  Yet for the most part they remain polite, and friendly, and optimistic.  But this has gutted them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I went to visit one of them, a 43 year old man named Will.  Will looks ten years younger than his actual age.  Unlike many of the people I work with, he is in good shape - he is careful to work out regularly and eat as well as he can on his budget.  He works at a discount store and does a good job, taking the train to work and back.  He smiles a lot, and makes an effort to be friendly, even to strangers.  This takes some extraordinary optimism on his part because strangers have not always been kind to Will.  He does not look "disabled".  But he cannot really read or write, and has an IQ in the low 60s.  He cannot drive or pay his own bills or - most significantly for him right now - handle the complexities of his medical treatment for stage IV melanoma.  All of those tasks are currently handled by the staff that supports him.  All of those services will end July 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..."No one asked us", he suddenly said, quite forcefully for him - he's very soft spoken normally.  "No one asked us if it was okay to do this.  No one asked us ANYTHING and we're the ones who are hurt by it.  It's not right.  No one asked us."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, they sure as hell did not. In this nation, when changes in public policy are made, who gets asked?  The rich and the powerful.  Those least affected are carefully consulted and their best interests put front and center.  But as Scarlett O'Hara  succinctly put it, it's a sight easier to steal from the poor and weak than from the rich and strong.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've followed the situation in Oregon through my state's &lt;a href="http://www.oregonddcoalition.org/node/165"&gt;self-advocacy channels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/demanding_no_reduction_in_services"&gt;testified&lt;/a&gt; before legislative groups &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/policy_advocacy_elearning_and_post-transition_education"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;, and done what I can to prevent the loss of funding which, ultimately, for all the enmasse protest of thousands in my state, I have zero control over.  Sometimes it seems like whether we are asked or not, we will all still lose.  How can we fight this more effectively, before it is too late?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to spend Sunday afternoon taking in a movie and so I went to see Pixar’s Up.  I won’t spoil the film but there were times when there wasn’t a dry eye in the theatre, my own included.  After the movie was over and I dried my tears with some twitter therapy I began thinking  about how the film was able to elicit this response from such a large number of people.  Knowing there are people who are not moved by such displays lead me to today’s question.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Do you think empathy is a learned behaviour, or is it  hardwired?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afternoon Inquisition (or AI) is a question posed to you, the Skepchick community.

One is Los Angeles, where the Science &amp;amp; Entertainment Exchange has recently set up shop, and which the Norman Lear Center, which I direct, also calls home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other ‘hood is more metaphorical. The Exchange is in Westwood, located at UCLA’s California NanoSystems Institute; the Lear Center, based at USC’s Annenberg School for Communication, is housed in Beverly Hills. But both of us are also in Hollywood, an industry that permeates the region, both literally and virtually.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In particular, both the Exchange and Hollywood, Health &amp;amp; Society (HH&amp;amp;S), a Lear Center project on which I’m the principal investigator, have a shared mission: improving the accuracy of the scientific information depicted in entertainment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For HH&amp;amp;S, the focus is medicine and health. Funded initially by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, our scope includes all topics relevant to public health and safety and studied by the CDC, ranging from avian flu, obesity, and West Nile virus to autism, bioterrorism, and violence. Subsequent support from other agencies – the National Cancer Institute, the Division of Transplantation, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health – enabled us to expand our scope to topics like clinical trials, organ donation, patient safety and medical errors, and workplace injuries.  More recently, support from The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has enabled us to address health issues like malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis in a global context, and funding from The California Endowment has added a focus on the environment, income inequality, and other social determinants of health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do we do with these topics? We try to make it as easy as possible for writers and producers of television series and movies to depict those issues factually.  Any entertainment industry professional, at no cost, can enlist our help to connect them to clinicians, researchers, first responders, field workers, patients, victims, families, agencies – to experts across the country and around the world on any public health and safety issues that come up in their storylines. These experts, in turn, provide technical assistance and advice to those shows and films. They don’t tell writers what they have to do, but they do tell them what’s true, and they do their best to help those writers tell their stories without sacrificing either accuracy or entertainment value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason our funders support this work is the tremendous influence that entertainment has on audiences.  Research consistently shows that audiences believe that the medical and health content of entertainment storylines is accurate.  What viewers take in when they watch television and movies does more than capture their imaginations; whether the makers of entertainment intend it or not, their creations constitute a kind of unofficial curriculum about how the world works. Writers do what they do in order to attract viewers, not to conduct public health communication campaigns. But because their stories have such a powerful impact on audiences’ knowledge, beliefs, and behavior, we do our best to help them make smash hits and blockbusters that don’t needlessly misinform their consumers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now the National Academy of Sciences, through the Exchange, has come to town.  The broad portfolio of the NAS means that industry professionals will now have access to science and engineering experts on cutting-edge topics including extraterrestrial life, computer technology, climate change, and multiple dimensions.  And where the subject matter expertise of the Exchange and of HH&amp;amp;S converge – in Institute of Medicine topics, and in life science basic research – we have fashioned a way to route industry queries to one another’s networks of scientists, wherever the most appropriate expertise is located.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So welcome to the ‘hood, NAS.  Hollywood will profit from the cool science you can connect it with.  And society will benefit from the audiences exposed to the knowledge you can broker to them. As we say in show biz, break a leg.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Marty Kaplan holds the Norman Lear chair in entertainment, media and society at the USC Annenberg School for Communication, where he directs the Norman Lear Center, a nonpartisan research and public policy center studying and shaping the impact of entertainment on society.

&lt;p&gt;Seems like a simple question, right? We live in a galaxy — a sprawling city of gas, dust, and over a hundred billion stars — and we see hundreds of billions of them in the sky, so you’d think we have a decent handle on how these objects came to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That turns out not to be the case. Their formation is more complicated than you might expect, but &lt;a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/labs/"&gt;a new set of observations reveals an important clue&lt;/a&gt; in the birth process of the largest discrete objects in the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the cool image: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/galaxyblobs.jpg" alt="galaxy blobs"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so it’s not the most photogenic thing in the world. But what is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep optical images of young galaxies reveal that they are surrounded a vast cloud of hydrogen gas, many times larger than the galaxy itself. In a fit of nomenclaturial acumen, astronomers have dubbed these &amp;quot;blobs&amp;quot;. The thing is, to be seen at all from this great distance, the blobs must be tremendously luminous, and there’s no clear source of energy for them. Something must be powering them, but what? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two competing ideas: one was that the gas is simply cooling as it falls in to the galaxy, and that gas radiates away its heat in the form of light (similar to the way a hot iron bar will radiate its heat away as infrared light). That will then power the gas on the outside, causing it to glow. The other idea was that there is some central source of power deep inside the galaxy itself, lighting up the blobs like a light bulb in a smoke-filled room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But which is it? Ah, enter these new observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image on the left is of such a young galaxy with a blob around it. This image is optical (from Japan’s Subaru telescope and Hubble) plus deep infrared (taken using the Spitzer Space Telescope). You can see the blob, falsely colored yellow, and the denser galaxy embedded in it. Look at the upper left part of the blob: see that reddish glow? What could that be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image on the right reveals it. That is the same picture, but added in (in blue) are observations using the Chandra X-ray Observatory. X-rays are only produced through very energetic and violent sources, such as matter swirling around a black hole, or exploding stars. That would certainly explain what’s powering the blobs’ light! But usually these events also produce a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of optical light. Why don’t we see that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reddish glow in the left hand picture is the key. That indicates the galaxy is loaded with dust, made when stars are born and when the explode, too. Dust absorbs optical light, and what does get through can be highly reddened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now it looks like we have a complete picture of what’s going on here: as a galaxy forms from an infalling blob of gas a million light years across, a supermassive black hole coalesces in the center. Matter falls in, swirling madly around it, pouring out X-rays. Just outside this central region of the galaxy, stars are born at tremendous rates, creating lots of dust. The most massive stars explode in just a few million years, also blasting out X-rays, but also making even more dust. The dust blocks our optical view of the bright sources, but the X-rays still can leak out in quantities sufficient to heat up and light up the surrounding blobs of gas. What this means for the galaxy at large is that this huge amount of energy dumped into the blobs may slow and eventually reverse the infall, shutting off the process which forms the galaxy itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we’re seeing here may be the last birth throes of a galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I love about all this — besides the fact that we can know anything at all about what’s going on in an object a million light years across, billions of light years away, and billions of years in the past — is that we need all these observations together to figure this stuff out. The optical light alone presents us with a mystery, and the IR observations help but don’t solve the problem. But when you add the X-ray observations, they reveal the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And think on this… the blobs we’re talking about here are &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;, dwarfing the galaxies that are forming from them. They contain billions of times the Sun’s mass in raw gas, the building material of stars in a nascent galaxy. And these immense clouds are being lit up by not just supernovae — which are terrifying all by their lonesome, dumping out energy at rates that would turn the Earth into a crispy ember — but also by gigantic black holes smack dab in their galaxy’s hearts, which are blowing out energy in quantities to rival or exceed the supernovae themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet all that power, the true source of energy illuminating the clouds so much we can see them from across half the Universe, is hidden from our telescopes. Or at least it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;, until we learned to slip the surly bonds of Earth and loft our eyes into space, where X-rays can travel freely, unimpeded by our pesky atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universe is complex, and if we truly want to understand it, we will need to continue to explore it, and use the combined might of our scientific equipment to investigate it. There are hidden treasures out there, and the more we probe, the more we’ll find.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245865694691"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4762827614191702843.post-6996234867430145528">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/877913864c887ece</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Simon Singh" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="British Chiropractic Association" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Crap Libel Cases" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="BCA" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Coming Up: the BCA's Reply</title><published>2009-06-24T17:23:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T17:23:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/06/coming-up-bcas-reply.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="html">I have now obtained a Court file copy of the &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2008/12/on-where-is-bcas-reply.html"&gt; Reply&lt;/a&gt; submitted by the British Chiropractic Association.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the formal response by the BCA to Simon Singh's &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2008/11/on-putting-chiropractic-on-trial.html"&gt; Defence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a very substantial document - far longer than the Defence - and it will take a day or two to fully absorb.

By following the advice of the economists, the group was able to purchase wireless coverage for the United States for $2.4 billion, while their major competitors ended up paying $3.5 billion for the same spectrum in the same auction. Thus, their advice was worth more than $1 billion to their clients.</summary><author><name>By Steven D.

So there's two new websites out there with quite similar names, &lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt;. Both sites are about (obviously) autism and have a number of videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; states that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All too often in the world of autism, celebrity and sex appeal are used to promote pseudo-science that exploits autistic people, their family members and the public. We decided to put those very same factors to work in service of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Videos.html"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; are entitled "No Link," "Inclusive Education," "Words," and "Pet Peeves," and feature Leeann, the "friend of a family with an autistic child," well, struttin' and showin' her stuff. (Not &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/not_the_good_goods"&gt;this kind of stuff&lt;/a&gt;.) The admittedly "tongue in cheek" videos are, it seems, made to get attention, with something of a reference to a quite well-known &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/evaluate_science_not_celebrity"&gt;celebrity&lt;/a&gt; (not &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/why_people_believe_oprah"&gt;Oprah&lt;/a&gt;, but a friend) whose past included her "exposing herself" in some similar ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos on &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt; are meant to teach parents and professionals about ABA therapy. You can &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/SampleLessons.aspx"&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; for a fee ($100/month for personal use) to have access to "hundreds of step-by-step video lessons" and online support from professionals. Some &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/SampleLessons.aspx"&gt;sample lessons&lt;/a&gt; (imitating a peer, labeling prepositions/incidental teaching---familiar to those of whose children have been doing ABA, or to those who themselves are teachers/therapists) can be seen &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/SampleLessons.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt;'s stated &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/OurPhilosophy.aspx"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; is to provide "immediate access to effective and affordable Applied Behavior Analysis-based treatment tools for the growing population affected by autism spectrum disorders," hence the videos and online subscriptions. The Senior Clinical Advisor on the &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/WhoWeAre.aspx"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; is Bridget Taylor, the Executive Director of one of New Jersey's private autism schools, the &lt;a href="http://www.alpinelearninggroup.org/aboutus/staff.asp"&gt;Alpine Learning Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of a page on &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/WhyRethink.aspx"&gt;why rethink autism&lt;/a&gt;, it's noted that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imagine what’s possible. Then think again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rethink autism. We don’t just offer hope, we give you help.&lt;br&gt;
rethink autism empowers you to teach today!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, "rethinking autism" on &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt; refers to (I think) that, instead of thinking that it's not possible to teach an autistic child, think again, yes you can (with an emphasis on ABA teaching).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; also asks people to think differently about autism, with such suggestions as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because a person with autism may not speak, it does not mean they have an inferior intellect.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.................&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should be more concerned about an autistic individual’s quality of life instead of preventing them from being born. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to self-advocates and learn about neurodiversity. Include the organized community of autistic adults when it comes to making legislation regarding their quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two very different, if very similarly websites, and maybe some would think they oughtn't to be discussed in the same post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But think again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt; are asking us to think, life with autism isn't----doesn't have to be----hopeless. We need, indeed, to think differently about autism and individuals on the autism spectrum, just as the &lt;a href="http://www.nas.org.uk/"&gt;National Autistic Society&lt;/a&gt; has exhorted people to do with its &lt;a href="http://www.think-differently.org.uk/"&gt;Think Differently&lt;/a&gt; campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it went. This is not an unusual exchange, and I’m not annoyed in the least. Often, such awkward openings lead to something more interesting, and that was the case here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Asian man approached me and said something very interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ghosts are cultural.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Via my evil twin &lt;a href="http://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/possibly-the-best-optical-ilusion-i-have-seen-all-year/"&gt;Richard Wiseman&lt;/a&gt; comes one of the best color optical illusions I have ever seen. The original was apparently posted on &lt;del&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.buzzhunt.co.uk/2009/06/22/green-and-blue/"&gt;Buzzhunt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/color12e.html"&gt;Akiyoshi Kitaoka’s incredible optical illusion website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.buzzhunt.co.uk/2009/06/22/green-and-blue/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/colors.gif" alt="Blue green spiral illusion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see embedded spirals, right, of green, pinkish-orange, and blue? Incredibly, the green and the blue spirals &lt;em&gt;are the same color&lt;/em&gt;. At first I thought Richard was pulling our collective legs, being a trickster of high magnitude. So I loaded the image in Photoshop and examined the two spirals. In the two squares displayed below, the one on the left is colored using the same color from the blue spiral, and on the right using the green spiral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/greenblue2.jpg" alt="green and blue squares"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, incredible! For pedantry sake, the RGB colors in both spirals are 0, 255, 150. So they are mostly green with a solid splash of blue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason they look different colors is because our brain judges the color of an object by comparing it to surrounding colors. In this case, the stripes are not continuous as they appear at first glance. The orange stripes don’t go through the &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; spiral, and the magenta ones don’t go through the &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; one. Here’s a zoom to make this more clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/bluegreenzoom.gif" alt="Blue green spirals zoom"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See? The orange stripes go through the &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; spiral but not the &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; one. So without us even knowing it, our brains compare that spiral to the orange stripes, forcing it to think the spiral is green. The magenta stripes make the other part of the spiral look blue, &lt;strong&gt;even though they are exactly the same color.&lt;/strong&gt; If you still don’t believe me, concentrate on the edges of the colored spirals. Where the green hits the magenta it looks bluer to me, and where the blue hits the orange it looks greener. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall pattern is a spiral shape because our brain likes to fill in missing bits to a pattern. Even though the stripes are not the same color all the way around the spiral , the overlapping spirals makes our brain think they are. The very fact that you have to examine the picture closely to figure out any of this at all shows just how easily we can be fooled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I tell people over and over again: &lt;em&gt;you cannot trust what you see even with your own eyes&lt;/em&gt;. Your eyes are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; cameras faithfully taking pictures of absolute truth of all that surrounds you. They have filters, and your brain has to interpret the jangled mess it gets fed. Colors are not what they appear, shapes are not what they appear (that zoomed image above is square, believe it or not), objects are not what they appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the next time someone swears they saw Jesus, or a UFO, or a ghost, show them this picture. What you see in life is absolutely and provably &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; what you get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Saturday in Worcester, MA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4th Annual Greater Worcester Humanists Summer Outing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
According to the organizers, you can “network with other New England area freethinkers in a casual, social setting in order to strengthen our community.” Fun! It starts at noon on Jun 27, 2009 at Rutland State Park. &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=110381253081&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;Here’s the Facebook event page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Monday in Boston, MA&lt;br&gt;
Boston Skeptics in the Pub: Particle Colliders—The Science &amp;amp; The Fiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is going to be a good one, people! Shulamit Moed is a post-doc who splits her time between Fermilab (where she measures the production of the charm quark), CERN (where she prepares for the first LHC collisions), and Harvard (where she gives talks in pubs to people like you). It starts at 7pm (show up early if you want a seat!) at Tommy Doyle’s in Harvard Square. &lt;a href="http://www.bostonskeptics.com"&gt;Info at BostonSkeptics.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 9 in Vegas, NV&lt;br&gt;
Drinking Skeptically/Skeptics in the Pub at TAM7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Get together with skeptics groups from around the country on the Thursday night before TAM! There will be goodies, plus booze of course. Info over at &lt;a href="http://www.nycskeptics.org/specialevents/dstam7"&gt;NYCSkeptics.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
People need to understand American homebirth midwives are a second class of midwives with less education and training than other American and European midwives. The standards for direct entry midwives, in terms of educational requirements and clinical training, are far below those of any other midwives in the industrialized world. American homebirth midwives are, by and large, quacks, and babies are dying as a result.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addendum:&lt;/em&gt; One of the things I find most interesting is how everyone involved understands that the refusal to seek real medical care led to this tragedy. Carri's family has removed the posts detailing her actions in the weeks leading up to the catastrophe, and MotheringdotCommune has removed the posts by Carri and those responding to her. The baby died possibly because of unassisted birth/homebirth, and now supporters and the family want to remove the evidence. &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245857437312"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/06/dr-gwenn-is-in-how-do-bloggers-get-information-about-swine-flu-a-new-survey-is-trying-to-find-out.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ecc03901da2eee82</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Emergency Preparedness"/><title type="html">Dr. Gwenn Is In: How do bloggers get information about Swine Flu?

&lt;blockquote&gt;How do bloggers get information about Swine Flu? A new survey is trying to find out.
With Swine Flu, Influenza H1N1, now at pandemic levels world wide, gathering data and information about the virus is important to keep us all healthy.

&lt;p&gt;He doesn't like chemotherapy, though (and who would?), and there are these interesting rationalizations going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Hauser was not at the court hearing but later told The Associated Press he had hoped he would be able to stop chemotherapy, which he said makes him ill. 
"I get really sick when I do it," the teen said during an interview at his family's farm at Sleepy Eye. "You get so dizzy and I get a headache right away."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Daniel said he believes his tumor's improvement comes from alternative treatments he's doing such as supplemental drinks and pills.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
His parents also remain concerned about the risks of chemotherapy, which they initially rejected for religious reasons, saying it harms the body. But they told Brown County Judge John Rodenberg during the today's hearing that they would take their son to a Wednesday chemo appointment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Colleen Hauser told the AP at her home that doctors said it would take six months to treat her son's Hodgkin's lymphoma when he was first diagnosed, but they've now seen improvement in the past few weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Wow," she said. "Something's working."

But I &lt;a href="http://saltosobrius.blogspot.com/2006/06/caffeine-withdrawal-headache.html"&gt;got fed up&lt;/a&gt; with caffeine addiction a few years back and started to limit my intake. Currently I'm at 1.5 litres every second day, which means that my system is used to going without caffeine for over 40 hours at a time -- counted from afternoon tea on a Monday to morning tea on a Wednesday for instance. This regimen works out to an average daily intake of 190 milligrams of caffeine. Coffee has about 1.7 times the caffeine in strong black tea, which in turn has 2.7 times the caffeine in Coke. But I never have coffee and very rarely any caffeinated soda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Reader, what's your caffeine habit like? Here are &lt;a href="http://www.wilstar.com/caffeine.htm"&gt;some figures&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coke: ~100 mg caffeine per litre&lt;br&gt;
Strong black tea: ~250 mg caffeine per litre&lt;br&gt;
Coffee: ~425 mg caffeine per litre&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(A litre is about 34.5 fluid ounces.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/06/computing_my_caffeine_habit.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/Pc8yrhUlLcI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245854606627"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_697.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b68070b1e20bf1aa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-06-24T12:52:44Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T12:52:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/yZuXJ27eyZY/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_697.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_697.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_697.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_697.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/yZuXJ27eyZY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245854065458"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13863">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bb129699461763e5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="China"/><category term="military"/><category term="naming"/><title type="html">Mao's Little Red Aircraft Carrier</title><published>2009-06-24T13:43:04Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T13:43:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/maos-little-red-aircraft-carrier/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">&lt;em&gt;Freakonomics&lt;/em&gt; readers know that a baby's name reveals more about its parents than about the baby.

It’s hard. There is so much nonsense in the world… but I try. I read a lot of blogs, of course. I have about 200 blogs in my feed reader, but only a handful of those have daily posts, and of those I skim a lot. I get email from readers, of course (which I love) when news breaks, and also see things on Twitter. Still, how do you find out what’s going with online skeptical activism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an idea: read Skepdad’s &lt;a href="http://www.resurch.org/"&gt;Epic Reading List&lt;/a&gt;. It really is. Epic, I mean: he’s put a bazillion links in various categories, including blogs, podcasts, thinkers, topic-specific, and so on. I’ve looked it over and it’s a pretty good list if you’re looking to find ways to blow off that big project that’s already overdue. I’m actually a little afraid to delve into more deeply, as I can see my already-neutron-star-dense schedule getting even more tightly squeezed… and that can only have one outcome. A calendrical black hole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you’re looking for a little summer reading (&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/03/06/kirsten-dunst-and-carl-sagan/"&gt;and who isn’t?&lt;/a&gt;) then this is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

He now has a blog post up &lt;a href="http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/aroundtheworld/2009/06/22/a-professors-falsehoods-and-poor-research/"&gt;complaining about me and my "inaccuracies"&lt;/a&gt;. His complaints are amusingly petty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I object to the lies at the very heart of his "museum", and he thinks he is rebutting me by whining over petty details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, he quotes me as regarding the idea of "Noah's ark being built to carry off members of every species on earth", and then he primly informs his readers that that isn't true: it only carried every &lt;i&gt;kind&lt;/i&gt; of "land-dwelling, air-breathing animal". Oh, well, that fixes the logistical problems of the ark right up, doesn't it? Here we have a great big flood that turns the globe into &lt;i&gt;Waterworld&lt;/i&gt;, and he doesn&amp;#39;t have to worry about the effects of salinity changes on aquatic organisms, doesn&amp;#39;t have to think about the plants, and the birds can just stay airborne for a year until the flood recedes. I don&amp;#39;t care what fraction of life on earth the poop-shovelin&amp;#39;, travelin&amp;#39; family of Noah squeezed onto their big imaginary boat — the &lt;i&gt;whole story&lt;/i&gt; is ludicrous and unsupported by the evidence or by sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he complains that I mentioned his "dinosaurs with saddles". He's only got &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt;, he says, and it's out for repairs, and it wasn't out in the exhibits anyway. But again, this is his whole schtick behind the museum: that like the Flintstones, humans and dinosaurs coexisted! He's got exhibits with kids playing with carnivorous dinosaurs, and he specifically claims that dinosaurs existed within the last 10,000 years. The point is that the founding premise of his scammy little "museum" is false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also complains that he doesn&amp;#39;t make any direct accusations of &amp;quot;malice and dishonesty&amp;quot; against biologists in general, but again, that&amp;#39;s the implication he makes by calling evolution a lie and the work of Satan. He says he doesn&amp;#39;t blame Darwin for the world&amp;#39;s problems — that&amp;#39;s caused by &lt;i&gt;sin&lt;/i&gt;, of course — but again, it&amp;#39;s pretending that a major focus of his &amp;quot;museum&amp;quot; is on how godless Darwinism leads people away from the true faith and into depravity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He thinks the numbers I cited are wrong. Well, take it up with the &lt;a href="http://www.ministrywatch.com/profile/Answers-in-Genesis.aspx"&gt;source I cited&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks charitable organizations to give potential donors information on what the institution is doing. Mr Ham can always provide them with up-to-date information, and I'm sure they'll make the numbers more current.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the most pathetic whimper of all: I called it "Ken Ham's 'museum'". It's not his museum, he says, it's the Lord's. Yeah, right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Mr Ham is so concerned about my accuracy or lack thereof, and is obviously stressed at the poor publicity I'm giving his little monument to ignorance, I'll make him an offer. I'll give him a whole day of my time if he'll fly me in and give me a personal tour, during which he can point out all the things I've gotten wrong about Creation, and I will dutifully write them down and post a complete report of his various rebuttals. Thorough coverage for the price of a plane ticket. How can he possibly turn down such an offer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If he was really confident of the legitimacy of his museum, I could probably even gather a small group of mouthy, obnoxious, and culturally prominent godless scientists who'd also take advantage of such an offer, and he could shepherd us all through at once, evangelizing as much as he wanted. It would be great! Come on, Mr Ham, put a little bit of your money where your mouth is.&lt;/p&gt;

No, I never did buy any of that nonsense about how sticking thin needles into the skin at points along various "meridians" somehow "redirects the flow of &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt;," that mystical life force upon which so much woo, particularly woo based on Eastern mysticism and traditional Chinese medicine depends. However, because acupuncture involves an actual physical action on the body, namely sticking needles in it, I didn't think it entirely implausible that it might have some sort of physiological effect, such as counterirritation or the release of endorphins, that could relieve pain or induce relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, back then I was still fairly early into my skeptical career of investigating "alternative" medicine claims and hadn't read very many the studies of acupuncture. The more I read, the more I realized that acupuncture is nothing more than yet another elaborate placebo. What it took over the last couple of years for me to give up on acupuncture entirely was reading a steady stream of studies showing that "real" acupuncture is no better than "sham" acupuncture involving either using special needles that don't break the skin, locations &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/acupuncture_and_blood_pressure.php"&gt;other than the true "meridian" points&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/another_acupuncture_study_misinterpreted.php"&gt;even toothpicks&lt;/a&gt;. Heck, in one case, sham acupuncture &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/04/sham_acupuncture_is_better_than_true_acu.php"&gt;worked better than "real" acupuncture&lt;/a&gt;, but the study authors argued that their study was evidence that "acupuncture works"! In fact, virtually every study that shows no difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture is still somehow spun by its authors as providing evidence that "acupuncture works" (although they usually do a bit of handwaving and represent it as "more complex" than previously thought). The more I learned, in other words, the more I asked: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/can_we_finally_just_say_that_acupuncture.php"&gt;Can we finally just say that acupuncture is nothing more than an elaborate placebo&lt;/a&gt;? When I started to learn that what is represented as acupuncture today is, in fact, not really even that ancient but rather a modality &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=131"&gt;resurrected by Chairman Mao&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=494"&gt;give the appearance&lt;/a&gt; of bringing health care to his people when he couldn't afford modern, scientific medical modalities, that about sealed it.

As a chiropractor once admitted to me - there are a great many things that happen under the umbrella of “chiropractic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I will summarize some of the history and practice of chiropractic, highlighting what I consider to be many of the enduring problems with this profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiropractic was founded in 1895 by Daniel David Palmer, a grocer with an intense interest in metaphysics.  Prior to his “discovery” of chiropractic, D.D. Palmer was a magnetic healer.  He also had interests in phrenology (diagnosing disease based on the bumps of the skull) and spiritualism.  Palmer reported to have discovered the principle of chiropractic when he allegedly cured a janitor of his deafness by manipulating his neck.  The fact that the nerve which conveys sound information from the ears to the brain does not pass through the neck did not seem to bother Palmer, if he was even aware of this fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmer created the term “chiropractic,” which literally means “done by hand,” to refer to his new therapy.  He argued that all disease is caused by subluxated bones, which 95% of the time are spinal bones, and which disrupt the flow of innate intelligence.  He did not subject his ideas to any form of research, but rather went directly to treating patients and to teaching his principles to the first generation of chiropractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subluxation Theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmer believed in the pre-scientific vitalistic notion that health stems from the flow of a spiritual life force. Although vitalism was rapidly declining within scientific thought by the end of the 19th century, it was the centerpiece of early philosophies of health in most cultures. Palmer borrowed this ancient belief and renamed it “innate intelligence” which he claimed flowed from the brain to the rest of the body through the spinal cord and peripheral nerves.  All disease, he argued, results from disruption in the flow of innate intelligence. Disruption in flow is caused by spinal subluxations, which are small misalignments in the spine that compress the spinal nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, liver disease is caused by a subluxation which compresses the spinal nerve which supplies the liver with life force, depriving it of its vital innate intelligence.  Palmer therefore believed he could cure by fixing these misalignments with manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea has remained the cornerstone of chiropractic despite advances in neurobiology and anatomy which have failed to show any evidence for innate intelligence or chiropractic subluxations.  Many continue to ascribe all disease to the blockage of innate intelligence despite scientific advances in medicine which have discovered infectious, genetic, autoimmune, degenerative, nutritional, and other causes for many of the diseases which plague mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiropractic was also not the only tradition based upon manipulating the bones. Of note, osteopathic doctors also developed an art of bone manipulation in order to heal, but they believed they were unblocking blood flow through arteries. Osteopathy and chiropractic had similar roots, but took very different paths, as we will see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D.D. Palmer’s son, B.J. Palmer, became involved in the chiropractic movement early on, during the formative years.  B.J shared his father’s metaphysical bent (prior to chiropractic, he worked with a mesmerist and worked in the circus), his tendency to make sweeping statements about health without justification, and his ignorance of contemporary scientific knowledge. He was reported to state, for example, “When I saw there was no use for a sympathetic nervous system, I threw it out, and then just had to put something better in its place, so I discovered Direct Mental Impulse.” B.J. also “discovered” a non-existent “Duct of Palmer” connecting the spleen to the stomach.  In 1907 B.J. engineered a hostile take over of his father’s school of  chiropractic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B.J. Palmer set the tone that would later dominate the field of chiropractic.  He emphasized salesmanship, advertising, and practice building.  He was highly critical of medicine, stating that M.D. stands for “more death.”  He continuously sought new methods for increasing revenues, such as his neurocalometer, which would pinpoint subluxations by measuring skin temperature and he decreed must be rented from him by other practitioners at exorbitant fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beginning chiropractors were also politically aggressive.  They sought licensure as a protection from the growing scientific medicine with which they were completely at odds.  Many legislators were reluctant to license chiropractors for this reason, but as more and more states voted in licensure, it became increasingly difficult to fight.  Additionally, many legislators looked upon licensure as way of controlling the scope of chiropractic. By 1925, 32 states had instituted licenses for chiropractors. The struggle ended in 1974 when Louisiana instituted licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many states then began to pass basic science board requirements for licensure, making chiropractors pass the same tests of basic science knowledge as medical and osteopathic students.  This was justified by the fact that chiropractors were presenting themselves as primary practitioners. However, where roughly 86 percent of medical students passed their basic science boards between 1927 and 1953, only 23 percent of chiropractors did. Chiropractors who could not pass the boards either moved to another state without the requirement, or practiced without a license.  Between 1967 and 1979 all of the basic science laws for chiropractors were repealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years chiropractic has never ceased its tireless struggle for growth and acceptance.  Despite the fact that scientific medicine has continued to progress and chiropractic has never shed its pseudoscientific origins, they have been quite successful. After licensure, they gained coverage under Medicare.  They have also successfully sued the AMA to stop their antichiropractic campaign. Today they continue to lobby hard for increased coverage and access under health insurance and HMO policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Straights, Mixers, and Reformers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost since the beginning, chiropractic has been fraught with many internal schisms. Today there is a wide range of differences between individual chiropractors, but most can be placed within one of three basic types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straight chiropractors consider themselves the only true or pure chiropractors because they limit their practice to the identification and treatment of spinal subluxations. They adhere strictly to Palmer’s concept of disease and believe that all ailments can be treated through manipulation to restore the flow of innate intelligence. Once freely flowing, they believe innate intelligence has unlimited power to naturally heal the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straight chiropractors are the most extreme in their anti-scientific views.  They &lt;a href="http://www.visionchiro.com/chiropractic.html"&gt;openly advocate a philosophical rather than a scientific basis for health care&lt;/a&gt;, calling mainstream medicine “mechanistic” and “allopathic.”  They call physicians “drug pushers” and disparage the use of surgery. They are careful not to give diseases names, but none-the-less they claim to cure disease with their adjustments. They oppose vaccinations. They also openly advocate the replacement of scientific medicine with chiropractic as primary health care. The statements of Dr. Wilson A. Morgan (who just passed away earlier this month), previous Executive Officer of Life College School of Chiropractic, are typical:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;	“Chiropractic: The health care system whose time as the official guardian of the public’s health is fast approaching!”&lt;br&gt;
“On the other hand, it is equally appropriate for chiropractors to be viewed as generalists in that the far-reaching effects of their highly specific spinal adjustments usually are followed by the decrease and often disappearance of a very broad array of symptoms, disabilities and pathological conditions.”&lt;br&gt;
“Unlike the medical profession, chiropractic has a very strong philosophical basis, which no doubt has contributed to its having been labeled ‘unscientific’ by the more mechanistically-oriented scientific community.”&lt;br&gt;
“It appears that education will prove to be the best strategy in the ‘war on drugs,’ including education about the dangers of drugs available on the street and also those available from the physician as prescriptions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixers, comprising the largest segment of chiropractors, may at first seem more rational.  They accept that some disease is caused by infection or other causes and they do not limit their practice to fixing subluxations.  Most chiropractors in this group, however, do not supplement subluxation theory with scientific medicine, but rather with an eclectic array of pseudoscientific alternative practices.  Mixers commonly prescribe homeopathic and herbal remedies, practice acupuncture and therapeutic touch, diagnose with iridology, contour analysis, and applied kinesiology, and adhere to the philosophy of naturopathy. This broad use of unproven, unscientific, and fanciful so-called “alternative” practices clearly indicates an antiscience attitude, as well as a lack of scientific knowledge, on the part of those chiropractors who employ them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rhetoric of Mixers indicates that they are attempting to become accepted into the scientific mainstream, rather than replace scientifically based medicine with a philosophy based approach.  They no longer openly oppose immunization, like straights do, but they do advocate the freedom to choose whether or not to be immunized.  Their appeal to freedom is emotionally effective, especially in the United States, but it fails to recognize that immunization is far less effective in eliminating or containing infectious diseases when it is not given to everyone.  They also advocate a role for chiropractors as a primary care portal of entry system within HealthCare, despite the fact that they lack adequate training as generalists skilled in medical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small minority of chiropractors, numbering only about 1,000, or 2% of all chiropractors (these are rough estimates because accurate figures are lacking), have been openly critical of their own field.  They have called for absolute rejection of the subluxation theory of illness, disposing of pseudoscientific and unethical practices by chiropractors, and the restriction of chiropractic to treating acute musculoskeletal symptoms.  They are attempting to bring their field into the scientific mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally chiropractic reformers have attempted to forge a new profession, entirely shedding the pseudoscience attached to the chiropractic brand. About ten years ago one group in Canada renamed themselves “Orthopractors,” and considered the new discipline of orthopractic as distinct from chiropractic.  Orthopractic is the use of manipulation to provide symptomatic relief from uncomplicated acute back strain.  They do not believe in maintenance therapy, treating medical ailments, or the use of pseudoscientific alternative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this reform effort died because “orthopractic” did not exist as a legal entity. This also partly explains why the “chiropractic” label persists and covers such a wide range of philosophy and practice - because it exists as a recognized licensed profession. It has a regulatory inertia that is hard to combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further complicate things, spinal manipulation exists outside of the chiropractic profession, and not all manipulation is chiropractic manipulation. Some physiatrists, sports medicine doctors, and osteopaths legitimately employ manipulative therapy to relieve muscle strain, mobilize joints, and improve function. Chiropractors do this as well. But some chiropractors also do chiropractic manipulation designed to realign the spine and reduce imaginary chiropractic subluxations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Evidence - Subluxations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past 100 years, there has been very little research conducted into the basic principles of straight chiropractic. There is no research that indicates the existence of innate intelligence or that such a force plays any role in health and disease. Further, the evidence strongly suggests that chiropractic subluxations are a figment of the chiropractic imagination. And it also seems that spinal manipulation is not capable of realigning the vertebra of the spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study carried out by Edmund Crelin, Ph.D. investigated the amount of force necessary to displace vertebral bones of the spine in order to cause impingement of a spinal nerve.  The study was carried out on six corpses within 8 hours after death.  His conclusion was that the amount of force necessary to actually displace the vertebra was great enough to break the spine, arguing strongly that chiropractic manipulation cannot significantly affect spinal alignment, and that misaligned spines do not caused pinched nerves (Crelin, 1973).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinched or impinged spinal nerves do occur, but they are caused by herniated discs, fractures, tumors, or overgrowth of the vertebral bones. When spinal nerves are impinged they cause pain, numbness, and tingling and may cause a decrease or loss of deep tendon reflexes and weakness of the muscles supplied by the affected nerve.  Impinged nerves are not caused by subluxations nor do they result in diseases of the organs.  Believers in subluxation theory must claim, implausibly, that nerve impingement causes only a blockage of innate intelligence without causing any of the known signs and symptoms of such impingement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, spinal manipulation is contraindicated in cases of actual nerve impingement and should not be performed. In medical studies of manipulation, such as the RAND study, often cited by chiropractors as evidence for manipulation, spinal nerve impingement was considered a reason not to have manipulation and therefore was a criteria for exclusion from the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another source of evidence that the chiropractic theory of subluxations and innate intelligence is completely false comes from the unfortunate victims of spinal trauma. There are many victims of complete transection, or disruption, of the cervical spinal cord in the neck.  Such a complete injury leaves its victim quadraplegic, unable to move the arms or legs.  If the injury is high enough in the spinal cord the victim may not even be able to breath on their own.  In such victims no impulses from the brain are able to travel below the spinal cord in the neck, and therefore most of the communication between the brain and the body is interrupted. Certainly, this is a much more dramatic and complete interference of nerve flow than that of an impinged spinal nerve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, in these patients, the organs continue to work without difficulty and diseases do not develop at any higher rate than those without such an injury.  Of course, there are some effects from the disruption of the autonomic nervous system, that part of the nervous system which regulates the bladder, the degree of bowel motility, and other functions. But all effects of spinal cord damage are caused by known neurological injury. If subluxation theory were correct, then patients with high spinal cord injuries would be ravaged by every conceivable disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So chiropractors cannot realign the spine to fix imaginary subluxations and restore the flow of nonexistent innate intelligence.  Subluxation theory is pure pseudoscience, like homeopathy or therapeutic touch, and has no place in a 21st century scientific health care system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the extreme scientific implausibility of subluxation theory, specific applications have been tested with clinical research - with predictable results. For example, many chiropractors will use manipulation to treat asthma is children. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9761802?dopt=Abstract"&gt;The results of this research are soundly negative&lt;/a&gt; - chiropractic does not work on asthma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this many chiropractors persist in treating asthma. This led Simon Singh to write in the Guardian in 2008 that the British Chiropractic Association, which does advocate chiropractic for childhood asthma, “promotes bogus therapies.” In response to this statement the BCA notably did not provide the evidence that Singh claimed was missing. Rather, they sued him for libel (the case is ongoing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week I will cover the evidence for musculoskeletal uses of chiropractic.&lt;/p&gt;

As we sat in her living room, this ordinary appearing middle-aged woman spoke to the small gathering in the voice of D’Hartma, the spirit of a man who allegedly last lived more than 1000 years ago in Nepal, but now resides in the seventh spiritual dimension.  Lynne has been channeling (the modern word for this form of spirit summoning) D’Hartma for 24 years, and claims that his only purpose is to bring his philosophy of love and spirituality to mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Brief History of Spiritualism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern channelers are the successors to a long history of spiritualism in this and other countries, which has waxed and waned in popularity over the centuries.  The most recent rise in popularity of spiritualism prior to its modern resurgence, was around the turn of the century.  This was the age of mediums and seances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic séance involved several people gathering in the parlor of a medium, who, with the lights off, would summon the spirits of their client’s lost loved-ones. As proof of the presence of the spirit, there were often many physical manifestations, such as rappings, bell ringing, or other noises, items moving about the room, and levitating tables.  These “parlor tricks” were often very persuasive to those who already had a strong desire to believe, and were likely not schooled in the techniques of magic. The spirits would sometimes speak in a disembodied voice, speak to the medium, who would then relay their messages, or would speak  directly through the medium, who would be in a trance state while the spirit used their voice to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predictably, the messages contained vague and pleasant sentiments likely to validate the hopes of those seeking the services of a medium.  “Aunt Alice says she is happy where she is, and you should no longer worry about her.  She want me to tell you that she loves you.”  At times cold reading techniques would be used to give the illusion that the medium had knowledge that could only come from the deceased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this form of physical mediumship (for the mediums, that is) is that they were vulnerable to discovery.  If someone caught them ringing a bell with their toes, or lifting the table with a rod placed in their sleeves, then they were caught red-handed, and were branded a fraud with no plausible deniability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made the spiritualism-debunking work of Harry Houdini very immediate and satisfying.  Houdini, the most famous magician of his time and also an ardent skeptic, knew that the mediums of his day were using standard magical and escapist techniques to pull off their cons.  He knew because he recognized all the tricks, and could do them himself, better, in fact, than the mediums (similar, in this respect, to James Randi’s modern debunking career).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry Houdini was part of a committee put together by Scientific American magazine, to investigate spiritualism.  He caught medium after medium in the act of committing blatant fraud, exposing them to the public.  He was almost single-handedly responsible for the sharp decline in physical mediumship in the early 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rise of Channeling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although physical mediumship disappeared, largely through the efforts of Houdini, spiritualism survived and adapted. The solution for mediums was actually quite simple – eliminate the physical aspects of talking to spirits and simply just talk to them or allow them to speak through you.  This eliminates any physical evidence of fraud or trickery, for the only evidence of the presence of a spirit is in the mind of the medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two basic techniques of non-physical mediumship developed in the latter half of the 20th century.  One type involves “psychics” or “sensitives” who can speak to spirits, and then relay what they hear to their clients.  This form of spiritualism is little more than a variation of cold reading. The most widely known current practitioner of this form is John Edward, made famous by his show Crossing Over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other form of non-physical mediumship is called channeling, in which the channeler goes into a trance and then becomes “possessed” by a specific spirit, who then talks through them.  The most successful and widely known channeler of this variety is J.Z. Knight, who claims to channel the spirit of Ramtha, a 30 thousand year old man.  At her height, Knight was channeling Ramtha in front of audiences with thousands of people, and was bringing in millions of dollars from true-believers. She still has a loyal cult following, but her popularity has declined significantly in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art of channeling is actually quite easy to perform.  All that is needed is a modicum of acting ability and a simple, feel-good philosophy to peddle.  The standard new-age fluff will do.  Following J.Z. Knights success, small-time channelers proliferated, but most followed what had become the standard format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D’Hartma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NESS was not surprised to learn that we have a channeler right here in New England, in Winsted, CT in the northern part of the state.   Lynn LaFountain claims she has been channeling the spirit of D’Hartma for 24 years.  D’Hartma,, apparently, has had many incarnations but his last incarnation was of an illiterate Hindu who lived in Nepal from AD 932-968.  After dying he went, as we all do, according to D’Hartma and his followers, to the first spiritual dimension (there are nine in total).  D’Hartma decided not to reincarnate, which he says is an irrevocable decision, and rather has gone on to higher spiritual dimensions, finally arriving at the seventh dimension, which is the realm of masters.  Masters, of which there are always 144 at any time (an even gross), have achieved a sufficient level of spiritual enlightenment to teach other spirits how to advance.  It is this mission which brings D’Hartma to the Earth to spread his philosophy to mankind. When his mission is complete, he will progress onto the eighth dimension and then finally onto the ninth dimension where he will merge with the god entity of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we were very excited to have the opportunity to speak directly to such an ancient and wise spirit, or at least someone pretending to be an ancient and wise spirit.  Prior to the interview, we were asked (communications were handled over e-mail) to provide the names and backgrounds of the NESS investigators who would attend.  I dutifully complied with background information for myself and Perry DeAngelis, who was to accompany me.  At the last minute, however, Perry could not attend the session and Evan Bernstein (the CT Vice-chairman), came in his place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some preliminary questions, Lynn was ready to begin the channeling.  In addition to Evan, myself, and Lynne, five of D’Hartma’s faithful followers were in attendance. Lynn explained to us that what she does is actually called soul transference, because while D’Hartma is in her body, her spirit will be in the tunnel which leads to the seventh dimension (not actually in the seventh dimension itself). She began by assuming the obligatory lotus position in her easy chair, arms in her lap.  She closed her eyes and began slow deep breathing.  In a few moments her head dropped forward, and we were informed that Lynn was now gone.  A few moments more and her hands began to slowly twitch, as if coming to life.  They then assumed a thoughtful position, with forefingers extended together, and we were informed that D’Hartma had arrived.  Without further warning, Lynn’s body sprang to life, and I found myself being addressed by a strange voice tinted with a vaguely Indian accent.&lt;br&gt;
I had feared that we would get nothing more from D’Hartma than a repetition of his philosophy, which I had already read on their website.  We did, in fact, get that, but there was more.  To my delight, Evan and I were treated to personal readings.  D’Hartma informed me that I have an interest in science and teaching others about science (amazing, considering that Lynn knew I am an academic neurologist at Yale). He also told me that my true desire is to discover the ultimate nature of the universe, but I must be more open and look beyond science for this.  Finally, D’Hartma made a specific prediction, that I would be taking a long trip on a very large boat sometime soon.  Evan received a somewhat more generic reading.  He was told that he is a more powerful person than he realizes, and that he is a “blessed spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D’Hartma’s reading was, from my perspective, completely unimpressive and predictable.  The statements made about myself were not very insightful, and could easily be derived from information Lynn was given about me.  Looking at the statements from the perspective of a cold reading, I suspect that the boat trip prediction was an attempt at a high-probability hit, given the fact that I am a physician, and might be taking a cruise sometime in the future.  What Lynne (and D’Hartma) apparently did not know about me is that I am very susceptible to sea sickness and have no intention of getting on a large boat at any time in my future.  Still, we will see if the fates conspire to force me into a boat trip any time soon.  So far (now 9 years later), there are no signs of this.  It is also very telling that Evan’s reading was far more generic than my own.  D’Hartma’s level of knowledge about the two of us seemed to mirror the amount of information Lynn had available to her (remember that Evan was a last-minute substitution for Perry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the rest of the session.  Most of it was spent discussing D’Hartma’s philosophy and the nature of the spiritual dimensions.  Here again, D’Hartma failed to impress.  His philosophy is a variation of the standard new-age themes of “limitations are all in the mind,” “Love is the greatest power in the universe,” and “We all contain god within ourselves.” Most of his advise somehow related to these basic themes.  That’s it.  You can save yourself the $150 Lynn charges for sessions with D’Hartma, you have just heard the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to preaching this philosophy, D’Hartma apparently dispenses sound financial advise on the side as well.  Lynn reports that she has a clientele of wealthy and famous (and, of course, anonymous) people who have prospered from D’Hartma’s financial wisdom.  D’Hartma also dispenses medical advice.  Here, too, the philosophy is all too predictable new age nonsense.    Disease is also all in the mind.  If you believe yourself to be sick, then you are sick.  If you do no accept illness, then it cannot harm you.  One of those present asked D’Hartma if the fatigue they have been feeling recently is a sign of any illness they should be concerned about.  D’Hartma reassured them that they were fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview with D’Hartma contained a few other details that may be helpful to a rational assessment of Lynn’s claims.  D’Hartma, although he speaks with a distinct accent that is reminiscent of the region of Nepal, could not speak Nepalese.  He speaks only in English, which is the only knowledge that he derives from Lynn.  Otherwise, he does not have access to her knowledge. One might wonder why D’Hartma remembers his life in Nepal, but not the language.  One might also wonder why, if he derives his knowledge of English from Lynn, he speaks in the broken and accented English one would expect from a foreigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D’Hartma did speak one word of Nepalese, Namaste, which is a greeting (used for both hello and goodbye) which means “I bow to the divinity within you.” This is about as impressive as claiming to channel the spirit of King Kamehameha but not being able to speak Haiwaiin - but only being able to say “aloha” in a cheesy accent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D’Hartma also made the following claims: he does not perceive the passage of time while in the spiritual dimension; time has no meaning to him, since past, present, and future are all the same thing and time is merely a man-made construct; he did not pay attention to events on Earth while in the spiritual dimension, nor communicate with other spirits, as he was consumed with the task of gaining spiritual wisdom; and he lived from AD 932-968.  Someone who is less than completely trusting might wonder how D’hartma would know the dates in which he last lived.   The Christian calendar was not in wide-spread use in the tenth century even in Europe, and was unknown in Nepal, especially to an illiterate peasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I found it amusing that D’Hartma claimed that people only use 15% of their brain, a common new age myth with no scientific validity. The other 85% is allegedly used to “channel energy,” however this 85% is dormant and unused in most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynn’s background is pretty much what one would expect from a new age channeler.  She says that her mother is American Indian, and so Lynn was raised with spiritual beliefs.  When she was young she had many encounters with spirits.  At one time she claims she saw ghosts leaving a burning building.  She believes in astrology and reincarnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynn has also followed the career of JZ Knight and says she does not believe Knight is genuine. Perhaps she was at first, but isn’t any longer.  She also reports that Knight was part of her inspiration for her current channeling career.  She had stopped channeling D’Hartma for a period of time, until a friend of hers was lamenting the fact that she could not afford the exorbitant fee Knight charges to attend a channeling session.  Lynn graciously offered to channel for her, and has been doing it ever since.  At the time of the investigation Lynn was living off the fees she charged to consult D’Hartma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynn also is not impressed with James von Prague, and believes he is just a fast talker.  We were also amused to discover that Lynn had a brief association with our old friends, Ed and Lorraine Warren.  Apparently, the Warrens wanted D’Hartma to help them banish a demon.  D’Hartma, however, informed the Warrens that there is no such thing as evil, and that there were no evil spirits in the house the Warrens were about to exorcise. Thus ended their brief association, a victim to competing paranormal belief systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only physical aspect of Lynn’s channeling is what she called the “water miracles.”  D’Hartma can apparently summon water or burst water pipes as validation that he is genuine.  He did not manifest any water miracles for us, leading me to conclude that he either cannot do so, or chose not to, which was definitely a bad call on his part.  A few days prior to our interview, D’Hartma was interviewed by a local news station, and had promised the reporter a water miracle.  When asked by one of his followers if the water miracle had occurred, D’Hartma responded, “No, because he is looking for it too much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our evening with D’Hartma was certainly an interesting experience.  Lynn’s performance, however, was predictable and unimpressive.  It was stylistically very similar to the standard model of the current channeling phenomenon. I found D’Hartma’s philosophy to be simplistic new age, feel-good tripe, with no new metaphysical elements.  The details offered were also lacking, including D’Hartma’s inability to speak his native language, the problems with time, the mediocre cold reading complete with poor prediction, and the endorsement of common new age mythology.&lt;br&gt;
If we consider the two most obvious hypotheses to explain Lynn’s apparent channeling of D’Harmta, either she is genuinely channeling a spirit from the seventh dimension, or she is pretending to do so, what can we conclude about which of these two hypotheses is more likely to be correct?  The fact that Lynn’s performance fits so cleanly into the standard new age model, I find to be a compelling argument that D’Hartma is a cultural construct, not a genuine entity.  The principle of Occom’s Razor would also favor the far simpler explanation that D’Hartma is a product of Lynn’s mind and nothing more, since this hypothesis adequately explains all available evidence, without having to introduce new extraordinary elements, such as nine spiritual dimensions and reincarnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I am satisfied with this mundane explanation for Lynn’s claims, I still can’t help feeling somewhat unfulfilled.  Her performance offered no opportunity for a Houdini-style exposure.  No climactic “Aha!, Caught you.”  And I suppose that is the point of non-physical mediums - plausible deniability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;em&gt;there must be a better way&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to match up all occurrences of a journal’s name, including misspellings and tyops, in our database and correct them to the canonical abbreviation. For further enjoyment I’d like the &lt;span&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; of the journal’s main page, where one exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PubMed, frankly, is a bit crap at finding journal names and their homepages. Anyone know of a good resource? Preferably one with an &lt;span&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; or at least a script-friendly interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are you a ghost hunter?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Er, well… no, not exactly.. you see…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s very interesting, but what I do at the JREF is…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;And so it went. This is not an unusual exchange, and I’m not annoyed in the least.

So there's two new websites out there with quite similar names, &lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt;. Both sites are about (obviously) autism and have a number of videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; states that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All too often in the world of autism, celebrity and sex appeal are used to promote pseudo-science that exploits autistic people, their family members and the public. We decided to put those very same factors to work in service of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Videos.html"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; are entitled "No Link," "Inclusive Education," "Words," and "Pet Peeves," and feature Leeann, the "friend of a family with an autistic child," well, struttin' and showin' her stuff. (Not &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/not_the_good_goods"&gt;this kind of stuff&lt;/a&gt;.) The admittedly "tongue in cheek" videos are, it seems, made to get attention, with something of a reference to a quite well-known &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/evaluate_science_not_celebrity"&gt;celebrity&lt;/a&gt; (not &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/why_people_believe_oprah"&gt;Oprah&lt;/a&gt;, but a friend) whose past included her "exposing herself" in some similar ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos on &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt; are meant to teach parents and professionals about ABA therapy. You can &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/SampleLessons.aspx"&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; for a fee ($100/month for personal use) to have access to "hundreds of step-by-step video lessons" and online support from professionals. Some &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/SampleLessons.aspx"&gt;sample lessons&lt;/a&gt; (imitating a peer, labeling prepositions/incidental teaching---familiar to those of whose children have been doing ABA, or to those who themselves are teachers/therapists) can be seen &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/SampleLessons.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt;'s stated &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/OurPhilosophy.aspx"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; is to provide "immediate access to effective and affordable Applied Behavior Analysis-based treatment tools for the growing population affected by autism spectrum disorders," hence the videos and online subscriptions. The Senior Clinical Advisor on the &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/WhoWeAre.aspx"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; is Bridget Taylor, the Executive Director of one of New Jersey's private autism schools, the &lt;a href="http://www.alpinelearninggroup.org/aboutus/staff.asp"&gt;Alpine Learning Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of a page on &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/WhyRethink.aspx"&gt;why rethink autism&lt;/a&gt;, it's noted that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imagine what’s possible. Then think again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rethink autism. We don’t just offer hope, we give you help.&lt;br&gt;
rethink autism empowers you to teach today!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, "rethinking autism" on &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt; refers to (I think) that, instead of thinking that it's not possible to teach an autistic child, think again, yes you can (with an emphasis on ABA teaching).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; also asks people to think differently about autism, with such suggestions as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because a person with autism may not speak, it does not mean they have an inferior intellect.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.................&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should be more concerned about an autistic individual’s quality of life instead of preventing them from being born. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to self-advocates and learn about neurodiversity. Include the organized community of autistic adults when it comes to making legislation regarding their quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two very different, if very similarly websites, and maybe some would think they oughtn't to be discussed in the same post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But think again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt; are asking us to think, life with autism isn't----doesn't have to be----hopeless. We need, indeed, to think differently about autism and individuals on the autism spectrum, just as the &lt;a href="http://www.nas.org.uk/"&gt;National Autistic Society&lt;/a&gt; has exhorted people to do with its &lt;a href="http://www.think-differently.org.uk/"&gt;Think Differently&lt;/a&gt; campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a shady operation that constantly makes false claims about products and rips people off.  Sandler was mocking a real phenomenon--the liquidation companies named "going out of business" or "total liquidation sale."  The Journal has a fun &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124579907861644365.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on the issue today, focusing on a rug salesman who has settled down in Texas for a permanent going out of business sale.  Barry Newman reports:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many localities do have rules against such claims. New York City asks stores to get licenses for angst-inspired specials, from "fire sale" to "lost our lease." Texas asks the same. But with blowouts on every corner, there's been no burst in enforcement. Texas has issued 49 such licenses since 2001 -- and prosecuted one used-car dealer in Austin.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/06/making_a_business_of_going_out.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/nZFOnB2Dqa0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245824088885"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/leave_journalism_to_profession.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e9d683b27e078743</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Media"/><title type="html">Leave journalism to professionals!</title><published>2009-06-24T04:31:54Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T04:31:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/Ey8ca36Wp7c/leave_journalism_to_profession.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/leave_journalism_to_profession.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Or better not.

&lt;p&gt;I think this story makes for a great counterpoint to the story I blogged about yesterday about France considering banning burkas. Paris Hilton gets a gold star from me on this one. &lt;/p&gt;

Basically, Zicam was approved without testing to show it to be both safe and efficacious because it slipped in using an old 1938 law that allows homeopathic remedies to bypass the usual process for FDA approval. Too bad that, due to the zinc in Zicam, it can cause anosmia, or the loss of the sense of smell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Colbert, of course, thinks it must be the Democrats who are plotting against one of Rush Limbaugh's main sponsors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...Lee's yoga focuses on Brain Education, or as one official put it, "using your brain well." Part of this training includes the head-shaking Brain Wave Vibration exercise...Participants take basic yoga classes and are reportedly encouraged to attend pricey workshops, retreats and healing sessions.

The last I had heard was that they were going to get a jury of scientists to evaluate their claims. I knew that if it was a real panel, they would sort out where the extra energy was coming from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;I knew that there was a problem just from their description of their "technology" they made the claim that magnets somehow allowed them to gain energy "just like when you walk up and down a hill, you have gained energy". I knew that they would either find the error (this was being very optimistic on my part), or they were simply trying to pull a fast one (the realist in me).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Today from &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/06/steorn-perpetual-motion-co-s-independent-jury-runs-out-of-energy/"&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt;, I learned that the panel has spoken. Guess what. Nada. Funny part is that the company claims that the jury only looked at the technology while it suffered from a problem that has been corrected after the jury was complete. Pretty funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementing Orbo in a reliable and consistent manner had remained a challenge for the organization, one that we had made no secret of. Due to these difficulties we had focused on providing the Jury with test data relating to the underlying magnetic effect behind Orbo. This work concluded at the end of 2008.” &lt;br&gt;McCarthy concluded by stating that “during 2009 the company had resolved the key technical problems related to the implementation of Orbo and is now focused on commercial launch towards the end of this year, at which time academic and engineering validation would be released concurrent with public demonstrations”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Typical woo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;That said, I am pretty pleased how this has all turned out. I even commend Steorn for going through with the jury. They must have themselves pretty deluded to think that they would get past an honest panel of skeptics. Regardless, they honestly went about the testing and let the jury publish their findings ( sans the details unfortunately).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;This sort of reminds me of my position about NCCAM. Orac and PZ have &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/let_president-elect_obama_know_that_he_s.php"&gt;been railing against NCCAM for years&lt;/a&gt;. We have found out that they &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31190909"&gt;spent 2.5 billion dollars finding out that virtually nothing of the CAM industry works&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;But isn't that good? Isn't that exactly what we want some organization to do? Check if something works and publish the results? I'd love for CAM to work. I'd love for all that nice comforting woo to work. But I want an organization to check for efficacy with rigorous studies. Considering the scope of studies, finding out that only one worked (ginseng for chemotherapy nausea), to me was worth it. This is enough for me, you, and the government to point to and say "nonsense!". I'm pretty happy wth both the Steorn outcome and the NCCAM outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;I realize that Steorn has spun the result already, and most woos will simply ignore the NCCAM results. But we now have a big thing to point at. And I like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/26613182-2460151305950744618?l=techskeptic.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Techskeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Effort Sisyphus</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245813274097"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1535">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/192c822876826d5d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and culture"/><title type="html">Ancient Cybertronian text</title><published>2009-06-24T03:03:25Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T03:03:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1535" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is the U.S. release of &lt;a href="http://www.transformersmovie.com/"&gt;Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen&lt;/a&gt;. (Warning: clicking on that link will cause Linkin Park to start playing the chorus of &lt;em&gt;New Divide&lt;/em&gt; through your computer&amp;#39;s sound system, which may not be what you want…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some parts of the movie were shot here at Penn — including one scene in the Quad, where I live:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Transformers1a.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click for a larger version" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Transformers1a.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this screenshot from the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhtGnCa8x2k"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt;, the (added by me) red ellipse marks my dining room window, next to which I generally sit while blogging at breakfast. The trailer suggests that I can expect to get cinematically blown to CGI bits along with pretty much every everything else in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This geographical accident is not the only linguistic connection. According to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_Revenge_of_the_Fallen"&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt;'s plot description, "Sam Witwicky heads off to college in an attempt to live a normal life. Whilst packing, he finds another shard of the AllSpark which fills his mind with ancient Cybertronian text."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam in turn carves some of this text in the turf, as shown here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Transformers2.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that this ancient Cybertronian text is the movie&amp;#39;s MacGuffin — &amp;quot;the language Sam sees is of the Dynasty of Primes, the original seven Transformers, who powered the AllSpark like a battery by destroying suns&amp;quot;, according to Wikipedia. And the text somehow encodes &amp;quot;information on the location of a new energon signal&amp;quot;, which the evil transformers want to dissect Sam&amp;#39;s brain to find. Or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there's a well-defined made-up language behind this text, but if so, I haven't been able to learn anything about it. Maybe that's just as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — Roger Ebert &lt;a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090623/REVIEWS/906239997"&gt;was not impressed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&amp;quot;Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen&amp;quot; is a horrible experience of unbearable length […]  If you want to save yourself the ticket price, go into the kitchen, cue up a male choir singing the music of hell, and get a kid to start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and use your imagination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The plot is incomprehensible. The dialog of the Autobots, Deceptibots and Otherbots is meaningless word flap. Their accents are Brooklyese, British and hip-hop, as befits a race from the distant stars. Their appearance looks like junkyard throw-up. They are dumb as a rock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it follows from this, as Michael Cieply &lt;a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/transformers-sequel-off-to-red-hot-start-in-british-cinemas/"&gt;tells us&lt;/a&gt; in the NYT's Media Decoder column, that "company executives were privately speculating that the new “Transformers” film had a shot at becoming Paramount’s second-highest grossing film, behind 'Titanic'".  I can't wait to see it, myself. ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update #2 — Cosma Shalizi, in a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1535#comment-34611"&gt;characteristically astute comment&lt;/a&gt;, points us to a review by Charlie Jane Anders, "&lt;a href="http://io9.com/5301898/michael-bay-finally-made-an-art-movie"&gt;Michael Bay Finally Made An Art Movie&lt;/a&gt;", which I can't resist quoting in part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Critical consensus on &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is overwhelmingly negative. But the critics are wrong. &lt;span&gt;Michael Bay&lt;/span&gt; used a squillion dollars and a hundred supercomputers&amp;#39; worth of CG for a brilliant art movie about the illusory nature of plot. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Since the days of &lt;em&gt;Un Chien Andalou&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, filmmakers have reached beyond meaning. But with this summer's biggest, loudest movie, Michael Bay takes us all the way inside Caligari's cabinet. And once you enter, you can never emerge again. I saw this movie two days ago, and I'm still living inside it. Things are exploding wherever I look, household appliances are trying to kill me, and bizarre racial stereotypes are shouting at me. &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Transformers: ROTF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has mostly gotten pretty hideous reviews, but that's because people don't understand that this isn't a movie, in the conventional sense. It's an assault on the senses, a barrage of crazy imagery. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In one of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/the_complaints_department_is_o.php"&gt;comment threads&lt;/a&gt;, some simple suggestions for new commenters have been formulated. They&amp;#39;re pretty good — pay them some heed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you post, even if you intend to reply only to PZ or to one other comment on the 
thread, up to 200 people (or more) will read, and possibly respond to you. Keep this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this is a science blog, a greater proportion of the readers and commenters here well-
educated, and, if not scientists, are reasonably well-versed in logic, observation, empiricism, 
debate, and rationality. As such, their responses will likely be pointed, eloquent, articulate, 
and highly opinionated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any comments you make will be judged, and often judged harshly for grammar, intellectual 
consistency, knowledge of the subject addressed, and openness of tone. Get used it; this is 
the deep end, not a wading pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenters who wish to make religious, spiritual, or other arguments are welcome to do 
so, provided they are willing to respond to the observations and criticisms of other posters, 
many of whom are experts in their fields. Commenters who argue without insulting other 
commenters personally or in whole, and who actually respond to counter-arguments will have 
a stimulating time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenters who begin their interaction on this blog with insults (you're a bunch of jerks), 
threats (you're all going to hell) or other poltroonery (atheists have no morals) will be 
responded to in kind by persons who generally have far more experience and education, and 
certainly a greater vocabulary in both insult and invective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often say stuff on the Internets that they would never say to your face. You are 
strongly urged to get over it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People do get banned here, although it takes some effort. You can also read my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/plonk.php"&gt;list of grievances&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the vociferous commenters already here who will skewer offenders, keep in mind that I rule this place as a casual dictatorship — if I get annoyed, I bring out the axe. All that&amp;#39;s saving some people is that I&amp;#39;m also a lazy tyrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other thing I have to add for the regulars: I have a  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/08/a_suggestion_for_the_comments.php"&gt;Three Comment Rule&lt;/a&gt; that I don't really enforce very consistently, but would make for a somewhat less hair-trigger environment. Basically, if someone brand new to you shows up and says something annoying, don't jump down their throat right away. Give them a couple of chances to clarify first, and &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; if they're  still painfully stupid, open fire with both barrels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/advice_to_new_commenters.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/7BxWTfB5a4E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245806318247"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1534">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ae62ec15bc863906</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">A head wound from a falling what?</title><published>2009-06-24T00:46:57Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T00:46:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1534" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sitting at San Francsico Airport waiting for my ride (my plane came in half an hour early from London — take that, air travel grumblers!), and beside me is a British Airways cabin crew member waiting for a friend. He just told me about a flight he was once on where an overhead bin opened accidentally and a didgeridoo fell out and hit a passenger on the head so hard that medics on the flight recommended he be taken off the flight at the first opportunity to land.  It&amp;#39;s hard to believe people would take seriously the idea that you were just sitting reading when you suffered a head wound from a falling didgeridoo.  On the same flight there had been a case of vomiting, and a passenger who had fouled his pants.  At the end of the whole flight the pilot said to the crew, &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s take stock.  We&amp;#39;ve had a spew, a poo, and a didgeridoo.  You couldn&amp;#39;t make it up, could you?&amp;quot;  And I swear I didn&amp;#39;t.  Poetry in real life.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005970" title=""&gt;A Fish Eye Out of Water: Ten Visual Opsins in the Four-Eyed Fish, Anableps anableps&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The "four-eyed" fish Anableps anableps has numerous morphological adaptations that enable above and below-water vision. Here, as the first step in our efforts to identify molecular adaptations for aerial and aquatic vision in this species, we describe the A. anableps visual opsin repertoire. We used PCR, cloning, and sequencing to survey cDNA using unique primers designed to amplify eight sequences from five visual opsin gene subfamilies, SWS1, SWS2, RH1, RH2, and LWS. We also used Southern blotting to count opsin loci in genomic DNA digested with EcoR1 and BamH1. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the identity of all opsin sequences and allowed us to map gene duplication and divergence events onto a tree of teleost fish. Each of the gene-specific primer sets produced an amplicon from cDNA, indicating that A. anableps possessed and expressed at least eight opsin genes. A second PCR-based survey of genomic and cDNA uncovered two additional LWS genes. Thus, A. anableps has at least ten visual opsins and all but one were expressed in the eyes of the single adult surveyed. Among these ten visual opsins, two have key site haplotypes not found in other fish. Of particular interest is the A. anableps-specific opsin in the LWS subfamily, S180γ, with a SHYAA five key site haplotype. Although A. anableps has a visual opsin gene repertoire similar to that found in other fishes in the suborder Cyprinodontoidei, the LWS opsin subfamily has two loci not found in close relatives, including one with a key site haplotype not found in any other fish species. A. anableps opsin sequence data will be used to design in situ probes allowing us to test the hypothesis that opsin gene expression differs in the distinct ventral and dorsal retinas found in this species.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005991" title=""&gt;Melanopsin Bistability: A Fly's Eye Technology in the Human Retina&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to rods and cones, the human retina contains light-sensitive ganglion cells that express melanopsin, a photopigment with signal transduction mechanisms similar to that of invertebrate rhabdomeric photopigments (IRP). Like fly rhodopsins, melanopsin acts as a dual-state photosensitive flip-flop in which light drives both phototransduction responses and chromophore photoregeneration that bestows independence from the retinoid cycle required by rods and cones to regenerate photoresponsiveness following bleaching by light. To explore the hypothesis that melanopsin in humans expresses the properties of a bistable photopigment in vivo we used the pupillary light reflex (PLR) as a tool but with methods designed to study invertebrate photoreceptors. We show that the pupil only attains a fully stabilized state of constriction after several minutes of light exposure, a feature that is consistent with typical IRP photoequilibrium spectra. We further demonstrate that previous exposure to long wavelength light increases, while short wavelength light decreases the amplitude of pupil constriction, a fundamental property of IRP difference spectra. Modelling these responses to invertebrate photopigment templates yields two putative spectra for the underlying R and M photopigment states with peaks at 481 nm and 587 nm respectively. Furthermore, this bistable mechanism may confer a novel form of "photic memory" since information of prior light conditions is retained and shapes subsequent responses to light. These results suggest that the human retina exploits fly-like photoreceptive mechanisms that are potentially important for the modulation of non-visual responses to light and highlights the ubiquitous nature of photoswitchable photosensors across living organisms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005974" title=""&gt;Stimulus Familiarity Affects Perceptual Restoration in the European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Humans can easily restore a speech signal that is temporally masked by an interfering sound (e.g., a cough masking parts of a word in a conversation), and listeners have the illusion that the speech continues through the interfering sound. This perceptual restoration for human speech is affected by prior experience. Here we provide evidence for perceptual restoration in complex vocalizations of a songbird that are acquired by vocal learning in a similar way as humans learn their language. European starlings were trained in a same/different paradigm to report salient differences between successive sounds. The birds' response latency for discriminating between a stimulus pair is an indicator for the salience of the difference, and these latencies can be used to evaluate perceptual distances using multi-dimensional scaling. For familiar motifs the birds showed a large perceptual distance if discriminating between song motifs that were muted for brief time periods and complete motifs. If the muted periods were filled with noise, the perceptual distance was reduced. For unfamiliar motifs no such difference was observed. The results suggest that starlings are able to perceptually restore partly masked sounds and, similarly to humans, rely on prior experience. They may be a suitable model to study the mechanism underlying experience-dependent perceptual restoration.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005987" title=""&gt;Induction of Empathy by the Smell of Anxiety&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The communication of stress/anxiety between conspecifics through chemosensory signals has been documented in many vertebrates and invertebrates. Here, we investigate how chemosensory anxiety signals conveyed by the sweat of humans (N = 49) awaiting an academic examination are processed by the human brain, as compared to chemosensory control signals obtained from the same sweat donors in a sport condition. The chemosensory stimuli were pooled according to the donation condition and administered to 28 participants (14 males) synchronously to breathing via an olfactometer. The stimuli were perceived with a low intensity and accordingly only about half of the odor presentations were detected by the participants. The fMRI results (event-related design) show that chemosensory anxiety signals activate brain areas involved in the processing of social emotional stimuli (fusiform gyrus), and in the regulation of empathic feelings (insula, precuneus, cingulate cortex). In addition, neuronal activity within attentional (thalamus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) and emotional (cerebellum, vermis) control systems were observed. The chemosensory perception of human anxiety seems to automatically recruit empathy-related resources. Even though the participants could not attentively differentiate the chemosensory stimuli, emotional contagion seems to be effectively mediated by the olfactory system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005996" title=""&gt;Large-Scale Assessment of the Effect of Popularity on the Reliability of Research&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Based on theoretical reasoning it has been suggested that the reliability of findings published in the scientific literature decreases with the popularity of a research field. Here we provide empirical support for this prediction. We evaluate published statements on protein interactions with data from high-throughput experiments. We find evidence for two distinctive effects. First, with increasing popularity of the interaction partners, individual statements in the literature become more erroneous. Second, the overall evidence on an interaction becomes increasingly distorted by multiple independent testing. We therefore argue that for increasing the reliability of research it is essential to assess the negative effects of popularity and develop approaches to diminish these effects.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006024" title=""&gt;No Need to Discriminate? Reproductive Diploid Males in a Parasitoid with Complementary Sex Determination&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Diploid males in hymenopterans are generally either inviable or sterile, thus imposing a severe genetic load on populations. In species with the widespread single locus complementary sex determination (sl-CSD), sex depends on the genotype at one single locus with multiple alleles. Haploid (hemizygous) individuals are always males. Diploid individuals develop into females when heterozygous and into males when homozygous at the sex determining locus. Our comparison of the mating and reproductive success of haploid and diploid males revealed that diploid males of the braconid parasitoid Cotesia glomerata sire viable and fertile diploid daughters. Females mated to diploid males, however, produced fewer daughters than females mated to haploid males. Nevertheless, females did not discriminate against diploid males as mating partners. Diploid males initiated courtship display sooner than haploid males and were larger in body size. Although in most species so far examined diploid males were recognized as genetic dead ends, we present a second example of a species with sl-CSD and commonly occurring functionally reproductive diploid males. Our study suggests that functionally reproductive diploid males might not be as rare as hitherto assumed. We argue that the frequent occurrence of inbreeding in combination with imperfect behavioural adaptations towards its avoidance promote the evolution of diploid male fertility.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006042" title=""&gt;Gender Differences in the Motivational Processing of Babies Are Determined by Their Facial Attractiveness&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This study sought to determine how esthetic appearance of babies may affect their motivational processing by the adults. Healthy men and women were administered two laboratory-based tasks: a) key pressing to change the viewing time of normal-looking babies and of those with abnormal facial features (e.g., cleft palate, strabismus, skin disorders, Down's syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome) and b) attractiveness ratings of these images. Exposure to the babies' images produced two different response patterns: for normal babies, there was a similar effort by the two groups to extend the visual processing with lower attractiveness ratings by men; for abnormal babies, women exerted greater effort to shorten the viewing time despite attractiveness ratings comparable to the men. These results indicate that gender differences in the motivational processing of babies include excessive (relative to the esthetic valuation) motivation to extend the viewing time of normal babies by men vs. shortening the exposure to the abnormal babies by women. Such gender-specific incentive sensitization phenomenon may reflect an evolutionary-derived need for diversion of limited resources to the nurturance of healthy offspring.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You know &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/for_dedicated_bibliophiles_onl.php"&gt;I mocked&lt;/a&gt; his weird decision to sell an edited version of Darwin's &lt;i&gt;Origin&lt;/i&gt; with a long-winded creationist introduction just this morning…and he&amp;#39;s already edited the ad to &lt;a href="http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/146710758.html"&gt;include a quote from me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Um... what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently an autistic high school senior, who had completed all of the academic requirements necessary for graduation was not going to be allowed to cross the stage because he had not completed his "social and other goals."  Again, um... what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senior's family had to go to court in order to force the school to allow the teen (who, remember, had completed the all of his academic course work) to participate in graduation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the superintendent Wrend,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Graduation at People's Academy is not a feel-good exercise," Wrend said. "It is the formal recognition that students have met the high standards set for them. We want our graduation ceremonies ... to have meaning."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in what way wouldn't this graduation ceremony have meaning for an autistic teen who completed his course work along with his classmates of the past 9 years?  And since when didn't it "feel good" to finally complete high school?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High school has changed a lot since "my day."  Back then, criteria for graduation, thankfully, did not involve meeting "social goals" else I probably would have needed to go to court in order to be allowed to cross the stage too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a little unclear here if graduation is intended for the students or for the administrators, and whether school is intended to teach general education or just to point out one's social inadequacies.  The world can be unfriendly enough for us--let us have a moment to "feel good" about what we can, and have, and could accomplish.  Even if it's something like learning calculus instead of small talk.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245797934656"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7843">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8f7e506c24f82c31</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Links elsewhere"/><category term="Skepchick-ism"/><title type="html">Hear Me Say Stuff at 7pm ET!</title><published>2009-06-23T22:30:43Z</published><updated>2009-06-23T22:30:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7843" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I recorded an interview with a very nice Canadian fellow named Ethan, host of Radio Freethinkers on CiTR 101.9 in Vancouver.

And, as I did with the &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/06/jack-night-and-privacy-case-analysis.html"&gt; Night Jack&lt;/a&gt; court ruling, I have inserted my comments in [brackets]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My general view is that it actually is not a bad or surprising ruling, given (a) the narrow questions which Ofcom had to address given the actual wording of the Code and (b) the evidence submitted by LBC's lawyers (which in large part seems to have relied on the contributions of the hostile callers to provide "balance" not provided by the presenter).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, Ofcom makes intersting comments about the inadequate briefing for the presentation of the broadcast and how the presentation was was unclear on significant points, and it also comments about the impatient and dismissive manner the presenter dealt with criticism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skeptics should thereby not be discouraged by the overall ruling that the radio show was "not in breach", for as a careful reading of the ruling perhaps suggests that Ofcom is really quite damning about the quality of the broadcast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The source of this text is the Ofcom site &lt;a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/obb136/"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;, which I gratefully acknowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeni Barnett&lt;br&gt;LBC 97.3 FM, 7 January 2009, 14:00 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LBC 97.3 FM (“LBC”) is a local speech based commercial radio service which broadcasts across Greater London. Ofcom received 190 complaints regarding a discussion about a parent’s right to not give their child the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (“MMR”) vaccination, on the weekday afternoon phone-in discussion programme presented by Jeni Barnett. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The complainants expressed concern about the way in which Jeni Barnett presented and handled the phone-in discussion on this topic. In their view the programme gave such an unbalanced, inaccurate and irresponsible portrayal of the dangers of the triple MMR vaccine that it could have caused considerable anxiety to parents. This in their view could reduce the take up of the vaccination resulting in a considerable threat to public health. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ofcom asked LBC to comment with reference to the following Code Rules: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.2 – factual programmes or items or portrayals of factual matters must not materially mislead the audience; and&lt;br&gt;5.13 – local radio services must not give undue prominence to the views and opinions of particular persons or bodies on matters of political or industrial controversy and matters relating to current public policy in all the programmes included in any service taken as a whole. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ofcom was of the view that the MMR vaccination could be considered a matter relating to current public policy given that it is part of the Government recommended childhood vaccination schedule.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Here Ofcom is setting the scene. It is their job as a regulator to convert often general complaints into potetential breaches of particular provisions of the Code. In this case they have identified two code provisions. The last sentence is to explain why Code Rule 5.13 is applicable. The use of 5.13 is interesting as it is not an immediately obvious provision, and it perhaps shows that Ofcom wanted to ensure LBC had to deal with the strongest possible complaint against the broadcast.] &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LBC responded that the debate on the right to choose the MMR vaccination was based upon presenter opinion, as was much of LBC’s output. Indeed, the focus of this discussion was based on Jeni Barnett’s own personal experience as a mother - who had chosen not to give her daughter the triple MMR vaccine – and the right for her to make this choice for her child without being criticised for it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the outset of the programme, the broadcaster argued that Jeni Barnett made clear that she was not an expert herself and that this programme was focused on the notion of informed parental choice, not about whether immunisation was good or bad. Furthermore, the presenter had invited experts, as well as parents who had refused the vaccination, to call in and had advised against scaremongering. In conclusion, they argued that the programme did not “stray into the bounds of providing factual information that mislead listeners” and did not breach Rule 2.2. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With reference to Rule 5.13, the broadcaster stated that given the nature of LBC’s output, the vast majority of its content would in some way be related to government policy and therefore fell within the bounds of “current public policy”. In their view however, the Code provided scope for presenters to express their own opinions thereby stimulating debate, provided that a fair opportunity for comment was offered. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The phone-in format of the programme afforded this facility. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this particular programme Jeni Barnett received six callers to the programme, four of whom presented opposing views to her. Indeed, the second caller actually pointed out that he was a regular listener and that every medical expert he had heard on LBC discussing the issue of MMR had said it was “a good thing” and the evidence against it had been refuted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall these points demonstrated that the broadcaster had not only provided balance in this broadcast but also across its output. Given that Rule 5.13 defined undue prominence as a “significant imbalance of views” the broadcaster stated that this programme did not reach this level of imbalance and was therefore not in breach of this rule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Fairness requires that a case is put to the relevant party before a determination. LBC would have instructed lawyers to prepare this response, and so the response is closely honed to the terms of the two Code Rules. This is how, in general terms, companies will usually have an advantage in regulatory matters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lawyers for LBC have ensured &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; which can be said for LBC in respect of the two Code provisions will be. The consolation for non-lawyers in this case is the sympathy one must have for the lawyers who had (presumably) to listen repeatedly to the recording of their client's show in formulating this response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is clear that LBC has had to rely on the callers to provide evidence of balance which was otherwise missing in the broadcast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The LBC lawyers have done a thorough job of the required exercise and, in my view, Ofcom was going to struggle to uphold a complaint of the two Code Rules.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Communications Act 2003 places a statutory duty on Ofcom to ensure that broadcasters apply generally accepted standards so that the public is adequately protected from harmful material. In applying this rule Ofcom must ensure an appropriate level of freedom of expression as set out in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This is in terms of both the broadcaster’s right to impart information and ideas and the audience’s right to receive them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ofcom must therefore seek an appropriate balance between ensuring members of the public are protected from material which may be considered harmful on the one hand and the broadcaster’s right to freedom of expression on the other. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the complainants expressed concern, that the programme misleadingly suggested that the MMR vaccine was dangerous, thereby suggesting to parents that immunisation was not recommended nor a necessity, we firstly considered the programme with specific reference to Rule 2.2. This rule relates to protecting the public from material which may be harmful, by requiring the broadcaster to ensure that the portrayal of factual matters does not materially mislead the audience.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Again, this is scene-setting. Ofcom is setting out its powers and how it will approach the case. It correctly identifies Coder Rule 2.2 as the most important provision.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 2.2 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With reference to this rule Ofcom considered if the programme had given the overall impression to listeners that the MMR vaccine was dangerous and unnecessary and whether material harm might have been caused to the public as a result. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Ofcom is setting out what it sees as the Code Rule 2.2 test in this particular instance. See that they have split it into two: the "overall impression" and the "material harm" tests. For a complaint to be upheld on Code 2.2 it would need to meet both these tests.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ofcom acknowledges that the focus of the debate was intended to be about a parent’s right to choose, based upon an informed decision, whether to have their child immunised. The presenter set out this argument clearly at the outset of the programme, recounting her personal experience when she chose not to immunise her daughter and with comments such as: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“…if as a human being you decide you do not want to give your child a vaccination, you should in a democracy, have the right to say no.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, Jeni Barnett restated this argument several times during the course of the hour long programme with statements such as: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I want you to tell me why you think we have to have this measles jab..”&lt;br&gt;“It’s not my job to say to people ‘don’t do it’ it’s not my job to do any of that. But you’re allowed to have your say.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“You’ve got to make an informed decision – your children will not be the same as anyone else’s.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Jeni Barnett had clearly set out her personal position at the start of the programme it was not unexpected that she would endorse the statements and motives of two mothers who had also elected not to immunise some, or all, of their children. Consequently the callers did make a number of unchallenged statements that suggested the MMR vaccination and immunisations in general were simply not necessary and could be dangerous to a child’s health. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, the first caller made the comments: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It must be wrong to be putting toxins and poisonous material into a young baby’s body…live viruses that are cured in monkey’s kidneys. How can that be the right thing to do?” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I just think vaccination is a total abuse of the immune system.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other caller said : &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“he [her son]...had the MMR, and then when he was three he was diagnosed with autism…my paediatrician was quite sure that it was the cause of the autism.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I would never recommend having my children vaccinated…all my children who have never been vaccinated have been very very healthy.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also Jeni Barnett did not question the text messages and emails she received during the programme which put forward a similar anti-immunisation or MMR position, such as: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“…as well as not being a hundred per cent effective, they also contain cancer causing agents.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“…gave my son MMR and then watched him shut down for a week as autism took hold…I live with guilt.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s all Government spin children don’t need the triple jab.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[These comments are now hereby immortalised in an Official Document!]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;In considering Rule 2.2, however, our decision was not based on whether the presenter should have challenged the callers or whether she should have exercised more caution in reading out texts and emails. Rather, it was based on whether, taken as a whole, the content of the programme would have left listeners with the overall impression that the MMR jab was dangerous thereby influencing parents not to immunise their children.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[This is the crucial passage. No sensible person listening to the broadcast would have not wanted some of the callers and texts to be challenged; but this is NOT the question which Ofcom is asking itself. In view of the text of Code Rule 2.2, I am afraid I have to say Ofcom is righr to adopt this restricted approach.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ofcom is of the view that, on balance, the programme did include sufficient and important opposing arguments to inform listeners of the case for immunisation and so served to dispel concerns about the dangers of the vaccine and ensure overall that the information was not materially misleading or harmful. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[This is where one can form a different view to Ofcom, because it appears that the "balance" which saves the broadcast was not intended by the presenter or by LBC. The callers that put contrary arguments were presumably not set up to do so. In my view, left to itself, the broadcast may have been held to be in breach.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Ofcom now set out the extent of this "balance".]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indeed four of the six callers given air-time during the hour long programme presented an opposing view to Jeni Barnett. Importantly, two of these four callers were health professionals, a GP and a nurse, who drew upon their experience of working closely with young children and the Government recommended immunisation schedule. The doctor in particular was given a considerable amount of air time, largely uninterrupted by the presenter, to explain the rationale for the MMR immunisation programme and the reasons why it was important to eradicate measles: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“All you need to do is meet one family whose normal child - they took the decision not to vaccinate their child - and they got measles and they got a devastating complication such as inflammation of the brain…or they died, and your opinion changes.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Measles is the one that can really does kill…it’s just because the numbers in Western Europe and the States and Australia are lower that we don’t see this so often.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition the nurse criticised Jeni Barnett several times for being “irresponsible” and made comments such as: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“You should think about what you are doing on this programme. You are doing a lot of damage.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She also presented the rationale for a national immunisation schedule: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If you deny immunisation then you are denying health to your child and other children.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another caller reprimanded Jeni Barnett for reading out an anonymous email saying that vaccines contained “cancer causing agents” (see above) because it would “scare new mothers” and it was irresponsible to read out such a statement without the name of the person who had sent in the email. A further caller stated that all the medical experts he had heard on LBC previously had rejected the arguments against the MMR vaccine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Further, on at least two occasions Jeni Barnett herself looked to redress the balance by commenting: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“…there isn’t a definitive answer. There is no absolute answer” and “as a parent you have to make a decision based on your own family history”. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[This was enough to make the show balanced, it would appear. But the following two paragraphs are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; interesting.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Broadcasters must exercise extreme caution when dealing with issues of public health where misinformation or misleading impression could cause actual or potential damage. It is extremely important that while broadcasters exercise their freedom of expression, they must ensure that any potentially harmful material is fully put in context. Broadcaster understandably wish to reflect discussions and debates that are taking place across the country, but in doing so, in areas of public health, they must not ignore the prevailing medical advice. In particular, while maintaining the right to freedom of expression, broadcasters need to be responsible and be aware of giving air to unfounded or unscientific views on matters of public health which may carry some weight.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[This paragraph will presumably be quoted by anyone making a complaint to Ofcom about such a programme in future.] &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;At times, it appeared that during this broadcast the presenter relied upon her anecdotal experience and was not adequately briefed on the wider public health issues and prevailing medical advice which this debate would undoubtedly also touch upon. For example, at times the schedule of other childhood immunisations were confused with the MMR triple vaccine schedule, and no reference at all was made to any current research contesting a link between autism and the MMR vaccine yet several anecdotal references were made supporting a link. Whilst this did not mean that the programme overall was materially misleading, and was therefore not in breach of Rule 2.2, in Ofcom’s opinion that it would have been preferable for the programme to have made some significant points clearer to listeners.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[This paragraph seems to me to be damning about the programme. In my view, given the wording of the Code Rules and the "balance" provided by the callers, this is as far as Ofcom really could have gone in this case in criticising the broadcast. In simple terms, Ofcom have held that the presentation in the broadcast was inadequate and unclear on significant points.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;In conclusion, however, Ofcom is of the view that on balance there were sufficient opposing arguments and challenges from contributors, including health professionals, to present the case for immunisation and that listeners would not have been materially misled by this broadcast. Therefore, Rule 2.2 was not breached.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Sad, but Ofcom really had no choice; at least Ofcom were able to qualify their determination here with their comments on the quality of the broadcast.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 5.13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rule 5.13 states that: “Broadcasters should not give undue prominence to the views and opinions of particular persons or bodies on matters of political or industrial controversy and matters relating to current public policy in all the programmes included in any service taken as a whole.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Again, Ofcom setting out the rule.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some complainants expressed concern that the way in which Jeni Barnett presented the discussion was not balanced and resulted in undue prominence of the anti-MMR position. We assessed these concerns with reference to Rule 5.13. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rule 5.13 prohibits undue prominence being given to particular views on matters relating to current public policy on a local radio service such as LBC in the context of its output overall. Given that the very nature of speech based local radio services is to debate matters of interest to listeners within a certain locale, which inevitably may relate to current public policy, this requirement for impartiality for the local radio broadcaster is slightly different to that applied to broadcasters with national coverage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Firstly, legislation in this area, which is therefore reflected in the rules in the Code, requires local radio stations to ensure that no undue prominence is given to views, on controversial matters. This is a separate and different concept to the requirement of due impartiality. Secondly, as Rule 5.13 makes clear, for this rule to be breached the broadcaster would have to demonstrate a “ significant [Ofcom’s emphasis] imbalance of views aired” across “ all [Ofcom’s emphasis] programming on a service dealing with the same or related issue within an appropriate period.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In contrast, the rule of due impartiality for national radio broadcasters must be achieved within a programme or more than one programme of the same series only. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As set out above when considering Rule 2.2, Ofcom was of the opinion that the programme itself provided a balance of views which were both in support of, and also opposed to, the MMR vaccine and the immunisation schedule for children. Therefore Ofcom considered that across the programme there was not a significant imbalance of the views aired. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In conclusion, it is Ofcom’s view that the programme itself provided enough views to ensure that the programme provided balance overall and, therefore, no undue prominence and no breach of Rule 5.13. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Ofcom is merely saying here that it cannot hold a breach of this alternative rule which applies only to local radio stations when it has not found a breach of Rule 2.2.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ofcom recognises that it is important for broadcasters to bring discussions about medical matters to an audience, and, that broadcasters should have the editorial freedom to present such matters as they wish provided that they comply with the Code. However, it is Ofcom’s view that broadcasters should exercise caution when dealing with medical matters where the issues are as controversial and scientifically based as the MMR vaccination. Whilst the broadcaster stated that the focus of this programme was about parental choice, not whether the MMR immunisation was good or bad, it was inevitable that such a discussion would evaluate the merits of immunisation or otherwise the issue of choice would not be relevant at all. Where such arguments are based on an understanding of the science and medicine, broadcasters should be aware of the potential dangers of causing harm. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Again this paragraph may well be quoted in future complaints.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is also Ofcom’s view that the notion of avoiding undue prominence may include the presenter, as appropriate, paying due respect to callers putting forward a view with which he or she disagrees. For example, in this case the contributions of the two mothers who had not immunised their children were positively endorsed and appreciated by the presenter with comments such as “This is fascinating” and “Fantastic…I know I shouldn’t be biased…” In comparison, Jeni Barnett’s treatment of the nurse who criticised her handling of the topic was at times dismissive and impatient. In the context of Rule 5.13 therefore, broadcasters are advised to ensure that overall the tone towards, and treatment of, callers does not leave listeners with the impression that one particular view on a matter of political controversy or a matter relating to current public policy, is being given undue prominence. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Again this appears to me damning, and it seems to go further than Ofcom needed to in not finding a breach of 5.13. The presenter's "dismissive and impatient" handling of criticism was, however, not enough for Ofcom to find a breach.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not in Breach of Rules 2.2 and 5.13 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[There is sometimes more to a case report than its headline determination!]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments Moderation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No attacks on Ofcom, LBC, or the presenter, will be approved.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-3797215600421445815?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245792889534"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/supreme_court_spec_ed_decision">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fc52e68b7d0fb93a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Supreme Court Spec Ed Decision</title><published>2009-06-23T21:26:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-23T21:26:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/supreme_court_spec_ed_decision" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.mississippifamilylawblog.com/Gavel%20and%20lawbook.jpg" height="170" alt="Gavel and law book from http://www.mississippifamilylawblog.com/Gavel%20and%20lawbook.jpg" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-right:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="200"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Even if a child has never received special education services from a public school district, the child is entitled to be reimbursed for tuition to a private school, according to a Supreme Court decision issued yesterday (&lt;a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-305.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; of the decision is &lt;a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-305.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The Court ruled 6-3 in &lt;em&gt;Forest Grove School District v. T.A.&lt;/em&gt; (Case No. 08-305), as noted in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/06/22/36scotusspecialed.h28.html?tkn=QVUFovfWjVp55hgCFxiEUxsLlHBJBHD9zDVX"&gt;EdWeek&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent with our decisions in [&lt;em&gt;School Committee of] Burlington&lt;/em&gt; [v. &lt;em&gt;Department of Education of Massachusetts&lt;/em&gt;] and [&lt;em&gt;Florence County School District No. 4&lt;/em&gt; v.] &lt;em&gt;Carter&lt;/em&gt;,” Justice Stevens wrote, “we conclude that &lt;a href="http://idea.ed.gov/"&gt;IDEA&lt;/a&gt; authorizes reimbursement for the cost of private special-education services when a school district fails to provide a [free, appropriate public education] and the private-school placement is appropriate, regardless of whether the child previously received special education or related services through the public school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, advocates for students with disabilities are praising the ruling, while organizations representing school boards and teachers are criticizing the decision for its potential effect on school budgets, keeping the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_costs_of_private_schools"&gt;costs of private schools&lt;/a&gt; in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it's understandable that parents would not want to place a child with disabilities in a public school program that they deemed inadequate and inappropriate, and therefore seek alternatives (often in the form of a private school). An inappropriate educational program, with not enough staff and/or with staff without the proper training, can potentially create more problems for the student who's not being properly taught, and for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

This one is in the Brainerd Dispatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to a previous writer's statement " ... modern neo-Darwinian synthesis of organic evolution is supported by more compelling and intellectually satisfying empirical evidence that any other idea ever advanced by the world's scientific community ... "&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The retort to this statement is simple: hogwash! Remember, the neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory is not "change over time" or "modifications through natural selection within an existing species", nor dynamics of cellular metamorphosis. These kinds of actions are simply workings of the natural order and have been observed and recorded for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could tell exactly what the writer is about to do at this point. Note that he is responding to a statement of fact, that there is a great deal of empirical evidence in support of evolution. He has announced that that is "hogwash", but is he going to rebut any of the evidence? No, he's going to do a little dance over the word "evolution" and tell us what it isn't. And he's going to get it wrong. Neo-Darwinian theory &lt;i&gt;includes&lt;/i&gt; all of the things he just listed (well, except for &amp;quot;dynamics of cellular metamorphosis&amp;quot; — I don&amp;#39;t even know what that means, and the writer certainly doesn&amp;#39;t, either).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's nice of him to coopt elements of the theory and claim that we've known it all along, though. It's one small step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, science is not synonymous with neo-Darwinism. Neo-Darwinism is in reality a very recent construct. In fact, it was and is being continually cobbled together long after Darwin himself died. Neo-Darwinism in effect says - since there is no pre-planned design behind it - every thing is random and undirected-nothing is planned. There is no purposeful form of life. So human beings, like everything else, is in effect just one of the many possible resulting accidents of an unconscious blind cosmic dice shake. Everything that is came into being as an accident and will disappear someday the same way. Consequently, there is no reason for being, nor any purpose for the natural world, or behavioral norms, and surely there is no rational for a future hope in anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one claims that science is synonymous with neo-Darwinian theory — the physicists and chemists and geologists would be very surprised to learn that they needed to be biologists to be called scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neo-Darwinian synthesis is less than a hundred years old. No one has been arguing otherwise about that, either. It's also an active theory which is being continually tested, revised, and re-assessed. This is a &lt;i&gt;good thing&lt;/i&gt;: we like to modify our ideas to fit the facts, not vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, nothing he's said contradicts the claim that evolution is a well-supported theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now we get to the nub of his objections: evolution is unplanned and lacks a long-term purpose. This is both a premise and an inference from the science. We always assume chance is behind variation; that is the null hypothesis. One could charge in, I suppose, and hypothesize that a particular pattern of change is the result of directed meddling, but the best way to test that would be to directly address the mechanism of the intervention. It's not a very productive approach, we've found. We'd have to deduce some of the properties of the agent behind the change, you see, and if we try that, advocates of teleology always back away quickly from any testable proposals. It's been a much more promising approach to postulate an absence of design, make predictions from that, and test them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And voila, it almost always seems to work out well. Predictions that leave out angels, demigods, demons, and magic spells seem to work out quite nicely, so we are left with a powerful theory sans deities, which implies that deities are at least superfluous. That's all the ateleology of biology means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, but notice again: none of his railings have any relevance to the claim of empirical evidence for evolution, that which he calls "hogwash". This isn't an argument, it's an emotional appeal. Many people are uncomfortable with the idea of an absence of guidance, so he's announcing that evolution doesn't include a god, and gee everyone, shouldn't that make you dislike it? But whether we dislike an idea or not has no bearing on its truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially not when our Minnesotan critic then goes on to demonstrate his ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neo-Darwinism's top proponents-Dawkins, Huxley, Weiner, Gould and Dobzhansky are all convinced atheists. For the person who is interested in the subject, but does not want to wade through pages of polemic, or get into deep esoteric scientific reading, might simply go to the video store and ask for Ben Stein's "Expelled" or get a hold of the book "Icons of Evolution" by molecular biologist Jonathan Wells. It might stun you on just how neo-Darwinism is pure fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ron Lindner&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;East Gull Lake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, let's see. The top proponents are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dawkins: Definitely a top proponent, definitely an atheist. Good start!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Huxley: Well, he &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a top proponent, but he's dead now. Long dead. He also wasn't an atheist. He was the fellow who coined the word "agnostic"!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Weiner: Who? It took me a moment to figure out who he's talking about, but it must be Jonathan Weiner, the excellent writer behind &lt;i&gt;Beak of the Finch&lt;/i&gt; and other science books. He's more of a science journalist though, a good one. If he's an atheist, he doesn't write about it, and it doesn't come through at all in his books.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Gould: Another top proponent, also an atheist, but also dead. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Dobzhansky: Dobzhansky? One of the most important architects of the neo-Darwinian synthesis, sure, but an atheist? He was Russian Orthodox, and by all accounts, rather devout! He was author of the essay, "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution", which phrase irks many creationists, but if you actually read the essay, one of its central assertions is that science is not in conflict with his own sincerely held Christianity! This is the guy our writer wants to argue was a nefarious atheist?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have to give Mr Lindner points for unintentional irony. If you don't like polemics, go watch &lt;a href="http://expelledexposed.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Expelled&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? Right. Don't want to read that science stuff? Then go read Wells. At least I can agree with that last point, since there isn't so much as a scrap of science in that book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm feeling dissatisfied, though. His starting premise was that the body of empirical evidence for evolution was "hogwash", and he seems to have forgotten to actually address the point. Typical.&lt;/p&gt;

They strap a scary big capacitor onto a U.S. quarter and zap it with 15,000 Joules, a truly terrifying amount of energy to pack into a few square centimeters. And what happens when they do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go watch the videos to find out. It’s pretty cool. Interestingly, in the high-speed video, you can see the affect on the coin &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the materials get so hot they incandesce. That means the magnetic field is interacting with the quarter itself before it heats the air, which is not what I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also clearly hear one of the guys telling people to look away when he trips one of the safety devices. That threw me for a moment. Why look away? Because it’s bright? And then I realized: they are creating a potential of 10,000 Volts, which means they get enough energy density to make &lt;del&gt;X-rays&lt;/del&gt; ultraviolet light. Holy Haleakala. Anyway, watch the setup video as well. &lt;/p&gt;

Today, I asked one of my SciBlings, Greg Laden of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/" title=""&gt;eponymous blog&lt;/a&gt;, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I intended to become a priest.  Since I was being raised among Jesuits and Franciscans, that would mean that I would likely be trained as an Inquisitor, and Inquisitors were learned.  So I searched for books to read, and in my household there was one bible written in Ancient German, an Encyclopedia, and a collection of Biology Textbooks.  I read all of them except the Bible because I could not read Ancient German.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that there is a direct line from my youthful training as an Inquisitor to my present job as a Blogger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on being a retired Inquisitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="GregLaden.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/GregLaden.jpg" width="403" height="292" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't talk about my real life job these days  I like to think of myself as an independent scholar and a writer, and a part time blogger. I have a lot of jobs, a lot of stuff I have to do.  But writing, at this moment, is the only thing I want to acknowledge.  Everything else can bite me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good question.  There is absolutely nothing related to science or communication about the web that is interesting. There is only interesting content.  But there is a lot of interest from a technology point of view related to how Web 2.0/the blogosphere/etc works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My interest is mainly in that content. I assume we can do anything with the web, anything related to communication, eventually.  Web 2.0 is baby web.  This will all look so silly even in just a few years. But the need for excellent, accurate, challenging and engaging content is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web allows for communication of the form that has not happened before, but I see the current technology as doing almost as much to interfere with technology as to enhance it. On the user side of things, people in academics tend to be Luddites, wearing their ludditosity as a badge.  These two things -- baby technology and cultural resistance to novelty -- need to change over the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Luddites will be left in the dust and Open Source technology will save us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to the latter, I am very interested in promoting Open Source approaches as the technology of science communication, and Open Access as the structural or editorial milieu for dissemination.  The proprietary models have had their chance and they have stifled rather than enhanced communication.  The party is over, proprietary models! Over!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that there is no room for commercial enterprise and even profit making, but the model that links consumer dollars to production via marketing has got to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social&lt;br&gt;
networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, now we are getting to the serious questions, I see.  Blogging does not relate to my work.  It IS my work.  Blogging is where my voice lives these days.  I've got writing projects that the blogging supports, in terms of my thought process and production stream.  I'm a blogger, not a person who blogs.  Social networks such as, for me mainly, Twitter and Facebook support, point to, enhance, underscore the blogging I do, and provide me with streams of information for my blog.  Facebook in particular is also a social network that serves as a social network (as opposed to something called a social network that serves as a tool for disseminating information).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, Twitter explicitly denies that it is a social network.  This is in writing somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was at a Minnesota Citizens for Science Education conference and someone mentioned PZ Myers' blog, Pharyngula, as a good thing for life science teachers to read.  I mostly ignored it for a while, because I was not really into reading blogs.  Then I read through a few days worth and thought "Hey, this is a good way to write.  Nice bite size bits, instant feedback, etc" (I don't remember if I actually said "etc" but I might have.)  So I started a blog, and it ran for about 10 months, when I was asked by Scienceblogs Dot Com to join them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think I discovered any new science blogs at the conference because a) I knew about most of them already and b) before the conference I used the conference wiki to find out about more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I did discover is that these blogs are actually written by PEOPLE!!! Who would have thought!?!?!?  One of the great pleasures, for me, which I expected to happen, was to meet some of the bloggers in person.  I was especially looking forward to meeting Coturnix, and I was not disappointed.  There were many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many things.  Enough that I have to say that this was a very important conference. Much of what I learned came from the inter-session and extra-session conversations, as well as the sessions themselves.  It was also great to meet in person people with whom I've collaborated on line. The organizers and participants in the Transitions session, Gender in Science, Race in Science, and Anonymity sessions produced a sort of Big Giant Stream of Conversation about all of these issues, which are largely related.  There is positive movement here, and a lot of good is happening.  I happen to also think that much of the social theory and political method being used by many of my fellow bloggers is rather mid 20th century and not as effective as it could be, and I would like to see this part of the blogosphere ... well, grow up a bit, to be honest. But that is not true of everyone involved in these important political movements.  And everyone, to a person, is well meaning and is contributing one way or another to the progress that is being made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to the day when I can put up 15 blog postings in a row that have to do with gender and race and have the following two things NOT happen:  1) One or more commenters say "I thought this was a science blog, I'm leaving forever!!!" and 2) One or more fellow bloggers make a side long nasty remark about how my voice is different from theirs, and therefore, wrong.  When those two things happen, or more exactly, don't happen, I'll know we'll have made some advancement in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the ScienceOnline09 conference, because people were meeting face to face, we all were moving more quickly in this direction than we have on the intertubes before or since.  That is important.  The web is wonderful but it is not real life in this very important way.  We need significant cultural evolution to happen in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related, the ScienceOnline09 conference also demonstrated the overlap between science (= fieldwork and test tubes and stuff), politics and society.  That is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of pragmatic aspects of communication covered by the conference, most of which I missed because of the stream of sessions I chose.  They looked good and I heard good things about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also very much appreciated the conversations I had with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/islandofdoubt/"&gt;James Hrynyshyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://thebeagleproject.blogspot.com/"&gt;Karen James&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://inversesquare.wordpress.com/"&gt;Tom Levinson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://coralnotesfromthefield.blogspot.com/"&gt;Rick McPherson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogfishx.blogspot.com/"&gt;Mark Powell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/culturedish/"&gt;Rebecca Skloot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/"&gt;Blake Stacey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://quichemoraine.com/2009/03/gender-trends-in-science-and-medical-writing/"&gt;Karen Venti&lt;/a&gt;, and others at Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Beer Hour and so on. I flew out with my Quiche Moraine Co-blogger, &lt;a href="http://almostdiamonds.blogspot.com/"&gt;Stephanie Zvan&lt;/a&gt; and her husband &lt;a href="http://photography.zvan.net/"&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; , and we were very happy to use this as an opportunity to let people know about &lt;a href="http://quichemoraine.com/"&gt;Quiche&lt;/a&gt;.  Also, I was thrilled that &lt;a href="http://crowdedheadcozybed.wordpress.com/"&gt;Lou FCD&lt;/a&gt; came up from the coast for big chunks of the conference, so I could meet my on line buddy in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing that surprised me the most, if I may say, is how many people at the conference had been reading the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2008/12/the_zodiac.php"&gt;Congo Memoirs&lt;/a&gt;, and went out of their way to tell me that they liked them! That was nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you and thank you for the interview. I hope&lt;br&gt;
to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pleasure was all mine, and I'll see you in January!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had originally started that last sentence as "there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; some general ways," but as I tried to finish the sentence with a few examples, I wrote and deleted, wrote and deleted, wrote and deleted until I realized that I'm not entirely sure there are any at all.  There are momentary overlaps, some parents share the motivations of some professionals on some things, some professionals share the motivations of some self-advocates on some things, and so on.  Nothing global.  I'm reminded vividly of the paper on &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/professionals_parents_self-advocates_and_social_movements"&gt;professionals, parents, and self-advocates&lt;/a&gt; that broke down some of the core reasons for why the motivations of each group are so often divided or even at odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not where it ends either.  Within each group there are also conflicting motives--some professionals want different things for their clients than other professionals.  Some parents want different things for their children than other parents.  And some self-advocates want different things for themselves than other self-advocates.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking about this a lot today. Partly because I think about it always, knowing there is nothing I can post here that won't enrage someone, no matter how innocuous seeming.  But mostly because later this week I'll be attending and presenting at the &lt;a href="http://www.oregonmegaconference.org/index.html"&gt;Oregon Disability Megaconference&lt;/a&gt; which attempts to cater equally to an audience of professionals, parents, and self-advocates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second year of the Megaconference.  I missed the first year because I was at the &lt;a href="http://aaidd.org"&gt;AAIDD&lt;/a&gt; conference, presenting on something more science than advocacy.  So I'm not sure entirely what to expect.  I do know that the conference format--two or three sessions per day with long breaks in between--is like 500,000,000 times more do-able for me than the typical breakneck schedule (speaking of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/accessible_meetings"&gt;more accommodating conferences&lt;/a&gt;).  I also do know that there are a number of presentations that are explicitly for a self-advocate audience, and which are being given by (and for) self-advocates and not professionals or parents.  Which bodes well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I don't know however is how that divide will play out.  How many of those autism or child-related presentations would make me enraged?  Or pleased?  Is the presentation on "Understanding Guardianship" going to be one that addresses the issues that are important to self-advocates, or will it be highlighting those things we most adamantly oppose?  Is it even possible to create an event that is for all three audiences without falling into that divide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how much each group might educate the other, come to understand the point of view of the other, or even work on a daily basis with the other, sometimes I wonder if there might not be some good reasons for that divide. Maybe sometimes the divide should be simply respected rather than attempted to be bridged.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245781510437"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1532">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9a788236183c0842</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">TIIIP</title><published>2009-06-23T18:25:11Z</published><updated>2009-06-23T18:25:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1532" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Quoting from the new blog &lt;a href="http://translate4iran.wordpress.com/about-tiip/"&gt;The Translation and Interpretation Intitiative for Iranian Protesters&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The Translation and Interpretation Initiative for Iranian Protesters (TIIIP) is an ad hoc initiative to produce free, publication-ready translations and high-quality interpretations of the written and spoken communication streaming out of Iran in the Farsi (Persian) language in the form of e-mails, YouTube videos, Facebook entries, press releases, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work is being done at the &lt;a href="http://translate4iran.wikispaces.com/"&gt;translate4iran wiki&lt;/a&gt;. The biggest need is for people who can translate from Persian into English, but they add that&lt;/p&gt;

By offering their expertise to the filmmakers, the military brought an informed perspective that will start a unique conversation with the audience. When heroes on screen show us how it's really done, we naturally want to emulate them.  And the discovery that the cool protagonist you saw on screen did something real that you too could do, well, that gets people excited to be a part of something in which they may not have otherwise had an interest - like the military... or science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pentagon's decision to consult on TRANSFORMERS was in part an effort to advertise and glamorize military service.   Here at The Exchange, we're thrilled to see this kind of synergy because, in many ways, our mission is one-and-the same as theirs: promote recruitment and interest in our cause through mainstream media.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In TRANSFORMERS, we have a major action extravaganza that consulted with the experts to make things, bigger, faster, louder, better, and more explosive because the reality is that oftentimes fact is a wilder ride than fiction.  This film, along with many of Mr. Bay's motion pictures, makes an important statement about the value of getting things right for the screen: the glory of spectacle (and no one has mastered this art better than Bay) only grows stronger with realism.  And what better way is there to celebrate the achievements of our servicemen and women - or the most brilliant science minds on the planet - than to honor them as heroes onscreen?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/7InTpNWJ4HQ%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-4904411139846485354?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Want to make short movies? Are you also a huge physics dork?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well then, here’s your big chance: &lt;a href="http://www.atlas.ch/contest/"&gt;the folks at the ATLAS experiment at CERN are looking for you&lt;/a&gt;. They’re looking for original media that will help promote ATLAS, the biggest particle experiment being run on the Large Hadron Collider, which I &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt; guarantee will not destroy the Earth. If I thought it did, would I help them promote the idea of posting things to YouTube? Hmmm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if they like what you did better than everyone else’s efforts, they’ll fly you to CERN so you can see the place for yourself! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the idea in their own words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want you to start by showing us your communication and creative skills by producing an original short film or multimedia piece, incorporating material about ATLAS, the biggest experiment on the LHC. The best submissions will be posted on the ATLAS website and YouTube page with full credit to the author, and enter a competition for a paid internship at CERN. The winner will be offered a trip to CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, and given exclusive access to scientists working on the project as well as all the equipment and expertise in CERN’s audiovisual lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got that? If they like you best, you get to see the LHC! &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/04/22/europe-day-3-cern-the-lhc/"&gt;I was there last year&lt;/a&gt;, and let me say, it freakin’ rawks. &lt;em&gt;You want to go there&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So get your camcorder or your iPod or whatever you kids are using these days&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#lhcfootnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and make a video plugging particle physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you win, and you go to Geneva, and you go to old town early enough, and the chocolate store isn’t friggin’ closed like it was when I was there leaving me to drool on the window while mere centimeters away from hundreds of kilos of Swiss chocolate, then send me a bar or two, OK? I promise &lt;a href="http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2009/06/what-happens-if-you-feed-a-dog-chocolate-while-he-wears-a-tin-foil-hat-in-the-microwave.html"&gt;I won’t eat it in the microwave while wearing a tin foil hat&lt;/a&gt;, though a variation on that idea might make a good ATLAS video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better get started: the contest ends July 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="lhcfootnote"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Two thirds don't believe in gods at all, and &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also emerged six out of ten 10 children (59 per cent) believe that religion "has a negative influence on the world".
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The survey also shows that half of teenagers have never prayed and 16 per cent have never been to church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came to the enlightenment late, so I've been in church. Really, they aren't missing a single thing. Not one thing. Funny, isn't it; the religious insist that we need the fellowship and ritual and sermonizing, but it's all the most dreary crap and superficial 'community'.

The only problem? The first two words of the headline are obviously wrong, possibly meant to cap another article entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the story in a nutshell: a mysterious man with a St. Bernard is seen around Hingham, and one day only the dog appears, soaking wet and staring soulfully at a lake. Suspecting that the man has gone missing, the police investigate. Since no one knows who the man is, they check a local pet-friendly motel. A woman staying there says she had two visions involving the mysterious man’s demise: one in which  the cops should check the city of Quincy (near a shamrock!) and one in which they should check the woods near the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cops do not check Quincy or its shamrocks since the city is 27 square miles and a third of the population is Irish. They &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; check the woods using cadaver-seeking dogs. They find absolutely nothing.&lt;br&gt;

The only problem? The first two words of the headline are obviously wrong, possibly meant to cap another article entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the story in a nutshell: a mysterious man with a St. Bernard is seen around Hingham, and one day only the dog appears, soaking wet and staring soulfully at a lake. Suspecting that the man has gone missing, the police investigate. Since no one knows who the man is, they check a local pet-friendly motel. A woman staying there says she had two visions involving the mysterious man’s demise: one in which the cops should check the city of Quincy (near a shamrock!) and one in which they should check the woods near the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cops do not check Quincy or its shamrocks since the city is 27 square miles and a third of the population is Irish. They do check the woods using cadaver-seeking dogs. They find absolutely nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

He’s come out swinging in the science/religion debates, taking a hard line against “&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/tag/accommodationism/"&gt;accomodationism&lt;/a&gt;” — the rhetorical strategy on the part of some pro-science people and organizations to paper over conflicts between science and religion so that religious believers can be more comfortable accepting the truth of evolution and other scientific ideas.  &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/05/31/civility-and-the-new-atheists/"&gt;Chris Mooney&lt;/a&gt; and others have taken up the other side, while &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2009/06/noma-no-more-great-accommodationism.html"&gt;Russell Blackford&lt;/a&gt; and others have supported Coyne, and since electrons are free there have been an &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/06/12/the-big-accommodatinism-debate-all-relevant-posts/"&gt;awful lot of blog posts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I’d like to weigh in on the actual topic of accomodationism, and in particular on what to do about the &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/06/21/fighting-back-against-templeton/"&gt;Templeton Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.  But there is a prior question, which some of the discussion has touched on:  are science and religion actually compatible?  Clearly one’s stance on that issue will affect one’s feelings about accomodationism.  So I’d like to put my own feelings down in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and religion are not compatible.  But, before explaining what that means, we should first say what it doesn’t mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t mean, first, that there is any &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;logical&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; incompatibility between science and religion.  We shouldn’t declare them to be incompatible purely on the basis of what they are, which some people are tempted to do.  Certainly, science works on the basis of reason and evidence, while religion often appeals to faith (although reason and evidence are by no means absent).  But that just means they are different, not that they are incompatible.  (Here I am deviating somewhat from &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/06/10/rosenhouse-vs-mooney-redux-jason-is-doing-my-job-for-me/"&gt;Coyne’s take&lt;/a&gt;, as I understand it.)  An airplane is different from a car, and indeed if you want to get from Los Angeles to San Francisco you would take either an airplane or a car, not both at once.  But if you take a car and your friend takes a plane, as long as you both end up in San Francisco your journeys were perfectly compatible.  Likewise, it’s not hard to imagine an alternative universe in which science and religion were compatible — one in which religious claims about the functioning of the world were regularly verified by scientific practice.  We can easily conceive of a world in which the best scientific techniques of evidence-gathering and hypothesis-testing left us with an understanding of the workings of Nature which included the existence of God and/or other supernatural phenomena.  (St. Thomas Aquinas, were he alive today, would undoubtedly agree, as would many religious people who &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Physics-Theology-Unexpected-Kinship/dp/0300138407/"&gt;actually are alive&lt;/a&gt;.)  It’s just not the world we live in.  (That’s where they would disagree.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incompatibility between science and religion also doesn’t mean that a person can’t be religious and be a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/science/23Vatican.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss"&gt;good scientist&lt;/a&gt;.  That would be a silly claim to make, and if someone pretends that it must be what is meant by “science and religion are incompatible” you can be sure they are setting up straw men.  There is no problem at all with individual scientists holding all sorts of incorrect beliefs, including about science.  There are scientists who believe in the Steady State model of cosmology, or that HIV doesn’t cause AIDS, or that sunspots are the primary agent of climate change.  The mere fact that such positions are held by some scientists doesn’t make them good scientific positions.  We should be interested in what is correct and incorrect, and the arguments for either side, not the particular beliefs of certain individuals.  (Likewise, if science and religion were compatible, the existence of thousands of irreligious scientists wouldn’t matter either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why science and religion are actually incompatible is that, in the real world, they reach incompatible conclusions.  It’s worth noting that this incompatibility is &lt;strong&gt;perfectly evident&lt;/strong&gt; to any fair-minded person who cares to look.  Different religions make very different claims, but they typically end up saying things like “God made the universe in six days” or “Jesus died and was resurrected” or “Moses parted the red sea” or “dead souls are reincarnated in accordance with their karmic burden.”  And science says:  none of that is true.  So there you go, incompatibility.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the superficial reasonableness of a claim isn’t enough to be confident that it is true.  Science certainly teaches us that reality can be very surprising once we look at it more carefully, and it’s quite conceivable that a more nuanced understanding of the question could explain away what seems to be obviously laid out right in front of us.  We should therefore be a little more careful about understanding how exactly a compatibilist would try to reconcile science and religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, unlike the non-intuitive claims of relativity or quantum mechanics or evolution, which are forced on us by a careful confrontation with data, the purported compatibility of “science” and “religion” is simply a claim about the meaning of those two words.  The favored method of those who would claim that science and religion are compatible — really, the only method available — is to twist the definition of either “science” or “religion” well out of the form in which most people would recognize it.  Often both.&lt;/p&gt;

Aside from the somewhat corny introductions, I was impressed by the quality of Ava’s questions, which clearly showed that she had done her homework before she requested the interviews. I did not notice any comments on the blog, but the Website also features a discussion board that looked well-attended. &lt;/p&gt;

I am speaking of the &lt;a href="http://villagedogs.canmap.org/"&gt;Village Dog Project&lt;/a&gt;, some current research going on that looks very cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the evolution and domestication in dogs requires genetic analysis of a global and diverse panel of non-breed-affiliated village dogs. With a network of worldwide and Cornell-affiliated collaborators, we plan to gather dog samples from remote villages, establish a genetic archive containing DNA and phenotypic information from these dogs, carry out genetic analyses on these samples, and develop computational methods for analyzing this dataset. In particular, we are interested in understanding the location, timing, and demographic conditions underlying domestication; the genetic changes involved in the transition of wolf to dog; the relationship between these village dogs and the breed dogs; and the effect that historical forces have shaped village dog diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That looks informative and useful, and I'll be looking forward to the publication of the research. That's not what's got me envious, though: for that, you have to look at their field work. The researchers are spending the summer traveling to exotic, remote locations (admittedly, to the kinds of places rife with scavenging village dogs, but &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt;…) to collect blood samples. They have a &lt;a href="http://beak3chimps.blogspot.com/"&gt;travel blog that will be recounting their adventures&lt;/a&gt;, and also explains the science a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After initial domestication, dogs probably lived "breed-less" lives as human commensals (hanging around humans, not really helping or harming them but living off their trash) for many thousands of years. During this time, dog populations quickly expanded and spread across the globe. In the last few hundreds of years, several hundred dog breeds were formed from local dogs in many parts of the world; these breed dogs have entirely replaced the non-breed "indigenous" dogs in some parts of the world, notably in Western Europe and the USA. However, most dogs throughout the world still live their lives as non-breed, indigenous, commensal dogs. We refer to these dogs as "pariah" or "village" dogs. They tend to be smallish (25-40 pounds), often tan, short-haired dogs, though the type varies a bit according to the region you're in. The important point is that these dogs have not undergone the intense genetic bottleneck associated with breed formation. Thus, while breed dogs have only a small subset of the total genetic diversity of all dogs, it is likely that village dogs have a much greater range of the total diversity. Thus, they are very useful for looking at the original domestication event. They are informative of the original genetic bottleneck that led to the formation of domestic dogs many thousands of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm. We don't seem to have many dogs running loose around exotic, remote Morris, Minnesota, but there are a few feral cats living off the dumpsters near the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably wouldn't try to read about visiting small midwestern towns to collect cats, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/visiting_village_dogs.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Vv7GzODXb_s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245768594012"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13795">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c7d2daf6700efc51</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="contest"/><category term="Harvard"/><category term="schwag"/><title type="html">Freakonomics Quiz: Where Does the Harvard Class of 1989 Live Now?</title><published>2009-06-23T14:45:18Z</published><updated>2009-06-23T14:45:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/freakonomics-quiz-where-does-the-harvard-class-of-1989-live-now/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">I could find nine people from my class who are  famous/semi-famous/infamous.

&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;I played them a recording of the "last words" of the &lt;a href="http://www.linguistics.unimelb.edu.au/research/jiwarli/index.html"&gt;Jiwarli language of Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;.  After some questioning looks I explained that this language is now dead, and we were listening to its last speaker before he died.  As one they all looked down, shaking their heads in disbelief and saying &lt;em&gt;sorry, sorry, sorry…&lt;/em&gt;.  It was as if I told them a mutual friend had died.  They urged me to put that recording on a cassette tape so they could take it back to their village.  That way, everyone would surely understand what will happen to the Usarufa language unless there are serious attempts to revitalize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;I wasn't prepared for the intensity of their response.  Now I'm wondering if a collection of such recordings might be a useful tool in promoting language revitalization, and also in explaining the concept of language archiving.  (Thanks to Ima'o Ta'asata, James Warebu, Sivini Ikilele, and Waks Mark for their dedication to the preservation of Usarufa oral culture, and to Aaron Willems and SIL-PNG for facilitating this work.)&lt;/p&gt;
