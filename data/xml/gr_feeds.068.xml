I have a mental list of things on my reading list, but it&amp;#39;s in no particular order and occasionally, I can find other things that strike my interest. My last trip to Barnes &amp;amp; Nobles was a prime example of this. I&amp;#39;d already decided on a few books from my list when a book entitled &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Rigor-Mathematical-Breakthrough-Century/dp/015101406X/"&gt;Perfect Rigor&lt;/a&gt; by Masha Gessen caught my eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Flipping the book open to the description, it purported to be about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman"&gt;Grigory Perelman&lt;/a&gt;, the Russian mathematician who solved the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture"&gt;Poincare Conjecture&lt;/a&gt; and was thus eligible for the Millenium Prize of $1 million. But he turned it down and went into seculsion. It sounded like an interesting story, so I picked it up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story is mostly about Preleman's early life: His mother was a Jewish mathematician, his study with his math coach Rukshin, odd behaviors, oppression in the Soviet regime, graduate school, and eventual disillusionment with the mathematical community for not giving what the author suggested he thought was his due credit. However, since Perelman has gone into seclusion, the book had the be written entirely without interviewing him. Thus, it is told mainly from interviews with friends and colleagues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't tell whether it's because of this (or perhaps the author's writing style or the difficultly I have with remembering names), but the majority of the book seems to be painfully disjointed. Although it is told chronologically, there seems to be little coherence and details are included with little to no justification for doing so. I suppose the idea was to build up a reason for all of Perelman's eccentricities, but exactly how things connect is so weakly fleshed out that I'm still not certain that all of it does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The majority of the book is devoted to Perelman's childhood which is quite boring. Only in the last few chapters do we actually find Perelman working on the problem and responding to it. While I understand build up is important, it felt too tedious for too long with a sadly abbreviated climax.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, the math is almost non-existent in the book. There's a few vague analogies here and there, but in general, it's completely absent. This seemed very odd for such a book, to not even attempt to explain how Perelman solved such a monumental problem aside from saying something to the effect of "he found a way around a few blocks someone else had come up against."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, this book was a large disappointment.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-1973854607898076836?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270484719375"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=31023">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/413fac44763dbf70</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Gary Becker"/><category term="health care"/><title type="html">The Recent Health Care Bill</title><published>2010-04-05T14:47:41Z</published><updated>2010-04-05T14:47:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/05/the-recent-health-care-bill/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Levitt weighs in on health care.</summary><author><name>By STEVEN D.

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it wasn’t just emotional incontinence. He kept a large empire together in difficult times, expanded and, in many ways, improved it. It may not have been bad psychology for the people around him to fear his wrath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the rage was real, Henry’s contribution to standardising and centralising the law of his kingdom cannot be doubted. He energetically travelled miles to supervise legal proceedings, championed the use of juries and established the Royal Magistrate Courts. He also oversaw the decline in the outmoded use of trials by ordeal and combat.&lt;/p&gt;

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Maria-Jose Vinas to answer a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glad to be here! I come from Barcelona, Spain, and my relationship with science has been complicated in the past, although we're in good terms now. See, in the Spanish educational system there isn't anything similar to American colleges - after high school, you go straight into a professional school. At 18, I didn't have a clear idea of what I wanted to be in life. My mom did: she wanted her daughter to be a medical doctor. But in a rebellious outburst I decided to go to veterinary school instead (it was a pretty tame rebellion, I admit). In summary, I found out quite soon that veterinary medicine wasn't the right thing for me, but I still went ahead and graduated, and even worked as a vet for two years (in a pig farm in France, and in the lab at the Universitat AutÚnoma de Barcelona). By the time I decided to go back to school to study journalism, I had promised myself I would never, ever have anything else to do with science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="MJ Vinas pic1.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/MJ%20Vinas%20pic1.jpg" width="448" height="336" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What made you change your mind?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was already working as a reporter (in a pretty dull job) when I got a call from one of my teachers from journalism school. He was the editor-in-chief of a Sunday magazine, and he wanted to run a story on the boom of biomedical research in Barcelona during the previous 5-10 years. He remembered I was a vet, so he asked if I could write that article. I had so much fun reporting for that story! I got to talk to some of the top-notch scientists in Spain; they were bright, they were passionate about what they did, they didn't mind sitting down with me for hours to talk about their science. I then realized that although I was not meant to be a scientist (or not a vet, at least), I would never get tired of writing about science. It's the perfect subject for people with short attention spans, like me; science is always evolving, there's always something new to learn and write about. So I applied for a fellowship for graduate studies in the United States, got it, and moved to California to get a science-writing graduate degree at &lt;a href="http://scicom.ucsc.edu/SciWriting.html" title=""&gt;UC Santa Cruz.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a two-year fellowship, so I spread one year of classes over two years and doubled the internships. I did six half-time internships (at the SETI podcast, "&lt;a href="http://radio.seti.org/" title=""&gt;Are we alone?&lt;/a&gt;" -- I loved the experience so much!--, two at &lt;a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/" title=""&gt;local&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.thecalifornian.com/" title=""&gt;newspapers&lt;/a&gt;, two at &lt;a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/" title=""&gt;press&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://today.slac.stanford.edu/" title=""&gt;offices&lt;/a&gt;, and one in a &lt;a href="http://www.seastudios.com/" title=""&gt;film-production company&lt;/a&gt;) and a final, full-time summer internship at &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/" title=""&gt;The Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/a&gt;. I needed a lot of practice, since I wasn't only changing reporting fields, I was also switching to a foreign language. In October 2008, I got my first job as a science writer/press officer for the &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/" title=""&gt;American Geophysical Union&lt;/a&gt;, the largest association of Earth and space scientists. It's been a blast: working for AGU, I get to write about a very wide array of sciences, and organize press conferences at big meetings. Plus, our scientists are some of the coolest around (may I say geoscientists rock?) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="MJ Vinas pic2.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/MJ%20Vinas%20pic2.jpg" width="448" height="303" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I have three fledgling projects. One is managing and expanding AGU's social media presence. Another is creating a collection of blogs for AGU. And finally, I started teaching science communication workshops at scientific meetings some months ago and loved the experience, so now I would like to expand my reach with online training materials, and a blog dedicated to science communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm glad you ask! I created a &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/AmericanGeophysicalUnion" title=""&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; for AGU about a year ago that now has over 2,800 fans. I also manage the AGU &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/theAGU" title=""&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, though I must admit that I didn't create one &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mjvinas" title=""&gt;for myself&lt;/a&gt; until I attended ScienceOnline2010. What do I get from social media? You see, I'm in a curious situation as a press officer at AGU; my scientists are based in hundreds of research institutions in many countries. The only chance I get to see them is at meetings, and everybody's super busy at conferences. So the AGU social networks allow me to interact a bit more with the scientists, even if it's only with a very small fraction of them (AGU has around 58,000 members). Social networks also allow me to find researchers who're interested in science outreach, and to learn about and then share interesting news on Earth and space science.  In addition to that, I network and chat with other science writers through my personal Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And about the blogs: we currently have three blogs up and running, one on the science presented at AGU &lt;a href="http://blog.agu.org/meetings" title=""&gt;meetings&lt;/a&gt;, another one on &lt;a href="http://blog.agu.org/meetings" title=""&gt;geohazards&lt;/a&gt;, and finally, my pet project: &lt;a href="http://blog.agu.org/sciencecommunication/" title=""&gt;The Plainspoken Scientist&lt;/a&gt;, a blog on science communication for scientists. This topic fascinates me, and I'll use the blog to make a case for science outreach, to showcase researchers who are already doing a great job in communicating their science to the public, and to provide tips and a discussion forum on how make science more appealing to everybody. In the near (I hope) future, we will be taking guest contributions from veteran geobloggers, and also using the blogs as a training ground for researchers who would like to communicate their science to the public, but don't have much experience yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="MJ Vinas pic3.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/MJ%20Vinas%20pic3.jpg" width="448" height="336" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any cool science blogs by the participants at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered science blogs about four years ago, and now I have dozens of blog feeds in my Google Reader, including quite a few geoblogs. Two of my favorites are &lt;a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/" title=""&gt;Dot Earth&lt;/a&gt; and CJR's &lt;a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/" title=""&gt;The Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. I'm also addicted to reading posts about science communication and climate change communication, no matter the blog they come from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than helping me discover cool new blogs, ScienceOnline2010 helped me discover cool new tweeters that I now follow, such as you (@BoraZ), @j_timmer, @cliftonwiens, @oystersgarter, and many more. When you guys tweet about good blog posts, I go read them. It's a fantastic referral service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 was how energizing it was to be surrounded by such smart, motivated science communicators. I went back to work all fired up and determined to expand the scope of the AGU blogs project (until then we had only blogged during one scientific meeting) and specifically, to launch my new blog on science communication.

Edited by S. Holly Stocking, it’s an anthology that can stand on its own, or serve as reading for a journalism class. Here’s a description of the book from the publisher’s web site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science writing poses specific challenges: Science writers must  engage their audiences while also explaining unfamiliar scientific  concepts and processes. Further, they must illuminate arcane research  methods and statistics and at the same time cope with scientific  ignorance and uncertainty. Stocking’s volume not only tackles these  challenges, but also includes extraordinary breadth in story selection,  from prize-winning narratives, profiles and explanatory pieces to  accounts of scientific meetings and new discoveries, Q&amp;amp;A’s,  traditional trend and issue stories, reviews, essays and blog posts.  These Times exemplars, together with Stocking’s guide to reading stories  about science and technology, are perfect for science writers who  aspire to diversify and hone their reporting and writing skills in a  changing media climate. Holly Stocking is an experienced science writer,  award-winning teacher, and a fellow of the American Association for the  Advancement of Science.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can order it &lt;a href="http://www.cqpress.com/product/NYT-Science.html"&gt;from CQ Press&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1604264810?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1604264810"&gt;Amazon page&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it wasn’t just emotional incontinence. He kept a large empire together in difficult times, expanded and, in many ways, improved it. It may not have been bad psychology for the people around him to fear his wrath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the rage was real, Henry’s contribution to standardising and centralising the law of his kingdom cannot be doubted. He energetically travelled miles to supervise legal proceedings, championed the use of juries and established the Royal Magistrate Courts. He also oversaw the decline in the outmoded use of trials by ordeal and combat.&lt;/p&gt;

He is defending the proposition that the evolution/creation controversy is not a conflict between science and religion [&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-zimmerman/redefining-the-creationev_b_484691.html"&gt;Redefining The Creation/Evolution Controversy&lt;/a&gt;]. Your task is to identify the logical flaw(s) in this argument. For the purposes of this test, we're not interested in who's right and who's wrong in the Accommodationist Wars. I'm just interested in knowing whether you can recognize a good argument and a bad one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;The mere existence of the Clergy Letter Project, an international organization I founded that is comprised of thousands of clergy members and scientists, demonstrates that religious leaders and scientists are not inherently at odds. After all, more than 12,400 Christian clergy members from all across the United States have signed the Christian Clergy Letter, a powerful, two-paragraph statement promoting a shared understanding and acceptance of evolution and Christianity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What could be clearer than these sentences from that Letter? "Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth. Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts[...]. We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge. We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion, two very different, but complementary, forms of truth." &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://www.mnscience.org/index.php?id=27"&gt;Michael Zimmerman&lt;/a&gt; is an ecologist at Butler University in Indiana (USA).

As it was quite a success and I expected the number of entries to double (I was right about that), I decided to invite each year a different person - a blogger and a friend - to act as guest editor. Thus, the 2007 book was edited by Reed Cartwright, the 2008 one by Jennifer Rohn and the 2009 book by SciCurious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure you are all waiting with baited breath for me to announce the editor of the 2010 edition, the person who will design the judging method, invite judges, organize the Table Of Contents, make decisions about the design and 'look' of the book deal with everything else that may pop up during the process. We'll work together on making the next book better than ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://spitzer.caltech.edu/uploaded_files/images/0005/4713/sig10-003.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/Spitzer_orion.jpg" alt="Spitzer_orion" title="Spitzer_orion" width="589" height="332"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, what beauty! This picture shows the famous Orion nebula, one of the galaxy’s largest and most active star forming gas clouds. Spitzer is an infrared telescope, so blue here depicts light at 3.6 microns, roughly 5 times the wavelength your eye can see, and red/orange is 4.5 microns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on about the ethereal beauty of this image, about how we can actually see stars forming here, about why there are streamers and shock waves that sculpt this vast light-years long structure.  But you can find me expositing at length on all those topics in other posts about other nebulae. That’s not the point I want to make here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first saw the image, the email from JPL had the subject line &amp;quot;Colony of Young Stars Shines in New Spitzer Image&amp;quot;, so I didn’t know what nebula it was showing. I simply clicked the link, and the image above popped up. I smiled when I saw it because of its beauty, at least at first. But after a moment I was puzzled. The nebula looked familiar, but for a brief moment I couldn’t place it. Then I focused my attention on the big cloud on the left, and my mind snapped into clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2006/01/image/a/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/hst_m42.jpg" alt="hst_m42" title="hst_m42" width="300" height="362"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Any amateur astronomer on this planet can identify the picture at the left in a heartbeat. That’s an optical picture of the Orion nebula, one taken using visible light (&lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2006/01/"&gt;the picture is by Hubble&lt;/a&gt;; click it to get more info and access to much, &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; larger versions). I’ve rotated the picture to match the one from Spitzer; you can see the same curved shock front going across the lower left corner, and the round comma-shaped cloud with a star near its center to the right. While the Hubble image is far more detailed (and colorful!) than what you see through an eyepiece, it still strongly resembles the view through a good telescope. But the Spitzer image…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever met up unexpectedly with a friend you haven’t seen in five years? Maybe they grew a beard, or lost weight, or dyed their hair, or changed their clothing style. It’s the same person, clearly, but somehow &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. It takes a second to recognize them, and when you do, it’s a bit of a jolt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly how I felt when I saw the Spitzer image (and like many an astronomer, I consider Orion an old friend). Spitzer’s image is just a little bit into the infrared, enough that details are different while the overall shape and features are the same. I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; it was my old friend, but it took me a moment to recognize its face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in many ways, like seeing that acquaintance after a few years, there were new things to learn, new ways to experience our friendship. The stars in the Spitzer image that are in the narrow bridge between the two halves of the nebula seem a bit more vibrant, a bit more obvious… as they should, since they are young stars in the throes of birth, and veiled substantially by dust. More stars overall are apparent in the image, since fainter ones can shine through the dust in the infrared, while their light is blocked by that dust in the visible. The streamers in the infrared image are more vivid, but the dust features less so, again as expected, but still somehow new and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my travels I do happen to run across friends I haven’t seen in many years, and when I have time to actually sit and chat, I’m delighted when they have grown and done things they have previously not experienced. It brings a new side of them to light for me, lets me see them in a new way and appreciate them all the more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is true on Earth as it is in the heavens. There are so many things to see in and above this world, and so many ways to see them! New eyes, new perspectives, new ways of seeing… it makes me always eager to find out what’s next, and to cherish what we already know.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270479636135"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/647f45ecd5a25dab</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Quackery at Temple...?</title><published>2010-04-05T14:26:57Z</published><updated>2010-04-05T14:26:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/931-quackery-at-temple.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, March 25, 2010, Temple University announced — in &lt;em&gt;Temple Today&lt;/em&gt;, their daily e-mail posting to keep staff, faculty, students, alumni and friends of the University abreast of Temple news — the official advent of Medical Acupuncture as an accepted therapy now to be offered at Temple University’s hospital. Sanford M. Sorkin, Faculty Chair of the Advisory Board of Temple University, wrote to Temple president Dr. Ann Weaver Hart and to Dr. John M. Daly, Temple’s Dean of the University Medical School, regarding this announcement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement in Temple Today that the university hospital is introducing an acupuncture practice is very distressing.  The pretense that this is a viable modality in light of all of the evidence to the contrary is inconceivable.  Including this material in the Temple wide distribution gives the impression that the university supports pseudo-science and wants to spread its message to the widest audience possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am suggesting that an apology be sent to everyone through Temple Today for suggesting that they would be foolish enough to consider acupuncture, and warn them that that there are absolutely no medical conditions that will benefit more from acupuncture than scientific evidence-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ask the doctor who has studied this to produce the literature that supports the practice. When the NIH was asked to produce the material recently by James Randi, they accumulated approximately 307 studies (&lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/../"&gt;www.randi.org&lt;/a&gt;).  If you eliminate the studies that do not mention acupuncture and were not double-blinded, I believe you are left with about seven studies.  And only one of those hinted at the possibility of efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information on the latest study, and its flaws, can be found on Science-Based medicine, (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4065"&gt;http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4065&lt;/a&gt;). And &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/"&gt;www.quackwatch.org&lt;/a&gt; has extensive information on acupuncture. From that site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;"Chinese medicine," often called "Oriental medicine" or "traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)," encompasses a vast array of folk medical practices based on mysticism. It holds that the body's vital energy (chi or qi) circulates through channels, called meridians, that have branches connected to bodily organs and functions. Illness is attributed to imbalance or interruption of chi. Ancient practices such as acupuncture, Qigong, and the use of various herbs are claimed to restore balance.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Temple prepared to face the world and say we believe in mysticism and are willing to ignore science?  Please take action now and stop this foolishness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Sorkin, an instructor at Temple, has not yet received any response to his letter, nor has any apology appeared in &lt;em&gt;Temple Today&lt;/em&gt;. He further wrote to Hart and Daly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that Temple will take the challenge and either brings the million dollars to our hospital and medical school, or conversely, recognizes that we are doing a tremendous disservice to our community and the university by indulging in a pseudo-science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am curious as to the justification for offering acupuncture at our hospital. And it bothers me that this may be the open door for homeopathy, therapeutic touch, and so many other modalities rejected by evidence-based medicine. Please apply for the challenge and do not abandon your commitment to science, medicine and patient care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would very much appreciate being notified of your decision regarding the challenge, as I believe this situation requires attention until it is resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll keep our readers informed on this matter…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

For the opening event I have chosen Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.  I will speak on the Brown campus at 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday night next week, April 13, in the Metcalf Chemistry Building Auditorium at 190-194 Thayer Street.  Admission is free, and Language Log readers get a 30% discount off that.  Be there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The lecture is designed to be accessible and enjoyable for almost anyone with an interest in the English language — except perhaps for people who want to tell me that they revere &lt;i&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/i&gt; because it's such a nice little book and helped them so much with their writing when they were in college that they carry it everywhere they go and give it to all their students or hand a copy to each new employee that they hire for their company yadda yadda yadda.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hoped originally to stoke up the crowd to a huge outburst of anger against &lt;i&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/i&gt; and end the evening with a cathartic mass burning of copies of the book, everyone setting fire to copies they had brought with them and holding them aloft like a candles, waving them so that embers of flaming nonsense like "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000469.html"&gt;Write with nouns and verbs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; scatter through the air like precious twinkling sparks of wisdom and truth…  But I am told that the fire marshals for the Metcalf Chemistry Building have ruled that out in no uncertain terms.  They are not happy about the courtyard bonfire idea, either.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another idea I had was that everyone would strip naked in a symbolic throwing off of prescriptivist strictures, a return to the naked innocence of using the language as it is rather than as a pair of misinformed old authoritarians once wanted it to be…  But it turns out that they already do that at Brown in the various undergraduate libraries, during the celebrated &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University_traditions#Naked_Donut_Run"&gt;naked donut run&lt;/a&gt; every semester, so this would be absolutely nothing new.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event now planned, therefore, is likely to be quite safe despite the huge crowds expected, and fit for family TV news viewing.  (The networks are a little disappointed; their location crews had been making plans for coverage of either a major blaze or a lot of titillating pixelized shots of public nudity.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown University, the 7th to be founded in America, was the first to accept students regardless of their religious faith. That element of tolerance is important when you are going to speak out against a book that many people seem to regard as a sacred text.  Brown is also the university where it was first proposed that computer-searchable corpora of text would one day be important for linguistic investigation — for finding out what the language is actually like so you don&amp;#39;t have to go by the unfiltered prejudices that dopey old coots stuff into their cockamamie usage books.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Longman group now own the rights to the current (4th) edition of &lt;i&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/i&gt;.  I hope the rumors I have heard about them capitalizing on my campaign by setting up a book display in the lobby of the Metcalf Building are untrue.  You wouldn't believe how tiring it is kicking over tables of books.  I want to reserve my energy for giving the lecture.  See you there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

It was our documentation of the death of science journalism, and the failure of science on the web to fill the gap, and we are honored to have it featured among the year's collected essays. Here's an excerpt:
In light of the media upheaval, scientists can no longer assume that a responsible, high-minded press will treat their ideas with the seriousness they deserve, delivering them to policy-makers and the public for sober consideration. Instead, partisan media will convey diametrically opposed versions of where science actually stands on any contentious subject--consider, for example, the difference between how Fox News and NPR cover climate change--even as most of the public (and many policy-makers) will tune out science more or less completely, besieged by other information options.

That's the media reality we live with, and facing it head-on is necessary not only for scientists but for everyone who cares about the impact of science and good information on public ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/4s14o3slbqnbbtt5h00bhpgldc/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fintersection%2F2010%2F04%2F05%2Fwere-going-to-be-in-the-best-american-science-writing-2010%2F" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>The Intersection</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270479203252"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=173229">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c341529bfbd49f93</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="baby names"/><category term="bob geldof"/><category term="celebrity baby names"/><category term="edy's ice cream"/><category term="Fifi Trixibell"/><category term="Parenting"/><category term="Rob Morrow"/><category term="Tu Morrow"/><category term="worst baby names"/><title type="html">Parenting: Why the Hell Can't We Name Our Baby?</title><published>2010-04-05T14:04:41Z</published><updated>2010-04-05T14:04:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/why-the-hell-cant-we-name-our-baby/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="width:238px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/wenn2057531.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="wenn2057531" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/wenn2057531-228x300.jpg" alt="" width="228" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor Rob Morrow with daughter Tu Morrow (photo: WENN.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, there have been a few Blisstree posts about baby names (&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/what-not-to-name-your-kid/"&gt;What Not to Name Your Kid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/poll-of-the-day-crowdsourcing-your-kids-name/"&gt;Crowdsourcing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/bad-baby-names-child-abuse/"&gt;Bad Baby Names&lt;/a&gt;), and, given my own sordid baby-naming history, I have to join the conversation. Seven years ago, we gave our very sweet little girl a very wrong name. Okay, so it wasn’t Tu Morrow (born of Rob Morrow) or Fifi Trixibell (born of Bob Geldof). In fact, there was nothing inherently wrong with the name itself. It was pretty actually. (Just please don’t make me say it). But it was wrong. Wrong. Wrong. And so we changed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is, we had been pretty smug about our baby-naming skills. While some insist that whatever name you choose, a child will grow into it, as a kid I couldn’t even name a kitten or a puppy unless I thought the moniker suited the monikee’s cute little face and personality perfectly. (Full disclosure: my pets’ names included Howard Spitz, Ashley Roachclip and Orangey.) I couldn’t fathom naming my first born without a face-to-face, so we went into the hospital with a working list and saved the final choice for when we met him. And from the minute our little boy was born, both my husband and I knew exactly who he was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter: my second born. Squalling and utterly unfamiliar, our little girl’s determined baby self would have nothing to do with the names on our list. Annie, Olive, Sadie, Daisy – they all slid right off her. We argued. We stressed. I obsessed with friends on the phone. We even asked nurses (note: &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; ask nurses) and called an acquaintance who had written a popular baby-naming book. Nothing. But the hospital insisted we couldn’t leave until we gave her a name, so we pulled one out of thin air. Don’t do what we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Be Bullied!&lt;/strong&gt; I later found out that if you don’t name your kid by the time you leave the maternity ward, they just put ‘baby girl’ or ‘infant’ on the birth certificate. And (at least in New York) that’s no big deal – if we’d just waited, giving our girl a name would have been as simple as filling out and mailing in a “correction” form. But doing an actual name change took months of paperwork and trips to the courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the Name Slides Off, Let It.&lt;/strong&gt; My husband and I called our girl Skitch, which fit her beautifully in those first colicky weeks. It allowed us to sort of ignore her real name, but we knew we were in trouble when we were irritated every time my mother-in-law used it. Finally, we got up the guts to let friends and family know that maybe we hadn’t gotten it right and that the topic was off-limits. That gave us the space to get to know her a bit better, see if another name popped up – or if the one she had might stop sounding like sandpaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Brave.&lt;/strong&gt; The weeks or months or however the hell long it took us to finally name our kid seemed like an eternity. It was torture; we were ribbed and ridiculed. A few people were quick to tell us that the old name was &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;. And we carried around a weird sense of shame for a while. &lt;em&gt;Why couldn’t we name our own kid?&lt;/em&gt; But seven years later, it seems as fleeting as sleep deprivation and labor – and definitely worth the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait For It.&lt;/strong&gt; You’re pretty curious by now, right? Her title came to us in a flash one day when we saw an Edy’s ice cream truck while driving. “Edie!” my husband yelled. “That’s it!” I yelled back. “What’s what?!” yelled my three-year-old from his car seat. Edie just slept. We didn’t really name her after ice cream, but that truck did remind us of a noble, strong, slightly idiosyncratic name worn by some pretty great women. We officially made her name Eden (on many tree-hugging lists, but we love it less for its hippie quality and more for its biblical, early-settler feeling), and to this day both name and nickname fit her to a tee. Even she thinks so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll see how she feels when she’s thirteen.&lt;/p&gt;

(see pictures and coverage, e.g., &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/04/eurotrip_08_trieste_part_i.php" title=""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/04/eurotrip_08_trieste_part_ii.php" title=""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/04/eurotrip_08_trieste_part_iii.php" title=""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/04/eurotrip_08_trieste_the_open_a_1.php" title=""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/eurotrip_08/" title=""&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;). Now nixed by Berlusconi who has other priorities than science, the FEST was one of the most exciting and famous science and technology events in the world. Sad that FEST is no more (at least temporarily), I am happy that a similar event will be held right here in the USA - the &lt;a href="http://www.usasciencefestival.org/" title=""&gt;USA Science &amp;amp; Engineering Festival&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Inaugural USA Science &amp;amp; Engineering Festival will be the country&amp;#39;s first national science festival and will descend on the Washington, D.C. area in the Fall of 2010. The Festival promises to be the ultimate multi-cultural, multi-generational and multi-disciplinary celebration of science in the United States. The culmination of the Festival will be a two-day Expo in the nation&amp;#39;s capital that will give over 500 science &amp;amp; engineering organizations from all over the United States the opportunity to present themselves with a hands-on, fun science activity to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The festival will take place over two weeks, from October 10th till 24th, 2010, while the Expo on the National Mall will be on October 23th and 24th, 2010. It is organized by Larry Bock who organized a similar (and very successful) event in San Diego last year. You should read the &lt;a href="http://www.usasciencefestival.org/images/files/press_releases/Press%20Release%202_17_2010%20short%20versionwithlink.pdf" title=""&gt;press release (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; about it for more detail as well as look around the &lt;a href="http://www.usasciencefestival.org/" title=""&gt;USA Science &amp;amp; Engineering Festival website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be &lt;a href="http://www.usasciencefestival.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=73&amp;amp;Itemid=76" title=""&gt;satellite events&lt;/a&gt; in many, many places in the USA. I am still a little confused, but there will be both a North Carolina Science Festival and the Triangle Science Festival with, I guess, some degree of coordination between the two. It's early, but I may get involved with one or both of these, at least reporting from the events on this blog and the &lt;a href="http://scienceinthetriangle.org/" title=""&gt;Science In The Triangle&lt;/a&gt; site and blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I can get involved in some aspect of the main event in D.C. Perhaps there may be a Science Communication Expo as a part of it at some date, where people and organizations can showcase both traditional and cutting-edge efforts in science publishing, communication, popularization and education, from Open Access online-only journals, to science blogging networks, social networking, new cool software, to more traditional magazines and books (books were a huge part of the Trieste FEST).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading to the event itself, there will be a number of events and contest. Perhaps you can enter the &lt;a href="http://www.usasciencefestival.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=92:kavli-science-video-contest&amp;amp;catid=43&amp;amp;Itemid=102" title=""&gt;Kavli Science Video Contest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.usasciencefestival.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=88:rubikstournament&amp;amp;catid=43&amp;amp;Itemid=93" title=""&gt;You CAN do the Rubik's Cube Tournament&lt;/a&gt; (more info &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/usasciencefestival/2010/03/learning_to_do_the_rubiks_cube.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and many more will be unveiled over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll keep you posted as I get more information. But in the meantime, you should follow the Festival on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=46922645272&amp;amp;ref=ts" title=""&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=90792&amp;amp;trk=hb_side_g" title=""&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/USAScienceFest" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, as well as on the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/usasciencefestival/" title=""&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; (yes, hosted here on scienceblogs.com).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/usa_science_engineering_festiv.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/LglWnpBjj7U" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270475926509"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=7719">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/109fa48c563050e7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Miscellaneous"/><title type="html">Dow 11,000?</title><published>2010-04-05T13:58:39Z</published><updated>2010-04-05T13:58:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/04/05/dow-11000/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">It's possible we may get there today, or soon as the recovery continues.

&lt;p&gt;Description: What is a sellable idea? How do you develop one? Is your idea enough for a book, is there more you can do to develop it, or should it just be a magazine article or series of blog posts? This will be a hands-on nuts and bolts workshop: Come with ideas to pitch. Better yet, bring a &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; (1 page or less) written proposal to read and workshop. This workshop will provide handouts on proposal writing as well as sample proposals you can use to help develop your own in the future.

The story was that of a Belgian man named &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/another_contender_for_the_worst_reportin.php"&gt;Rom Houben&lt;/a&gt;, who had been unfortunate enough to have been in a motor vehicle collision and suffered serious brain injury. That brain injury left him in a comatose state, which had been diagnosed as a persistent vegetative state. What brought him worldwide prominence was a claim by neurologist Steven Laureys that he was not in a persistent vegetative state at all, but was rather fully conscious and "locked in," meaning that he could see, hear, and feel everything but could not move any part of his body. Unfortunately, part of the methodology by which Dr. Laureys came to this conclusion was through the woo known as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/02/update_on_the_case_of_coma_man_rom_hoube.php"&gt;facilitated communication&lt;/a&gt;. It was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/02/belgian_skeptics_showing_the_world_that.php"&gt;recently definitively shown&lt;/a&gt; (once again) that Houben was not communicating through facilitated communication, but the concept of being "locked in" both fascinates and horrifies me. I have a hard time imagining a worse fate, and stories of the locked-in hold a special fascination for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why I was disturbed to find out about a woman in Toronto named Alda Byers who is definitely locked in and has resulted in yet another round of bad reporting, which renders the tragedy even more hard to take. The case of Alda Byers involves what is likely (but not certainly) quackery coupled with a number of thorny ethical issues that are hinted at, but barely touched upon, in a story by Michele Mandel entitled &lt;a href="http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2010/04/03/13456206-qmi.html"&gt;Trapped in her own body, docs won't help: Woman denied stem cell treatment that offered hope&lt;/a&gt;. The title alone was painful to read because it paints the doctors who won't help Byers pursue stem cell woo as being heartless and blocking her from her last chance at a cure from her horrific state.&lt;/p&gt;

Because I host a skeptical podcast and contribute to  several skeptical blogs, it cannot be avoided. &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/archive/podcastinfo.aspx?mid=1&amp;amp;pid=246"&gt;This  week’s episode of the SGU&lt;/a&gt; featured Eugenie Scott as a guest rogue,  and the question of skepticism and religion came up. And, as predictably  as the dawn follows the night, the old debate sparked up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genie  takes a position very similar to my own – that science is agnostic  toward untestable claims. Science follows methodological naturalism, and  anything outside this realm is by necessity outside the realm of  science. It’s not a choice so much as a philosophical/logical position.  (I will call this the “agnostic” position for simplicity.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think many people are confused when we discuss this  topic, especially since we often refer to “religion,” which can create  the false impression that we think science cannot address any claims  that fall under “religion” – it may, depending on what those claims  are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="More..." src="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Science is a Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I  think the primary confusion stems from this – defining science vs  religion as a set of beliefs vs a set of methods or processes. A  commenter on the SGU forums represents this confusion well when they  write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“…what the hell kind of skeptic movement  would give an approving nod to  the theist saying ‘I’m a skeptic–I  won’t believe in ghosts without good  evidence, …unless they’re holy  ghosts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His comment focuses entirely on the beliefs  themselves, but the agnostic position is about method not beliefs. It is  absolutely not about ghosts vs holy ghosts – it is about methodological  naturalism (science) vs faith (not necessarily religion). Any belief  which is structured in such a way that it is positioned outside the  realm of methodological naturalism by definition cannot be examined by  the methods of science. In short, this usually means that the beliefs  cannot be empirically tested in any conceivable way. One can therefore  not have scientific knowledge of such claims, and science can only be  agnostic toward them. Any belief in untestable claims is therefore by  definition faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of the beliefs, however, does not  matter – it does not matter if they are part of a mainstream religion, a  cult belief, a new age belief, or just a quirky personal belief. If  someone believes in untestable ghosts, or ESP, or bigfoot, or whatever –  they have positioned those claims outside the realm of science. This,  of course, is Sagan’s invisible floating heatless dragon – creating a  belief that cannot be tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important, in my opinion, for  skeptics to be crystal clear on this point, because often the purveyors  of pseudoscience will try to evade falsification or the negative  effects of evidence on their claims by positioning the claim outside of  science. At that point the skeptic must acknowledge that science can no  longer demonstrate that the claim is likely to be false, but rather the  claim is no longer scientific and can only be an article of faith. You  can believe in the kind of bigfeet that are immune to all scientific  investigation, but then you have to also stop claiming to have evidence  for this bigfoot, or that you are doing science. Belief in bigfoot has  become a tenet of your faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Religion is More than Faith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often  in this discussion we may use the term “religion” to refer to  faith-based beliefs. I actually try to avoid it, because it is  confusing. The fact is – religions routinely make fact-based claims.  They intrude upon science on a regular basis, and whenever they step  into the arena of science, they are absolutely fair game. No one I know  denies this, and any regular reader of this blog, or listener of the  SGU, knows that we will address head on any scientific claim, no matter  its source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, whenever we state that science cannot  address “faith” (beliefs that are outside the realm of science), this is  commonly misconstrued to mean that it cannot address any claims of  “religion,” which is not true and not the “agnostic” position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religions  are multifarious – they often contain tenets of faith (the ultimate  meaning of things), claims about history and the nature of reality, a  source of cultural identity, and a code of morality. Freedom of (and  from) religion means that people have a right to any tenets of faith  they choose, they have a right to their own moral code (within limits,  of course), and they also have a right to frame their personal and group  identity how they wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People do not, however, have a right to  their own facts. So when religions make claims about history or the  nature of the material world, they are within the purview of science.  Religions should not dictate to science, to limit its scope or its  conclusions. It is also logically invalid to claim that faith is an  appropriate approach to factual claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philosophical  Naturalism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many proponents of philosophical  naturalism within the skeptical movement  – the position that the  material world that science can investigate is not only all that we can  know but that it is all that there is. I am personally a philosophical  naturalist, in that I do not “believe” in anything outside the natural  world, but I do not think that science (and by extension skepticism) is  dependent upon philosophical naturalism. Science, as I stated, can only  be agnostic toward any notions outside the grasp of its methods – such  beliefs are unknowable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable from a philosophical  point of view to conclude that there is no reason to believe in anything  unknowable. All such beliefs are by necessity arbitrary, and most  people end up believing whatever is taught to them by their parents and  culture. So again, I agree with the position of philosophical  naturalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it has to be acknowledged that some people can  and do accept and practice methodological naturalism and simultaneously  maintain personal articles of faith for questions outside the realm of  science. There is nothing inherently inconsistent in this position, and  largely I find it difficult to care (as long as that faith does not also  intrude upon science nor is used to justify a malignant morality).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skepticism  and Religion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a tangential issue, which is often  conflated with the philosophical issues I discussed above – what should  be the strategic approach of the skeptical movement toward religion and  the religious? While this issue often garners the most heated debate,  this is mostly a personal choice and not something which can be  objectively resolved. It is part of the reason why the skeptical  movement is a loose collection of individuals and organizations, and not  one cohesive whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal approach is to focus on science,  which includes tackling any religious claims that intrude upon science.  Genie Scott took this position as well in our discussion. But there are  others who also wish to promote philosophical naturalism or atheism. I  have no problem with this – everyone can do as they wish, and as I said  the skeptical movement is very much a bottom up spontaneous movement  without any top-down control or organization. I do not pretend to have  the “one true way” of skepticism, only my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do feel (and  this is just a feeling) that the skeptical movement is most effective  when we are clear about the boundaries of science and the nature of  science vs faith vs religion. I prefer to give people critical thinking  skills and a love for science, and not worry about their faith. It is  also quite possible (again, this is only my bias, as I do not have any  solid evidence to back it up) that you will lead more people away from  faith by this approach than by tackling their faith head on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And  again, this is my personal approach but I do not presume to dictate to  other skeptics what they should do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genie Scott brought up the  point that the skeptical movement will only limit its reach if it  defines itself as, by necessity, including only non-believers. There are  many good skeptics who also choose to be theists, and they should not  feel excluded. Of course, as I said there is no card-issuing skeptical  organization. This has more to do with the culture of skepticism – how  we make people feel, not about any imposed rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should  also be pointed out that there are sister movements (atheism, humanism)  that do tackle faith and the other aspects of religion. These movements  include many people with expertise and interest in these areas. So part  of my approach is a matter of specialization. However, whenever I say  this some people conclude that I am saying it is all about  specialization or strategy. It is not – as I discussed extensively  above, it is about clarity of philosophy, logic, and definition, which  also happens to be in line with what I think is an effective approach  and how much of the skeptical movement is already organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This  issue is an enduring point of heated discussion among skeptics. It has  remained so for the last 15 years that I have been part of the skeptical  movement, and those who have been at this longer than I have tell me it  goes back as far as they can remember also. I think it is a healthy and  very useful discussion for us to have, and I have resigned myself to the  fact that I will have to endlessly clarify my own position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But  each time I do I try to get better at focusing on the real issues and  illuminating the source of any confusion or disagreements. I hope this  latest attempt at the issue has been useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The take-home point  of this post is to understand that the “agnostic” position is about the  difference between science and faith as differing methods, not about the  paranormal and religion as different belief systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270472200894"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2234">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c6b5638959698d61</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and culture"/><title type="html">Explanatory Neurophilia ≅ Physics Envy?</title><published>2010-04-05T12:44:19Z</published><updated>2010-04-05T12:44:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2234" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Weinberg wrote to suggest that perhaps "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1378"&gt;explanatory neurophilia&lt;/a&gt;" (the fact that people tend to be impressed and persuaded by neuroscientific details even if they provide no explanatory value) is part of a larger phenomenon that also includes "&lt;a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/2010/04/04/lets-get-physical/"&gt;physics envy&lt;/a&gt;" (the desire to achieve in other sciences the success of mathematical reasoning from first principles that Newton brought to physics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cited post by DougJ at Balloon Juice suggests the relationship explicitly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;There’s a more general science envy in the nexus of finance, social science, and media. In a few weeks, Bobo Brooks will come out with a book purporting to be about neuroscience which will in fact be a bunch of pop psychology about how conservatives are right about everything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has certainly been a recurring theme in David Brooks' columns over the past few years (see "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/003246.html"&gt;David Brooks, Cognitive Neuroscientist&lt;/a&gt;", 6/12/2006; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/003586.html"&gt;David Brooks, Neuroendocrinologist&lt;/a&gt;", 9/17/2006; "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=478"&gt;David Brooks, Social Psychologist&lt;/a&gt;", 8/13/2008; "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1305"&gt;An inquiry concerning the principles of morals"&lt;/a&gt;, 4/7/2009), but if he&amp;#39;s got a book on this topic coming out, you can&amp;#39;t pre-order it on amazon yet…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting back to the "explanatory neurophilia ≅ physics envy" idea, it seems to me that there are some analogies but also some striking differences. The research of Weisberg et al. on "&lt;a href="http://www.yale.edu/cogdevlab/People/Lab_Members/Frank/aarticles/The%20Seductive%20Allure.pdf"&gt;The Seductive Allure of Neuroscience Explanations&lt;/a&gt;" suggests that logically irrelevant neuroscience impresses novices and outsiders, but not experts. In contrast, Lo and Mueller &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.2688v3"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; that the seductive allure of irrelevant but interesting mathematics has distorted the judgment of the most highly-regarded economists and financial analysts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who are interested in the sociology of economics (about which I obviously know very little), I recommend Deirdre McCloskey's &lt;a href="http://www.prickly-paradigm.com/paradigm4.pdf"&gt;The Secret Sins of Economics&lt;/a&gt; (summary and discussion &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001455.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in any area of rational inquiry, the best advice comes from &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001554.html"&gt;Dick Hamming&lt;/a&gt;: "Beware of finding what you're looking for".&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270471796841"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=173216">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1e572621f6bc4f67</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="carbon dioxide emissions"/><category term="cars"/><category term="do it with ZERO emissions"/><category term="electric cars"/><category term="emissions"/><category term="journey to zero"/><category term="Nissan"/><category term="Nissan LEAF"/><category term="Richard Saul Wurman"/><category term="TED"/><title type="html">Photo of the Day: No Cars, or Just Nissan Cars?</title><published>2010-04-05T12:33:15Z</published><updated>2010-04-05T12:33:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/photo-of-the-day-no-cars-or-nissan-cars/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This eye-catching ad campaign in New York City seems to be urging consumers to ditch their cars, but the slick “&lt;a href="http://journey-to-zero.com/"&gt;Journey to Zero&lt;/a&gt;” campaign is actually put on by Nissan.

Because I host a skeptical podcast and contribute to several skeptical blogs, it cannot be avoided. &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/archive/podcastinfo.aspx?mid=1&amp;amp;pid=246"&gt;This week’s episode of the SGU&lt;/a&gt; featured Eugenie Scott as a guest rogue, and the question of skepticism and religion came up. And, as predictably as the dawn follows the night, the old debate sparked up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genie takes a position very similar to my own – that science is agnostic toward untestable claims. Science follows methodological naturalism, and anything outside this realm is by necessity outside the realm of science. It’s not a choice so much as a philosophical/logical position. (I will call this the “agnostic” position for simplicity.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think many people are confused when we discuss this topic, especially since we often refer to “religion,” which can create the false impression that we think science cannot address any claims that fall under “religion” – it may, depending on what those claims are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science is a Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the primary confusion stems from this – defining science vs religion as a set of beliefs vs a set of methods or processes. A commenter on the SGU forums represents this confusion well when they write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“…what the hell kind of skeptic movement would give an approving nod to  the theist saying ‘I’m a skeptic–I won’t believe in ghosts without good  evidence, …unless they’re holy ghosts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His comment focuses entirely on the beliefs themselves, but the agnostic position is about method not beliefs. It is absolutely not about ghosts vs holy ghosts – it is about methodological naturalism (science) vs faith (not necessarily religion). Any belief which is structured in such a way that it is positioned outside the realm of methodological naturalism by definition cannot be examined by the methods of science. In short, this usually means that the beliefs cannot be empirically tested in any conceivable way. One can therefore not have scientific knowledge of such claims, and science can only be agnostic toward them. Any belief in untestable claims is therefore by definition faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of the beliefs, however, does not matter – it does not matter if they are part of a mainstream religion, a cult belief, a new age belief, or just a quirky personal belief. If someone believes in untestable ghosts, or ESP, or bigfoot, or whatever – they have positioned those claims outside the realm of science. This, of course, is Sagan’s invisible floating heatless dragon – creating a belief that cannot be tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important, in my opinion, for skeptics to be crystal clear on this point, because often the purveyors of pseudoscience will try to evade falsification or the negative effects of evidence on their claims by positioning the claim outside of science. At that point the skeptic must acknowledge that science can no longer demonstrate that the claim is likely to be false, but rather the claim is no longer scientific and can only be an article of faith. You can believe in the kind of bigfeet that are immune to all scientific investigation, but then you have to also stop claiming to have evidence for this bigfoot, or that you are doing science. Belief in bigfoot has become a tenet of your faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Religion is More than Faith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often in this discussion we may use the term “religion” to refer to faith-based beliefs. I actually try to avoid it, because it is confusing. The fact is – religions routinely make fact-based claims. They intrude upon science on a regular basis, and whenever they step into the arena of science, they are absolutely fair game. No one I know denies this, and any regular reader of this blog, or listener of the SGU, knows that we will address head on any scientific claim, no matter its source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, whenever we state that science cannot address “faith” (beliefs that are outside the realm of science), this is commonly misconstrued to mean that it cannot address any claims of “religion,” which is not true and not the “agnostic” position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religions are multifarious – they often contain tenets of faith (the ultimate meaning of things), claims about history and the nature of reality, a source of cultural identity, and a code of morality. Freedom of (and from) religion means that people have a right to any tenets of faith they choose, they have a right to their own moral code (within limits, of course), and they also have a right to frame their personal and group identity how they wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People do not, however, have a right to their own facts. So when religions make claims about history or the nature of the material world, they are within the purview of science. Religions should not dictate to science, to limit its scope or its conclusions. It is also logically invalid to claim that faith is an appropriate approach to factual claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philosophical Naturalism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many proponents of philosophical naturalism within the skeptical movement  – the position that the material world that science can investigate is not only all that we can know but that it is all that there is. I am personally a philosophical naturalist, in that I do not “believe” in anything outside the natural world, but I do not think that science (and by extension skepticism) is dependent upon philosophical naturalism. Science, as I stated, can only be agnostic toward any notions outside the grasp of its methods – such beliefs are unknowable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable from a philosophical point of view to conclude that there is no reason to believe in anything unknowable. All such beliefs are by necessity arbitrary, and most people end up believing whatever is taught to them by their parents and culture. So again, I agree with the position of philosophical naturalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it has to be acknowledged that some people can and do accept and practice methodological naturalism and simultaneously maintain personal articles of faith for questions outside the realm of science. There is nothing inherently inconsistent in this position, and largely I find it difficult to care (as long as that faith does not also intrude upon science nor is used to justify a malignant morality).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skepticism and Religion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a tangential issue, which is often conflated with the philosophical issues I discussed above – what should be the strategic approach of the skeptical movement toward religion and the religious? While this issue often garners the most heated debate, this is mostly a personal choice and not something which can be objectively resolved. It is part of the reason why the skeptical movement is a loose collection of individuals and organizations, and not one cohesive whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal approach is to focus on science, which includes tackling any religious claims that intrude upon science. Genie Scott took this position as well in our discussion. But there are others who also wish to promote philosophical naturalism or atheism. I have no problem with this – everyone can do as they wish, and as I said the skeptical movement is very much a bottom up spontaneous movement without any top-down control or organization. I do not pretend to have the “one true way” of skepticism, only my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do feel (and this is just a feeling) that the skeptical movement is most effective when we are clear about the boundaries of science and the nature of science vs faith vs religion. I prefer to give people critical thinking skills and a love for science, and not worry about their faith. It is also quite possible (again, this is only my bias, as I do not have any solid evidence to back it up) that you will lead more people away from faith by this approach than by tackling their faith head on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, this is my personal approach but I do not presume to dictate to other skeptics what they should do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genie Scott brought up the point that the skeptical movement will only limit its reach if it defines itself as, by necessity, including only non-believers. There are many good skeptics who also choose to be theists, and they should not feel excluded. Of course, as I said there is no card-issuing skeptical organization. This has more to do with the culture of skepticism – how we make people feel, not about any imposed rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should also be pointed out that there are sister movements (atheism, humanism) that do tackle faith and the other aspects of religion. These movements include many people with expertise and interest in these areas. So part of my approach is a matter of specialization. However, whenever I say this some people conclude that I am saying it is all about specialization or strategy. It is not – as I discussed extensively above, it is about clarity of philosophy, logic, and definition, which also happens to be in line with what I think is an effective approach and how much of the skeptical movement is already organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue is an enduring point of heated discussion among skeptics. It has remained so for the last 15 years that I have been part of the skeptical movement, and those who have been at this longer than I have tell me it goes back as far as they can remember also. I think it is a healthy and very useful discussion for us to have, and I have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to endlessly clarify my own position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Easter Saturday, many Swedish kids receive candy-filled cardboard eggs. Mine have to jump through a lot of hoops to get theirs. Often I have made paper trails around the house, "Under yellow table", "Inside broom closet", "In Dad's rubber boot". Then increasingly (as Junior grew) I have obfuscated the clues by swapping Ö for all vowels, writing them backwards or writing them in English. Sometimes I've prepared GPS-based outdoor egg hunts. And that's what Juniorette faced this year, without any help from her older brother who was with his mom. She found the egg soon enough, once she had learned to look at her surroundings, not fixedly at the arrow on the GPS unit. And right beside the egg's hiding place was a club-house ruin - or at least a poorly kept club house that was used last summer and hasn't wintered well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/04/easter_egg_hunt_and_club-house.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/B05pq5eubD0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270469678124"><id gr:original-id="http://holfordwatch.info/?p=4904">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ca1e872a3a5f2f13</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Science: So What?

Your first two years were probably spent in classrooms and small-group labs discussing anatomy, pharmacology, pathology, etc.Then BAM! You are thrown into the deep end of the pool. You are now on a clinical team of medical professionals taking care of actual patients!Some students fare better than others during this abrupt transition period. This commentary in Academic Medicine provides a framework to help students adapt to this change, by understanding adult learning literature. Specifically, the authors review the concept of Kolb&amp;#39;s learning cycle.Kolb initially proposed that learning occurs in a 4-stage cycle. This consists of:Concrete Experience (experiencing an event)Reflective Observation (reflection on that concrete experience)Abstract Conceptualization (generation of new approach or style based on reflection)Active Experimentation (test the new approach or style in reality)The authors of this article propose a 5-stage modified Kolb cycle to adapt to the new challenges of the clinical years of medical school:Prepare for the clinical settingExperience the clinical settingReflect on the experienceConceptualize new approachesTesting new approaches1. Preparing for the Clinical SettingAs a student, identify what your roles and responsibilities are on the team. The clerkship director should tell you this, but if not, seek out the answer. What should your presentations be like for new and established patients? Do you write notes in the chart, and if so, what is the format preferred?Remember to do no harm. As a student, be sure not to give definitive answers to patients or families if you are not sure of the answers. Tell them that you will find out the answer. Also, do not perform procedures with which you are unfamiliar. Let the resident or attending know that you are uncomfortable with the new procedure and would like to observe at this time.2. Experiencing the Clinical SettingKeep a log of patient encounters, framed within goals and objectives in the medical school curriculum. Such objectives might include: communication with a consultant, dealing with a difficult patient, practicing cost-effective medicine when deciding on prescribing discharge medications. Learning should be driven by the student. Read more about conditions or symptoms from your patient encounters. For me personally, I retain information more when it&amp;#39;s contextually based.Share what you have learned by teaching your fellow team members. Teaching reinforces what you&amp;#39;ve learned. Move beyond &amp;quot;reporter&amp;quot; status. Medical students are traditionally perceived as data gatherers. Go one step further and think about a broad differential diagnosis list, based on your gathered data, without prompting from your resident or attending.Build collaborative relationships with your team members. In team-based clinical work, it is crucial to understand the importance of collaboration. Unit secretaries, mid-level providers, nurses, and other professionals in the health care system are all part of the greater team.Set a high professionalism standard. Sometimes students may witness unprofessional behavior. Think about how you would have handled the scenario differently, so that you don&amp;#39;t fall into that trap in the future. Emulate those who exhibit humanistic behavior towards their patients and colleagues.Develop habits that promote mental health and physical and social well-being.3. Reflecting on ExperienceA critical component in the &amp;quot;learning cycle&amp;quot; is the reflective piece. For self-reflection to improve your learning, seek out frequent feedback on how you are performing from residents and faculty. Be specific in what you are seeking feedback on -- &amp;quot;Can you tell me how I did in taking this patient&amp;#39;s history?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Any feedback about my venipuncture procedure?&amp;quot;During your reflection of your clerkship experiences, think about what you like and don&amp;#39;t like about that specialty. Start developing a pros/cons list of factors which will play into your decision-making about selecting a career choice. Clearly, the specialty of Emergency Medicine is the best, but I suppose I&amp;#39;ll let you come to that decision yourself.4 and 5. Conceptualizing and Testing New Approaches Based on self-reflection, think of how you might improve upon yourself or what you are doing. This might be how you approach a difficult patient, how you ask sensitive questions, troubleshooting a procedure, or present your differential diagnosis list.Test your new approaches.Repeat as new experiences arise.ReferenceGreenberg L, &amp;amp; Blatt B (2010).

And now they are here in Delhi for the final rounds of their work.Lets here from them their experiences for the DAY1.Hey, We (PSGians) landed here at the Nizamuddin Station with hand full of luggages that we can hardly carry. Mr. Sukhbir received us with a big smile and with a weird sense of direction! We finally reached IGIB Guest House. After lunch with Sukhbir and Deeksha, we went to IGIB lab, where we met our Guide, Dr. Vinod Scaria. Dr. Zakir Thomas gave us a visit. He even sneaked at Suresh's work and gave him a shock (Suresh didn't know that he was talking to ZT)! Anyway, we finally ended at the conference room with a room full of scientists and "kids" (Thats how they called us!). After surviving the questions that were bombarded at us, we got to continue our work! We returned to our rooms late at night, to a much awaited cosy bed and looking forward to tomorrow's dawn!Sunday!!! Hurray... Its a holiday... I guess not! :( We worked! Dipon and Vivek joined us for lunch and ever since, they are stuck with us! Since it was Easter, Shamini (Sham), Dipon, Suresh and Myself went on a road trip to St. Sacred Heart Cathedral with Mr. Saurabh, late in the evening. We pushed cars (boys did this exercise and VS helped too!), jumped on the autorickshaw (which got punctured) and even trended on our footwear. We roamed the streets of Delhi to find Palika Market and we finally found a bottle of water (Bisleri Bottle)! Open Central Park was crowded but we had the time to relish our bottle of water! We found kids dancing MJ's moves on the road, woman washing her clothes, Delhi band playing some tune and the calm trees shadowing the streets at night. We got on the Metro, saw Hanuman Mandir and returned back to IGIB. Poor Deepa, Karthi and Vivek. They were stuck with small notebooks and annotation work. Dont worry, they'll get their due credit (I hope!)....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that C-SPAN now has their entire archive online, this was one of the first things I searched for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They won’t let me embed it, but here’s the &lt;a href="http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/159474-1"&gt;link to the video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never seen a debate on this topic, this is a fantastic one to start with.  Keyes recites the usual Christian soundbytes and Dershowitz (also using typical points) knocks him down left and right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite bit, coming from Dershowitz, in a particularly passionate moment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Organized religion is always having to say you’re sorry for misunderstanding God’s will in the past.  That has been the history of organized religions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’re sorry for the Crusades.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re sorry that we slaughtered babies and children in the name of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re sorry for the Inquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re sorry for the pogroms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were wrong then.  God didn’t speak to us clearly then.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he speaks to us clearly today!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have some time (two hours), it’s worthwhile to watch the whole thing.  If you don’t have that time, just watch the Dershowitz bits.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the intensity and the back and forth in the second half of the video.  And take special note of Dershowitz’s statement at the 30:10 mark, made a full year before 9/11.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

will normally be value judgments not statements of fact;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- matters "&lt;em&gt;concerned with the establishment of dependable generalisations about cause and effect&lt;/em&gt;" include but are not limited to scientific debates;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- accordingly Simon's statement "&lt;em&gt;not a jot of evidence&lt;/em&gt;" must be a value judgment, and not a statement of fact which he has to justify;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- it follows that Simon's use of "&lt;em&gt;bogus&lt;/em&gt;" and "&lt;em&gt;happily&lt;/em&gt;" were aspects of this value judgment;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- the meaning of the words complained of is therefore that the BCA was promoting what Simon contends are bogus treatments without regard to the want of reliable evidence of their efficacy;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- it was not open to Mr Justice Eady to equate "&lt;em&gt;happily&lt;/em&gt;" with &lt;em&gt;dishonestly&lt;/em&gt; - the word instead meant &lt;em&gt;blithely&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- accordingly Simon has the defence of fair comment or "&lt;em&gt;honest opinion&lt;/em&gt;", which can be rebutted by the BCA proving he was acting maliciously; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- the wonderful &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2010/04/that-easterbrook-quote-on-scientific.html"&gt;Easterbrook quotation&lt;/a&gt; and the references to Orwell and Milton merely add emphasis to the importance of treating scientific contentions as value judgments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA now has to decide whether to apply to the Supreme Court (formerly the House of Lords); if the BCA does not, then the case returns to the High Court and can proceed to trial (though there is an outstanding issue as to whether the BCA as a company limited by guarantee (rather than one owned by shareholders) can even sue for libel).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published;

(Hint, hint.) However, what that means is that I was away Thursday and Friday; between the trip and the various family gatherings I didn’t have time for one of my usual 4,000 word screeds of fresh material. However, there is something I’ve been meaning to discuss on SBM, and it’s perfect for SBM. Fortunately, I did write something about it elsewhere three years ago. This seems like the perfect time to spiff it up, update it, and republish it. In doing so, I found myself writing far more than I had expected, making it a lot more different from the old post than I had expected, but I guess that’s just me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the hunt for new bloggers goes on, with some promising results. If we haven’t gotten back to you yet (namely most of you), please be patient. This meeting and the holiday–not to mention my real life job–have interfered with that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The continuum of surgical research in science-based medicine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things about science-based medicine that makes it so fascinating is that it encompasses such a wide variety of modalities that it takes a similarly wide variety of science and scientific techniques to investigate various diseases. Some medical disciplines consist of mainly of problems that are relatively straightforward to study. Don’t get me wrong, though. By “straightforward,” I don’t mean that they’re easy, simply that the experimental design of a clinical trial to test a treatment is fairly easily encompassed by the paradigm of randomized clinical trials. Medical oncology is just one example, where new drugs can be tested in randomized, double-blinded trials against or in addition to the standard of care without having to account for many difficulties that arise from difficulties blinding. We’ve discussed such difficulties before, for instance, in the context of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?cat=8"&gt;constructing adequate placebos for acupuncture trials&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, this topic is critical to the application of science-based medicine to various “complementary and alternative medicine” modalities, which do not as easily lend themselves to randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials, although I would hasten to point out that, just because it can be very difficult to do such trials is not an excuse for not doing them. The development of various “sham acupuncture” controls, one of which consisted even of just twirling a toothpick gently poked onto the skin, shows that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area of medicine where it is difficult to construct randomized controlled trials is surgery. The reasons are multiple. For one thing, it’s virtually impossible to blind the person doing the surgery to what he or she is doing. One way around that would be to have the surgeons who do the operations not be involved with the postoperative care of the patients at all, while the postoperative team doesn’t know which operation the patient actually got. However, most surgeons would consider this not only undesirable, but downright unethical. At least, I would. Another problem comes when the surgeries are sufficiently different that it is impossible to hide from the patient which operation he got. Moreover, surgery itself has a powerful placebo effect, as has been shown time and time again. Even so, surgical trials are very important and produce important results. For instance, I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=665"&gt;wrote about two trials&lt;/a&gt; for vertebral kyphoplasty for ostoporotic fractures, both of which produced negative results showing kyphoplasty to be no better than placebo. Some surgical trials have been critical to defining a science-based approach to how we treat patients, such as trials showing that survival rates are the same in breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and radiation therapy as they are when the treatment is mastectomy. Still, surgery is a set of disciplines where applying science-based medicine is arguably not as straightforward as it is in many specialties. At times, applying science-based medicine to it can be nearly as difficult as it is to do for various CAM modalities, mainly because of the difficulties in blinding. That’s why I’m always fascinated by strategies by which we as surgeons try to make our discipline more science-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, I attended a rather fascinating session sponsored by the &lt;a href="http://www.susweb.org/"&gt;Society of University Surgeons&lt;/a&gt; on surgical research issues involving bioethics and institutional review boards. I realize that there are those out there, particularly on the medical side of things, who with a sneer will refer to the term “surgical research” as an oxymoron, but, trust me on this, there are a lot of surgeons out there trying to do scientifically rigorous studies within the bounds of their discipline to advance the art and science of surgery, all for the good of their patients. (OK, there’s also glory to be had, but the primary motivation still usually boils down to wanting to do good for our patients, with the glory being a secondary motivation.) One other aspect of surgery, besides the ones that I just mentioned, is that surgery is just as much a craft as it is a science. How a surgeon ties knots, where he places the incision and how large he makes it, how he puts together two ends of bowel so that they don’t leak, all of these things are examples where the skill of the individual surgeon matters as much as the scientific validity of what operation the individual surgeon is performing. Surgical research differs from research carried out in medical specialties in that it is much more difficult to standardize operations; placebo controls (i.e., sham operations) are rarely ethically acceptable; and double blind studies are in essence impossible, because the operator will always know what he did and blinding the patient to what was done is similarly impossible without doing sham operations. Moreover, new surgical procedures have a learning curve, such that they may seem less desirable early on in their development but their benefits become apparent the more practice surgeons have at them and as more surgeons learn how to do them well. All of these factors tend to make surgical research, I would argue, in many ways more difficult than medical research, particularly research comparing drug treatments, where double blinding is possible and placebo controls can often be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One  commonly accepted definition of research is found in &lt;a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/phs398/instructions2/p2_human_subjects_definitions.htm"&gt;federal regulations&lt;/a&gt; about human subject research: “Research means a systematic investigation, including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalized knowledge.” Innovative surgery is often not systematic. Rather, it is designed to benefit individual patients; there is often no intent to publish the surgical series at a later time, or such intent is secondary. In reality, many, if not most, advances in surgery don’t come from careful controlled trials (at least not at first), and the topic of the conference was how to decide when alterations in an established surgical procedure constitute what was referred to as “tinkering” and when they constitute an “innovation,” which is more substantive (more on this later). And when does a surgeon cross the line from tinkering into innovation into actual human subjects research, anyway? These are actually pretty tough questions, with a lot of complexities involved, and the main impetus for the SUS to undertake a project to try to write guidelines about these issues, the preliminary draft of which were presented at the session I atteneded, was as a pre-emptive strike: To do it first before the government steps in and does it in its typically ham-fisted manner. Also, a lot of this tinkering and innovation go on outside the confines of academic medical centers, out in the “real” world of private practice surgeons. The end result was a position statement published in 2008 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American College of Surgeons&lt;/em&gt; entitled, appropriately enough, &lt;a href="http://www.journalacs.org/article/S1072-7515(08)00188-9"&gt;Responsible Development and Application of Surgical Innovations: A Position Statement of the Society of University Surgeons&lt;/a&gt;. It begins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field of surgery has a unique culture and rich tradition of innovation. Surgeons are trained to perform continuous situational assessment, decision analysis, and improvisation, in preparation for the challenges and creativity required by nearly every clinical case. Indeed, as Riskin and colleagues point out, “most surgeons innovate on a daily basis, tailoring therapies and operations to the intrinsic uniqueness of every patient and their disease.” In addition, unsolved problems and repetitive failures—or at least suboptimal outcomes—stimulate surgeons to strive for a better way to address challenging surgical problems. Consequently, the practice of surgery is steeped in innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, development of new drugs and medical devices is closely monitored by the federal government. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates biologics, devices, and drugs by reviewing their safety and efficacy for a given indication before granting approval for marketing and distribution. The labeling (package insert) summarizes what the FDA has deemed the safe and effective use of the product, and “off-label” use of a product, although allowed, may be subject to regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such oversight does not necessarily extend to surgical innovations. The surgical innovator has historically been allowed to “tinker” with procedures, introducing modifications of varying degrees to the point that a procedure could arguably be called new. In fact, there are numerous examples of such innovations currently in clinical use, most notably, the myriad variations of minimally invasive procedures. Rapidly advancing technology offers the surgeon a steady stream of opportunities to innovate, and this is encouraged by the incentive to publish or present novel approaches, the need to attract new patient referrals, and the innate desire to improve the quality of care delivered by one’s profession. But there are currently no formal regulations that apply to surgical innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the gap between regulatory goals and professional reality is widening. With the importance of ensuring patient safety, it is clear that surgical innovation can no longer enjoy its unmonitored status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgical innovation in itself is not problematic. Indeed, a safer, more effective, or less morbid procedure would have a direct and favorable impact on patients. The absence of any organized oversight or mechanism to protect patients from becoming unwitting research subjects is, however, problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients may be harmed by innovations that are less effective or more dangerous than expected. More than a decade ago, Roy and colleagues observed, “When large numbers of innovative treatments are being continuously introduced into clinical practice, rigorous testing is mandatory for the protection of individual patients and the just use of limited resources. This holds true with even greater force in light of the evidence that many innovations show no advantage over existing treatments when they are subjected to properly controlled study.” Concerns about inadequate testing of operations have led to increasing calls for vigilance to prevent cavalier innovations and to ensure scientific evaluation of new procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last paragraph tells what is so problematic about much surgical “innovation.” For example, as I’ve mentioned before, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, laparoscopic cholecystomy rapidly replaced the open cholecystectomy as the standard of care for gallbladder disease requiring surgical intervention. It did so not based on randomized clinical trials showing it to be superior (or at least not inferior) to the prior “gold standard” operation, but rather because the technology was sexy and it was very satistfying (not to mention attractive to patients) to be able to remove a gallbladder while leaving only a few tiny scars and at the same time being able to send the patient home the same day or the next day, compared to a several-day hospital stay. In essence, marketing won out before science, and science has played catch up ever since. Older surgeons had to learn the new technique or watch their bread-and-butter cases be referred to surgeons who could do the new technique. Moreover, in the early days of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, it was documented that the rate of common bile duct injuries was considerably higher than for the old operation. Given that common bile duct injuries can be devastating, even to the point of leading to liver failure, and that they can require huge operations to repair, sometimes with unsatisfactory results, this was not a problem to dismiss lightly. These days, the rate of common bile duct injury for laparoscopic cholecystectomy is very low, but in the “learning curve” phase of the adoption of the procedure it was not and it is arguably still somewhat higher than it was “in the old days” before laparoscopic cholecystectomy. I’ve also written about &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=56"&gt;other examples&lt;/a&gt; of surgical procedures that spread like wildfire before they had been adequately proven through clinical trials. The aforementioned kyphoplasty for ostoporotic vertebral fractures is an example of just such a procedure, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there is a gradation between a modification of an old procedure and a whole new procedure. I’ll illustrate with an example. &lt;a href="http://surgeonsblog.blogspot.com/2007/01/mini-me.html"&gt;Sid Schwab&lt;/a&gt; described a perfect example of tinkering by a private surgeon when he told how, over time, he developed a “mini-cholecystectomy.” (This was before the days of laparoscopic cholecystectomies.) There was no clinical trial to test his hypothesis that he could do a cholecystectomy through a smaller incision. He just did it, confident that he could always make the incision bigger if he was struggling too much. (It’s an axiom in surgery that you can always make the incision bigger, but you can’t make it smaller.) Clearly this qualifies as “tinkering”; i.e., the minor modification of a surgical procedure that does not produce a reasonable expectation of increased risk to the patient. Of course, if Dr. Schwab were too much of a “cowboy” to admit when he couldn’t do the operation using a the smaller incision and started getting into trouble because he couldn’t see or get his instruments in there adequately, you could imagine that this tinkering might have the potential to cause harm. But Dr. Schwab is a prudent and skilled surgeon; it’s reasonable to trust that his judgment is good and that he’ll do the right thing and make the incision bigger if he finds himself struggling too much. Lots of procedures have been improved by such tinkering, and, in fact, often such tinkering is simply a reflection on the skill of the surgeon; for example, one of my partners can do a right colectomy through what to me is an amazingly small incision, while other surgeons use much bigger incisions to do the same operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, it was widely agreed that there is generally no need for IRB involvement when tinkering with surgical procedures, as long as informed consent is given or, if the operation was done emergently, the patient is informed afterwards what was done. In practice, though, I can see this as a bit problematic. Consider Sid in the example above. Suppose he went up to his patient and said, “I’m going to do your cholecystectomy, but I’m going to do it a little different. I’m going to use a small incision. It means I might struggle a bit and the operation may take a little longer, but I can always open wider if I have to.” Most patients wouldn’t object, but many would ask: “How much smaller?” A reasonable question. If the incision is only, say, 5% smaller than the usual incision, would it be necessary to tell the patient? After all, only Sid would know for sure that it was smaller than his usual incision. Other surgeons might make that size incision just from their own training, and even Sid, unless he measures all of his incisions to the millimeter, probably varies his incision size by as much as 5% from patient to patient just in the normal scope of his practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is innovation? Innovation differs from research in that it is a change in therapy designed to benefit an individual, whereas research is a study according to protocol in which the goal is to gain knowledge, not necessarily to benefit the individual being treated. As the &lt;a href="http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html"&gt;Belmont Report&lt;/a&gt;, the basis of all human subjects research regulations in the U.S. states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the term “research’ designates an activity designed to test an hypothesis, permit conclusions to be drawn, and thereby to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge (expressed, for example, in theories, principles, and statements of relationships). Research is usually described in a formal protocol that sets forth an objective and a set of procedures designed to reach that objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a clinician departs in a significant way from standard or accepted practice, the innovation does not, in and of itself, constitute research. The fact that a procedure is “experimental,” in the sense of new, untested or different, does not automatically place it in the category of research. Radically new procedures of this description should, however, be made the object of formal research at an early stage in order to determine whether they are safe and effective. Thus, it is the responsibility of medical practice committees, for example, to insist that a major innovation be incorporated into a formal research project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position statement recommends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgical Innovations Requiring Formal Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the innovation is planned, AND:&lt;br&gt;
The surgeon seeks to confirm a hunch or theory about the innovation;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innovation differs significantly from currently accepted local practice;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outcomes of the innovation have not been previously described;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innovation entails potential risks for complications;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific or additional patient consent appears appropriate,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) The described review by a local surgical innovations committee is required, plus&lt;br&gt;
b) submission to the national innovations registry is required, and&lt;br&gt;
c) additional informed consent is required of the patient specific to the nature of the proposed innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendations also state that such innovations must comply with FDA and NIH regulations and that informed consent must be obtained, except in the case of emergency surgery, in which case the patient must be informed afterwards, in the case of “unanticipated innovation.” (Of course, one surgeon’s “unanticipated innovation” is another surgeon’s “surgical misadventure.”) It was also recommended that, if all possible, such innovations should be tried out first in an animal before being performed on humans. A further recommendation that was discussed at the SUS meeting but apparently didn’t make its way into the final draft was the creation of a “national innovations registry,” to which surgeons could report their attempted innovations and how they worked. This would be particularly important because most innovations do not work, and some even cause harm. If a surgeon is thinking of trying a new innovation, it would be useful if that surgeon could consult a database to see if someone had tried it before. After all, what’s the first thing we scientists do when considering embarking on a new research project? We hit the scientific literature, of course, to see if anyone has done anything like what we’re thinking of doing before! Scientists have PubMed; many, if not most, innovations, particularly the ones that don’t work, are never published in the peer-reviewed literature. The final recommendation was that “innovation review committtees” be set up to review attempts at surgical innovations. These would tend to be &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; committees based on the specific case and far more informal than an institutional review board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the distinction between tinkering and innovation (and, for that matter, research) is artificial, and definitely somewhat arbitrary. It all really exists as a continuum. Consider the example of Dr. Schwab’s “minicholecystectomy” again. It’s really a remarkable story of how a surgical procedure, in the hands of a skilled surgeon, evolved over time. Simply by trying to decrease the size of the incision in a systematic fashion, Dr. Schwab ultimately ended up changing his practice. He started using a headlight, special instruments, and a different surgical technique to get the gallbladder out. Ultimately, his consistent tinkering led to innovation, and, I daresay, had it not been for the sudden advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, the mini-cholecystectomy  that he and others developed would likely have propagated far and wide among surgeons and become the preferred technique for removing gallbladders. In terms of the scientific method, tinkering could be looked at as the stage of hypothesis generation, while innovation could be considered preliminary testing and refining of the hypothesis. The actual research is then the stage where the refined hypothesis is subjected to rigorous testing in a highly controlled, protocolized manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, laparosocopic cholecystectomy (LC) is a great example of an innovation that rather got ahead of itself. The potential benefits of the procedure in terms of decreased hospital stay, decreased postoperative pain, and faster return to work were obvious and quickly recognized. However, this procedure, perhaps more than any other, reveals some of the pitfalls in surgical innovation. For one thing, it revealed the effects of marketing and patient demand. Surgeons who learned how to do LCs in those heady early days advertised it heavily, and patients came to see the new procedure as obviously superior to the old before there was much comparative data on complication rates. They started to demand it, and more and more surgeons felt obligated to learn it even before the data from research (formal definition) was all in, lest their patients go elsewhere and their referring physicians abandon them. Eventually, as the research was finally done, it became apparent that there was a considerably higher rate of common bile duct injuries in LC compared to the old method. Granted, it was still a very small number, but the number was nearly ten times smaller still using the boring, old-fashioned open approach to taking gallbladders out, and common bile duct injuries can be devastating, requiring large operations to repair. In the end, it was fairly clear that the benefits outweighed the larger (albeit still very small) risk of common bile duct injuries with LC, but by the time that information was known the procedure had almost entirely supplanted the older procedure. There was no chance to weigh the risk-benefit ratio of LC in anything approaching a calm, measured fashion before introducing the procedure; the analysis was all done after the “cat was out of the bag,” so to speak. Ironically, Sid’s mini-cholecystectomy produced similar good results in his hand to LC; maybe it would have been a better, albeit less sexy, alternative, although it’s always possible that there were complications that would only become apparent if thousands of patients were studied. That’s why innovation needs to be accompanied by research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many problems in considering innovations and research, not the least of which are issues of liability. As one surgeon at the session three years ago asked: “When does ‘innovation’ plus bad outcome equal departure from the standard of care?” The answer was not that encouraging. Innovation by definition is departure from the standard of care, and in the case of a bad outcome it can be a big problem. Surgical innovation committees can ameliorate this problem somewhat by giving cover to the surgeon, as can rigorous informed consent, but clearly in this litigious age the threat of being sued will have a chilling effect on innovation that even these measures may not forestall. Another issue is the composition of these committees. In academic centers, finding the expertise is usually not that big of a problem, but what about in community settings, where either the expertise is lacking or the potential members of such a committee would often be riddled with conflicts of interest, given that potential members would tend to be either partners of or competitors with the surgeon involved? Finally, there is the issue of intellectual property, particularly in the case of devices, even simple ones. Surgeons will be reluctant to share their ideas in a database if they are thinking of patenting them, although it was pointed out that it’s fairly easy to protect one’s idea beforehand by filing a preliminary patent application. And, of course, we must remember that, as much as we hate to admit it, surgeons are human too. Not all of them can always be counted on to act based primarily on what they perceive to be the best interests of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line, regardless, is that academic surgeons are going to have to get used to more oversight. Vigorous self-regulation would be the best option if we can pull it off. Gone are the days of the “Wild West,” where “cowboy” surgeons could try whatever innovative idea that caught their fancy. Although many bemoan this new oversight and worry that it will quash surgical innovation, that need not be so if surgeons, rather than the government, act to codify how we distinguish between “tinkering,” innovation, and research and require the level of oversight appropriate to each: IRBs for research and something formalized, but less rigorous, for innovation. Unfortunately, since the SUS guidelines were published in 2008, I haven’t seen much evidence of their having been widely adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, what I have seen that is very encouraging is the &lt;a href="https://www.acosog.org/"&gt;American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG)&lt;/a&gt;. Two weeks ago, I attended the Academy of Surgery of Detroit meeting at which Dr. Mitchell Posner, who ran the training program at the University of Chicago when I was a fellow there, presented data on the latest ACOSOG trials. What was most impressive was the effort to which ACOSOG goes to standardize cancer operations rigorously between surgeons. ACOSOG requires surgeons to present videotapes of their operation in order to make sure that the technique is correct and that a surgically adequate resection was performed. In essence, ACOSOG is trying to make surgical trials as close to a randomized, double-blind trial as possible and to remove as many sources of inter-surgeon variation in skill and technique as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, as much as we try to make it a science, surgery can never escape the fact that, by its very nature, it is also a craft. Surgeon skill matters when it comes to patient outcome, and there are often as many ways of throwing a stitch or tying a knot as there are surgeons. Unfortunately, IRBs, as currently constituted, are not sufficiently flexible to take into account tinkering versus innovation versus research. While it is probably not possible to test various new tinkerings or innovations rigorously, it is possible to be a lot more rigorous about overseeing them, preferably before the fact but at least after the fact. Such oversight is increasingly critical as &lt;a href="http://www.rmgh.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=840:responsible-surgical-innovation-natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes&amp;amp;catid=39:rmgh-news&amp;amp;Itemid=100017"&gt;“natural orifice” surgery&lt;/a&gt; now breathes down the neck of laparoscopic surgery as the “latest and greatest” fad in surgery. It is also possible to standardize operations as much as possible for purposes of clinical trials. All of these are important developments in the quest to make “surgical science” cease to sound like an oxymoron.&lt;/p&gt;

The ground track for this launch will make it visible well up the East Coast of the US, so if you’re awake at that time, you may see Discovery to your southeast as a bright light moving rapidly across the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can follow the launch on &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/launch_blog.html"&gt;the NASA Launch Blog&lt;/a&gt;, or watch it live on &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/ntv"&gt;NASA TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

That video, titled &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4G7z2LZ3Pw"&gt;HOMEOPATHY: Jew of  Nazi Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the most hilariously vitriolic and delusional videos you’re likely to ever see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2010/04/04/is-john-benneth-the-lewis-black-of-the-crank-world/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/F4G7z2LZ3Pw/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that video &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4524"&gt;pales in comparison to Benneth’s latest video&lt;/a&gt;, which one would swear was an April Fools joke if Benneth didnt’ have a history of supporting homeopathy. This new attack on Steven Novella, titled “Yale’s Nigger Homeopathy” may be the funniest piece of unintentional comedy I’ve seen this year with Benneth’s almost Lewis Black style ranting (minus Black’s intellect and actual wit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t want to oversell it so judge for yourselves:&lt;/p&gt;

I kinda liked the idea of standing up, unrolling a giant poster and asking, &amp;quot;Which one of these formulas is the Schrödinger Equation?&amp;quot;  That&amp;#39;s not so hard a question; I mean, even &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9qYF9DZPdw"&gt;Weird Al Yankovic&lt;/a&gt; would stand a decent chance.  But that would probably just get me booted by his Blackwater guards as that most odious of things, a person educated in science.

He's a homeopath who runs a website called &lt;a href="http://www.scienceofhomeopathy.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Science of Homeopathy&lt;/a&gt; and produced a woo-tastic video claiming to show us &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_physics_of_h.php"&gt;how homeopathy works&lt;/a&gt;. Steve Novella &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1383"&gt;also took on his video&lt;/a&gt;. For his trouble, he was rewarded with one of the most hilariously off-base attacks I've ever seen, even from anti-vaccine loons. So full of awesome looniness was the video that it induced in me a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/why_oh_why_cant_i_have_something_like_th.php"&gt;distinct sense of envy&lt;/a&gt;. After all, all I have is J.B. Handley attacking me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, for reasons that elude me, Mr. Benneth has produced a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dGSsS6L2jM"&gt;second video&lt;/a&gt;. It's just as outrageous. In fact, it's even more so and probably NSFW given that it drops the N-word. Clearly Benneth has upped the ante considerably, particularly given his apparent attempts at sound effects and the hilariously "artsy" beginning of the video. Don't play it if that offends you. You have been warned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You heard it right. In this one, Mr. Benneth compares Steve's criticism of his discussions of homeopathy to the breaking of an "uppity slave" by a slave breaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damn. Steve gets all the best crank attacks directed at him for his efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One almost has to wonder if Benneth's second video is a joke, given that it was posted on April Fools' Day. What I fear is that it is not. I rather believe that Benneth is dead serious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/why_oh_why_cant_i_have_something_like_th_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/chT7_IAoveg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270440454574"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4524">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/096fb5c0d435970c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Homeopathy"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Jews"/><category term="John Benneth"/><category term="Nazi"/><category term="slavery"/><title type="html">Our fearless leader Steve Novella gets the best responses to his posts!</title><published>2010-04-05T04:00:47Z</published><updated>2010-04-05T04:00:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4524" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You may recall that Steve has been &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1383"&gt;criticizing a certain homeopath named John Benneth&lt;/a&gt; for his incredible flights of–shall we say?–fancy used in defending homeopathy. As a result, Mr. Benneth (whose website is called &lt;a href="http://www.scienceofhomeopathy.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Science of Homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;) has produced a series of amazing videos that he’s posted on YouTube. Although we have a very serious mission here at SBM, we are not without a sense of humor, and that’s why we thought our readers might be interested in the sorts of commentary we have received in response to some of our efforts. The first video is called &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4G7z2LZ3Pw"&gt;HOMEOPATHY: Jew of Nazi Medicine&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/F4G7z2LZ3Pw%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how Benneth likens the criticism of his pseudoscience to the persecution of Jews by the Nazis. When you see something like this, you know that Godwin’s Law has been thoroughly invoked. The &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dGSsS6L2jM"&gt;second video&lt;/a&gt; is just as outrageous and probably NSFW given that it drops the N-word. Don’t play it if that offends you.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You heard it right. In this one, Mr. Benneth compares Steve’s criticism of his discussions of homeopathy to the breaking of an “uppity slave” by a slave breaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that I’m a bit envious here. Steve gets all the best crank attacks directed at him for his efforts. It’s not as though a certain particularly insolent fellow &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_physics_of_h.php"&gt;hasn’t also had his fun&lt;/a&gt; with John Benneth’s woo-ful description of “&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8BvHyorg"&gt;how homeopathy works&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s also not as though I haven’t had some fun with certain &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2377"&gt;homeopaths on this very blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, well. I guess that, as number two, I’ll just have to try harder in the future. (I guess I’ll always have &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4259"&gt;J. B. Handley&lt;/a&gt;.) In any case, one almost has to wonder if Benneth’s second video is a joke, given that it was posted on April Fools’ Day. What I fear is that it is not, although I do like his playing around with camera techniques and special effects in this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;The creator of this Cthhulonic congregation seems to have awaken from some dream of dread R’lyeh, and applied the nightmare image direct to the walls of the Kohl Center, only adding diverse colors to the cuttlefish-oid creatures to relieve the horror of his vision.&lt;/p&gt;

I figured it was another appropriation of a BBC show with redubbed narration, but I didn't realize I'd seen any of the original show before. In fact, the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG17TsgV_qI"&gt;time-lapse video of undersea scavengers&lt;/a&gt; is one of the coolest biology videos I've seen in a long time, and I watched that months ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seeing the original in comparison with the Americanized version makes me realize just how much more I like David Attenborough as a narrator than Oprah Winfrey. Maybe it's the soothing British accent, maybe it's the fact that Attenborough doesn't spend the rest of his time promoting all manner of dangerous pseudoscience, all I know is that I hope it's Attenborough when the DVDs come out.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20494433-2557777627367652782?l=dubitoergo.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Foss</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Dubito Ergo Sum</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270432332049"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/two_good_interviews_about_scie.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/12f618a5501180f8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">Two good interviews about science journalism</title><published>2010-04-05T02:35:43Z</published><updated>2010-04-05T02:35:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/9vEe04L1OQ8/two_good_interviews_about_scie.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/two_good_interviews_about_scie.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In his ongoing series, Colin Schultz posted two excellent interviews, with &lt;a href="http://colinschultz.wordpress.com/2010/04/03/interview-with-ferris-jabr/" title=""&gt;Ferris Jabr&lt;/a&gt; and with &lt;a href="http://colinschultz.wordpress.com/2010/04/04/interview-with-ed-yong/" title=""&gt;Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt;.

She's one of the loudest voices for Intelligent Design on the net, and she has to perpetually struggle with her own ignorance in order to come up with new excuses to deny evolution, and all she ever accomplishes is to briefly dazzle us with her incompetence. She has come up with two new problems with evolution lately. Brace yourselves, put your coffee down, and swallow before you read them. I'll will not be held accountable for damaged keyboards!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about this? Macroevolution is about changes in form and size, which &lt;a href="http://recursed.blogspot.com/2010/04/ignoramus-of-month-denyse-oleary.html"&gt;kittens do routinely as they grow up&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, evolution is trivial. And false? I'm not sure where she's going with that. I wonder if she's been consulting with that JohnHamilton wanker on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/design_flaws_support_evolution.php"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here's another one: &lt;a href="http://canadiancynic.blogspot.com/2010/04/ah-i-have-so-missed-denyseitude.html"&gt;if chimpanzees and humans are 98% identical genetically, why are spinsters so picky about marrying humans&lt;/a&gt;? Seriously: she's proposing a "Would Denyse O'Leary marry it?" test for speciation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's so sad.

The authors developed a model to estimate the economic impact of increasing the size of tuna populations in the Pacific Ocean. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous warnings from scientists to limit fishing effort have largely been ignored because “many fishers, and some countries, do not consider it is in their best interest.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img style="FLOAT:left;MARGIN:0px 10px 10px 0px;WIDTH:295px;HEIGHT:205px" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_LtVXpV7wD8c/S7gPETAZX4I/AAAAAAAAExE/9Cq17NBs-v4/s320/Tunaharvest.bmp" border="0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part of the problem is uncertainty: the economic impacts of continued expansion of harvests have not been well-understood. To address this information gap, the researchers determined the maximum economic yield – a financial measure – to complement previous &lt;em&gt;biological&lt;/em&gt; measures of maximum sustainable yield.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They found that reducing effort would have two effects that would benefit fishers: 1) given the elasticity of demand for tuna, prices would go up and fishers would get a higher margin; and 2) tuna stocks would increase, thereby increasing the abundance of tuna and making them easier and cheaper to catch (also increasing profit margins).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="PADDING-RIGHT:5px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;FLOAT:left;PADDING-BOTTOM:5px;PADDING-TOP:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img style="BORDER-RIGHT:0px;BORDER-TOP:0px;BORDER-LEFT:0px;BORDER-BOTTOM:0px" alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_mid.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The financial impact of such an action is significant: after a couple years of reduced profitability of the fisheries, economic profits go up in line with the increasing abundance of tuna. By reducing fishing effort and increasing biomass levels of the three tuna species under consideration, the industry could capture an additional $3 billion in profits, as compared with business-as-usual, over the next 50 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do smaller harvests raise the prices commanded by fishers (because demand is relatively inelastic), higher fish stocks also make it easier to find and harvest the fish: “a larger biomass makes it easier to find and catch fish that lowers per unit harvesting costs and increases expected profits.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises one of the biggest challenges in fisheries management: controlling the number of fishers and how much they harvest. Even to secure higher prices at market, there must be effective cooperation among all actors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver="&gt;Kompas, T., Grafton, R., &amp;amp; Che, T.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010007" title=""&gt;ARNTL (BMAL1) and NPAS2 Gene Variants Contribute to Fertility and Seasonality&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Circadian clocks guide the metabolic, cell-division, sleep-wake, circadian and seasonal cycles. Abnormalities in these clocks may be a health hazard. Circadian clock gene polymorphisms have been linked to sleep, mood and metabolic disorders. Our study aimed to examine polymorphisms in four key circadian clock genes in relation to seasonal variation, reproduction and well-being in a sample that was representative of the general population, aged 30 and over, living in Finland. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ARNTL, ARNTL2, CLOCK and NPAS2 genes were genotyped in 511 individuals. 19 variants were analyzed in relation to 31 phenotypes that were assessed in a health interview and examination study. With respect to reproduction, women with ARNTL rs2278749 TT genotype had more miscarriages and pregnancies, while NPAS2 rs11673746 T carriers had fewer miscarriages. NPAS2 rs2305160 A allele carriers had lower Global Seasonality Scores, a sum score of six items i.e. seasonal variation of sleep length, social activity, mood, weight, appetite and energy level. Furthermore, carriers of A allele at NPAS2 rs6725296 had greater loadings on the metabolic factor (weight and appetite) of the global seasonality score, whereas individuals with ARNTL rs6290035 TT genotype experienced less seasonal variation of energy level. ARNTL and NPAS2 gene variants were associated with reproduction and with seasonal variation. Earlier findings have linked ARNTL to infertility in mice, but this is the first time when any polymorphism of these genes is linked to fertility in humans.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010020" title=""&gt;Actuating Mechanism and Design of a Cylindrical Traveling Wave Ultrasonic Motor Using Cantilever Type Composite Transducer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ultrasonic motors (USM) are based on the concept of driving the rotor by a mechanical vibration excited on the stator via piezoelectric effect. USM exhibit merits such as simple structure, quick response, quiet operation, self-locking when power off, nonelectromagnetic radiation and higher position accuracy. A cylindrical type traveling wave ultrasonic motor using cantilever type composite transducer was proposed in this paper. There are two cantilevers on the outside surface of cylinder, four longitudinal PZT ceramics are set between the cantilevers, and four bending PZT ceramics are set on each outside surface of cantilevers. Two degenerate flexural vibration modes spatially and temporally orthogonal to each other in the cylinder are excited by the composite transducer. In this new design, a single transducer can excite a flexural traveling wave in the cylinder. Thus, elliptical motions are achieved on the teeth. The actuating mechanism of proposed motor was analyzed. The stator was designed with FEM. The two vibration modes of stator were degenerated. Transient analysis was developed to gain the vibration characteristic of stator, and results indicate the motion trajectories of nodes on the teeth are nearly ellipses. The study results verify the feasibility of the proposed design. The wave excited in the cylinder isn't an ideal traveling wave, and the vibration amplitudes are inconsistent. The distortion of traveling wave is generated by the deformation of bending vibration mode of cylinder, which is caused by the coupling effect between the cylinder and transducer. Analysis results also prove that the objective motions of nodes on the teeth are three-dimensional vibrations. But, the vibration in axial direction is minute compared with the vibrations in circumferential and radial direction. The results of this paper can guide the development of this new type of motor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010022" title=""&gt;Selection on Alleles Affecting Human Longevity and Late-Life Disease: The Example of Apolipoprotein E&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is often claimed that genes affecting health in old age, such as cardiovascular and Alzheimer diseases, are beyond the reach of natural selection. We show in a simulation study based on known genetic (apolipoprotein E) and non-genetic risk factors (gender, diet, smoking, alcohol, exercise) that, because there is a statistical distribution of ages at which these genes exert their influence on morbidity and mortality, the effects of selection are in fact non-negligible. A gradual increase with each generation of the ε2 and ε3 alleles of the gene at the expense of the ε4 allele was predicted from the model. The ε2 allele frequency was found to increase slightly more rapidly than that for ε3, although there was no statistically significant difference between the two. Our result may explain the recent evolutionary history of the epsilon 2, 3 and 4 alleles of the apolipoprotein E gene and has wider relevance for genes affecting human longevity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010026" title=""&gt;Quantifying Recent Ecological Changes in Remote Lakes of North America and Greenland Using Sediment Diatom Assemblages&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although arctic lakes have responded sensitively to 20th-century climate change, it remains uncertain how these ecological transformations compare with alpine and montane-boreal counterparts over the same interval. Furthermore, it is unclear to what degree other forcings, including atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen (Nr), have participated in recent regime shifts. Diatom-based paleolimnological syntheses offer an effective tool for retrospective assessments of past and ongoing changes in remote lake ecosystems. We synthesized 52 dated sediment diatom records from lakes in western North America and west Greenland, spanning broad latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, and representing alpine (n = 15), arctic (n = 20), and forested boreal-montane (n = 17) ecosystems. Diatom compositional turnover (β-diversity) during the 20th century was estimated using Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA) for each site and compared, for cores with sufficiently robust chronologies, to both the 19th century and the prior ~250 years (Little Ice Age). For both arctic and alpine lakes, β-diversity during the 20th century is significantly greater than the previous 350 years, and increases with both latitude and altitude. Because no correlation is apparent between 20th-century diatom β-diversity and any single physical or limnological parameter (including lake and catchment area, maximum depth, pH, conductivity, [NO3−], modeled Nr deposition, ambient summer and winter air temperatures, and modeled temperature trends 1948-2008), we used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to summarize the amplitude of recent changes in relationship to lake pH, lake:catchment area ratio, modeled Nr deposition, and recent temperature trends. The ecological responses of remote lakes to post-industrial environmental changes are complex. However, two regions reveal concentrations of sites with elevated 20th-century diatom β-diversity: the Arctic where temperatures are increasing most rapidly, and mid-latitude alpine lakes impacted by high Nr deposition rates. We predict that remote lakes will continue to shift towards new ecological states in the Anthropocene, particularly in regions where these two forcings begin to intersect geographically.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010037" title=""&gt;Phytoplankton Biogeography and Community Stability in the Ocean&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite enormous environmental variability linked to glacial/interglacial climates of the Pleistocene, we have recently shown that marine diatom communities evolved slowly through gradual changes over the past 1.5 million years. Identifying the causes of this ecological stability is key for understanding the mechanisms that control the tempo and mode of community evolution. If community assembly were controlled by local environmental selection rather than dispersal, environmental perturbations would change community composition, yet, this could revert once environmental conditions returned to previous-like states. We analyzed phytoplankton community composition across &amp;gt;104 km latitudinal transects in the Atlantic Ocean and show that local environmental selection of broadly dispersed species primarily controls community structure. Consistent with these results, three independent fossil records of marine diatoms over the past 250,000 years show cycles of community departure and recovery tightly synchronized with the temporal variations in Earth&amp;#39;s climate. Changes in habitat conditions dramatically alter community structure, yet, we conclude that the high dispersal of marine planktonic microbes erases the legacy of past environmental conditions, thereby decreasing the tempo of community evolution.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_267.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/TPZuoLiHg60" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270415998146"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=23041">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3ec59adc62cf1f6e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Where Is the Jesus?</title><published>2010-04-04T21:00:21Z</published><updated>2010-04-04T21:00:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/04/04/where-is-the-jesus/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;He’s everywhere!  &lt;/p&gt;

Often, people think that these things happen because some guiding hand or supernatural force caused them.So the question is, why are these delusions so common? Do we humans have an inbuilt predisposition (a cognitive bias) that leads us to anthropomorphize events? That’s one explanation that’s been suggested. The idea is that the brain machinery devoted to figuring out what’s going on inside another person’s head (the so-called ‘theory of mind’) also acts to interpret major life events as purposeful and meaningful.Alternatively, fatalism might simply be one other aspect of basic errors in thinking that lead to all sorts of mistakes about how the world operates. Perhaps fatalism is just a kind of paranormal delusion, and they are all caused by an inability to understand how the world works.New research from Annika Svedholm and colleagues from the University of Helsinki suggest that’s exactly what happens.They surveyed over two thousand Finns (mostly women, but with a good age range – not just students) on whether they believed that seemingly random events were in fact caused by an invisible agency. Then they asked about their paranormal beliefs.They also asked a series of questions to test their subjects’ basic understanding of how the world works (their ‘core knowledge confusion”). Here’s some examples – many people would recognise them as poetic metaphors, but those with core knowledge confusion tend to think that they are literally true:“Stars live in the sky” (Lifeless natural objects are living)“Planets know things” (Lifeless objects are animate)“Flowers want light” (Living inanimate objects are animate)“A home knows its inhabitants” (Artificial objects are animate)“Force can sense a human being” (Force is living and animate)“The mind falls apart when ill” (Mental states are material)Next, they worked out how all these factors were related statistically. What they found is depicted in the graphic.Paranormal beliefs and beliefs in the purpose of events were strongly correlated (leading to a factor they call “General Paranormal Pelief”. What’s more, all the elements of ‘core knowledge confusion’ were inter-correlated.What does that mean in practice? Well, what they were left with was a strong link between basic errors in thinking and belief in the paranormal – including fatalistic beliefs.What this suggests is that there is nothing particularly special about the belief that things are ‘caused’ in some mysterious way – or indeed about paranormal beliefs in general.If Svedholm and colleagues are right, there is no special brain pathway that makes people believe things happen for a reason. It’s simply that some people just have problems understanding how the world really works.In the words of the French sociologist Marcel Mauss, “Either you believe in it all, or you do not”!Svedholm, A., Lindeman, M., &amp;amp; Lipsanen, J.

&lt;p&gt;One of my growing interests is assistive technology for those who struggle with language in any way. On Wednesday at 6 pm PDT (9 pm EDT) there will be a discussion with &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/bgilormini"&gt;Bridget Gilormini&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://www.pacer.org/stc/"&gt;Simon Technology Center&lt;/a&gt; (part of the Minnesota-based &lt;a href="http://www.pacer.org/about/index.asp"&gt;Parent Advocacy Coalition for Educational Rights&lt;/a&gt;, or PACER Center) on Twitter, hosted by &lt;a href="http://thecoffeeklatch.com/"&gt;The Coffee Klatch&lt;/a&gt; (more on &lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/04/the-coffee-klatch.html"&gt;TCK on my blog&lt;/a&gt;).  Go to &lt;a href="http://tweetchat.com/room/tck"&gt;http://tweetchat.com/room/tck&lt;/a&gt; to follow the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Simon Technology Center Overview
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Assistive technology can be a device or service that helps children with disabilities participate more independently within their environment at home or school.
&lt;/p&gt;

The Simon Technology Center (STC) is dedicated to making the benefits of technology more accessible to children and adults with disabilities. Through a collaborated effort involving parents, professionals, and consumers, the STC can provide numerous services for your family, as well as resources and informative answers to your questions. Since 1987, the Simon Technology Center has helped many children and adults, with a variety of disabilities, use assistive technology to enhance learning, work and independence. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Usually I don&amp;#39;t — and I definitely don&amp;#39;t when he flees to the safety of the baby pen at HuffPo to cry about how mean everyone is to him. Now he is &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-ruse/a-scientific-defense-of-t_b_523416.html"&gt;bleating about the criticisms given to Ayala for accepting a Templeton Prize&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Templeton Foundation was begun by the late Sir John Templeton, who made a great deal of money by starting mutual funds, and is essentially devoted to the promotion of the interaction and harmony between science and religion. It is hardly too strong a term to say that it is an object of derision by many of today's scientists, including my own colleague here at Florida State University, Sir Harry Kroto who won the Nobel Prize in chemistry (for discovering the structure of complex carbon molecules, "buckyballs"). Richard Dawkins has characterized the president of the Royal Society (of London), Sir Martin Rees, as a "Quisling" (after the war-time Nazi ruler of Norway) for his friendliness to the Foundation. Jerry Coyne, a University of Chicago biologist and a deservedly respected scientist for his work on problems of speciation, runs a blog (Why Evolution is True) where he writes of the foundation's "history of intellectual dishonesty." When it was announced that the National Academy of Science's premises would be used to introduce this year's prize winner he called it an "outrage." And then there is Minnesota biologist P. Z. Myers, who runs the blog Pharyngula, and whose splenetic keyboard surely qualifies him for the title of evolution's answer to Rush Limbaugh. It is not only the Foundation that sends up his blood pressure, but Ayala now also is in his line of fire. He is accused of "intellectual cowardice" and is characterized as "the master of non-committal waffle." Apparently Ayala received the award purely for "religious apologetics," even though somewhat inconsistently Ayala is also faulted for not making clear his own position on the God question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, Ruse does not link to the article he quotes. After all, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/ayala_fires_a_shot_across_the.php"&gt;I actually addressed specific comments by Ayala&lt;/a&gt; which show that he does waffle. This is not inconsistent with winning a prize for religious apologetics, since waffling inconclusively is a fine theological tradition. And yes, &lt;a href="http://www.templetonprize.org/currentwinner.html"&gt;he won for religious reasons&lt;/a&gt;: the first sentence of the Templeton announcement says he is a scientist &lt;span&gt;"who has vigorously opposed the entanglement of science and religion while also calling for mutual respect between the two"&lt;/span&gt;. We know what is important to the Templeton Foundation, after all, and it isn't scientific integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all that complaining about critics, what is Ruse's point? As it turns out, there really isn't one, just more vague grumpiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while I am a bit wary about the Foundation and shall be watching its future developments - especially now that Sir John is gone and his far-more-evangelical son has taken the reins - I shall continue to defend its existence and its purpose. I don't want to reconcile science and religion if this implies that religion must be true. At most, I want to show that science does not preclude being religious. But I don't see that what I want and what others want means that we necessarily have to be bad friends and despise each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah. Nice to know that Ruse doesn't despise fascist propagandists who make Oxycontin-fueled jaunts to partake of the sex trade on Caribbean islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's such a waffly conclusion to his argument that it confirms my suspicion that he's angling for a Templeton bribe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/waaaah_michael_ruse_waaah_waaa.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/h4BQxbwPvvk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270407250306"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/sunday_sacrilege_the_silliest.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bbd38e786082fdb7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Sunday Sacrilege: The silliest story ever told</title><published>2010-04-04T17:52:06Z</published><updated>2010-04-04T17:52:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/JPB_nf4Jy-w/sunday_sacrilege_the_silliest.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/sunday_sacrilege_the_silliest.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s Easter.

I also note that the Court of Appeal made a point of using Simon Singh’s academic title in its case title.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Court of Appeal's decision follows the previous decisions in this case: &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/05/bca-v-singh-official-ruling.html"&gt; the astonishingly illiberal ruling &lt;/a&gt;of the High Court in May 2009, the &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/08/length-of-simon-singhs-skeleton-reasons.html"&gt; terse one paragraph refusal &lt;/a&gt;of Simon’s application for permission to appeal in July 2009, and Lord Justice Laws’s wonderful &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/11/bca-v-singh-court-of-appral-permission.html"&gt;granting of permission to appeal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(And even a hardened English lawyer must admit it is rather splendid for a Lord Justice Laws to grant permission to appeal to a court headed by a Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the reasons I set out below, I think the judgment is significant as it appears that the Court of Appeal has extended the defence of “fair comment” – or “honest opinion” – to all contentions about evidence in any debate (and not only those to relating to science or medicine) “&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;concerned with the establishment of dependable generalisations about cause and effect&lt;/span&gt;”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, to provide my analysis of this complex judgment, I will have to resort to use two technical terms, well-known to lawyers but not more widely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first term is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_decidendi"&gt; &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  This means the basis of the court’s decision: the reasoning on which the order made by a court is based.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(The order made here by the Court of Appeal was to allow Simon's appeal.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Court of Appeal cases, it is the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt; of the decision which will have the binding effect of precedent both on lesser courts (such as the High Court) and indeed (in most circumstances) on the Court of Appeal itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is thereby important to work out exactly the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt; of any Court of Appeal case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second term is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obiter_dictum"&gt; &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;obiter dicta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  What is said &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;obiter&lt;/span&gt; by a court is not essential to the order made by the court.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A court may set the background to the case, or make observations on the conduct of the parties, or remark on the state of the law generally; but unless the order made by the court can only be explained by reference to these statements, they can be said to have been &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;obiter&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Insofar as &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;obiter&lt;/span&gt; statements are about law, they do not bind other courts, though they can be of “persuasive” effect: that means a court can adopt such a statement as having effect should that court be persuaded that the statement be relevant in case before it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But with the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt;, a court may have no choice: it is a binding precedent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The task for those analysing an appellate case is to try and sort the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt; from the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;obiter dicta&lt;/span&gt;, though such analysis is provisionally academic until its soundness is tested in actual future cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For me, the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt; of BCA v Dr Singh consists of the Court of Appeal’s reasoning on jurisdiction and on meaning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Ratio&lt;/span&gt; – jurisdiction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first hurdle for the Court of Appeal was the extent they could actually hear the appeal.  This is a dry-ish point about jurisdiction, and so feel free to now scroll down to the really interesting part of the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt; on meaning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA contended that the Court of Appeal should only disturb the ruling of Mr Justice Eady if, in effect, it was outside the range of rulings available to him; that the ruling may perhaps be wrong, but not so wrong that the Court of Appeal should intervene and overturn it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here it is significant that Mr Justice Eady was, with the agreement of the parties, determining the question of meaning which is usually left to juries in defamation cases.  Normally the judge would rule on whether the words were capable of carrying a certain meaning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Court of Appeal’s reasoning on this point is in paragraphs 13 to 15, which I now set out:  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;13. What the words in issue in a libel action mean is subject to two controls: a decision, reserved to the judge, as to whether the defamatory meaning alleged by the claimant falls with the range of possible meanings conveyed by the words in their context; and a decision, traditionally reserved to the jury, as to what they actually mean. The former is regarded as a question of law, the latter as one of fact, with the result that the meaning eventually decided upon by the jury is shielded from attack on appeal save where it has crossed the boundary of reasonableness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;14. Heather Rogers QC for the BCA accordingly submits that we cannot interfere with Eady J's decision on meaning simply because we may disagree with it: we can only do so if we are quite sure that he was wrong. Adrienne Page QC for Dr Singh submits, first, that we are free to retake that decision if, as she submits is the case, it is vitiated by an error of law; but she submits in any event that the deference accorded on appeal to what is ordinarily a jury's verdict has no equivalent where the finding in question is the speaking decision of a judge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;15. Ms Page draws our attention in this connection to Slim v Daily Telegraph [1968] 2 QB 157, an appeal from a decision of Paull J who, as is to happen in the present case, had tried a libel action without a jury. Diplock LJ (at 174) explained the two functions in this way:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The decision as to defamatory meanings which words are capable of bearing is reserved to the judge, and for this reason, and no other, is called a question of law. The decision as to the particular defamatory meaning within that category which the words do bear is reserved to the jury, and for this reason, and no other, is called a question of fact."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The purpose of this careful explanation becomes apparent when, having held that the trial judge had failed to direct himself adequately as to the true meaning of the words complained of, Diplock LJ (at 177) asks "What then is this court to do?" and answers:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I do not think we need send it back for a retrial …. This court is in as good a position as the judge to determine what is the natural and ordinary meaning of the words…."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words, the BCA’s case on the jurisdiction point was rejected.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Court of Appeal could decide meaning for itself.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This means it should be easier for losing parties to appeal adverse rulings of the High Court on meaning in defamation cases when the parties elect not to have a jury trial, as – because of significant additional cost of jury trials – parties may increasingly do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(In view of what the Court of Appeal then say about meaning, it is arguable that this point on jurisdiction is &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;obiter&lt;/span&gt;  - the Court of Appeal seems to go on to say that the meaning adopted by Mr Justice Eady was outside the meanings available to him – and so the appeal could have been allowed even if the BCA’s submissions on jurisdiction had been correct.  However, I regard the jurisdiction point as &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt; as it seems to me to go to the jurisdiction the Court of Appeal is exercising in ordering that the appeal be allowed.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now the really interesting part of the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Ratio&lt;/span&gt; - meaning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once that the Court of Appeal had satisfied itself as to its jurisdiction, it could then approach the “words complained of” which (of course) were:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"The British Chiropractic Association claims that their members can help treat children with colic, sleeping and feeding problems, frequent ear infections, asthma and prolonged crying, even though there is not a jot of evidence. This organisation is the respectable face of the chiropractic profession and yet it happily promotes bogus treatments."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Court of Appeal was careful, as Lord Justice Laws had done in granting permission, to set out the whole paragraph containing the words complained of and the following paragraph where Simon sets out why he describes the treatments as bogus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Court of Appeal starts with the word “evidence” and then construes what “not a jot of evidence” would thereby mean:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;26. What "evidence" signifies depends heavily on context. To a literalist, any primary fact – for example, that following chiropractic intervention a patient's condition improved – may be evidence of a secondary fact, here that chiropractic works. To anyone (and not only a scientist) concerned with the establishment of dependable generalisations about cause and effect, such primary information is as worthless as evidence of the secondary fact as its converse would be. The same may equally well be true of data considerably more complex than in the facile example we have given: whether it is or not is what scientific opinion is there to debate. If in the course of the debate the view is expressed that there is not a jot of evidence for one deduction or another, the natural meaning is that there is no worthwhile or reliable evidence for it. That is as much a value judgment as a contrary viewpoint would be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is an extremely interesting paragraph. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It appears to establish a class of statements (and not just in scientific debates) which are “concerned with the establishment of dependable generalisations about cause and effect” where contentions about evidence are inherently “value judgments”  - that is, expressions amenable to the defence of “fair comment” (or "honest opinion" as the courts now prefer to call it).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accordingly, if a statement is “&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;concerned with the establishment of dependable generalisations about cause and effect&lt;/span&gt;” then, following &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;British Chiropractic Association v Dr Singh&lt;/span&gt;, there will now be a presumption (which can be rebutted by evidence of malice) that there will be a defence to a defamation suit.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Unless this case is superseded in some way by a Supreme Court judgment and then the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt; can fall away.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my analysis, this reasoning of the Court of Appeal is part of the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt; of the case.  And, if I am correct in this, then this will bind the High Court (and effectively the Court of Appeal, but not the Supreme Court) in future cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If so, this will have more direct effect than the wonderful &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Easterbrook quotation&lt;/a&gt;, which was clearly &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;obiter&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have to stress that I may well be incorrect on this; whether I am right or not is subject to the hard reality test of future libel cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it does seem very interesting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Here I would like to pay tribute to &lt;a href="http://blogs.nature.com/scurry/"&gt;Professor Stephen Curry&lt;/a&gt; who spotted &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Stephen_Curry/statuses/11422172351"&gt;the potential significance of paragraph 26&lt;/a&gt; well before me.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having decided this about “evidence” and thereby “not a jot of evidence” - and providing an illustrative example in paragraph 27 - the Court of Appeal goes on to make short work of “bogus”:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;28. Ms Rogers has understandably not sought to make a major issue of the word "bogus". In its context the word is more emphatic than assertive. But it is also explicitly supported by the next paragraph of the article, which explains that Dr Singh's co-author Professor Ernst had found in 70 trials no evidence that chiropractic could treat conditions unrelated to the back. It is a paragraph which also underlines the evaluative character of the assertion that there was not a jot of evidence for such claims.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And “happily”:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;29. The other assertion to which the BCA takes objection is that it "happily" promotes treatments which, if Dr Singh is right, are bogus. Eady J accepted the BCA's case that this meant, in its context, that the BCA was well aware that there was in reality no evidence to support its claims – "the plainest allegation of dishonesty", as the judge put it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the Court of Appeal then construe the words complained of as a whole and provide the Court of Appeal’s own ruling on “meaning”:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;30. Once the allegation that there is "not a jot of evidence" to support the claims is properly characterised as a value judgment, the word "happily", even if synonymous with "knowingly", loses its sting. But we respectfully doubt whether the judge was justified in any event in attributing to the word any significance beyond, say, "blithely". The natural meaning of the passage, in other words, was not that the BCA was promoting what it knew to be bogus treatments but that it was promoting what Dr Singh contended were bogus treatments without regard to the want of reliable evidence of their efficacy – a meaning which takes one back to the assertion that there was not a jot of evidence for the BCA's claims.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short, the meaning of the words complained of is that the BCA was promoting what Simon contended were bogus treatments without regard to the want of reliable evidence of their efficacy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And unless the Supreme Court overturns this, all Simon has to show to defeat this is that he was not acting maliciously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conclusions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What the Court of Appeal required to determine the appeal is set out in paragraphs 13, 14, and 15 on jurisdiction and in paragraphs 26, 28, 29, and 30 on meaning.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The judgment could – with some slight modifications - have consisted just of the reasoning in those paragraphs combined with the introductory paragraphs 1 to 9 and paragraph 37 describing the order made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The remaining literary fireworks of the judgment – the mention of an Orwellian Ministry of Truth, the quoting of Milton on Galileo, the Easterbrook passage, and so on – all fall to be regarded as &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;obiter&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;obiter&lt;/span&gt; statements are vivid, exhilarating, heady stuff.  In particular, it would be delightful if the Easterbrook passage was seen as an expression of the English legal position.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But these statements will only ever have persuasive effect, if any effect at all, on future English libel litigation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The eminent blogger &lt;a href="http://heresycorner.blogspot.com/2010/04/simon-singh-appeal-ruling-right-result.html"&gt;The Heresiarch &lt;/a&gt;has examined these statements and finds many of them intellectually unsatisfying.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He complains that the Court of Appeal was “&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;engaged in piece of casuistical manipulation to reach its preferred result&lt;/span&gt;”: it was the right decision, but for the wrong reasons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am afraid I have to differ.  The Court of Appeal did not actually need any of these colourful passages for the appeal to be allowed, for none of these statements were part of the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Court of Appeal simply did not need them to reach its "preferred result".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So why were these &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;obiter&lt;/span&gt; statements made?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my view, the Court of Appeal is consciously giving a steer to potential claimants and their lawyers, and perhaps even the High Court itself, about the general approach which should be adopted in defamation cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In particular, I believe the Court of Appeal is signalling the values which courts should have regard to in dealing with such defamation cases in future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And a Court of Appeal consisting of the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, and Lord Justice Sedley is in an extremely powerful position to make these signals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Insofar as these &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;obiter&lt;/span&gt; statements do not hang together then this is more because of it being a jointly-written judgment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my view, the judgment is tightly reasoned where it matters, that is the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt; on meaning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, I think the judgment is important and welcome, as well as inspiring and emphatic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That Simon won this appeal is delightful; to do so in a judgment in such striking and – one hopes – influential &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;obiter&lt;/span&gt; terms is uplifting; but to have prompted the Court of Appeal to determine that “fair comment” (or “honest opinion”) can cover all statements “&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;concerned with the establishment of dependable generalisations about cause and effect&lt;/span&gt;” may be the most enduring result of this case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in no way does this judgment correct the wider manifest faults of English libel law and the campaign for libel reform must press on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please go to &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/http//:www.libelreform.org"&gt; the Libel Reform website&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the libel reform campaign.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published; always use a name for ease of reference by other commenters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-3610829542291884646?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270404173857"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/?p=4498">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9e7d4b185b5706d2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Technology"/><title type="html">First Thoughts on the iPad</title><published>2010-04-04T15:05:51Z</published><updated>2010-04-04T15:05:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CosmicVarianceBlog/~3/_EAgKUjA-I0/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/04/04/first-thoughts-on-the-ipad/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Only one thought, actually: why don’t I have one?

Dianetics and Scientology processes fit that description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polarization around this work is equally strong among laypeople.  Mooallem describes one study of a mutation that produces same-sex courtship in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila &lt;/em&gt;males:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, for instance, the University  of Illinois neurobiologist David Featherstone and several  colleagues, while searching for new drug treatments for Lou Gehrig’s  disease, happened upon a discovery: a specific protein mutation in the  brain of male fruit flies made the flies try to have sex with other  males. What the mutation did, more specifically, was tweak the fruit  flies’ sense of smell, making them attracted to male pheromones —  mounting other males was the end result. To Featherstone, how fruit  flies smell doesn’t seem to have anything to do with human sexuality.  “We didn’t think about the societal implications — we’re just a bunch of  dorky biologists,” he told me recently. Still, after publishing a paper  describing this mutation, he received a flood of phone calls and e-mail  messages presuming that he could, and would, translate this new  knowledge into a way of changing people’s sexual orientations. One  e-mail message compared him with Dr. Josef Mengele, noting “the direct  line that leads from studies like this to compulsory eradication of gay  sexuality . . . whether [by] burnings at the stake or injections with  chemical suppressants. You,” the writer added, “just placed a log on the  pyre.” (Earlier that year, PETA and the former tennis star Martina  Navratilova, among others, were waging similar attacks on a  scientific study of gay sheep, presuming it was a precursor to  developing a “treatment” for shutting off homosexuality in human  fetuses.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, in talking to gay people, I find some who would prefer that human homosexuality be shown to be genetic, so that they won’t be derided for making a supposedly immoral “choice” and can impute their behavior to a genetic imperative.  Other gays would prefer a more “nurture-ist” finding, since they envision a kind of pogrom or eugenics program if gay behavior were found to be genetic.  And there are those, myself included, who think that the question is irrelevant, since the morality seeing gays as having equal rights does not depend on any genetic or evolutionary basis. (Or, if you take a Sam-Harris-an approach to the question, you can say that our well being is best served if we don’t discriminate against gay people or legally regulate the sexual behavior of consenting adults).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can animal studies really inform work on human homosexuality? I’m not an expert in this area, but Mooallem doesn’t paint an optimistic picture.  He shows, and I had guessed this, that “gay” behavior in animals (by this I mean “same-sex” sexual behavior) is a grab-bag of diverse phenomena that don’t support a single evolutionary explanation.  Some same-sex behavior, such as the occasional tendency of males to mount other males, could simply be a byproduct of a general tendency for males to copulate with anything moving, which is itself adaptive since sperm is cheap. (Some flies, for example, will try to copulate with balls of wax, and some orchids, to gain pollination, have flowers mimicking female bees, with which overstimulated males try to mate).  In other cases  same-sex behavior may have evolutionary roots, reflecting specific adaptations.  Mooallem describes “lesbian” behavior in albatrosses in Hawaii, for instance, in which pairs of females will nest together (&lt;em&gt;sans&lt;/em&gt; males) to incubate a single egg.  While this behavior isn’t yet understood, it may reflect the advantage of brooding an egg even when you’re not sure it’s yours, just because there’s a dearth of males in the population and it’s better to have half a chance of producing an offspring than no chance at all.  In other cases, like the polymorphous sexuality in bonobo chimps, sexual behavior may have been co-opted into forms of social bonding. I wouldn’t expect, for instance, that same-sex mounting in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; would have an evolutionary explanation similar to that of male mammals fellating each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we shouldn’t hold out a lot of hope that these kinds of studies will shed much illumination on human homosexuality.  It may, but I’m not hopeful.  For one things, humans have a rich and mercurial culture that is unlike anything seen in animals.  Social stigma or conventions can change quite quickly, and this can affect the propensity of same-sex behavior.  Was prolific gay behavior in ancient Athens the same thing, biologically, as the behavior of gays in 1930s Chicago? Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy about the roots of gay behavior in our culture is often couched as a dichotomy: is it genetic or is it a “choice”?  Because I’m a physical determinist who believes that there’s no such thing as true free will or a genuine “choice”, I prefer to couch the dichotomy as one of nature versus nurture: are there genes whose presence results in gay behavior, or is that behavior entirely due to environmental influences, including social pressures and the behavior of one’s peers?  The most likely answer is “both.”  There is some evidence that homosexual behavior in our species has a genetic basis, but we don’t know much about this, and of course how genes produce traits depends, with few exceptions, on the relevant environments. “Gay” genes may show environmental effects on &lt;em&gt;expressivity&lt;/em&gt; (the degree to which gay behavior actually appears when one has “gay genes”) and &lt;em&gt;penetrance&lt;/em&gt; (is such behavior even seen at all when one has the genes?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one is making an argument that gay behavior has an adaptive evolutionary basis, as do some evolutionary psychologists, then one must answer at least three questions.  These questions, while crucial for any argument about the evolution of human behaviors, are almost never addressed in any work of evolutionary psychology, and the second two aren’t touched by Mooallem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.  &lt;em&gt;Does gay behavior have a genetic basis?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As I said above, we don’t know much about this, but there are indications that there is &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; genetic basis in some people.  That doesn’t mean, however, that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; gay behavior stems from “gay genes.”  Even if there’s a genetic basis, there is likely a strong interaction with the environment, too, so that one may not be able to impute gay behavior to simply “genes” or “environment.” Complicating this is the additional possibility that some same-sex behaviors may reflect genes or gene-environment interaction, while others  could entirely reflect differences in the environment, perhaps based on neurological or hormonal factors not produced by mutations in the DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the answer to this first question is “no,” then there is no need to go further with explaining an adaptive basis for homosexuality. Without genes there couldn’t be an adaptive basis for the trait.  If it’s “yes”—that is, there is at least a partial genetic basis for some gay behavior, you can proceed to question #2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;em&gt;If the behavior is “adaptive,” how is it adaptive?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That is, how, exactly, do gay people leave more copies of their “gay genes” than non-gay people?  For that is what is implied by saying that the behavior is “adaptive.” Since homosexuality seems patently &lt;em&gt;maladaptive&lt;/em&gt; from an evolutionary point of view—presumably gay people don’t leave as many offspring as their non-gay &lt;em&gt;confreres&lt;/em&gt;—how come those genes are hanging around in the population?  We’d expect natural selection to eliminate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mooallem notes two possibilities.  One, originally suggested by E. O. Wilson, is kin selection.  As Mooallem notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper published earlier this year, Vasey and one of his graduate  students at the University of Lethbridge, Doug P. VanderLaan, report  that fa’afafine [this is a group of males in Samoa who engage in same-sex behavior] are markedly more willing to help raise their nieces and  nephews than typical Samoan uncles: they’re more willing to baby-sit,  help pay school and medical expenses and so on. Furthermore, this  heightened altruism and affection is focused only on the fa’afafine’s  nieces and nephews. They don’t just love kids in general. They are a  kind of superuncle. This offers support for a hypothesis that has been  toyed around with speculatively since the ’70s, when E. O. Wilson raised  it: If a key perspective of evolutionary biology urges us to understand  homosexuality in any species as a beneficial adaptation — if the point  of life is to pass on one’s genes — then maybe the role of gay  individuals is to somehow help their family members generate more  offspring. Those family members will, after all, share a lot of the same  genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would seem to be the prediction of “adaptive homosexuality” that is most easily tested.  It’s not hard to determine whether gay people have more brothers and sisters (or nieces and nephews) than non-gay people, a finding necessary to support the “kin selection” theory.  And it has to be more than just a one-for-one replacement with you because, according to kin selection theory, related individuals are devalued by their degree of genetic relationship to the gay person.  If a gay person is, as Wilson posited, the human equivalent of a bird “helper at the nest” (birds like Florida scrub jays who forgo reproduction for a while to help their parents raise brothers and sisters), one can make calculations about whether the outcome is “adaptive.”  If I become gay and have no offspring, for example, I’d have to help mom and pop raise produce &lt;em&gt;at least two&lt;/em&gt; more brothers and sisters than non-gay people, because each brother or sister carries only half my genes.  I suspect the “kin selection” idea is wrong, but it would be relatively easy to get the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complicating this explanation, however, is the evolutionary-psychology idea that whatever evolutionary forces promoted the evolution of “gay genes” occurred in the distant past, on the African savanna where most of our evolution took place.  Measuring &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; evolutionary advantages and disadvantages of homosexuality might having nothing to say about why it evolved (if it did evolve) in the first place.  This evocation of an unrecoverable past, while it might be true, makes much of the speculation in evolutionary psychology untestable.  Can’t find an adaptive advantage in modern society? That’s ok—there was probably an advantage several million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mooallem raises a different possibility for how “gay genes” might be selected for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vasey and VanderLaan have also shown that mothers of fa’afafine have  more kids than other Samoan women. And this fact supports a separate,  existing hypothesis: maybe there’s a collection of genes that, when  expressed in a male, make him gay but when expressed in a woman, make  her more fertile. Like Wilson’s theory, this idea was also meant to  explain how homosexuality is maintained in a species and not pushed out  by the invisible hand of Darwinian evolution. But unlike Wilson’s  hypothesis, it doesn’t try to find a sneaky way to explain homosexuality  as an evolutionary adaptation; instead, it imagines homosexuality as a  byproduct of an adaptation. It’s not too different from how Vasey  explains why his female macaques insistently mount one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may also be true, but it doesn’t necessarily solve the problem.  That’s because of question #3, to wit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;em&gt; Are the genes for gay behavior supposed to be fixed in populations or are they polymorphic?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; That is, do we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; have genes that, under the right circumstances, cause us to have same-sex sexual behavior, or are those genes &lt;em&gt;polymorphic&lt;/em&gt;—that is, do some individuals have them while others don’t?  This latter possibility is what evolutionary psychologists often suggest; and this possibility is required for studies that purport to show that gay behavior has a genetic basis. After all, if we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; have gay genes, there’s no genetic variation among people to study and thus no way of demonstrating a genetic basis to gay-ness!  And if gay genes are polymorphic, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; are they polymorphic?  Population-genetic studies show that only under very restricted circumstances can natural selection itself promote the existence of genetic polymorphisms in natural populations.  Just showing that gay behavior is sometimes adaptive, or has adaptive side effects, is not enough to explain the persistence of “gay genes” in populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mooallem’s idea that gay genes are maladaptive in males but adaptive in females doesn’t fully answer this question.  Genes that are adaptive in one sex but not in the other don’t automatically become polymorphic in a population.  In most cases, they’ll either be wiped out of a population (if the disadvantage in males is larger than the advantage in females), or be fixed in a population, so that everyone has them (advantage in females much stronger than disadvantage in males).  To explain a polymorphism, the balance between male and female fitness has to be of a very specific character so that, for example, “heterozygotes” (individuals carrying one gay gene and one non-gay gene) have a net advantage in the population.  This is by no means the inexorable result if gay genes are maladaptive in males and adaptive in females (or vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answering these three questions is a tall order.  Question 1, whether homosexuality has a genetic basis, is perhaps the easiest to answer.  The other two questions, involving the so-called “adaptive” basis for homosexuality, will be very difficult to answer. In fact, I don’t think—given the difficulties of studying a socially-conditioned behavior in a population on which you can’t do experiments—that they’ll ever be answered to our satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I suppose I’m not much interested in the evolutionary roots of gay behavior.  Yes, it would be nice to know, but, given the problems I’ve described above, we’ll likely never know for sure, and perhaps should spend our time studying more tractable questions.  The data at hand already show that same-sex behavior in animals is a mixed bag of heterogeneous stuff, and may not illuminate homosexuality in humans.  Most of the researchers described in Mooallem’s article seem to recognize this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, no matter what the evolutionary roots of homosexual behavior are, those are irrelevant (apologies to Sam Harris here) to how we regard gays.  Infanticide is “normal” in some species like lions and langurs, but we condemn it and punish it in humans.   What is “natural,” “genetic,” or “adaptive” has little relevance, to me at least, to the question of what is right.  It’s simply the moral thing to do to ensure that gays have equal rights, regardless of whether same-sex behavior rests on genes, the environment, or both.  Perhaps finding a genetic basis for homosexuality would make some Christians and Mulims stop condemning gays as immoral, but what if homosexuality turns out to be largely a product of environments?  Making your morality depend on such answers is simply a bad way to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, read Mooallem’s article. It’s a remarkably good piece of science reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: What is a sellable idea? How do you develop one? Is your idea enough for a book, is there more you can do to develop it, or should it just be a magazine article or series of blog posts? This will be a hands-on nuts and bolts workshop: Come with ideas to pitch. Better yet, bring a &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; (1 page or less) written proposal to read and workshop. This workshop will provide handouts on proposal writing as well as sample proposals you can use to help develop your own in the future. Useful for anyone hoping to someday write for print or online publications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_writing_fo_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/wqzICBRhswk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270386603291"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=23031">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/91543057454bfa04</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">What Atheist Should Be on Obama’s Faith Advisory Council?</title><published>2010-04-04T13:00:03Z</published><updated>2010-04-04T13:00:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/04/04/what-atheist-should-be-on-obamas-faith-advisory-council/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President Obama&lt;/strong&gt; has a “President’s Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships” consisting of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Office_of_Faith-Based_and_Neighborhood_Partnerships#Under_Barack_Obama"&gt;25 people&lt;/a&gt;.  They help advise the Office of Faith Based and Neighborhood Partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, there are no atheists on the Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are Jews, Catholics, Protestants, Episcopalians, Methodists, Baptists, Muslims, Interfaith-supporters… but no non-theists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was at Syracuse University a couple days ago, someone asked me who I thought would make a good representative on that council from the non-theist community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That somebody would have to be in a position of power, well-respected within our community (and hopefully beyond), not overly-controversial, and able to properly articulate our positions on many issues of faith and government and what policies the government should or should not be making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave an answer.  (I’ll keep it to myself for now.)  But I’m sure there are better ones that the person I stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that the Obama administration is asking, but since the council members are elected to one-year terms, maybe we can expect to see a non-theist in that group in the future.  (You hear me, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_DuBois"&gt;Josh DuBois&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who do you think would be a good representative for us?  Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

There's Allan and Barbara Pease's relationship self-help book &lt;em&gt;Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps&lt;/em&gt;;  an online chapter from the book &lt;em&gt;Be Your Own Therapist&lt;/em&gt; with the title "Men Don't Listen; Men Don't Communicate"; another self-help book, by Wayne Misner, that's called just plain &lt;em&gt;Men Don't Listen&lt;/em&gt;; an MSNBC Today article "Honey, did you hear me? Why men don't listen"; a BBC News Health article from 2000, "&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1044805.stm"&gt;Why men don't listen?&lt;/a&gt;". And that's just on the first page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these books and articles propose a biological basis for the phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus Rick Ryckeley in The [Peachtree City] Citizen, March 18, 2010, &lt;a href="http://www.thecitizen.com/blogs/rick-ryckeley/03-18-2010/men-dont-listen"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Spending the better part of my adult life trying to understand the opposite sex, I’ve realized one thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;It’s a daunting task — a task that I’m incredibly ill-equipped for. Okay, so that’s two things, but they don’t change the fact that when it comes to women, I’m in over my head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;And whether you realize it or not, the rest of you Neanderthals out there are in the same boat. You would be aware of it, if you’d only listen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Therein lies the root of the problem for most relationships. Women listen to what men say, but men don’t listen to what women say. Or at least that’s what The Wife told me last weekend. Come to find out she had told me the same thing two weeks ago. Apparently, I wasn’t listening. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Other than my being a Neanderthal, The Wife has come up with a plausible answer as to why I don’t listen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Hair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Yes, hair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;It seems for some reason the older I get, the more hair falls out of my head and lands in my ears. Once there it takes root, grows like a weed, and blocks sound waves from entering.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a joke, obviously, and so Rick's column has no footnotes citing the &lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22ear+canal+hair%22+&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;as_sdt=800000000000&amp;amp;as_ylo=&amp;amp;as_vis=0"&gt;extensive scientific literature on sex differences in ear-canal hair&lt;/a&gt;.  (Yes, there really are some, though Rick's not going to get off the hook by citing them.)  But most of the other references are serious in their attribution of male acoustic inattention to biological sex differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common trope is that males&amp;#39; hearing is simply less sensitive than females&amp;#39; hearing is. I discussed one instance of this idea — coming mainly from Dr. Leonard Sax — in &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=260"&gt;an earlier post&lt;/a&gt; and some links therein. Summarizing the (non-)evidence: there is no functionally significant difference between human males and females in auditory sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the "Men don't listen" idea is a powerful one, and there are plenty of other confidently-asserted biological explanations besides ear-canal hair and hearing-threshold differences. In particular, there are some fine specimens in Louann Brizendine's new book &lt;em&gt;The Male Brain&lt;/em&gt;. The relevant section is on pp. 40-41, under the heading &lt;em&gt;Tuning Out&lt;/em&gt;. (I've added numbers in square brackets to link to the endnotes, which in the book are on p. 150.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The teen male not only sees faces differently than he did as a boy; he also begins to perceive voices and other sounds differently than he did before adolescence[1]. And his changing hormones can make him hear things differently than girls his age. In Portugal, researchers found that during puberty, estrogen surges in females and testosterone surges in males increase the hearing differences between girls' and boys' brains[2], but the main difference is that some simple sounds, like white noise, are processed differently in the male brain. Liesbet Ruytjens and colleagues in the Netherlands compared the brain activity of seventeen- to twenty-five-year-old males and females as they processed the sound of white noise and as they processed the sound of music[3]. The female brains intensely activated to both the white noise and the music. The male brains, too, activated to the music, but they &lt;em&gt;deactivated&lt;/em&gt; to the white noise. It was as if they didn&amp;#39;t even hear it. The screening system in their male brains was automatically turning off white noise. Scientists have learned that during male fetal brain development, testosterone affects the formation of the auditory system and the connections within the brain, making it inhibit unwanted &amp;quot;noise&amp;quot; and repetitious acoustic stimuli more than the female brain does[4]. I tease my husband that his brain&amp;#39;s acoustic system seems to automatically shut down when I start repeating myself — it&amp;#39;s registering in his brain as white noise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Likewise, when Zoe and her friends talked endlessly about movies, fashion, and other girls, their combined voices just sounded like humming and buzzing to Jake's ears. For him and the other guys, following the girls' rapid musical banter was practically impossible[5]. The best they could do was nod their heads and pretend to be listening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;Note [1], explaining the assertion that "&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The teen male … begins to perceive voices and other sounds differently than he did before adolescence&lt;/span&gt;", cashes out to Krystyna Rymarczyk and Anna Grabowska, "&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.08.021"&gt;Sex differences in brain control of prosody&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychologia&lt;/em&gt; 45(5):921-930, 2007.
&lt;p&gt;There are two really weird things about this reference. First, it&amp;#39;s got nothing to do with changes in teens, male or otherwise — it documents a study whose subjects were all in their late 50s to mid 60s, two thirds of whom had suffered serious strokes of various sorts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Fifty-two individuals (28 men and 24 women) with unilateral infarction involving the right cerebral hemisphere and 26 (11 men and 15 women) neurologically intact controls (C) participated in this study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the study found no sex differences of any kind in the intact control subjects. The only differences had to do with interactions between sex and various areas of brain injury:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Post hoc analysis of the group × sex interaction demonstrated that women with frontal damage performed worse in both the linguistic and affective prosody tests than men with frontal damage (p &amp;lt; 0.002), whereas subcortical lesions produced greater impairment in men (p &amp;lt; 0.001) (Fig. 2). No other sex differences reached statistical significance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of you (if you&amp;#39;re still with me) will probably want to peel off at this point — or skip ahead to the discussion at the end of the post — satisfied that Dr. Brizendine&amp;#39;s new book is more of the same sort of &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7112/full/443634a.html"&gt;psychoneuroindoctrinology&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; found in her first book, in which the  pages and pages of endnotes and references are a sort of Potemkin Village of scientific pretense laid out in support of banal gender stereotypes. But in fairness to Brizendine — and to her readers — I feel compelled to go on with the note-checking to the end of this passage, and perhaps a few of you will want to come along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's some interesting science along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;Note [2], backing up the assertions that "&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In Portugal, researchers found that during puberty, estrogen surges in females and testosterone surges in males increase the hearing differences between girls' and boys' brains&lt;/span&gt;", reads:
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Rymarczyk 2007 found a sex difference in the brain's processing of tone of voice. For more on sex differences in brain chemistry and the sex-determining gene located on the Y chromosome, see Wu 2009 and Pau 2009.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third weird thing: none of the notes relating to these paragraphs seem to reference any work done in Portugal. Either the author neglected to include a reference, or there's a reference somewhere earlier that I've missed, or there was some other lapse on her part or on mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rymarczyk 2007 is the the same paper just discussed, and again, there's nothing in it about hormone surges in teens. Its conclusion, again,  is that (in 60-ish subjects)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;We examined the possibility that the effectiveness of prosody processing may differ between the sexes. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find any significant differences in the ability of healthy men and women to comprehend emotional intonation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the paper&amp;#39;s authors are based at the Department of Neurophysiology, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Warsaw, Poland. Which starts with the same letter as Portugal, but still…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu 2009 cashes out as M.V. Wu et al., "&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.036"&gt;Estrogen masculinizes neural pathways and sex-specific behaviors&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; 139(1):61-72, 2009, which is about "activating male-specific aggression and urine marking" in mice, and concludes that "aromatization of testosterone into estrogen is important for the development and activation of neural circuits that control male territorial behaviors". There's nothing in it about hearing, auditory attention, or humans. Its authors are all at UCSF or in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pau 2009 apparently cashes out as T.I. Paus et al., "&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2009.08.004"&gt;Sexual dimorphism in the adolescent brain: Role of testosterone and androgen receptor in global and local volumes of grey and white matter&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Hormones and Behavior&lt;/em&gt; 57(1) 2010. (It was published online during 2009.) This study comes to some general conclusions about sex differences in brain anatomy, as summarized in this table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/PausTable3.png" alt="" align="center"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it relates this differences to testosterone levels among adolescents, as summarized in this graph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/PausFig3.jpeg" alt="" align="center"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Absolute and relative volumes of white matter (top half) and grey matter (bottom half) plotted as a function of bioavailable testosterone (in nmol/L) in male adolescents with the short (left column) and long (right column) variant of the androgen-receptor gene. The lines represent the regression equation with 95% confidence intervals. R2 indicate the amount of variance in the respective volume explained by testosterone and p-values indicate statistical significance of a given correlation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is extremely interesting, but there's nothing about effects on hearing. And the authors are based in Nottingham, Quebec, and Penn State, none of which are in Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;Note [3] backs up the assertion that in a study in the Netherlands, "&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;female brains intensely activated to both the white noise and the music. The male brains, too, activated to the music, but they deactivated to the white noise. It was as if they didn't even hear it. The screening system in their male brains was automatically turning off white noise&lt;/span&gt;".
&lt;p&gt;The note reads&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Ruytjens 2007 found the male brain screened out white noise better than the female brain. For more on gender differences in auditory processing, see Voyer 2001 and Ikezawa 2008.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That first reference cashes out to L. Ruytjens et al., "&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2100432/"&gt;Functional sex differences in human primary auditory cortex&lt;/a&gt;", Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 34(12):2073-81, 2007. The abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;We found a sex difference in activation of the left and right PAC ["primary auditory cortex"] when comparing music to noise. The PAC was more activated by music than by noise in both men and women. But this difference between the two stimuli was significantly higher in men than in women. To investigate whether this difference could be attributed to either music or noise, we compared both stimuli with the baseline and revealed that noise gave a significantly higher activation in the female PAC than in the male PAC. Moreover, the male group showed a deactivation in the right prefrontal cortex when comparing noise to the baseline, which was not present in the female group. Interestingly, the auditory and prefrontal regions are anatomically and functionally linked and the prefrontal cortex is known to be engaged in auditory tasks that involve sustained or selective auditory attention. Thus we hypothesize that differences in attention result in a different deactivation of the right prefrontal cortex, which in turn modulates the activation of the PAC and thus explains the sex differences found in the activation of the PAC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally something relevant to hearing and attention! But the male "deactivation" (relative to baseline) was just in the right prefrontal cortex, not in the brain as a whole. And the difference in PAC responses was only found  to be significant in an ROI ("region of interest") analysis, not in an overall SPM ("statistical parametric modeling") analysis, because "The ROI analysis pools the data of all voxels in the PAC and gives a reduced standard error, resulting in a higher t-value and hence more power".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are their figures showing the ROI differences in the PAC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/RuytjensFig2.jpeg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the pretty blue prefrontal region of decreased activation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/RuytjensFig4.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's not clear to me about this was whether it's a reproducible fact about men vs. women, or a fact about these particular 10 men and 10 women and their responses to this particular experiment. Specifically, did the men "tune out" the white noise (to a degree) because that's the way their brains are built, or because that's how (some of them) felt about this experiment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not an idle question. In an &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=171"&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt;, I documented a study where a simple change in the instructions to subjects — whether or not to pay attention to the content of a broadcast — completely reversed the sex difference in &amp;quot;most comfortable listening level&amp;quot;. Without the instruction to pay attention, the females&amp;#39; MCL was 10.8 dB lower than the males&amp;#39; — but with the instruction, it was 9.7 dB &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;higher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;WITH&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;WITHOUT&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Male&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;47.9 (10.1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;50.4 (13.1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Female&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;57.6 (12.5)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;41.2 (9.4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of attentional effect would almost certainly show up in PET scans, but it might very well be a cultural difference, or at least one having more to do with assiduousness in following experimenters' instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brizendine's additional references "&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Voyer 2001 and Ikezawa 2008&lt;/span&gt;" are D. Voyer and J. Flight, "&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70578-1"&gt;Gender differences in laterality on a dichotic task: The influence of report strategies&lt;/a&gt;", Cortex 37(3):345-62; and S. Ikezawa et al., "&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.01.006"&gt;Gender differences in lateralization of mismatch negativity in dichotic listening tasks&lt;/a&gt;", International Journal of Psychophysiology 68(1)41-50, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of these papers (whose authors are based in New Brunswick, Canada) emphasizes the just-noted effect of instructions, in four different versions of encounters with the same stimuli:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;It was hypothesized that improved control of report strategies would increase the likelihood of detecting significant gender differences in laterality. This was confirmed when results showed no significant gender differences in laterality for the free recall and order of report control conditions, whereas focused attention produced marginal gender differences and clearly significant differences were obtained in the ABX discrimination condition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second paper (whose authors are based in Japan) found that "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mismatch_negativity"&gt;mismatch negativity&lt;/a&gt;" (an ERP indication of the pre-attentive detection of "oddball" acoustic stimuli) is not lateralized for tones in either sex, but is lateralized to a much greater extent for males than for females in the case of phonetic stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither paper tells us anything relevant about brain structures or mechanisms that would explain an increased male propensity or ability to "tune out" uninteresting sounds, or a testosterone-driven inability to focus on female voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;Note [4], backing up the assertion that "&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Scientists have learned that during male fetal brain development, testosterone affects the formation of the auditory system and the connections within the brain, making it inhibit unwanted "noise" and repetitious acoustic stimuli more than the female brain does&lt;/span&gt;", is again Ruytjens 2007. The note adds:
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;For more on fetal brain development and the effects of testosterone on hearing, see Beech 2006 and Cohen-Bendahan 2004.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's J.R. Beech and M.W. Beauvois, "&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bandl.2005.08.006"&gt;Early experience of sex hormones as a predictor of reading, phonology, and auditory perception&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Brain and Language&lt;/em&gt; 96(1):49-58; and C.C. Cohen-Bendahan et al., "&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2003.07.001"&gt;Prenatal exposure to testosterone and functional cerebral lateralization: A study in same-sex and opposite-sex girl twins&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Psychoneuroendocrinology&lt;/em&gt; 29(7):911-16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beech and Beauvois paper (whose authors are based in Leicester) examines the relation of finger-length ratios (which are believed in turn to correlate with fetal testosterone) to performance on various auditory and linguistic tasks. In some cases there are significant effects, and in others cases not. The key hypothesis (which remains somewhat controversial) relates to "possible effects of androgens on early brain development impairing aspects of the temporal processing of sounds by the left hemisphere", which is a reference to Paula Tallal's theory that the left hemisphere of the brain is specialized for processing more rapidly-changing sounds. There's nothing relevant to male "tuning out".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cohen-Bendahan et al. paper (whose authors are based in the Netherlands and the UK) uses dichotic lateralization as a way to argue for the effects of prenatal testosterone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;An auditory–verbal dichotic listening task (DLT) was used as an indirect method to study hemispheric specialization. Firstly, we established a sex difference on the DLT. Compared with SS girls, OS twin boys showed a more lateralized pattern of processing verbal stimuli. Secondly, as predicted OS girls had a more masculine pattern of cerebral lateralization, than SS girls. These findings support the notion of an influence of prenatal T on early brain organization in girls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their Figure 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Cohen-BendahanFig1.gif" alt="" align="center"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Scattergram of the Laterality Index (LI; Lambda) as measured with the Dichotic Listening Task (DLT) for the Opposite-sex (OS) girls, Same-sex (SS) girls, and OS boys. The error bar represents the 95% mean confidence interval LI for each group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the effect is persuasive, but not nearly categorical enough to motivate generic-plural statements about "male brains" and "female brains".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;Note [5] backs up the assertion that "&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;when Zoe and her friends talked endlessly about movies, fashion, and other girls, their combined voices just sounded like humming and buzzing to Jake's ears. For him and the other guys, following the girls' rapid musical banter was practically impossible.&lt;/span&gt;"
&lt;p&gt;The note reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Schirmer 2002 studied sex differences in neural processing of emotional words, and found the tone and meaning of emotional words were processed faster in females than in males.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's A. Schirmer et al., "&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0926-6410(02)00108-8"&gt;Sex differentiates the role of emotional prosody during word processing&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Cognitive Brain Research&lt;/em&gt; 14(2):228-33.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you probably won't be surprised to learn that there's nothing whatever in that paper (whose authors are based in Leipzig) to support the notion that girls' "combined voices just [sound] like humming and buzzing" to teen male ears. Nor does the research even support the weaker position that "the tone and meaning of emotional words were processed faster in females than in males".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, lexical decision time (how long it takes to determine whether a stimulus is a word or not) was the dependent variable. The independent variables included whether words have a semantically "positive" or "negative" meaning (i.e. have happy or unhappy associations); whether they were preceded by an irrelevant (and semantically neutral) "priming" sentence produced with  a "happy" or "sad" intonation; and whether the priming sentence was 0.2 seconds before the target word, or 0.75 seconds before it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/SchirmerFig2.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Mean reaction times (±1 S.E.M.) for lexical decisions plotted as a function of target valence. Open circles together with dotted lines indicate a positive prime prosody, closed circles together with solid lines indicate a negative prime prosody. Experiment 1 (ISI 200 ms) is presented in (a), male subjects and (b), female subjects. Experiment 2 (ISI 750 ms) is presented in (c), male subjects and (d), female subjects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sex differences were fairly small in all conditions — all the differences appear to be within a standard error, which since there were 16 subjects of each sex means that the biggest sex differences were about a quarter of standard deviation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to describe the differences would be this. At the short (200 msec) inter-stimulus interval, the responses of the male subjects were (taken as a whole)  unaffected by the (happy or sad) prosody of the priming sentences. The only effect for the male subjects (in the short-ISI condition) was that positive-meaning target words were slightly slower than negative-meaning words. The female subjects (in the short-ISI condition) behaved roughly like the males (though  they reacted a little more slower) for the positive-prime prosody words, but for the words primed with a negative-prosody sentence, the positive-meaning words were on average a bit slower than the negative-meaning words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the long (750 msec) ISI, the patterns of the male and female subjects were roughly reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors interpret this to suggest that the effect of the "happy" or "sad" intonation of the priming sentence was taking a few tenths of a second longer to affect the behavior of the males than the females. This is plausible, though other explanations also come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in any case, it&amp;#39;s not true that &amp;quot;the tone and meaning of emotional words were processed faster in females&amp;quot; — in the short ISI experiment, the word meanings seem to be processed faster by the males, though it&amp;#39;s plausible that the intonational priming is taking longer to have an effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there's certainly nothing about this at all that provides any support whatever for the view that teen boys can only perceive teen girls' speech as meaningless "humming and buzzing".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: So is it true that men tend to "tune out" what women say, more than women tend to "tune out" what men say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: I'm not sure. This is certainly something that many people believe. Of course, many people believe that Blacks are lazy, Jews are greedy, Irish are drunks, Poles are stupid, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: If it's true, is it because men have less sensitive hearing, or because they simply can't process women's voices very well, at least after puberty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: No, both of those ideas are complete nonsense, as far as I can tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Could it be because men are generally better than women are at focusing their attention so as to ignore auditory stimuli that they find uninteresting or obnoxious?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Maybe — but the evidence for this is meager at best. In particular, I don&amp;#39;t know of any direct tests of the hypothesis. The only relevant evidence that Brizendine cites comes from a study where a small number of subjects were made to listen to music and to white noise, without being given any particular reasons or motivations to attend closely to any of the stimuli. (&amp;quot;Subjects were instructed to close their eyes, not to move during the scans, and to listen to the auditory stimuli&amp;quot;, but there was no task that tested whether they attended or not.)  PET scans suggested that the males tended to tune out the white noise more than the females did. The subjects were 10 male and female Dutch university students (whose backgrounds are not clear — perhaps the males were mostly drawn from a different subject area than the females?), in the context of an experiment run by women; so the universality of the results is open to question, as usual in sex-difference experiments done by psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Are there any other biological explanations still in the running?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: The effect of sex differences in ear-canal hair has never actually been tested, as far as I know. Really, old guys do tend to get hair in their ears. Must be there for something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Is there any plausible reason to expect the biology to work according to this stereotype?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Some have suggested that maybe there was an evolutionary advantage for (putatively male) hunters to be able to "tune out" irrelevant stimuli so as to keep their attention focused on potential prey animals. As with most other such plausible stories, there's no evidence for this, as far as I know. And I suppose that you could make an equally plausible argument about how our female ancestors needed to be able to ignore distracting stimuli while engaged in delicate (putatively female) tasks like spinning, weaving and sewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Might there be historical or cultural reasons for the stereotype of male inattention to female speech?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: You tell me…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;Well, in the unlikely event that you're still reading, you've wasted another perfectly good hour on yet another application of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1378"&gt;explanatory neurophilia&lt;/a&gt; to gender stereotypes. Of course, wonky biological explanations are often &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=49"&gt;cited in other areas&lt;/a&gt; as well:

&lt;p&gt;Note that in this case, it's the mom who "doesn't listen". Maybe she was exposed to too much of her son's fetal testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270379224071"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=13212">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d1353e1fb520c9a8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Random Asides"/><category term="Science"/><category term="YouTube"/><category term="butt plugs"/><title type="html">Doctor Who’s New TARDIS (NSFW?)</title><published>2010-04-04T10:44:34Z</published><updated>2010-04-04T10:44:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/doctor-whos-new-tardis-nsfw/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy Easter, everyone!

I’m taking a little holiday to catch up on some other projects (and yes, for a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychronicity"&gt;polychronic person like myself&lt;/a&gt;, I assure you I’ll be keeping busy)! I’ll re-post a few links to some of my classic blog-posts so you can check out my archives if you’re new to my site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime? I’m certain that many of you have read the stories already. There’s quite a few, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/thank-god-were-not-all-atheists-archbishop-says-20100401-ri4q.html"&gt;“Thank God We’re Not All Atheists” says new Parramatta Archbishop:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Godlessness and secularism led to Nazism, Stalinism, mass murder and abortion, according to Anthony Fisher, the new bishop of Parramatta, who has used his inaugural Easter message to launch a scathing attack on atheism, while ignoring the sex abuse scandals besieging the Catholic Church worldwide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and &lt;a href="http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/secular-society-fast-track-to-loneliness-20100404-rl82.html"&gt;‘Secular society fast track to loneliness’&lt;/a&gt; – funny, just when I’ve found all kinds of &lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org.au"&gt;new contacts due to being at the GAC &lt;/a&gt;and enjoyed a weekend meeting with the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Perth-atheists"&gt;Perth Atheists&lt;/a&gt; who are planning more social activities and helping formalise a new group for atheists nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheists apparently don’t have charities either? Even though many of us &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2010/01/little-kitten-s-h-a-r-e-program-to-support-doctors-without-borders/"&gt;openly promoted helping out groups like ‘Doctors Without Borders’ during the Haiti tragedy&lt;/a&gt; and news items like  ‘&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/us/03religion.html"&gt;Atheists’ Collection Plate, With Religious Inspiration’&lt;/a&gt; talk about groups like &lt;a href="http://foundationbeyondbelief.org/"&gt;Foundation Beyond Belief&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://news.guelphmercury.com/News/Local/article/615014"&gt;CFI&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the Young Australian Skeptics are under attack – Andrew Bolt, ‘&lt;a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/none_so_blind_as_the_atheist_who_will_not_see/"&gt;None  so blind as the atheist who will not see&lt;/a&gt;‘:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiU-30qX3nw"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiU-30qX3nw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I can certainly say the video is NOT doctored – I am the woman who is standing next to Prof. Richard Dawkins in this film. &lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, &lt;a title="Atheists hit back at clergy criticism of non-belief" href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/atheists-hit-back-at-clergy-criticism-of-nonbelief-20100402-rjmr.html"&gt;Atheists hit back at clergy criticism of non-belief:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr Nicholls said atheists made contributions to society like any other citizen. “Atheists are not out to Stalinise or bring Nazism into the world,” he said. A spokesman for Dr Jensen denied a coordinated attack by the churchmen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;He said the remarks were likely to have been spurred by the recent Rise of Atheism conference held in Melbourne, which attracted 2,500 non-believers and featured renowned figurehead Richard Dawkins.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Christopher Hitchens speaks out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oFp21ryzs4"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oFp21ryzs4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ll leave the summary to Thinker’s Podium blog, from their post, “&lt;a href="http://thinkerspodium.wordpress.com/2010/04/03/thankyou-mr-pell-mr-fisher-dr-jensen-2/"&gt;Thankyou Dr Jensen, Mr Pell, Mr Fisher – Happy Easter!&lt;/a&gt;“:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a win for secularism. Thanks to the credibility of Dr Jensen, Mr Pell and Mr Fisher, the issue – sectarian privilege and contempt over and toward atheists – is now out there in the mainstream; open for discussion. It was never was a fringe concern, and now for the first time, it really doesn’t look like one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I really, quite sincerely, thank these men for sacrificing part of their holy weekend to make functional secularism (and the secular provision of welfare – thank you Mr Pell!) a hot topic.

How can you not feel a bit awed when you think about how Jesus so loved the world that he came back from the dead in order to &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/europe/25vatican.html?hp"&gt;molest deaf children&lt;/a&gt;?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the whole celebration is under a bit of a cloud this year, what with all the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/mar/28/pope-benedict-sexual-abuse-scandal"&gt;petty gossip&lt;/a&gt; about the Pope’s complicity in covering up sexual abuse by pedophile priests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally think it’s a bit unfair for us to focus so much energy on his role in the sexual abuse scandals while ignoring his role in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plame_Affair"&gt;Plame affair&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Vince_Foster"&gt;Vince Foster murder&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscam"&gt;Abscam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t really matter, though, as it looks like the Pope will be able to use his &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36131434/ns/world_news-europe/"&gt;diplomatic immunity&lt;/a&gt; card to get out of jail free:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The pope is certainly a head of state, who has the same juridical status as all heads of state,” he said, arguing he therefore had immunity from foreign courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, obviously this isn’t on the same level as &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; egregious diplomatic immunity abuses like &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiXNUaSjXRY&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;the end of &lt;i&gt;Lethal Weapon 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://lawandorder.wikia.com/wiki/Parasites"&gt;the “Law and Order: SVU” episode about Romanian wife-smuggling&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity#Vehicular"&gt;unpaid parking tickets&lt;/a&gt;.  But it still puts him out of our reach, unless maybe we can spare some Marines from Afghanistan, which &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/03/28/obama.afghanistan/index.html"&gt;doesn’t appear to be in the cards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves our hopes in the hands of rank-and-file Catholics, who could quickly and peacefully put a halt to both the priests-touching-boys and the pope-covering-up-for-priests-touching-boys problems by quitting the church.  Without parishioners, it would quickly go out of business and could be replaced by slightly less criminal churches.  (This is what economists call “creative destruction,” although in today’s world there’s always the possibility that Tim Geithner or Ben Bernanke might decide the Church is “too big to fail” and try to save it using our tax dollars.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be other benefits as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Springtime lunch options no longer restricted to crappy &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/LilStephie/status/9022822016"&gt;Quiznos Lenten menu&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Sunday mornings suddenly free to watch “America Quilts Creatively” on PBS
&lt;li&gt; No more germy Christ-blood sharing means slower spread of communicable diseases
&lt;li&gt; Savings from not tithing could be donated to help &lt;a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/282247"&gt;pay off national debt&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Prime Catholic real estate in Rome could be repurposed into something everyone can enjoy, like a Starbucks.
&lt;li&gt; If we’re lucky, no more Dan Brown books.
&lt;li&gt; Deep sense of satisfaction from no longer devoting life to false beliefs.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catholics, won’t you think about it?  If you won’t do it for me, then do it for the children!  Or maybe for Dan Brown!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and happy Easter!&lt;/p&gt;

My initial impression was that it’s pretty much exactly what it looked like: a big-ass iPod Touch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few immediately obvious ramifications of the much larger size. For one, web browsing is much less unpleasant. On a phone-sized screen there’s all this pinching and zooming, and slow loading even on Wi-Fi. It’s painful. The iPad is large enough that it’s substantially better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also feels much faster. I don’t know what’s under the hood, but you get the feeling that the larger form factor allowed for a better processor, probably because it could fit a much larger battery. It’s pretty responsive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The larger size changes the keyboard as well. It’s kind of awkward really because the device is too large to allow for thumb typing, Blackberry style, like you would on the iPhone, but even in landscape mode it’s much too small to just sit down on a table and type on like a normal keyboard. I think on the whole it might actually be worse than typing on a phone-sized screen just because it feels like it should be better and isn’t. I hate virtual keypads though, so if you’re one of those nut jobs who claims to like typing on an iPhone as much as a normal keyboard, your mileage might vary.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not a total fanboy, you might not care for it too much, but probably won’t hate it simply because you won’t be doing too much typing. The device is not going to replace your laptop. The lack of multitasking ensures that. Using a Palm Pre has me spoiled, and I kept clicking the center button to switch from one task to another only to find it close what I was using. I guess if I were an iPhone user I wouldn’t have that problem, but I still wouldn’t be leaving my Lenovo at home on a trip. The iPad might be used in its place on the plane though.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading on it is much like reading on a computer monitor, and a good one. Great for short periods, but I don’t think I’d want to read a novel on it but for just a little web surfing or news browsing it’s fantastic. So if you’re using a Kindle, I don’t think the iPad’s going to replace it, anymore than your iPod replaced your vinyl collection. It’s just a different style of device.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It lacks Flash, which is unfortunate because the screen is large enough that casual games might be great on it. I tried watching Hulu on it and couldn’t, which made me frown, but there’s a YouTube app so if Avril Lavigne videos are your thing, you’re set. In fact this might be the ultimate kittens-on-treadmills viewing device.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy at Best Buy said they had gotten in 25 of each model. The cheapest one (16 GB) sold out but the others were still in stock. I suspect the vast majority of the demand will be at the lowest price point, and that’s understandable. Overall the iPad seems like a cool toy but not much more. And, not $500 cool.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it were $200 I could see it having a place in the living room. I don’t think I’d ever bother taking it anywhere (expect maybe a plane, which it seems almost designed for) because it’s not much better than a phone for casual browsing on the go. But for Googling to find out what happened in the previous episode of Lost while you’re watching the current one and eating cheese straight from the can in your recliner, you really can’t beat a big-ass iPod Touch.&lt;/p&gt;

Sean has been arguing (&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/03/24/the-moral-equivalent-of-the-parallel-postulate/trackback/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/03/29/sam-harris-responds/trackback/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) that science does not give us morality. And, as the Pope and the Catholic Church have &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_sexual_abuse_scandal_in_the_United_States"&gt;resoundingly demonstrated&lt;/a&gt;, God doesn’t seem to provide us with morality either. None of this means that we shouldn’t strive to make the world a better place. Nor that we can’t say that the Holocaust was evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nabrdalik.com/"&gt;Maciek Nabrdalik&lt;/a&gt; has been photographing survivors of the Nazi concentration camps. Nabrdalik is quoted in a &lt;a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/showcase-146/"&gt;New York Times blog&lt;/a&gt;: “I believe that by looking into their eyes, a sharper perspective will appear and perhaps help us understand the nature of the enormity of this atrocity a little bit better,” Mr. Nabrdalik said. “Understand it on a human scale, that is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photographs show only shining faces, surrounded by an encroaching blackness. Perhaps the blackness represents the horrors they have experienced. Perhaps the blackness represents the fact that the number of survivors is dwindling, and soon there’ll be no one left to remind us of one of the worst examples of man’s inhumanity to man. All that will be left is darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

As a frog in winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:90px"&gt;Consider that this has been:&lt;br&gt;
I commend these words to you.&lt;br&gt;
Engrave them on your hearts&lt;br&gt;
When you are in your house, when you walk on your way,&lt;br&gt;
When you go to bed, when you rise.&lt;br&gt;
Repeat them to your children.&lt;br&gt;
Or may your house crumble,&lt;br&gt;
Disease render you powerless,&lt;br&gt;
Your offspring avert their faces from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now here’s the students of Palo Alto’s’ Gunn High School, who saw the WBC’s protest as an opportunity to come together in unity to send a powerful message of tolerance. Great job, guys!&lt;/p&gt;

I'm sure it probably has a traditional name; the fannish authors of Christian dogma over the centuries are far too meticulous to leave such an obvious day unnamed and uncatalogued. But that name is at least uncommon enough that I've never heard it or seen it referenced anywhere. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I were to offer a cynical suspicion, I'd say that Christians don't want to draw attention to it. After all, this Saturday represents o e of the most obvious and silly contradictions in the Christian narrative. According to the story, Jesus was crucified sometime on Friday (exactly when depends on which gospel you read), buried in a cave where he lay for three days, and then resurrected on Sunday morning. No matter how you slice it, there's no way to squeeze the necessary number of days out of that schedule. It's a trivial mistake, only significant because of how much emphasis is placed on the "three days in the tomb" part of the story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I propose a name for this Saturday, a magical day that somehow became two: &lt;b&gt;Lengthy Saturday&lt;/b&gt;. Go ye now and celebrate it in the traditional fashion: by pointing out the silliness and inconsistencies of the 'inerrant' book that serves as the foundation of monotheism. Just don't forget that, regardless of the story, there's still only 24 hours in this day, just like any other.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20494433-6975810668382964393?l=dubitoergo.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Foss</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Dubito Ergo Sum</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270341682366"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=13210">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d5cb31c4e0e1c155</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">AI: More weekend please!</title><published>2010-04-04T00:19:17Z</published><updated>2010-04-04T00:19:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/ai-more-weekend-please/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ed3b633b3ae45bd985c3032e0ea349f0&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is late.

&lt;p&gt;Well, an alert reader, anthropologist Ciarán Brewster from University College Cork, has done the proper statistical analysis of the brain-size data.  Over at his website, &lt;a href="http://adhominin.com/index.php?id=6556107719700163193"&gt;Ad Hominin&lt;/a&gt;, Brewster shows that there is indeed an inhomogeneity in brain evolution, and that the pace of brain-size increase did indeed pick up about 200,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Blakemore’s assertion about the acceleration was correct.  But of course this says nothing about whether that acceleration reflected the fixation of a macromutation, which I consider very unlikely for reasons I’ve already mentioned.  And Blakemore’s theory that any brain-size “macromutation” was initially neutral, and became advantageous only after it had already been fixed in our lineage by random processes (e.g., genetic drift), is pretty outlandish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that Brewster doesn’t discuss is whether that accelerated brain-size evolution was correlated with accelerated &lt;em&gt;body-size&lt;/em&gt; evolution.  If brains got bigger simply because bigger bodies produce bigger brains as a byproduct (this is what we geneticists call a “pleiotropic effect”), and if for some reason bodies were selected to get bigger around 200,000 years ago, then it’s not necessary to posit that there was something selecting for bigger brains &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. (Of course, increased body size could also be a byproduct of increased brain size!)  I don’t know if this is likely given the data, but it’s something to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:18px"&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the First Amendment appears simple, as The Reverend Jennifer points out, &lt;a href="http://return-to-reason.blogspot.com/2010/03/true-meaning-of-establishment-clause.html#links"&gt;its meaning has been debated.&lt;/a&gt;  Findlaw has&lt;a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment01/01.html#2"&gt; more commentary on the religion aspect.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me, freedom to worship as you wish -- including no worship at all -- is central to the American experience.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans United for Separation of Church and State, &lt;a href="http://www.au.org/"&gt;http://www.au.org/&lt;/a&gt;,  work to make the first phrase a reality not just one day, but day in and day out, as does First Freedom First, &lt;a href="http://www.firstfreedomfirst.org/"&gt;http://www.firstfreedomfirst.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally the weekend of Easter has been time for a &lt;a&gt;blog-swarm on the theme of the first amendment.

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost missed it, as I forgot that it&amp;#39;s always scheduled for the weekend of Easter (not a big holiday in this secularist&amp;#39;s calendar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a blogswarm dedicated to the separation of church and state.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is not a blogswarm against religion. Bloggers who believe in religion and those who don&amp;#39;t are equally welcome here. What we share is a common commitment to the First Amendment to the Constitution and its guarantee of church-state separation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

How could you pick among &lt;a href="http://www.onlinecolleges.net/2010/03/21/whos-that-deity/"&gt;this wealth of deities?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite of the images I made &lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2007/03/blog_for_separa.html"&gt;for the 2007 event.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/04/03/easter.atheists/?hpt=Mid"&gt;CNN covered the story today&lt;/a&gt; and there are some amusing soundbytes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“We have a lot of wonderful people,” [AA spokesperson David Silverman] said. “I haven’t sacrificed any Christian babies. I haven’t danced naked under the stars. I haven’t stolen anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He takes pains to say that atheists respect those who believe otherwise. But if that’s so, why hold a convention on Easter weekend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silverman chuckled at the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a slam against Easter,” he said. “We always have our national convention on Easter weekend. The hotels are cheap, and everybody has time off.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s not like atheists had any other big plans for the weekend &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: gotta love how CNN used the following as their pullout quotations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Pullout.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Pullout.png" alt="" title="SilvermanQuotation" width="215" height="106"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, relatively positive press.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sad I couldn’t make it to NJ this weekend but from what I hear, attendees are having a great time.&lt;br&gt;

I have a nice piece in the works for Sunday or Monday which is brand, spanking new.  This was originally published on 5/6/2009. --PalMD&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some bad ideas refuse to die.  Others die and then come back to eat your brains.  Of course, zombies don't just rise from the grave for no reason.  They need some sort of animating principle, like meteors, puffer fish toxin, a voodoo priestess, or all three.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/upload/2009/05/Zombies_NightoftheLivingDead.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Zombies_NightoftheLivingDead.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain-eating, measles-promoting zombies. &lt;em&gt;Not pictured: Andrew Wakefield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
I'm sure Oprah can afford any or all of these, and she's certainly putting them to work.  The latest reanimation from Oprah's Harpo Studios is Jenny McCarthy, Queen of the Undead, at least as far as the army of infectious disease promoters goes.  You see, not only has Jenny been spreading lies about public health, her activities have breathed fresh life into infectious diseases that were "mostly dead".  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/mccarthy---where_does_the_dang.php"&gt;She even admits&lt;/a&gt; that increasing the incidence of dangerous infectious diseases is a likely consequence of her actions.  Hell, she &lt;i&gt;revels&lt;/i&gt; in it.  

&lt;p&gt;So Oprah, Queen of TV woo, with friends like Mehmet Oz and Christine Northrup, is helping to keep alive the Bad Idea that Wouldn't Die.  Oprah is in a very powerful position, as we all know.  If she brings out the Jenny, people will listen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when people listen to Jenny, children die.   It's really that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thanks, Oprah.  Thanks for raising a zombie army of people who would rather we sicken and die of infectious diseases because of their own baseless fears.  Our brains will never be safe again.&lt;br&gt;

He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A recent blog entry from Pascale H. Lane discusses her &lt;a href="http://pascalesthoughts.blogspot.com/2010/03/membership-has-its-benefits.html"&gt;reasons 
for belonging to academic societies&lt;/a&gt;. Our good blog friend Dr. Isis is 
frequently found to be &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/09/join_martin_frank_at_the_aps_i.php"&gt;going&lt;/a&gt; 
all &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/03/help_dr_isis_fund_an_award_for.php"&gt;fangrrl&lt;/a&gt; 
about the APS (no, not &lt;a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/"&gt;the real 
APS&lt;/a&gt;, these &lt;a href="http://www.the-aps.org/"&gt;Physiological pretenders&lt;/a&gt; 
who are well down the GoogJuice list). &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to this, Dr. Marty Frank, Executive Director of the APS, made an appearance in the comments section.  He replied:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I must defend the honor of our Dr. Isis and address DrugMonkey's comment that 
"Dr. Isis is frequently found to be going all fangrrl about the APS (no, not the 
real APS,...). Who is the real APS - the American Physical Society, the American 
Psychological Society, the American Peptide Society? There are too many of us to 
keep track. I suspect that Drug Monkey is alluding to those physics folks since 
their URL is APS.ORG. But they weren't founded until 1899, 12 years after the 
founding of t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;he society for physiologists. We are the ones who should be 
APS.ORG. Unfortunately, the physicists created the internet, along with Al Gore, 
so they got there first. We got stuck with The-APS.org instead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;As for Dr. Isis, we love her and she is a great inspiration for students, 
postdocs and faculty seeking insights and advice. I am just upset that she only 
features hot shoes for women. What about us guys? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is just like a man to see a conversation aimed at women and demand to be included.  However, because Marty did say some incredibly flattering things about everyone&amp;#39;s favorite domestic and laboratory goddess, and because I am afraid he might show up to &lt;a href="http://experimentalbiology.org/"&gt;Experimental Biology&lt;/a&gt; in shoes that look like &lt;a href="http://steynian.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/clown-shoes-red-yellow500.jpg"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; unless we can lend him a hand, this week's shoe offering will be for the boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First thing&amp;#39;s first.  I want us to all understand and agree that these are never acceptable:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="breaker sandals.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/breaker%20sandals.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="350" height="350"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: Stacy Adam&amp;#39;s Breaker Sandal.  $75.00 at &lt;a href="http://www.shoes.com/Shopping/ProductDetails.aspx?p=EC1205587"&gt;shoes.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was in graduate school, one of my committee members wore shoes like these every summer.  I knew he was coming to see me and give me shit about something because I would be able to hear the heels of his man sandals clicking down the hall.  It would be then that I would turn and see him standing at my doorway, his dry, cracked man heels sticking out of the back and the tufts of curly foot fur poking through the openings of these monstrosities.  Don&amp;#39;t do it, men.  These shoes and capris are never acceptable fashion choices.  They are not chic. They are not European.  They are wretched and the cows that died for these shoes should be mourned because they surely died in vain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am, however, absolutely in love with these men's shoes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="evanston.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/evanston.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="350" height="350"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 2: Bostonian's Evanston Loafer in Burgundy. $87.00 at &lt;a href="http://www.shoes.com/Shopping/ProductDetails.aspx?p=EC1005217&amp;amp;pg=5071960"&gt;shoes.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burgundy men&amp;#39;s shoes are so, so fierce.  Plus, the detailing and perfectly rounded toe scream, &amp;quot;Fuck, yeah!&amp;quot;  Were it not for my desire not to have external gonads and hair on my chest and stomach, these shoes would make me want to be a dude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was out with Mr. Isis buying new shoes for the Isis family, I saw these and loved them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="adidas.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/adidas.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="350" height="350"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 3: Adidas Men's Samba. $70.00 at &lt;a href="http://www.shoes.com/Shopping/ProductDetails.aspx?p=EC1174083&amp;amp;pg=5104299"&gt;shoes.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I resisted the urge to make him try them on, though.  I was really afraid that if Mr. Isis started wearing shoes like these that he might make me start buying him &lt;a href="http://edhardyshop.com/"&gt;Ed Hardy&lt;/a&gt;.  Then you know what happens next...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/BDCPK4MiolQ%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x234900%26color2%3D0x4e9e00&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;So instead, I just bought these:&lt;img alt="shoes_ia76934.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/shoes_ia76934.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="350" height="350"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 4: BOC Leeza Flat in Antique Gold.  $49.99 at &lt;a href="http://www.famousfootwear.com/Shopping/ProductDetails.aspx?p=76934"&gt;Famous Footwear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/04/dr_isiss_shoe_of_the_week_28.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/PCE2BXBjSKA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270325408193"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/04/the-coffee-klatch.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/165e23e294200165</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="autism"/><category term="Education: Independent And Private Schools"/><category term="Education: Public Schools"/><category term="Learning Disabilities"/><category term="Parenting--Discussionsof Good Parenting"/><title type="html">The Coffee Klatch on Twitter</title><published>2010-04-03T19:46:05Z</published><updated>2010-04-03T19:46:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/04/the-coffee-klatch.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter-based chats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://thecoffeeklatch.com/Home.html"&gt;The Coffee Klatch&lt;/a&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:122px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/margery41.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="margery4" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/margery41.jpg" alt="" width="112" height="136"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margery the Sexy Medium&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things never change. It has come to my attention that a few “prominent skeptics” may be falling under the spell of the charms of a few “prominent mediums.” I’m not naming names here, but recent developments have given me pause to reflect on a time when such things happened before and as they say, if we don’t learn from the past, we are bound to repeat it.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mediums have traditionally been a forward bunch of folks not given to shyness or modesty. They are crooks after all, and as such need to have nerve and be ready to “turn their tricks” at a moment’s notice. I have always admired that dodgy aspect of mediumship. Being able to think fast on your feet and being sharp enough to not only reply to any question a sitter might throw out at you with appropriate woo is part of the entertainment value that transferred from magicians like The Davenport Brothers and Houdini back in the day when nobody knew any better. It’s also a large area that falls into that shady netherworld where magic and con artistry meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best of the lady mediums like Eusapia Pallidino, Margery (also known as Mina Crandon) and Mrs Leonora Piper exibited great charisma. If they weren’t beautiful to look at, they made up for that fact by displaying their wares in the most erotically misdirecting ways. From &lt;a href="http://www.prairieghosts.com/margery.html"&gt;www.prairieghosts.com/margery.html&lt;/a&gt; this excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Mina herself became well-known for her risqué and sometimes bizarre séances. It was not uncommon for her to hold sessions in the nude and according to some, she was especially adept at manifesting ectoplasm from her vagina. “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the most pertinent line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It was also rumored that she had affairs with some of her would-be investigators, thus silencing a few of her most vocal critics.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:240px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/margery22.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="margery2" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/margery22.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="282"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margery Knocking them Out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therein lies the tale. Mediums aren’t any less attractive or lacking in charisma these days (except Sylvia Browne of course). In fact, to keep up with the fashions and sexual climate of our Madonna laden times, many of these brazen neo-witches may  even be more crafty and nefarious in their seductive ways than ever before.They have to: It’s part of their act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t heard about any nude seances besides a couple of interesting situations that occurred at The Magic Castle years ago, but I have heard (and seen with my own eyes and ears mind you) that some questionable antics have been going on within skeptical circles here and abroad. Hey, I’m no prude and having grown up in the 60’s, I’ve no objection to any of this. I’m just saying…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:107px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/box23.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="box2" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/box23.jpg" alt="" width="97" height="108"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Houdini Holding Hands with Margery: Kinky? No, Just Careful...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houdini’s exploits with Margery are a good case in point. If you can read up on that whole affair, where the folding ruler that manifested inside the box Houdini built to restrain Mina came from and exactly why it was pinned on Houdini is one of the great mysteries of the anti-spiritualism movement.Things remain very muddled when it comes to who did what and for what reasons.  My dear friend and late cult movie director Curtis Harrington was intrigued by this story and wanted to make a film about it. Too bad it never happened. It would have been a great dramatic premise that would still ring true today. When men of prestige and scientific acumen get wrapped up with sexy women who know how to “cast a spell,” you can bet there’s going to be controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Read about Sir William Crookes, Florence Cook and the enigmatic Katie King fiasco. Whew! What a steamy story that one was. Then there was Sir Oliver Lodge and Mrs. Piper: Although a guest in the Lodge home, the medium was kept incommunicado and was constantly watched by experienced professional detectives. With Piper’s permission, her private mail was opened and read. Every possibility of her communicating with others and receiving any type of information was completely eliminated, yet Piper’s “spirit guides” provided accurate communication in every test that Lodge devised, which helped convince the researcher that spiritualistic phenomena were real. These “Sirs” were great scientific minds, but when confronted by the most material of fleshy fantasies, they apparently succumbed willingly. Ah well, I suppose we are all only human aren’t we?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The thing is; aren’t mediums and their lot generally rgarded by the public as highly advanced spiritual beings that are supposed to be super-human and far above such earthy delights? Apparently not. In a headline just in from Kualla Lumpur:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“COLLEGE STUDENT DUPED INTO HAVING SEX WITH ‘MEDIUM’”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A 20-year-old college student who sought a medium’s help to end her streak of bad luck ended up having to sleep with the man. She approached the medium, known only as master Choy, in April on the recommendations of her friends as she was worried about her well-being.The 50-year-old medium told her she would not be able to get rid of the bad luck unless she had sex with a married man. After some persuasion from the man, who is married, the girl agreed to have sex with him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:235px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/225px-Oliver_Joseph_Lodge1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="225px-Oliver_Joseph_Lodge" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/225px-Oliver_Joseph_Lodge1.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="373"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir Oliver Lodge: Skeptical Believer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The historical (or is it hysterical?) precedents are all there for us to learn from. Distancing oneself from the flirtatious among us is never easy, but with a greater cause at stake, I’m only suggesting some common sense.The Victorian seance room was well known as a playground for the repressed and the darkness provided cover for all sorts of fun. Sitters are no angels either. One night at The Magic Castle Seance Room, I had a woman squeeze my thigh most provocatively during a dark seance with her husband sitting right on the other side of me! I was shocked in a pleasing way… Still, I wasn’t involved in any sort of challenge or serious investigation. If I had been, I would have thought differently.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This kind of hanky-panky  has been going on for a long time. Again, I’m the last to point a finger and here’s nothing wrong with a little footsie going on in most situations, but when it sways data or threatens to undermine research- we may have a problem. If you are serious about investigating so-called “psychic phenomena” or want to make a dent in the woo, beware.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If you are reading this and have been dallying with a New Ager, psychic or medium who is begging for your help, you know who you are.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If you feel weak and in need of rescuing something, might I suggest  going to your local animal rescue and getting a Basset Hound?  These pups will look up to you more steadily, seldom channel demons, not threaten your reputation and eat far less.&lt;/div&gt;

It really baffles me. Also, why would he associate himself with a primitive and patriarchal society that viewed women as chattel? He had to have known that we would discover one day that women were equals to men. Somehow this god fellow doesn't strike me as a deep thinker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, being a fundie isn't the only reason that people don't engage in sex. I, for example, have struggled with mental illness through all of my teenage years, and have yet, with my 21st birthday near, to do the deed. BUt, lacking the fundie viewpoint, I have never had to struggle against the thought that my feelings are somehow "wrong" or of "Satan" or any boogie-men.&lt;br&gt;March 29, 2010 8:55 PM   &lt;br&gt;kurt said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem with the "idea" of God is that it only serves the whims of those in power.....MEN. That is why women are relegated to nothing more than chattel throughout history! That is obviously changing now.&lt;br&gt;March 30, 2010 10:06 AM   &lt;br&gt;Rob R said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The drive for sex is so strong and it is so important and pleasurable to us because our sexual nature because our communal nature is a necessary aspect of how we reflect God's likeness and sexual relationality (not just the physical but our whole relationship to the opposite sex) is the greatest expression of that that community. It is the one relationship that is highlighted in our reflection of God in genesis 1:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So God created man in his own image,&lt;br&gt;in the image of God he created him;&lt;br&gt;male and female he created them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our relationship to the opposite sex is sacred and serves as as a bond not just between a couple but the marriage is the foundation for the family. Our sexuality obviously relates to husband and wife, but it also greatly has an effect on our relationship between parent and child and the wealth of psychological research on the importance of a two parent home with mother and father also testifies to this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sex isn't bad from the Christian perspective and you only get this from religious people who really haven't reflected deeply on the importance of sexuality and atheists who don't have a reason to reflect on sexuality it deeply accept to emphasize the negative of the difficulty of high standards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason there is so much struggle, grief, and potential evil in sexuality is because it is deeply sacred and involves the core of our being and worth. There is no tragedy where there is no worth. There is no terrible violation where there is no sacredness. And sexuality is sacred on many many grounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The act of sex is sacred for two reasons. It serves as an intense bond between individuals, a bond where they can, in consistency with the biological nature of the act, hold the other in deep adoration and intense affirmation of the worth of the other which is a reflection of love within the trinity. Secondly, it is how new life is created which reflects God's relationship to us (but also is a further reflection of triune community since creation was the result of triune community and interaction).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, the sex drive didn't have to be so intense, and we didn't have to reflect God so deeply and we don't have to be so deeply sacred with sexuality as an expression of that. But I'm not going to begrudge God for making creation so great just because the risks reflected that greatness and the greatness was worth those risks.&lt;br&gt;March 30, 2010 11:09 AM   &lt;br&gt;Jim said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Genesis 2, God made all the animals first for Adam to see which one he wanted as a "helper."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only after Adam didn't "want" any of the animals, did God make Eve out of a rib (with heavy allusions to existing mythology of the time).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would make sense for the people who wrote the Genesis creation myths to invent a God who thinks Adam might want an animal for a mate--think of the satyr. Half man half animal creatures were part of mythology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Genesis 2:18 "The LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I thought God was incapable of doing something that was not good, but here it is . . .&lt;br&gt;March 30, 2010 2:23 PM   &lt;br&gt;Mark Zedler said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The argument you make about Christian sacred sexuality certainly sounds great and plausible. This type of belief about sex can be very comforting to a Christian who is confronted by the profound changes caused by the sexual revolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, for most of Christianity’s history sex was not view in these terms. From the first century CE to the latter part of the 20th century Christians did not teach sex to be a beautiful and wonderful thing to be practiced within the confines of a sacred union between man and wife. Rather, Christianity viewed sex and something dirty and evil…it certainly was not thought of as beautiful or sacred. Sex was considered a necessary evil to create offspring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the New Testament was composed in the first and second century, the view that the body was something dirty and evil dominated Christianity. Just read through the many references to the body being unclean in the NT. Since sex involves the body it was naturally considered evil. This is the view that was enshrined in Christian orthodoxy for centuries to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The phrase “Conceived in Sin” should give anyone their first clue as to what Christianity really thought about sex. If sex between a married monogamous man and a woman were truly sacred then there would be no sin involved. But as we all know in the Christian belief system sin in intrinsically linked to the act of sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read Christian literature on the topic of sex from the 2nd century CE to the 20th century; it is not pretty. Christians back then did not talk about sex in the same way you do. Sex was considered horrible, dirty and disgusting in the sight of God. Christians were certainly not comfortable talking about sex in the way a young 21st century Christian might be (or the way you do). Sex for most of Christianity’s history was a taboo topic not to be discussed. If it was truly considered sacred as you suggest than the literature during this era would reflect this; but it does not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your view on Christian sacred sexuality is a modern innovation. I am sure you will be able to find me lots of Biblical references testifying to the veracity of Christian sacred sexuality. But these are modern reinterpretations. If the Sexual Revolution had not happened we would not be talking about Christian sacred sexuality. It would have been the same old story….sex is bad and best to be swept under the rug!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will give Christians credit for trying to improve on a very bad model. Christian views on sex badly need improvement and talking about sex in positive terms is a step in the right direction.&lt;br&gt;March 30, 2010 2:41 PM   &lt;br&gt;zenmite said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lions must reflect god's nature even more than we humans. Lions can mate up to 100 times in a single day. Sex seems pretty important to most animals. If it weren't, the species would not continue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sex act was "sacred" to ancient peoples because there were so few humans and there was always the danger of extinction...of their tribe dying out. It was all about being fruitful and multiplying. This is also why sexual sin is tied to acts which do not involve procreation. It is why masturbation (the sin of Onan) is sinful. It is why homosexuality is sinful. It is why bestiality is sinful. Only procreational sex was sacred.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was a fine theological explanation, Rob. One I've heard countless times from various christians. But to an outsider, it sounds like a bunch of gobledygook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be as if a hindu shiva worshiper gave you a detailed account of why the male organ is sacred:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It all started with Brahma and Vishnu, who were arguing over their relative supremacy. Their vain arguments were interrupted by a superluminous glow from a strange and blazing pillar, its shape reminiscent of the linga. Both of them sped towards this indescribable flaming light, which grew before their eyes into infinity, piercing the earth and extending through the heavens. Overwhelmed and terrified by the unfathomable vision, the two gods decided to seek the beginning and end of this burning immensity. Brahma taking the form of a swan flew upwards, and Vishnu dove down acquiring the shape of a boar. Both of the gods however, could not fathom the extent of this fiery column at either end, and returned exhausted and bewildered to the level they had started from. At that moment, the central part of the pillar split open and Shiva revealed himself in his full glory. Overawed, both Brahma and Vishnu bowed before him. Thunderous laughter, or the sound of AUM, issued from the pillar, filling the sky.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Did you find that convincing, edifying or enlightening? Would you find an explanation of sex involving yin and yang or various chakras convincing?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the way your explanation reads to those who don't already share your pov.&lt;br&gt;March 30, 2010 3:04 PM   &lt;br&gt;Rob R said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;post 1 of 2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The argument you make about Christian sacred sexuality certainly sounds great and plausible.

Just read through the many references to the body being unclean in the NT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The old and new testament emphasize the goodness of creation and even embodiment. This is why the real Judeo-Christian view of the early church as opposed to gnosticism is that embodied life is good and represents God's good intentions in creation. But we have of course a complex picture. Paul contrasts the flesh vs. spirit. This is about a holistic embrace of God's intentions for us yet a realization that our bodies, which are doomed to dust embody our brokenness. but sexuality in and of itself is not the brokenness, but our capacity to assault sexuality. The new testament has nothing but good things to say of sexuality in the context of marriage and Paul himself indirectly relates to the unity of sex to be modeled after the unity of God. He insists that couples not to deny each other except on occasion for meditation or by mutual agreement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The song of solomon is filled with sexual imagery and this is all very positive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The phrase “Conceived in Sin” should give anyone their first clue as to what Christianity really thought about sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is this scripture? It doesn't clearly mean that sexuality is sinful and is subject to interpretation. If this was applied generally or even specifically, it is as much a hyperbolic statement as the phrase that all our righteousness is as filthy rags (which was not intended as a philosophical absolute but to point out to jews that they are no better off than the gentiles... one of whose morally good acts went up to God as a memorial (Cornelius).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I see no reason to interpret this as a general statement about sexuality as it is hyperbole emphasizing our imperfection and rebellion is to the core and needs to be restored by God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read Christian literature on the topic of sex from the 2nd century CE to the 20th century&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian literature from the 2nd century down to the 20th has had its errors. And some of the negativity towards sexuality besides the reaction against disgracing the sacred but goes over board is no doubt part of the greek pagan influence that viewed this world and embodiment as evil and unspiritual, which is in contrast to Christianity which says they are broken waiting for redemption and renewal.&lt;br&gt;March 30, 2010 4:09 PM   &lt;br&gt;Rob R said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;post 2 of 2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it was truly considered sacred as you suggest than the literature during this era would reflect this; but it does not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This kind of reasoning just isn't going to fly with a protestant (and protestants made mistakes too).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your view on Christian sacred sexuality is a modern innovation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If this is true which I seriously doubt, it is an innovation with strong roots in scripture and experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is something to argue against those who don't realize that God never quit teaching the church with the closing of the cannon.

And the Bible is an excellent resource for that.&lt;br&gt;March 30, 2010 4:10 PM   &lt;br&gt;Mark Zedler said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK rob here are my responses:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sounds great because it fits both experience and scripture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It only fits your interpretation of experience and scripture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for the sexual revolution, it's left a wake of human wreckage in the spread of disease and broken families.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is so much wrong with this comment that it is hard to know where to begin. If you are talking about the spread of Aids, its advance was greatly aided by Christians (ok the Catholic church) who fought hard against preventative measures being taught and given to poor Africans. The result was millions catching the disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But let’s go back to a time before the Sexual revolution when sex was in the closet and everyone went to church. During the late 1800s in every large city in the United States there were not hundreds but tens of thousands of prostitutes. All these prostitutes were having unprotected sex with supposedly good upstanding Christian men. The result was that more half of all males in the United States had some form of sexually transmitted disease (who they also passed along to their unsuspecting wives). This epidemic of STDs left in its wake human wreckage and broken families!!!!!! This problem was also found in Europe. If you check the current stats on STDs the population have nowhere near the same level of STDs they had in the late 1800 and early 1900s.....and remember this was in a Christian society almost a century before the sexual revolution. Sexual repression under Christian auspices is bad news for people’s health....see Aids crisis above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The education campaign that resulted from the sexual revolution helped slow the spread of STDs. Note that Aids has been contained in Western countries. On the other hand the spread STDs is a huge problem in societies where Christian moral prerogatives take precedence over health concerns. If you want more examples of human wreckage and broken families under Christian rule when it relates to sex I will gladly provide them to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For most of Christianity's history, we have been developing our understanding increasing our understanding of God, man, and the implications of scripture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think what you really mean is that Christians made things up throughout the course of history to suit the prevailing attitudes of the day. This is called relativistic religion!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The song of solomon is filled with sexual imagery and this is all very positive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I agree,the Song of Soloman is a great piece of erotic poetry. But it was written by the Jews and not Christians. Judaism does not have nearly as much sex negative baggage as Christianity does. Where do you find erotic poetry written by Christians in the ancient world?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is this scripture? It doesn't clearly mean that sexuality is sinful and is subject to interpretation. If this was applied generally or even specifically,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The link between sin and sexual conception was established in the OT. Psalms 51:5 “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.” This seems to make a pretty strong case that the sexual act was indeed sinful. But I think there are other people here much better qualified to debate this point than I.&lt;br&gt;March 31, 2010 12:05 AM   &lt;br&gt;Mark Zedler said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part 2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian literature from the 2nd century down to the 20th has had its errors.

Influential Christian writers of the ancient and medieval world (i.e. John Chrysostom, Augustine, Aquinas) had some pretty nasty things to say about sex. They based their views on the same Bible you use. You might argue they interpreted the Bible wrong, but their Biblical interpretations of sex persisted for more than 1,600 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It must really suck to be a Christian on those days because they got their interpretation of the Bible soooooooo wrong. But hey, modern Christians know the Bible and God so much better now!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is late and my responses to the rest of your comments will have to wait till tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark&lt;br&gt;March 31, 2010 12:09 AM   &lt;br&gt;Rob R said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The NT is full of pagan influences and beliefs so it should hardly be surprising that they manifested themselves in the real world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;that there is something wrong with sex is not one of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And on the side, there is no harm in the inevitable common ground amongst religions, which, as we see in Acts 17, is evidence of God's grace preceding the gospel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;had some pretty nasty things to say about sex. They based their views on the same Bible you use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And on some accounts (when they weren't addressing the real abuses of sex) they were wrong. So what if they based their wrong beliefs on a mistaken understanding of scripture?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You might argue they interpreted the Bible wrong, but their Biblical interpretations of sex persisted for more than 1,600 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the fallacy of antiquity. If you want to engage in real biblical exegesis against my points, be my guest. And proper reforms began at least by the reformation. But I am skeptical on your mastery of church history on sexuality here and it no doubt ignores the difference of the eastern orthodox church. I don't know how different they were from the catholic church, but they at least didn't see marriage as a spiritual liability to spiritual leadership like the catholics did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It must really suck to be a Christian on those days because they got their interpretation of the Bible soooooooo wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being wrong on some grounds doesn't make one sooooo wrong. It makes them wrong on a few grounds. They were the church fathers and they did do some good things as well. The world including religion is just more complicated than an overly simplistic all or nothing way of thinking that is common amongst fundamentalists and atheists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the mistaken catholic view of sexuality wasn't without it's benefits either. The monastic life was certainly a beneficial part of catholic scholarship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They were even right on sexuality. They just happened to be wrong on some important details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But hey, modern Christians know the Bible and God so much better now!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks to those who came before us who continued to meditate and reflect on scripture, to apply it to life, who's mistakes we have learned yet who's insights have deeply benefited us.&lt;br&gt;March 31, 2010 9:47 AM   &lt;br&gt;Rob R said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;post 2 of 2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It only fits your interpretation of experience and scripture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I argued for my interpretation of scripture. And my interpretation of experience excellently fits with all of the social problems that have arisen out of of a bankrupt sexual ethic. The grief of every child of divorced parents and parents who abandon their child fits it very well. The psychological brutality of rape or child sexual abuse testifies to the extreme sacredness of sexuality. The high divorce rate amongst those who shack up before marriage testifies to the fact that sexuality ought to be approached with the reverence for the infividual that marriage and commitment bestows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are talking about the spread of Aids, its advance was greatly aided by Christians (ok the Catholic church) who fought hard against preventative measures being taught and given to poor Africans. The result was millions catching the disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm talking about everything and the bottom line is that promiscuity is the number one spreader of aids. Treating aids is only treating a symptom of a disease that has many other symptoms including poverty, even the western form where fathers have children by many women and then have to support several households and allow those children to grow up fatherless with all the social problems that that brings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the late 1800s in every large city in the United States there were not hundreds but tens of thousands of prostitutes. All these prostitutes were having unprotected sex with supposedly good upstanding Christian men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;could be. These things can go in cycles but that was well over a century ago any how. You brought up the sexual revolution, and with regard to that, a family doctor assures me that the rate of std's arose dramatically during this period. I personally don't have time to investigate specific numbers but I'll get around to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sexual repression under Christian auspices is bad news for people’s health....see Aids crisis above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, that's a silly conclusion. Seems that allowing sexuality outside the marriage was the problem and they reaped the results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The education campaign that resulted from the sexual revolution helped slow the spread of STDs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;accept for herpes, HPV and all of the social and psychological damage for which condoms cannot protect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want more examples of human wreckage and broken families under Christian rule when it relates to sex I will gladly provide them to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what was that example you gave? Africa? hmmm. funny you presenting evidence against your case while arguing for it.&lt;br&gt;March 31, 2010 10:38 AM   &lt;br&gt;Rob R said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;post 3 of 3&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think what you really mean is that Christians made things up throughout the course of history to suit the prevailing attitudes of the day. This is called relativistic religion!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is that like relativistic science? All things are relative including absolutes. That anything is RELATED is one of the most non-informative and empty claims ever. Relativism as rejected by the church is the act of relating morality to the wrong things, merely societal aproval or disapproval, or even reducing this to the subculture and culture. This is hardly the picture of orthodox development of our understanding according to scripture, experience, tradition and reason. This is not the relativism referred to by the title of relativism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course suiting the attitudes of the day is just as uninformative given the attitudes of the day is hardly monolithic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it was written by the Jews and not Christians. Judaism does not have nearly as much sex negative baggage as Christianity does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christianity is always best understood when it is understood according to it's Jewish roots. The old testament has always been revered by the church and recovering some of the meaning that has been lost in the church is always viewed as an advancement in the understanding of our faith. This is also poorly termed "relativism" yet is an essential aspect of the developement of our faith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The link between sin and sexual conception was established in the OT. Psalms 51:5 “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.” This seems to make a pretty strong case that the sexual act was indeed sinful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conception isn't merely sexual, it refers to the beginning. Again, this is hyperbole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I think there are other people here much better qualified to debate this point than I.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus it remains that you have not established your point and my point remains that the negative aspect of sexuality is only a reflection of profaning it's deep sacredness and tremendous value.&lt;br&gt;March 31, 2010 10:40 AM   &lt;br&gt;Mark Zedler said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This kind of reasoning just isn't going to fly with a protestant (and protestants made mistakes too).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Probably Not! Overall the Protestants comprise a minority in Christendom and your denomination is just a fraction of that. For the vast majority of Christianity sex is dirty and shameful. Just look at the Catholics and Orthodox branches of the religion. Sure some Protestants have a better view, but the vast amount of Christian literature reflects this. I am interested in Christianity’s overall view of sex, not your tiny slice of it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is something to argue against those who don't realize that God never quit teaching the church with the closing of the cannon. But that wouldn't be me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You say God continues to teach, I call it making things up as you go along. If God really was teaching the message would be the same all throughout Christianity......which it is not. You guys cannot agree on almost anything. That is not God teaching that is man making up all kinds of contradictory bullshit for his own ends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;God is resourceful to use evil that he did not originate to bring about good. The sexual revolution was over all a travesty, but some good can come out of it even in our response against the heart of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Christian treatment of sex and its corresponding damage to real people’s lives during the reign of Christianity was a much greater travesty. The sexual revolution is just honest and open about human sexuality……Christianity is not!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed. And the Bible is an excellent resource for that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Bible is the most horrible sex resource available; 1,800 years of sex negativity testify to that. I would never recommend the Bible to anyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rob we come from opposite ends of the spectrum with totally different views…..we are not going to agree!&lt;br&gt;March 31, 2010 12:47 PM   &lt;br&gt;Mark Zedler said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course suiting the attitudes of the day is just as uninformative given the attitudes of the day is hardly monolithic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course Christianity rejects relativism because they like to think they believe in absolutes. You think you believe in absolutes and reject the whole notion of relativism being applied to Christianity. But when I look at Christianity I see no absolute truth in it because there no agreement on what it really is. I know you disagree but there is no coherent message. Christianity is made up of hundreds of different groups each claiming they have the absolute truth. That is moral relativism based on each groups own interpretation of a very incoherent book. This is man making things up to suit their own agenda and then claiming it is the word of God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christianity is always best understood when it is understood according to it's Jewish roots. The old testament has always been revered by the church and recovering some of the meaning that has been lost in the church is always viewed as an advancement in the understanding of our faith. This is also poorly termed "relativism" yet is an essential aspect of the developement of our faith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Christianity going in after the OT was written, making up a bunch of theological nonsense to link the NT to the OT and calling it the word of God. This process is discussed in great detail elsewhere on this site.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conception isn't merely sexual, it refers to the beginning. Again, this is hyperbole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You only think it is hyperbole because it disagrees with your worldview. I beg to differ because I do not share your view of the world!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus it remains that you have not established your point and my point remains that the negative aspect of sexuality is only a reflection of profaning it's deep sacredness and tremendous value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You only think I failed to make my point because my point of view is completely opposite of yours. I will add that you have completely ignored all the historical evidence that supports Christianity’s disgusting view of sex. Christianity has done more in the past 1,800 years to profane and shame sex than any other civilization in history. Christianity has utter contempt and disregard for sex and sexuality. This is extremely well documented and I have wrote about a small fraction of this sad tale on my blog.&lt;br&gt;March 31, 2010 1:28 PM   &lt;br&gt;zenmite said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The psychological brutality of rape or child sexual abuse testifies to the extreme sacredness of sexuality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does the bible even mention or condemn child sexual abuse at all? I don't recall any mention of it. Are we to assume that molestation was unknown amongst ancient peoples? Or is it that yahweh isn't particularly concerned about children at all?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It says disobedient children need to be stoned to death by their own parents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warns against not hitting your kids lest you spoil them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yahweh told abraham if he could find just 10 innocent men in Sodom he would not destroy it. What about the women? Should we assume the word for man includes all adults? Were there no children in Sodom? If so, are they not innocent or worthy of being saved instead of destroyed by yahweh?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To an objective reader, it is obvious the o.t. god has little regard for children. He readily kills them to prove some point or punish adults. (Pharaoh's first-born and first born of the egyptians were killed to attempt to force pharaoh into freeing the Israelis.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Men are told to kidnap virgin girls for wives...no age specified. Children are killed for insulting yahweh's prophet, killed along with the adults in the flood, carted off into captivity due to the adults sins. Sins of the fathers...&lt;br&gt;March 31, 2010 2:03 PM   &lt;br&gt;Mark Zedler said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK here are some more responses:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;that there is something wrong with sex is not one of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You denial of the historical record and Christianity’s disdain of sex is remarkable. But that should be hardly surprising since said historical record does not conform to your view of the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a reason why most people think Christianity is sex negative......it has something to do with Christianity's nearly 2,000 year war on anything sexual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And on some accounts (when they weren't addressing the real abuses of sex) they were wrong. So what if they based their wrong beliefs on a mistaken understanding of scripture?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is why I am not a Christian. I do not want to force fed bullshit and lies which are in turn based on an incoherent manmade book. But you seem to think it is OK that these guys inflicted horrible teachings on people. As long as it was done in the name of God it is all OK. Let’s have three cheers for false Christian teaching! I am glad I am not part of your belief system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the fallacy of antiquity. If you want to engage in real biblical exegesis against my points, be my guest. And proper reforms began at least by the reformation. But I am skeptical on your mastery of church history on sexuality here and it no doubt ignores the difference of the eastern orthodox church. I don't know how different they were from the catholic church, but they at least didn't see marriage as a spiritual liability to spiritual leadership like the catholics did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem we have here is that I view the Christian sex negative culture as Biblical based and you see it as not. You seem to think these views were based on the incorrect interpretation of the Bible. But the fact is Christians believed sex was bad and used the Bible to support their position….and still do! Like I said earlier, the Bible is such an incoherent document you can find a verse to support any position or belief.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You argue that “proper reforms” began during the reformation. But that was more than 1,200 years after Christianity became the state religion of Rome. That is an awful long time to endure false teachings. But as you indicated earlier you see no problem with that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no fallacy of antiquity either. Many denominations in Christianity still base their sex negative views on beliefs that originated in the ancient world. For example the coitus interruptus, amplexus reservatus or the copula dimidiate are pillars of Catholic dogma on sex. These doctrines were foisted on people by a Christian church for thousands of years and made people’s lives miserable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being wrong on some grounds doesn't make one sooooo wrong. It makes them wrong on a few grounds. They were the church fathers and they did do some good things as well. The world including religion is just more complicated than an overly simplistic all or nothing way of thinking that is common amongst fundamentalists and atheists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That depends on which Christian you talk to. Many will suggest if you do not follow the “True Faith” one will suffer an eternity of hell. Will a person go to heaven if they are a Catholic? If so then there is no need for all the other Christian denominations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the mistaken catholic view of sexuality wasn't without it's benefits either. The monastic life was certainly a beneficial part of catholic scholarship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You forgot to mention centuries of child sexual abuse and pedophilia in your list of benefits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They were even right on sexuality. They just happened to be wrong on some important details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh yeah, let us celebrate the Catholic position on sex! Do you make sure you have sex only for procreation? Do you make sure you avoid coitus interruptus, amplexus reservatus or the copula dimidiate when you have sex lest you commit a mortal sin?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, I bet the millions of people dying of Aids in Africa are very happy about the Catholic stance on sex and birth control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not getting sex right!&lt;br&gt;March 31, 2010 4:19 PM   &lt;br&gt;Harry H. McCall, CET said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best reference and discussion on sex and early Christianity is still:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Body and Society: Men, Women, and Sexual Renunciation in Early Christianity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twentieth Anniversary Edition with a New Introduction by Peter Brown&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book Description:&lt;br&gt;First published in 1988, Peter Brown's The Body and Society was a groundbreaking study of the marriage and sexual practices of early Christians in the ancient Mediterranean and Near East. Brown focuses on the practice of permanent sexual renunciation-continence, celibacy, and lifelong virginity-in Christian circles from the first to the fifth centuries A.D. and traces early Christians' preoccupations with sexuality and the body in the work of the period's great writers.&lt;br&gt;The Body and Society questions how theological views on sexuality and the human body both mirrored and shaped relationships between men and women, Roman aristocracy and slaves, and the married and the celibate. Brown discusses Tertullian, Valentinus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Constantine, the Desert Fathers, Jerome, Ambrose, and Augustine, among others, and considers asceticism and society in the Eastern Empire, martyrdom and prophecy, gnostic spiritual guidance, promiscuity among the men and women of the church, monks and marriage in Egypt, the ascetic life of women in fourth-century Jerusalem, and the body and society in the early Middle Ages. In his new introduction, Brown reflects on his work's reception in the scholarly community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Author:&lt;br&gt;Peter Brown, formerly professor of classics and history at the University of California, Berkeley, is the Philip and Beulah Rollins Professor of History at Princeton University and the most prominent scholar of late antiquity (between 250 and 800 A.D.).&lt;br&gt;March 31, 2010 10:23 PM   &lt;br&gt;Anthony said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hey Harry, thanks for the book recommendation! I just ordered a copy.&lt;br&gt;April 1, 2010 9:45 AM   &lt;br&gt;Mark Zedler said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;it looks like I missed some. Here are the rest of my responses to Rob R:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I argued for my interpretation of scripture. And my interpretation of experience excellently fits with all of the social problems that have arisen out of of a bankrupt sexual ethic. The grief of every child of divorced parents and parents who abandon their child fits it very well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You continue to insist that the sexual revolution was the worst thing to hit the family ever. The historical record says otherwise. For example, Statistics Canada has recently release data on family life in the early 1900’s which showed quite conclusively that there were a similar number of broken homes and blended families back then as there are today. Remember that nearly everyone in early 1900’s Canada was a Christian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clearly numerous people left their marriages in early 1900’s Canada even though divorce was not legalized. Again reality defies the myth that Christians love to perpetuate that family life under Christian rule will be ideal and perfect. Clearly it is not much of an improvement!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The historical record would indicate that the incidence of broken homes and blended families that we currently have is nothing unusual. The sexual revolution cannot take all the blame for the current state of affairs. People leave marriages whether the society is Christian or not. Another great example of this is the Bible belt in the United States. The rate of divorce is the same among fundamentalist Christians as it is among the rest of the population. It is further proof that even Christians are unable to live up to their ridiculous moral standards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The psychological brutality of rape or child sexual abuse testifies to the extreme sacredness of sexuality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately the centuries old culture of silence around sex allowed clergy of numerous denominations to commit heinous acts of child abuse with impunity. You continue to say Christianity treated sex as sacred but their actions said otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, that's a silly conclusion. Seems that allowing sexuality outside the marriage was the problem and they reaped the results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hardly, I bet the wives of the men who got the Aids virus while they were visiting an infected prostitute really sympathize with your point of view. Had these men been using a condom while they engaged in their tryst would have prevented the wife and children from contracting the disease. But then who cares about the unintended victims when unrealistic moral codes from a man made deity must be followed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;accept for herpes, HPV and all of the social and psychological damage for which condoms cannot protect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh yes and let’s not forget about all the physiological, mental and physical abuse that was inflicted upon people trying to live up to completely unrealistic Christian sexual morals for centuries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what was that example you gave? Africa? hmmm. funny you presenting evidence against your case while arguing for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course you would think that because it fits into your narrow view of the world. The reality is that humans have sex with more than one partner in their life despite the sexual prescripts of a man made deity. Humans are not naturally monogamous. The evidence clearly shows that all throughout history humans have sex with multiple partners. This not going to change! Get over it! It is better to accept this fact of the human condition and find ways of handling sexual relations in the most open and safe manner possible rather than trying to live up to the unrealistic expectations of a man made deity.&lt;br&gt;April 1, 2010 12:15 PM   &lt;br&gt;Harry H.

You will not regret this book!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I bought my copy when it first come out in 1988. I think it was about $65.00 then in a hard bound edition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regards,&lt;br&gt;Harry&lt;br&gt;April 1, 2010 6:52 PM   &lt;br&gt;Rob R said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;post 1 of 7&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the vast majority of Christianity sex is dirty and shameful. Just look at the Catholics and Orthodox branches of the religion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I found pretty much complete agreement with this article from an orthodox position and I agree with most of this article which is also positive about sexuality from a catholic view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am interested in Christianity’s overall view of sex, not your tiny slice of it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not interested in a shallow criticism of a biblical view when the source of knowledge of our faith has never been a democracy of people each of whom who may or may not rightfully be called Christians in the sense most faithful to Christ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You say God continues to teach, I call it making things up as you go along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can call development, drawing out implications of scripture and our faith and synthesizing that with our experience in a coherent fashion "making things up". I'd call that judgment poorly educated of church history, scripture, and how theology works all of which involves a process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If God really was teaching the message would be the same all throughout Christianity......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is that why all students from a class come out thinking exactly alike on everything? Well, come to think of it, that doesn't happen. People have different levels of commitment, emphasis in what they study, different interpretations and so on even when they have the same teacher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You guys cannot agree on almost anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, I know at a superficial level, all you see is disagreement. That's where the drama is, and it ignores that far broader areas of agreement (such as the great deal of agreement with articles I poste even on this specific area). The disagreements are not unimportant, but neither do they eclipse nor cancel out the importance of the agreements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sexual revolution is just honest and open about human sexuality……Christianity is not!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amongst so many of the lies of the sexual revolution is that sex is "just sex" that it isn't sacred, that it isn't an exultation of the individuals of a marriage as well as their community as well, that it isn't in it's best form in exclusivistic relationship, that sexual unfaithfulness won't damage kids as we see from so many divorces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rob we come from opposite ends of the spectrum with totally different views…..we are not going to agree!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't know what the point of that is. But nevertheless, you assert that Christianity is only negative on sexuality and it's worth pointing out how contrary this is to scripture especially when sexual community is highlighted as bearing the image of the eternal infinite God.&lt;br&gt;April 2, 2010 12:25 PM   &lt;br&gt;Rob R said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;post 2 of 7&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course Christianity rejects relativism because they like to think they believe in absolutes. You think you believe in absolutes and reject the whole notion of relativism being applied to Christianity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, I reject that relativism really means anything at worst and at best when it is cultural relativism, fails to describe true morality since people challenge the cultures values and actually spur progress. Moral relativism is inept at describing progress. Valuing the sexual revolution as an improvement is meaningless if your only standard is what society accepts as morality, and if you think it's better because it's just more honest, then you aren't truly commited to cultural relativism if you think honesty is always the way things should go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not an absolutist on morals anyhow. They do have a degree of relativity to various shifting standards. But there are some moral absolutes. The idea that murder isn't always wrong is just outright nothing short of stupidity (but not all taking of human life is murder).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know you disagree but there is no coherent message. Christianity is made up of hundreds of different groups each claiming they have the absolute truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That people disagree says nothing about whether what they believe is incoherent or even wrong. It just means that on what they disagree, they can't all be right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And who'd be so stupid to think they have the absolute truth. Every Christian I know, some of which are amongst the most brilliant scholars alive still feel the need to learn and develop their thought. That's not to say that we don't have absolute confidence in much of what we believe. I know you could equivocate and talk about absolutes that just will never change and are always true (which is utterly moronic to deny), and much of Christian apologetics drools and is enamored with the term of absolute even as applied to morality even though not all morals are indeed absolute. Nevertheless, development goes on and the majority of Christians who take their faith seriously realize the need to continually learn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there again is the shallow emphasis on our mere believing and not on the source of our beliefs which we are always drawing out. Here again is a shallow emphasis on disagrements which are far less than the agreements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Christianity going in after the OT was written, making up a bunch of theological nonsense to link the NT to the OT and calling it the word of God. This process is discussed in great detail elsewhere on this site.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A false unsupported claim which changes nothing and is well out of the scope of this discussion. Saying it is asserted at this site is far from support and the claims at this site have been challenged by others including myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You only think it is hyperbole because it disagrees with your worldview. I beg to differ because I do not share your view of the world!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your world view has nothing to do with the proper interpretation of scripture. And Consistency with other scriptures has everything to do with the proper interpretation of scripture. You know, you could have choosen better prooftexts for your arguement, but what you choose is at best, for your position, really ambiguous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will add that you have completely ignored all the historical evidence that supports Christianity’s disgusting view of sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's one thing to be accused of saying something one didn't. But I get this all the time that I didn't say what I in fact did. I absolutely addressed the historical consideration. the history of christianity is filled with both progress and mistake. Scripture takes precedence over tradition and here, tradition fails. This is one of the mistakes. That's not a failure to address the history. It does precisely that.&lt;br&gt;April 2, 2010 12:26 PM   &lt;br&gt;Rob R said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;post 3 of 7&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does the bible even mention or condemn child sexual abuse at all? I don't recall any mention of it. Are we to assume that molestation was unknown amongst ancient peoples? Or is it that yahweh isn't particularly concerned about children at all?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll answer your question but I'll first note that this is a red herring if you are ignoring the point. Rape and child molestation are devastating to the victoms, ruining their lives, even driving some of them to suicidal thoughts. This testifies to the extreme importance of sexuality in the value of humans. This is experience that coheres with the scriptural picture of sexuality as sacred.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only child molestation I know of was of the greeks. I find it completely plausible that it was unknown amongst some cultures and I have no reason to think that it was an issue with the ancient Jews. But on the whole, it goes against the sexual ethic of scripture as a whole which places the place for sex within marriage. That not every moral consideration is spelled out in scripture doesn't bother me in the least. It is a core, a guide even for the purpose of ethics but so much more and yet not an exhaustive account of all things ethical. Again, reflection and implications are essential.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It says disobedient children need to be stoned to death by their own parents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(yes I'll address this red herring)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which is not a rule for Christians who are no longer under the old testament, and yet very fruitful to teach us that reverence for parents is also deeply sacred as a reflection of the image of God. Almost all instances of the capital punishment in the ancient law deal with those parts of us that most intensely reflect the image of God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warns against not hitting your kids lest you spoil them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most people who have studied proverbs more than superficially agree that they are not all absolutes but generalities. This is one of them, and while I don't see a problem with corporal punishment in and of itself, the meaning is clearly about the importance of discipline and not the specific form of discipline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yahweh told abraham if he could find just 10 innocent men in Sodom he would not destroy it. What about the women? Should we assume the word for man includes all adults? Were there no children in Sodom? If so, are they not innocent or worthy of being saved instead of destroyed by yahweh?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The children were better off with Yahweh than to be virtually condemned to be raised by such a vile hostile people (who, for example were willing to rape strangers). We however live in an age of greater grace that can confront and overturn such evil. After all, Jesus said that the judgement of Sodom and Gomorrah would be far easier than for those who have a greater opportunity through him to find mercy in God. What about the woman? What about the innocent women? If there were 10 innocent women, perhaps they'd have 10 innocent husbands. Husbands and wives do indeed share responsibility for what the other does. If there were 10 innocent women who could not influence their husbands, then sharing in their husbands earthly judgment, they surely do not share in their eternal judgment.&lt;br&gt;April 2, 2010 12:27 PM   &lt;br&gt;Rob R said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;post 4 of 7&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To an objective reader, it is obvious the o.t. god has little regard for children. He readily kills them to prove some point or punish adults.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no such thing as an objective reader. How ironic for you to lecture me on relativism (which may hinge on a poor use of subjectivity) and then appeal to objective reading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The blood of these children falls on their parents heads who failed to protect them from the consequences of their own depravity by engaging in that depravity to begin with. God has made us responsible for each other and that responsibility is real and it goes to the deepest extremes, placing sacred innocent children in our care. We of course live a modernistic myth that children and spouses are independent, but no, we are all deeply connected and the innocent in our care will suffer because of us. It is the price to pay for such deep connection that we have with each other, a connection that also has powerful potential for good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Pharaoh's first-born and first born of the egyptians were killed to attempt to force pharaoh into freeing the Israelis.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sickening isn't it. I have to shake my head at pharoah. His evil was through and through. God hardened his heart that the evil would bear it's corrupt fruit and that they would see its judgment, and yet, Pharoah was ultimately responsible given hardening was not determinative. Once Pharoah and his officials were hardened and yet, the officials relented though pharoah did not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So Pharoah after hearing the threat still refused, he decided he was not going to listen to God and that is a losing strategy that cost him the sons. Where children of little regard to God? hardly, the loss of them was a terrible tragedy, the ultimate fruit of Egyption rebellion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Men are told to kidnap virgin girls for wives...no age specified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;obviously birthing was important and central to their thinking on sexuality. And this either had to do with sparing them from the destruction of their cultures which were far more perverse than you'd like them to be (then again, you have said something positive about relativism so perhaps you don't think much of the horrors of some of these cultures such as displayed in Sodom and Gommorha or of the child sacrifice that was an issue at the time), yet not so far as to warrant the total annhilation that other peoples faced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Children are killed for insulting yahweh's prophet,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, I've been to public school. I know a thing or two about the sort of psychopathic cretins that would do well from a mauling from a bear who share the same spirit as that gang of children. Even Nazi's start out as children after all who do bear moral responsibility and some kids have no more conscience than them having been raised by parents who were desperately inept and failed their kids. But God is full of grace and is now willing to see their redemption and has put up with their sort of inhuman rebellion the quality of which we see in our crucifixion of Jesus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;carted off into captivity due to the adults sins. Sins of the fathers...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;yeah, the myth of western individualism doesn't work well in scripture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You denial of the historical record&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While I'm skeptical of your knowledge of it and have good reason to be given you insistance on only looking at the negative, there is no denial. I've said there were mistakes in historical Christianity. That's not denial. That's admitting that yes, it the emphasis of the evil and danger cited in Christianity, some went over board to an extent that is inconsistent with the extreme sacredness of sexuality in scripture which you have denied.&lt;br&gt;April 2, 2010 12:28 PM   &lt;br&gt;Rob R said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;post 5 of 7&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that should be hardly surprising since said historical record does not conform to your view of the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course it does conform to my view of the world. In my view of the world, many in the churches tradition have indeed been overly negative. Do you disagree with this? Do you think it has been all positive? Of course I know you don't, but you are in denial of what I have actually said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a reason why most people think Christianity is sex negative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because sexuality is a huge source of negativity in the world and an overly simplistic assesment of the Christian view could easily only emphasis the negative side of the truth and ignore the positive side that is extremely positive, an extreme positiveness that is in reality necessary to the negative harmful aspects of sex. Again, that sexuality is so sacred so important is the reasons why the abuse of it is so heinous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You seem to think these views were based on the incorrect interpretation of the Bible. But the fact is Christians believed sex was bad and used the Bible to support their position….and still do!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm sorry but the point you think you are making here is no point at all. There's no argument here. That Christians have used their bibles to articulate a purely negative view of scripture does not negate my the claim that they were wrong in their interpretation. I don't know why anyone would think that was anything approaching an actual argument. This is circular reasoning on your part to say that I am wrong about disagreeing with their use of scripture because they use scripture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like I said earlier, the Bible is such an incoherent document you can find a verse to support any position or belief.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That you can find a passage in scripture to support anything says nothing about whether that is a fitting use for the passage or whether it is a good interpretation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You argue that “proper reforms” began during the reformation. But that was more than 1,200 years after Christianity became the state religion of Rome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is my ignorance speaking that I am granting that you may be right that the writings of Christians on sexuality was just negative in the catholic church. But I think that it's probably false. I don't see the history of the church as finally getting things right at the reformation, I see it as a continuum of development of thought and piety, some of which has been an advancement, some of which has been regression which later scrutiny would have to correct and allow that some specific topics, such as the positive nature of sexuality may have not have been seen until around the reformation. "proper reforms" on all things have been going on sicne day one of Christianity and even before in Judaism. For that matter, reform of thought in western Christianity's other (yet lesser) root, greek philosophy was also going on prior and continued when it was adapted into Christian thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is an awful long time to endure false teachings. But as you indicated earlier you see no problem with that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do and have always seen a problem with that. That's why I reject it. Even if this picture of sexuality in the church as only negative is true, it's only one of a heck of a lot of things that the church taught, many other things where the church was always right!&lt;br&gt;April 2, 2010 12:29 PM   &lt;br&gt;Rob R said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;post 6 og 7&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no fallacy of antiquity either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, you most absolutely are promoting a form of the technical logical fallacy of appeal to antiquity. The appeal says that people have always done such and such or have always believed such and such, thus that's the way it is. Even though you disagree with the claim in question, you are commiting the fallacy to suggest that if Christians have always believed a certain thing about some part of scripture, then that is the proper way to understand those scriptures and that is what is most authentic to Christian claims about the nature and source of truth. Well, sorry, a fallacy is a fallacy and your reasoning here doesn't fly rationally speaking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That depends on which Christian you talk to. Many will suggest if you do not follow the “True Faith” one will suffer an eternity of hell. Will a person go to heaven if they are a Catholic? If so then there is no need for all the other Christian denominations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's more of that fundamentalist all or nothing kind of thinking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You forgot to mention centuries of child sexual abuse and pedophilia in your list of benefits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay, you said it was a benefit. Not me. :p&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh yeah, let us celebrate the Catholic position on sex!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you daft? The very statement you quoted of mine said EXPLICITELY that I don't agree with all of it. As a matter of fact, that's been a sum of everything I've been saying up to this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, I bet the millions of people dying of Aids in Africa are very happy about the Catholic stance on sex and birth control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just like a bank robber would be unhappy without masks, guns, and a getaway driver. Yes, there are ways to suffer more immeadiately by practicing only half of a christian ethic on sexuality. The lack of safe sex in the spread of disease for a promiscuous lifestyle is like the lack of masks is the cause of the arrests of a bank robber. Whether you live virtuously or immorally, half measures either way is going to have bad consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You continue to insist that the sexual revolution was the worst thing to hit the family ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actually, I said these things may go in cycles. And it's pretty desperate to find a couter-example to the undeniable harm of the sexual revolution in Canada around the turn of the century. I wager though that they new better than to celebrate their brokenness on the level that is was in the sexual revolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sexual revolution cannot take all the blame for the current state of affairs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, we always have good ole human nature. But the sexual revolution surely can take a good chunk of blame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rate of divorce is the same among fundamentalist Christians as it is among the rest of the population.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;it's much lower for couples who make it a point to pray together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hardly, I bet the wives of the men who got the Aids virus while they were visiting an infected prostitute&lt;br&gt;April 2, 2010 12:30 PM   &lt;br&gt;Rob R said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;post 7 of 7&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You're using this as a counter-example to the harm of sex outside of marriage?! Obviously it takes teamwork which marriages require anyway to function, so no, keeping sex within marriage is not a protection as only applied to individuals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh yes and let’s not forget about all the physiological, mental and physical abuse that was inflicted upon people trying to live up to completely unrealistic Christian sexual morals for centuries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was your response to my point that herpes and HPV spread regardless of "safe sex". It is a red herring to that point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reality is that humans have sex with more than one partner in their life despite the sexual prescripts of a man made deity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;yes.... it's called rebellion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Humans are not naturally monogamous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;yes. naturely we are rebellious and sexuality is one of those areas. But even there, I have little doubt that your point is wrong to treat us as a monolithic group. Different humans have different struggles and the pitfalls of sexuality do not represent a universal struggles. Some people regardless of whether they are believers or not do not have issues with faithfulness in marriage. If you want to suggest that all people are either promiscous, desiring to be promiscuous or liars, be my geust, but that won't fly well here where so many here want to to fight the conception of some Christians that being an unbeliever is simply due to the desire to be promiscuous or perverted.&lt;br&gt;April 2, 2010 12:31 PM   &lt;br&gt;Mark Zedler said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1 of 2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK Rob here it is:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not interested in a shallow criticism of a biblical view when the source of knowledge of our faith has never been a democracy of people each of whom who may or may not rightfully be called Christians in the sense most faithful to Christ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, let’s hide behind the they were not really “Christian”defence. Just because you do not think these people were not really Christians (by your definition) does not mean they were wrong. After all you could be the one who is completely wrong and they are right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A false unsupported claim which changes nothing and is well out of the scope of this discussion. Saying it is asserted at this site is far from support and the claims at this site have been challenged by others including myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only in your opinion Rob! I am certainly not suggesting this site is the final authority on truth, it is only a resource. There are many more website, resources, groups and academics that I have read and refer to. I was once on your side believing as you do in the truthfulness of the Bible, but after years of intensive research I have come to the conclusion that the Bible in not divinely inspired and the God of the Bible does not exist. The Bible is a man made document; albeit a very important one that has greatly influenced world history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Therefore I do not see any need to follow the religious precepts of a false religion and imaginary deity. You can go on till you are blue in the face telling me how right your God is and how wrong I am. But the fact is I do not believe your God exists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A discussion of why I believe what I do is far beyond the scope of this discussion. You need to understand I look at the world totally different than you do and as a result I draw different conclusions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While I'm skeptical of your knowledge of it and have good reason to be given you insistance on only looking at the negative, there is no denial. I've said there were mistakes in historical Christianity. That's not denial. That's admitting that yes, it the emphasis of the evil and danger cited in Christianity, some went over board to an extent that is inconsistent with the extreme sacredness of sexuality in scripture which you have denied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You accuse me of viewing Christianity in purely negative terms. I can understand why you believe this and my pronouncements of my disbelief I am sure add to this impression. But I would like to say the following in my defence. With regards to my view of Christianity I view its overall treatment of sexuality as one of its most negative aspects. Since this discussion is related to sex I am not going to have much good to say about the Christian viewpoint on sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On my blog I provide detailed discussions of many of our sexual taboos in Western Society. It is a huge task and I am maybe 5% complete. I go into detail explaining their origins and how they entered our social consciousness. For many sexual taboos the reason they were originally created are long forgotten, we believe them out of tradition. By understanding why a particular sexual taboo was created can often remove its power. But as it turns out most of our sexual taboos have Christian or Judaic origins. Given the amount of research I have done on this topic I have taken a pretty dim view of the Christian treatment of sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have also explored sexuality in other civilizations and I feel that the Christian version leaves a lot to be desired...even if it is Christian Sacred Sex. I certainly will explore all these differences in time on my blog. I have experienced other forms of sacred sexuality like Tantra at a very advanced level. So when I do speak of these things I do have a lot of personal experience to draw from. I also I try to inject my personal experience into my discussions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Continued.....&lt;br&gt;April 2, 2010 6:02 PM   &lt;br&gt;Mark Zedler said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part 2 of 2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just so you understand that I do not view Christianity in purely negative terms here is a partial list of what I think is good about it:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• There is a desire and sincere effort on the part of some to look after the less fortunate in society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Christianity breathed new life into the Roman Empire after it nearly collapsed during the crisis of the third century.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Christianity (especially the Byzantine Empire) saved our western cultural heritage from destruction during the Medieval Ages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Christianity saved western civilization from being overrun by Islam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• I admire the zeal and determination with which the early Christians believed in their cause.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• I admire the walk your talk attitude of the early Christians.....something that I see is sorely lacking in the modern version. Avoiding materialism was actually taken seriously back then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Being able to take over the Roman Empire with only 10-15% of the population being Christian is quite an impressive feat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• The world in which we live today would not exist without our Christian past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was your response to my point that herpes and HPV spread regardless of "safe sex". It is a red herring to that point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was my mistake; I pasted the wrong comment there. With regards to HPV and herpes, while using proper protection can reduce ones chances of getting it, there is still an increased risk. I am quite aware of what the risks are when one has sex with more than one partner. Yes there are risks but for myself personally I have mitigated them. In all the years I have had an open relationship I have never gotten an STD. Being very healthy, having a strong immune system, using proper protection, carefully choosing my partners and using extensive STD testing makes the difference for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;yes.... it's called rebellion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is not rebellion if it is not wrong!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to suggest that all people are either promiscous, desiring to be promiscuous or liars, be my geust, but that won't fly well here where so many here want to to fight the conception of some Christians that being an unbeliever is simply due to the desire to be promiscuous or perverted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I never said that everyone wants or even should have sex with more than one person. Some people are perfectly fine with being monogamous but many more or not. This is a personal choice. Christianity makes it wrong to want to have sex with more than one person. I on the other hand do not see anything wrong with having sex with more than one person in one's lifetime. When having sex with other people is done from one’s integrity without manipulating others....everyone is a consenting adult, the experience can be quite profound and sacred. I do not expect you to follow my lifestyle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can live as you wish, but you have no right to impose your morals on me either......and as an addendum to that I take responsibility for my beliefs and lifestyle. I do not expect you have to pay for it either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I believe government should stay out of my wallet as well as my bedroom!! We all know the deal, the Left loves big government so they can get someone else to pay for all their pet projects. I am a libertarian and I believe in smaller government and paying my own way. You are not going to accuse me of wanting to mooch off of other citizens just to pay for my lifestyle.&lt;br&gt;April 2, 2010 6:15 PM   &lt;br&gt;Mark Zedler said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part III&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it's pretty desperate to find a couter-example to the undeniable harm of the sexual revolution in Canada around the turn of the century.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I believe you completely misunderstood the context of the example I gave about early 20th Century Canada. There was no sexual revolution in Canada in the early 1900’s. It occurred in Canada at the same time as it did in the United States (1960s and 1970’s). The parallel I wanted to make was this: Critics of the Sexual Revolution like to point out that it created a lot of broken families. Yes, there are a lot of marriage breakdowns and blended families occurring after the Sexual Revolution. But marriage breakdown is not necessary unique to the period after the sexual revolution. The statistics I cited suggested that in a society that was Christian and pre sexual revolution also had lots of marital breakdown and blended families. Since divorce was next to impossible to obtain, men and women just walked away from their marriages. The significant numbers of people who walked out on their marriage and blended families testified to that. Since divorce was so hard to obtain people walking out on their marriage would not be reflected in that statistic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now there can be all kinds of reason why people walked out on their marriage, but the end result is a failed marriage. People leaving their marriage are not unique to the period after the sexual revolution. I also take exception to your suggestion that using this example is desperate. I live in Canada so I am more familiar with life here. If data from the Government of Canada suggests that there was a significant amount of marital breakdown in the early 1900s that that is an important piece of information. That information contradicts the notion that high rates of marital breakdown only occurred after the sexual revolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would suggest that societies going through a lot of change and stress will suffer a lot of marital breakdown. Since the French Revolution society has been enduring one change after another. Weather it was the French Revolution itself, the industrial revolution, urbanization, the rise of all kinds of isms, world wars, women`s rights movement, immigration to a new country, the rise of the affluent society, socialization of government, the sexual revolution, civil rights movement or democratization all these events placed extreme stress on families and marriages. People have a hard time dealing with so much change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The statistic I described to you from Canada showed a high level of marital breakdown from a time period when Canada was going through tremendous change. During that era Canada`s population increased by 50% and we had a huge influx of immigration. That change really stressed the country; it was hard for the country to manage so much change. It was also hard on families and as a result a lot of people walked away from their marriages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marriages and families had to endure more stress and change in roles in the last 200 years than it had in the previous 4 or 5,000 years. All these changes will cause marital breakdown. It seems every time society has adjusted to the previous shock and new one is thrown at it. Yes, the sexual revolution caused problems, but in the context of the last 200 years it is only one in a long series changes to have been hitting the family. To blame the sexual revolution for being the worst thing to hit the family ever is being dishonest. I cited the example above from Canada. I could also cite the industrial revolution, it was extremely hard on early the societies going through it and it was also brutal on marriages. This is well documented.&lt;br&gt;April 2, 2010 10:18 PM   &lt;br&gt;Mark Zedler said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part IV&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, I know at a superficial level, all you see is disagreement. That's where the drama is, and it ignores that far broader areas of agreement (such as the great deal of agreement with articles I poste even on this specific area). The disagreements are not unimportant, but neither do they eclipse nor cancel out the importance of the agreements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would hardly call the religious wars and conflicts of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries superficial. These were life and death struggles between Protestants and Catholics. It was serious business and those involved claimed one`s salvation depended on picking the right version of Christianity. The literature of the day was really quite vile. If the Catholic Church and its supporters had been able to militarily defeat the Protestants your forbearers would have met the same brutal fate as the Cathars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately that did not happen and everyone had to accept a world where other forms of Christianity had to be tolerated. This eventually opened the door to other forms of toleration that we now see today. I see this process as essential in creating the increasing tolerant societies we have today.....but I digress! There is agreement because your forefathers had to accept the political reality that no one group would be able to dominate all of Christianity ever again. They all had to live together somehow. You might call this process the hand of God at work. I call this process a rationalization of the world around them. If they wanted to live to together they had to find ways to live together without killing each other. This is a political process rather than a theological one. But you might view it those ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You certainly see the positive aspects of this agreement, but this agreement is not always genuine. When I was still in religious circles I witnessed a tremendous amount of dissing other Christian denominations. Of course everyone`s favourite whipping boy was the Catholic church. Currently there is a lot of agreement between groups in the religious right; you all have a common enemy in the culture wars. But if there was not that common enemy you guys will soon be at each other`s throats, the animosity runs too deep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I recognize there is much agreement between denominations, but there is still much disagreement below the surface that can explode given the right geo-political circumstances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;it's much lower for couples who make it a point to pray together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Couples who both willingly participated in alternative lifestyles together overwhelmingly reported their marriages to be much happier and more fulfilling.&lt;br&gt;April 2, 2010 11:13 PM   &lt;br&gt;Mark Zedler said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you daft? The very statement you quoted of mine said EXPLICITELY that I don't agree with all of it. As a matter of fact, that's been a sum of everything I've been saying up to this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is sarcasm my friend! Do you have any sense of humour at all? I sure hope so. Also, since you like to ignore my questions, I`m going to give it back to you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I found pretty much complete agreement with this article from an orthodox position and I agree with most of this article which is also positive about sexuality from a catholic view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You talk about the theology of sex in Christianity. I talk about what happens in real people’s lives. I do not dispute what the theology says, it talks about the sacredness of sex from a Christian point of view. I see that. However, I met too many people who had screwed up sex lives and all manner of sexual dysfunction. When they talk about how bad their sex lives they often cite negative views about sex originating from Christianity. People have a really hard to be open with their partner. Women have a much harder time because they bear the brunt of an increased load of sexual taboos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Christianity has such a wonderful view of sexuality than they should do a better job of implementation because I do not see it. A large percentage of women have never even had an orgasm because their heads have been filled with all kinds of sex negative baggage. They tell me they do not know how to connect with their bodies. I would even go so far to suggest that women on a societal level have forgotten how to have sex. Women and men have had their heads filled with so many taboos that they cannot connect with their bodies and enjoy the experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have had been with women who were from the traditional Christian background who had their heads filled with sex negative taboos. I have also been with women who have no sex negative beliefs and really know how to connect with their bodies. I can tell you that sex with the later is absolutely phenomenal...and deep down this is what everyone wants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It takes a very patient, skilful and knowledgeable man to deal with a woman who has been possessed by such frigidity. Often it can be a lost cause because the damage is too great. I have seen the damage of sex negative beliefs first hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On my website I talk about sexual abilities that women have lost. I am referring to Female Ejaculation (FE). This is a controversial topic but I have much firsthand experience with it. Women all knew how to make it happen in the ancient world and it was widespread in every ancient civilization. But for women in the West FE was completely unknown until recently. Even western medicine denied FE`s existence until the last 10-20 years. Western women in the ancient world knew FE but it got lost. How did it happen? I point to 1,800 years of Christian rule and a sex negative culture as the culprit. Women got so many sex taboos pumped into their heads over the centuries that they lost the connection to their bodies and forgot how FE works. I am greatly simplifying this process but I will be writing articles detailing this process in much more detail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately, with the openness of the last 20 to 30 years women have been rediscovering their sexual birthright. For example, my wife, Rhianna has recently learned FE. She got a good book on the topic, followed the instructions and it happened. With ever more practice she is getting much better at it. There was also a lot of mental work that happened ahead of this that cleared her head of sex negative beliefs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you believe in the sacredness of Christian sexuality men and women should be able to enjoy the experience (within marriage if you are a Christian) with ALL the equipment that God supposedly gave us. Would you not agree?&lt;br&gt;April 3, 2010 12:02 AM   &lt;br&gt;zenmite said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The children were better off with Yahweh than to be virtually condemned to be raised by such a vile hostile people (who, for example were willing to rape strangers)."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I assume you realize this is exactly the justification that Andrea Yates gave for murdering her children a few years ago. In fact, it could be used by any religious person to justify killing children or anyone. She wanted to save them from this sinful world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By 'objective' reading, I simply meant someone outside your religion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It says disobedient children need to be stoned to death by their own parents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which is not a rule for Christians who are no longer under the old testament,"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, I understand that. But it does speak to the character / personality of yahweh who is supposed to be the christian god too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is why I like John's outsider test of faith. If you encountered some ancient, foreign religious document that described a god or goddess that commanded exactly the sort of acts described regularly in the o.t. you would find such a god a horrendous monster (much as Dawkins describes yahweh). If the followers of this monstrous diety attempted to justify his acts by the sorts of mental gymnastics that you engage in here you would likely find such blatant rationalizations absurd and unconvincing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Well, you see our goddess Kali killed 100 innocent children because they would be better off with her than living in that vile christian society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's perfectly reasonable that Thor murdered a group of children in cold blood...they were going to grow up to be bullys anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though it was Moloch that caused the firstborn children to die, it was that king's fault for not listening to him. The king caused the deaths, not poor, innocent Moloch."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rob, it is obvious there is absolutely nothing your god could have done that you couldn't readily justify. The same rationalizations, if used by other religious fanatics, you would find ridiculous. It's exactly the sort of reasoning that Bin Laden and his followers use to justify killing innocent men, women and children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yahweh caused the deaths of poor Job's wife and children simply to prove a point to satan. The story ends with Job's fortune restored as if that makes it all ok. I wonder how his wife and dead sons grandsons would feel about that though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The "Myth" of western individualism indeed. You seem to think that because we are all interelated social beings, this somehow makes punishing innocent children or bystanders understandable or ok.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every mobster understands and embraces your logic. You owe me money. Pay me or I'll kill your wife and kids. Only yahweh says: Worship only me, obey me...or I'll kill your wife and kids. I can imagine the murderious hoodlum telling the judge; "But your honor, it made sense for me to kill his wife and kids...surely your honor doesn't buy into that myth of western individuslism?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess it's sort of like the 'logic' GW Bush used to invade Irag after Al Qaeda attacked the u.s.&lt;br&gt;April 3, 2010 12:15 AM&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-2225961630717916777?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Dembski is a minor figure in a long line of failed prophets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: What is a sellable idea? How do you develop one? Is your idea enough for a book, is there more you can do to develop it, or should it just be a magazine article or series of blog posts? This will be a hands-on nuts and bolts workshop: Come with ideas to pitch. Better yet, bring a &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; (1 page or less) written proposal to read and workshop. This workshop will provide handouts on proposal writing as well as sample proposals you can use to help develop your own in the future. Useful for anyone hoping to someday write for print or online publications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_writing_fo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/_usI-GVwVQk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270314900189"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/04/weekend_diversion_eddie_izzard.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eca6b8146ac50f4d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Random Stuff"/><title type="html">Weekend Diversion: Eddie Izzard, Star Wars, and Legos</title><published>2010-04-03T17:39:08Z</published><updated>2010-04-03T17:39:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/04/weekend_diversion_eddie_izzard.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"But with dogs, we do have 'bad dog.'

Eddie Izzard is a funny, funny man.  If you haven't seen his stand-up act (especially &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_(Eddie_Izzard)"&gt;Circle&lt;/a&gt;, IMO), you are missing out.  Someone set one of his funniest bits -- the Death Star Canteen -- to Legos, and the results are hilarious.

He &lt;i&gt;wants&lt;/i&gt; to formally leave the Catholic church, so he followed the official procedures…and what does he get? A long letter from a priest telling him how wonderful the church is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe he needs to send the priest this &lt;a href="http://videocafe.crooksandliars.com/heather/bill-donohue-doubles-down-his-homosexualit"&gt;video of Bill Donohue reiterating his claim that the problem is the infiltration of the church by the homosexual agenda&lt;/a&gt;. The low point for me was when the really terrible interviewer, Rick Sanchez, asks whether the problem with the church isn't priestly celibacy, and Donohue smugly takes this as a vindication of his point, somehow. I don't get it. He sure seems positive that he's got a logical point connecting celibacy with gayness, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's hard to question one's desire to leave the church when one sees the kind of vermin defending it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, a while back I tried to follow the official Lutheran church&amp;#39;s procedure for being formally stricken from the rolls, and wrote to the only church I was ever a member of, way back in my childhood. They have no record of me, not even a baptismal record. I felt a little miffed that I was forgotten, but I got over it — I guess this just means I was never really a Christian, which is fine with me. I can set that brief youthful embarrassment aside and pretend it never happened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/they_dont_want_to_let_you_go.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/O1zBynFM8GE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270313391572"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/todays_carnivals_484.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/038425d62cace6b1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2010-04-03T17:37:50Z</published><updated>2010-04-03T17:37:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/WjIM7KhJe9k/todays_carnivals_484.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/todays_carnivals_484.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=djj249z_70tjrbzmfq"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Students compete in the Computational Linguistics Olympiad by solving challenging problems using data from a variety of languages and formal systems.  There is no pre-requisite knowledge.  Students discover facts about languages and formal systems in the course of solving the puzzles.  This year students solved a total of 16 problems, including deciphering the rules for a Pig-Latin-like play language in Minangkabau, the writing systems of Plains Cree, and the Vietnamese classic Tale of Kieu written in Chinese characters.    Computational problems dealt with text compression and automatic expansion of abbreviated words.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those interested in more detail, the &lt;a href="http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu"&gt;NACLO website&lt;/a&gt; gives the problems from previous years. For example, the first problem in the &lt;a href="http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu/assets/problems/naclo09prob_r2.pdf"&gt;invitational round of the 2009 competition&lt;/a&gt; involved figuring out a shift-reduce parser for the button presses in P-Little's Triple-I XTreem Hyp()th3tica7 Sk8boarding Game;  the second one involves decoding Linear B; and the third one requires you to figure out some aspects of Bulgarian morphology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NACLO website also &lt;a href="http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu/history.html"&gt;explains the history&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The idea of holding academic Challenges in linguistics stems from a long tradition of linguistics and mathematics competitions, which began in Moscow in the 1960s. In 1984, Bulgaria began holding similar competitions, and contests were first held in the United States at the University of Oregon starting in 1998. Bulgaria hosted the First International Olympiad in Linguistics in Borovetz in September of 2003, and subsequent International Olympiads have been held in Moscow, Russia in 2004, Leiden, The Netherlands in 2005, and in Tartu, Estonia in 2006. More recently, universities in Estonia, Finland, Netherlands, the United States, and other countries have begun sponsoring such outreach activities aimed at high school students. Participating as individuals and in country teams, students are given challenging sets of language data and language puzzles to solve, with the chance to win prizes and international recognition. Students learn about the richness, diversity and systematicity of language, while exercising natural logic and reasoning skills. No prior knowledge of languages or linguistics is necessary, but the competitions have proven very successful in attracting top students to study in the field of linguistics and computational linguistics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad picks up on this long tradition, with a focus on computational thinking as it relates to solving linguistics problems. In addition to the traditional linguistics problems, NAMCLO endeavors to introduce students to computational problem solving as it relates specifically to natural language data.&lt;/p&gt;

Evolution in action! Check with your local humane society!&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;She's responding to the idea that Lenski’s long-term experiment with &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;E. coli&lt;/span&gt; has led to bacteria that have "changed shape, changed size, changed metabolism and changed food source." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Denyse replies ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;So the claim is, “changed shape, changed size, changed metabolism and changed food source. How much more MACRO do you expect an organism to evolve?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hmmmm. Kittens do this all the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Change size? You bet. Goes from a couple of ounces to five lbs in half a year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Change shape? Sure. The average newborn kitten is just a little bag of mewing metabolism, blind and probably deaf, whose only real talent is using its sense of smell to get control of a teat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Changed metabolism? Sort of. Kittens must be weaned onto something other than cat milk after about six or seven weeks. I am not a vet, but surely some changes in metabolism accompany this transition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Changed food source? Yes! From mom cat to local rodents, birds, frogs, and eggs that can be cracked by being pushed off the branch or table. Or, if the cat is under human management, a science-based diet for growing felines. Or otherwise, scavenging a local dumpster. Or whatever an obligate carnivore* like the cat can stomach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay, so where are we now? We have explained how a kitten gets transformed into … a cat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And this is “evolution”?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thanks for the comic relief, Denyse.

The shroud is a 14th century fake relic, as has been well documented by historical sources and radiocarbon analysis. Here's a quick machine-assisted translation of &lt;a href="http://www.vof.se/folkvett/20041skeptiskt-abc#turin-svepningen"&gt;a 2004 article&lt;/a&gt; I wrote on the subject.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The shroud of Turin&lt;/b&gt;, a linen cloth, 4.5 x 1.2 m, with the image of a wounded male body. The wounds are consistent with the New Testament's portrayal of the last days and death of Jesus of Nazareth. The cloth depicts both the body's front and back as if it had been folded over the body which then made an instant impression in light brown where it touched the fabric, almost like a photographic film. The body's sides do not appear as they would if the cloth had been wrapped around a corpse. The fabric has been radiocarbon-dated to AD 1260-1390. This date coincides with the first written mention of the cloth from AD 1357. At the time it was displayed in a small church built for that purpose by Geoffrey de Charny at Lirey in northern France. Subsequently, the cloth has been kept in the Italian city of Turin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many have wanted to believe, or even do so still, that the cloth is the shroud of Jesus. The skilfully crafted cloth is in fact a piece of Medieval church art, or, put less favourably, a counterfeit relic. It is based on the same idea as the legend of St. Veronica's veil, which tells of a woman who dabbed at Jesus' face on his way to Calvary, whereupon his image appeared on the cloth. This story too inspired Medieval relic makers. Those who believe that the shroud of Turin is Jesus' shroud assume that it is identical to a shroud that allegedly disappeared in the sack of Constantinople in 1204, and that the cloth was nearly 1200 years old even then. The shroud of Constantinople and other pictorial cloths mentioned during the Middle Ages should rather be seen as members of the same artefact type as the shroud of Turin, that is, as evidence that the shroud of Jesus was an established type among the era's relic manufacturers. Already upon the shroud's original display in Lirey the area's bishop demanded that it be removed because it was in his opinion a forgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Middle Ages, relics of popular saints could attract huge numbers of pilgrims to a church and thus also generate huge revenues. The most prominent example is Santiago de Compostela in northern Spain. The city became one of the Christian world's main pilgrimages thanks to an unlikely story that Jesus' scantily documented brother James had been buried there. Perhaps Geoffrey de Charny had similar hopes for his church and its relic. But Lirey remained a small village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never watched the History Channel. But I've reviewed two pretty poor archaeology specials of theirs (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2008/07/film_review_journey_to_10000_b.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/01/film_review_the_real_tomb_hunt.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) that they sent me on DVD. And now this: endorsing mistaken beliefs on a long-settled issue. Tell me, Dear Reader -  isn't the History Channel kinda crap?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update 4 April:&lt;/b&gt; Lots of hits and comments on this one! Looking at the reactions, it's almost as if I had questioned some central tenet of Christianity. Actually, I reject all supernatural tenets of all religions -- but there's nothing about that issue in the above blog entry. It's about the date of a certain piece of linen fabric. Despite what the History Channel might say (I'm in Sweden and I don't subscribe to cable), there is no non-religious reason to question the radiocarbon analyses. The samples were not taken from secondary repair threads, and the idea of smoke contamination is a piece of special pleading that professional archaeologists and radiocarbon analysts do not accept. It was the subject of one of creationist &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2007/10/dimitri_kouznetsov_repeat_offe.php"&gt;Dimitri Kouznetsov's fraudulent papers&lt;/a&gt;. And anyway: even if a person is a devout Christian, they needn't believe that the shroud of Turin is more than 700 years old. Many large sects within that religion in fact stress the importance of faith &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; proof. To such a theology, hanging on to the shroud of Turin is a mark of weak faith.&lt;/p&gt;

Z. (“evolution’s answer to Rush Limbaugh”) and me.  What a thin skin that man has!  But there are many lolz:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having said this, it seems to me that it was perfectly open to Sir John  Templeton to have put his money into a foundation that seeks to  reconcile science and religion. The money was earned honorably, even  though one might have some questions about Sir John’s decampment to the  Bahamas and its tax-free economy.  But so long as America is daft enough  to let people get away with this, who am I to object?  Speaking as one  who has probably no more religious beliefs than Richard Dawkins, I don’t  see anything morally wrong with someone trying to reconcile science and  religion. Clarifying that a little, I don’t see anything morally wrong  with religion as such. These days I don’t much care for the Catholic  Church, whether it be abusing small children, covering up the crimes of  the priests involved, or leading the charge against universal health  care because the restrictions on abortion were not sufficiently  stringent. But I care for the work that the Church does among the poor  and the sick, and I care also about the work that many Evangelicals are  doing in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who ever said it was “morally wrong” to reconcile science and religion? It’s philosophically and logically wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Oh, and just when you thought that the Catholic Church couldn’t get more clueless, listen to this.  &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8601084.stm"&gt;The BBC reports &lt;/a&gt;that the  Pope’s personal preacher, Reverend Raniero Cantalamessa, has compared criticism of the Pope and the Church’s handling of the child-abuse scandal to anti-Semitism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rev Raniero Cantalamessa was speaking at Good Friday prayers in  St Peter’s Basilica, attended by the Pope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his sermon, he  quoted a Jewish friend as saying the accusations reminded him of the  “more shameful aspects of anti-Semitism”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His comments angered  Jewish groups and those representing abuse victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father  Cantalamessa said Jews throughout history had been the victims of  “collective violence” and drew a comparison with recent attacks on the  Roman Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He read the congregation part of a letter  from a Jewish friend who said he was “following with disgust the violent  and concentric attacks against the Church, the Pope…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The use  of stereotypes, the shifting of personal responsibility and guilt to a  collective guilt remind me of the most shameful aspects of  anti-Semitism,” he quoted from the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;On the upside, over at &lt;em&gt;Metamagician&lt;/em&gt; Russell Blackford, feeling feisty, says that &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2010/04/some-speech-deserves-to-be-marginalised.html"&gt;“Some speech needs to be marginalized.”&lt;/a&gt; That includes a lot of religious speech:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;But some ideas, though not censored, should be given only a marginal  place in our society. In every generation, we continue to debate which  those are. I am hopeful that future generations will include not only  the examples I’ve given, such as the ideas of reinstituting slavery or  punishing homosexuals, but also such examples as the ludicrous idea that  the Earth is only 6000 years old (contrary to all conclusions from  rational investigation). Likewise for the idea that there is something  even “sinful” about (as opposed to grounds for banning) consenting  homosexual conduct between sufficiently mature people, or that “sin”  attaches to the use of contraceptives or to masturbation. Like the  advocacy of slavery, these foolish ideas no longer deserve a level  playing field in our society. Let them be freely derided, ridiculed, and  driven to the margins. The sooner, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for religious  leaders, they certainly do not deserve the kind of deference they  currently receive, or the megaphones they are provided by the news media  for their pronouncements. They do not deserve to be looked upon as  moral or community leaders, or to be given a privileged voice in public  debate. Some – such as those Protestant fundamentalists who claim the  Earth is only 6000 years old or the celibate, white-haired dinosaurs of  the Vatican who think that the use of contraception is a sin – deserve  to be accorded little more intellectual credibility than would be given,  in a modern city such as Melbourne, to a slavery advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not  all ideas deserve to be taken seriously and considered respectfully, and  not all people deserve to be accorded intellectual legitimacy. We can  argue about who and what falls into which category, but there is no  doubt that some speech deserves to be marginalised … and that  certainly applies to a lot of religious speech. There’s no need to be  backward about saying so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What's the difference between softcore and hardcore insomnia you ask? Softcore insomnia = complaint of insomnia with normal sleep duration greater than or equal to 6 hours of sleepHardcore insomnia = complaint of insomnia with less than or equal to 6 hours of sleepFernandez-Mendoza and colleagues from Penn State University College of Medicine grouped 678 participants from the general population using the aforementioned criteria (although without the sophisticated categorical nomenclature) to see what between-group differences in neuropsychological performance they would find. They controlled for age, race, gender, education, body mass index, and physical and mental health. The comprehensive neuropsychological battery included tests of  processing speed, attention, visual memory, and verbal fluency. The researchers found no difference in performance between softcore insomniacs and controls. However, the hardcore insomniacs did worse on all tests compared to the controls and, get this, controls with less than 6 hours of sleep. Here it seems to be the case that it's only a problem if you make it one. "It's all about perception" as my former professor use to rant. The most significant finding was that hardcore insomniacs did the worst on tasks that required executive control of attention (set-switching). So if you're truly a hardcore insomniac, do yourself a favor and stay away from multi-tasking. For the rest of you softcore insomniacs, suck it up! At least you don't have real-life cognitive deficits (unless you're counting whining as a cognitive deficit).ulio Fernandez-Mendoza, MSc1,2,3; Susan Calhoun, PhD1; Edward O.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research  Council (BBSRC) at the University of Birmingham have discovered that a  gene called DAF-16 is strongly involved in determining the rate of  ageing and average lifespan of the laboratory worm &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis  elegans&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;) and its close evolutionary cousins.  DAF-16 is found in many other animals, including humans. It is possible  that this knowledge could open up new avenues for altering ageing,  immunity and resistance to stresses in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it will be years before any practical application to humans comes out of this, if ever, but it’s cool none the less.&lt;/p&gt;

Now another exorcist, Father Gabriele Amorth, has publicly stated that the media’s desire to inform the public of these crimes, particularly at the New York Times, was “prompted by the devil.” I could have told you that.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Catholic Church  disapproves of the annual ritual of devotion but says it cannot stop  people in Asia’s largest Roman Catholic country from being voluntarily  nailed to a cross or flagellating themselves, only educate them that it  isn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the Catholic Church would much rather they celebrate in a more traditional fashion, by raping young boys and covering it up.&lt;/p&gt;

And it couldn’t come at a more perfect time as it perfectly coincides with &lt;a href="http://www.nycskeptics.org/blog/face-of-jesus-discovered-in-rorschach-test/"&gt;my April Fools piece in the Gotham Skeptic&lt;/a&gt; about the discovery of Jesus’ face in a Rorschach Test.

The answer tragically is yes when it comes to the Monty Hall Problem. For those who don’t know what the Monty Hall Problem is, here’s a  summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you’re in a game show and your  host shows you three doors.  Behind one of them is a shiny car and  behind the others are far less  lustrous goats. You pick one of the  doors and get whatever lies within.  After making your choice, your host  opens one of the other two doors,  which inevitably reveals a goat. He  then asks you if you want to stick  with your original pick, or swap to  the other remaining door. What do  you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people think that  it doesn’t make a difference and they tend to  stick with their first  pick. With two doors left, you should have even  odds of selecting the  one with the car. If you agree with this  reasoning, then you have just  fallen foul of one of the most infamous of  mathematical problems – &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem"&gt;the  Monty Hall  Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, you should actually swap every time  – doing so  means double the odds of getting the car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s  completely counter-intuitive but it really works out that way. You can  test it yourself &lt;a href="http://math.ucsd.edu/~crypto/Monty/monty.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In any  case, despite giving even professional mathematicians headaches, pigeons  have no trouble at all getting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m afraid that it’s now only  a matter of time before the great pigeon revolt to take over the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Isis is back and in a better mood.  First, she managed to find some lunch that looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="better lunch.bmp" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/better%20lunch.bmp" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="319" height="320"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: I won&amp;#39;t say that the wine helped, but it certainly didn&amp;#39;t hurt.  Note the bad ass sunglasses on the table.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She worked while she ate and then picked Little Isis up from school early to fly kites.  Then, after an afternoon of more work and a delicious dinner, she talked to Aunt Isis via her fancy webcam system.  The following conversation ensued:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Aunt Isis:&lt;/strong&gt; I think I am going to get a Brazilian wax.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Isis:&lt;/strong&gt; No you're not.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Aunt Isis:  &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.  I really am.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Isis:&lt;/strong&gt; Where are you going to get it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Aunt Isis:&lt;/strong&gt; On my [redacted by Dr. Isis]&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, would the government really continue to test top secret aircraft based on alien technology out in the open where nerdy civilians could so easily see them (while always managing to forget to bring video equipment)? For such well kept secrets, it seemed rather easy for people with no spy training to sneak a gander, don’t ya think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once Area 51 became a video game, I pretty much had to accept the truth, that there was probably nothing all that amazing happening there and claims to the contrary were primarily products of overactive imaginations. I mean after the area turned into a tourist attraction for wannabe Fox Mulders you’d think the Men In Black would move the operation to a less public locale, no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now some of the secret projects at Area 51 have been declassified and former contractors who worked on the infamous base have broken their silence, revealing that if there were space alien spacecraft or human spacecraft modeled on alien spacecraft, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/area_51_veterans_speak_no_space_aliens.php"&gt;they never saw it&lt;/a&gt;. No Aurora Project. No little green men or big-eyed grays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course they could all be lying to throw us off the real government conspiracy but that doesn’t really make much sense for various reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. Why now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. The true believers aren’t likely to take their accounts seriously anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There hasn’t been any more clamor over declassifying Area 51 than usual so if anything, this only draws more media attention to Area 51. If you’re covering up a conspiracy at Area 51, wouldn’t you want to draw as little attention to it as possible, especially since nobody of any consequence is banging on the government’s door for answers. Of course, conspiracy theorists can easily fill in any plot hole with the ever popular game of, “because they know that we know that they know that we know,” ad infinatum and argue that they these are intentional plot holes to throw us off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this meme has a life of its own now and nothing is likely to change most people’s minds about Area 51. It’s still an interesting news story none the less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CIA report &lt;a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/97unclass/ufo.html"&gt;CIA’s  Role in the Study of UFOs, 1947-90&lt;/a&gt; says it best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the JFK assassination conspiracy theories, the UFO issue probably  will not go away soon, no matter what the Agency does or says. The  belief that we are not alone in the universe is too emotionally  appealing and the distrust of our government is too pervasive to make  the issue amenable to traditional scientific studies of rational  explanation and evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/jesus-christ-face-appears-history-channel/story?id=10246233"&gt;See the ABC News story here…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/jesus-christ-face-appears-history-channel/story?id=10246233"&gt;&lt;img title="jesus face" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/jesus-face.jpg?w=468&amp;amp;h=313" alt="" width="468" height="313"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a major media fail on the part of the “History” Channel, because the entire argument that this is the face of Jesus is based upon a false premise.  Namely, the assumption on the part of both the “History” Channel and the researchers performing the computer analysis is that the Shroud of Turin actually &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; cover Christ… when in reality it didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the evidence we have to date shows quite clearly that the Shroud could not have been the funeral covering for Christ, because &lt;a href="http://www.scifidimensions.com/Aug00/jnf_shroud.htm"&gt;all signs point to it being created sometime around the 13th century A.D.&lt;/a&gt; (see my previous blog posts on the Shroud of Turin &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/10/07/shroud-of-turin-its-fake-get-over-it/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/more-shroud-science-fail/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  And, unless I’m &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bad at both math and a basic understanding of Christian theology, Jesus is supposed to have been resurrected a mere three days after his death, as opposed to &lt;strong&gt;roughly seven centuries!!! &lt;/strong&gt; All the cool technology in the world won’t change the basic fact that if you start with a bad argument (i.e., the Shroud is authentic), you’ll still end with a bad argument (i.e., the “3D face of Jesus” is the real thing).  In other words… “garbage in = garbage out”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while the “History” Channel might be going for ratings with the timing of this TV special, they get a big, fat failing grade for spreading yet more nonsense when they are supposed to be educating the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Within the next week or so, Mr. McGowan expects to cut checks for a total of $12,025, the first benefits collected and disbursed by the Foundation Beyond Belief. The foundation has 316 donors who each have committed to contributing $5 to $250 per month — a system of regular giving that is modeled on the Christian tradition of paying weekly tithes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to just be about negating somebody else,” Mr. McGowan, 47, said in a recent interview at his current home in suburban Atlanta. “And there are a lot of atheists who don’t want to be always fighting the culture wars. We need a positive expression of our values and a sense of community.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping the article spurs other atheists to &lt;a href="https://foundationbeyondbelief.org/products"&gt;take notice and begin giving&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to &lt;strong&gt;Dale McGowan&lt;/strong&gt;; I hope this is just the start of a lot of positive, mainstream publicity for the organization.&lt;br&gt;

The movie is in 3-D at select theaters but this one did not have 3-D technology. One grandchild asked the owner in the lobby if the movie is in 3-D and he went off for ten minutes telling them that watching movies in 3-D is bad for their eyes. This is a case in point for how people can justify whatever brings them money, power, or sex. Of course he thinks that. Why? Because his movie theater does not have that technology. Get it? Just imagine what he would think if he had that technology! Then he would change his tune. My contention is that Christians feel empowered by their faith. After all, they actually think God is their helper in times of need, and that they will see him and their loved ones when they die. So of course they'll defend their beliefs just like this theater owner does. One would think that precisely because believers prefer their faith to be true they should be skeptical of it, but no, they don't see this. Maybe they can learn something as outsiders listening in to that theater owner and get the point.

It's also a good example of how to write a decent popular science press piece, one that adds context to the research it references, rather than dumbing it down or papering it over. From the perspective of the reliability theory of aging and longevity, the historical increase in life expectancy has occurred because better and more widespread availability of medical technology lowers the rate at which biological damage accumulates. Prevention of chronic infectious disease, for example, falls into this category: disease applies a damage load to an individual, and that damage reduces the mean time to failure of bodily systems. "We're living longer because people are reaching old age in better health," said demographer James Vaupel, author of a review article appearing in the March 25 edition of Nature. But once it starts, the process of aging itself - including dementia and heart disease - is still happening at pretty much the same rate. "Deterioration, instead of being stretched out, is being postponed." ...

If all goes well, you’ll be reading about it in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; tomorrow and the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle of Philanthropy&lt;/em&gt; next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Director &lt;strong&gt;Dale McGowan&lt;/strong&gt; also &lt;a href="http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/blog/?p=3847"&gt;shares some fantastic news&lt;/a&gt; about how much money non-religious people are &lt;a href="http://foundationbeyondbelief.org/node/324"&gt;giving to the various charities&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thanks to our 324 contributing members, the first quarter of 2010 ended with over $12,500 raised for our first slate of beneficiaries. We’re tallying the totals for each charity and will announce final numbers next week.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.  That’s with limited media outreach, too.  We really have to thank the publicity &lt;a href="http://www.daylightatheism.org/2010/03/fbb-member-interviews-4.html"&gt;other bloggers&lt;/a&gt; have given the group for much of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that the major articles will bring more people to the cause, helping us give more money to the newest slate of charities, &lt;a href="http://foundationbeyondbelief.org/node/324"&gt;revealed yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not already giving to FBB… &lt;a href="https://foundationbeyondbelief.org/products"&gt;get to it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to the next installment of The Greatest Story Ever Told: the history of the Universe!  We started from Inflation -- the phenomenon that set up the Big Bang -- and are coming forward in time.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_6.php"&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt;, we made it up to the end of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis"&gt;nucleosynthesis&lt;/a&gt;, where we made all of the elements that the big bang makes: by mass, we have about 76% Hydrogen, 24% Helium-4, trace amounts of Helium-3, Deuterium, and a teeny-tiny bit of Lithium-7.  The Universe has also expanded and cooled off a lot during these first few &lt;i&gt;minutes&lt;/i&gt;; all that's left are our atomic nuclei, electrons, neutrinos, and a whole bunch of photons.  (You can read parts &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/01/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-.php"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/01/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_1.php"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/02/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_2.php"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/02/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_3.php"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_4.php"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_6.php"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_6.php"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; if you want a refresher.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/20050727150836%21Plasma.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/20050727150836%21Plasma-thumb-500x375-44091.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="20050727150836!Plasma.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it might not be as catastrophic as it once was, but the Universe is still just a super hot, dense plasma filled with a huge amount of radiation.  Well, what happens now?  The surprising answer -- for &lt;b&gt;thousands of years&lt;/b&gt; -- is &lt;i&gt;nothing interesting&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not?  Well, we've got a whole Universe full of heavy, positively charged nuclei and light, negatively charged electrons.  The Universe is too &lt;b&gt;cold&lt;/b&gt; to blast the nuclei apart, but too &lt;b&gt;hot&lt;/b&gt; to form neutral atoms!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/roberds1.jpeg" width="500" alt="roberds1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, you can form them for an instant, sure, but remember that for every atomic nucleus, you have &lt;b&gt;over a billion photons&lt;/b&gt;.  If even one of them has enough energy, it's going to blast that electron not just to a higher energy level (as shown below), but right out of the atom!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/Bohrup2.bmp"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/Bohrup2-thumb-500x408-44094.bmp" width="500" height="408" alt="Bohrup2.bmp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if we want to do anything else with our Universe, we first need to make some neutral atoms.  And the only way to do that?  We've got to &lt;b&gt;wait&lt;/b&gt;.  Our Universe needs to expand and cool enough for this to be possible, and unlike nucleosynthesis, where we had to wait a few minutes, we have to wait &lt;i&gt;hundreds of thousands of years!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we have to wait so long?  Take a look at the energy spectrum of our photons -- the particles of light in the Universe -- which was made famous by &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/54/"&gt;xkcd&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/spectrumCMB.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/spectrumCMB-thumb-500x417-44096.gif" width="500" height="417" alt="spectrumCMB.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes 13.6 eV of energy to ionize a hydrogen atom.  But that doesn't mean that the &lt;i&gt;average&lt;/i&gt; energy of the Universe needs to drop below 13.6 eV.  Look at that graph above.  Notice how, even though the &lt;i&gt;average&lt;/i&gt; photon has a frequency of around 6 in the graph, there are still plenty with a higher frequency (and hence higher energy).  In fact, because photons are so numerous (again, outnumbering nuclei by a factor in the &lt;b&gt;billions&lt;/b&gt;), we need the average energy to drop down to about 2% of the ionizing energy!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, the only way the energy drops is because the Universe cools as it expands.  Light -- &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; light -- has a wavelength, and the longer the wavelength, the lower the energy, and hence the cooler it gets.  As the Universe expands, the wavelength gets stretched out, and so the Universe gets colder!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/I02-06-expansion.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/I02-06-expansion-thumb-500x315-44098.jpeg" width="500" height="315" alt="I02-06-expansion.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now the question becomes: &lt;i&gt;how long&lt;/i&gt; do we have to wait for the Universe to cool down this much?  And sadly, the answer is &lt;b&gt;380,000 years&lt;/b&gt;!  It took 7 parts to just tell some highlights from the first five minutes of the Universe, and then almost nothing of interest happens for hundreds of thousands of years!  No stars, no galaxies, nothing.  We have to wait this long &lt;b&gt;just to get neutral atoms&lt;/b&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/237110_f520.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/237110_f520-thumb-500x503-44100.jpeg" width="500" height="503" alt="237110_f520.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once you get them, you're in business!  All of a sudden, the light that used to bounce off of protons, electrons, and other nuclei now simply travels in a straight line!  All of those billions and billions of photons, once we form neutral atoms, don't interact with anything anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until, that is, they run into something.  Like, for instance, &lt;b&gt;us&lt;/b&gt;.  Can we &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; this leftover radiation from the big bang?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/Bell_Labs_Horn_Antenna_Crawford_Hill_NJ.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/Bell_Labs_Horn_Antenna_Crawford_Hill_NJ-thumb-500x375-44104.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="Bell_Labs_Horn_Antenna_Crawford_Hill_NJ.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You bet we can!  &lt;a href="http://startswithabang.com/?p=1763"&gt;In the 1960s&lt;/a&gt;, we discovered the leftover radiation from the big bang, which has now shifted into the microwave!  In fact, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_last_100_years_the_2000s_a.php"&gt;in the 2000s&lt;/a&gt;, we measured the fluctuations in the microwave background, and what did we find?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/080997_5yrFullSky_WMAP_2048W.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/080997_5yrFullSky_WMAP_2048W-thumb-500x250-44102.png" width="500" height="250" alt="080997_5yrFullSky_WMAP_2048W.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fluctuations are &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; the kind we expect to get &lt;b&gt;from inflation!&lt;/b&gt;  These observations are &lt;b&gt;huge&lt;/b&gt; verifications of our picture of how the Universe work.  In fact, just this -- the story of the formation of neutral atoms and the leftover glow -- was to lead to the widespread acceptance of the big bang and the rejection of pretty much every alternative.  Why?  Because &lt;b&gt;they don't predict this leftover glow &lt;i&gt;that we see&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So -- for those of you who don't like the big bang -- this is your number one challenge when you make a theory of the Universe.  Can you explain the observed abundances of the elements?  Can you explain the leftover microwave radiation?  Can you explain the fluctuations in that microwave radiation?  And can you explain the expansion of the Universe?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These first eight parts have put us in a great place, and we're now set up -- with a Universe full of neutral atoms -- for things to get both interesting and &lt;i&gt;familiar&lt;/i&gt;!

It also tried to convey the importance of evolutionary psychology in explaining fiction. The piece opened with Professor Lisa Zunshine discussing Phoebe&amp;#39;s complex theory of mind in the sitcom Friends:(Follow closely now; this is about the science of English.) Phoebe and Rachel plot to play a joke on Monica and Chandler after they learn  the two are  secretly dating. The couple discover the prank and try to  turn the tables, but Phoebe realizes this turnabout and once again tries  to outwit them.As Phoebe tells Rachel, “They don’t know that we know they know we know.” 1The juxtaposition of ideas makes perfect sense, now doesn&amp;#39;t it?Theory of mind is &amp;quot;the ability to attribute mental states—beliefs, intents, desires, pretending, knowledge, etc.—to oneself and others and to understand that others have beliefs, desires and intentions that are different from one&amp;#39;s own.&amp;quot; ToM has been studied by cognitive and developmental psychologists for a long time (quite nicely) without input from English professors.But the Next Big Thing in English: Knowing They Know That You Know continues, trying to convince us of the coming revolution.. . .At a time when university literature departments are confronting painful budget cuts, a moribund job market and pointed scrutiny about the purpose and value of an education in the humanities, the cross-pollination of English and psychology is a providing a revitalizing lift.Jonathan Gottschall, who has written  extensively about using evolutionary theory to explain fiction, said  “it’s a new moment of hope” in an era when everyone is talking about “the death of the humanities.” To Mr. Gottschall a scientific approach can rescue literature departments from the malaise that has embraced them over the last decade and a half. Zealous enthusiasm for the politically charged and frequently arcane theories that energized  departments in the 1970s, ’80s and early ’90s — Marxism, structuralism,2   psychoanalysis — has faded. Since then a new generation of scholars have  been casting about for The Next Big Thing.So literature is abandoning Marxism and psychoanalysis in favor of  neuroimaging!!  Meanwhile, key  neuroimagers have taken up psychoanalysis (Carhart-Harris &amp;amp; Friston, 2010) and socialism (Tricomi et al., 2010).These recent efforts seem to fit into the recently  maligned  microfield of neuro-lit-crit. An article by Raymond Tallis appeared in The Times Literary Supplement with the provocative title, &amp;quot;The  Neuroscience Delusion.&amp;quot; Its central theme?Neuroaesthetics  is wrong about our experience of literature – and it is wrong about  humanity....The literary critic as neuroscience groupie is part of a growing trend.We have become accustomed over the past half-century to critics sending out to other disciplines for “theoretical frameworks” in which to place their engagement with works of literature. The results have often been dire, the work or author in question disappearing in a sea of half-comprehended or uncritically incorporated linguistics, mathematics, psychiatry, political theory, history, or whatever.Tallis was writing in response to an article by acclaimed novelist A.S. Byatt on how the scientific zeitgeist influences contemporary writers. In an obvious example, the centrality of sex in Darwinian and Freudian thought had a clear impact on the novels of Saul  Bellow and Philip Roth. Byatt also looks ahead to the possible role of neuroscience in illuminating artistic understanding:Novel thoughtsNeuroscience is helping us to understand how art works – and it may offer us a way out of narcissism. . ....Neuroscience, and the study of  the activity of the brain, is beginning to bring its own illumination to  our  understanding of how art works, and what it is. I have come to see the  delight in making connections – of which metaphor-making is one of the  most  intense – as perhaps the fundamental reason for art and its pleasures.  Philip Davis, at Liverpool University, has been working with scientists  on  responses to Shakespeare’s syntax, and has found that the connecting  links  between neurones stay “live” – lit up for longer – after responding to  Shakespeare’s words, especially his novel formations of verbs from  nouns,  than they do in the case of “ordinary” sentences.I critiqued an early version of the Shakespeare study, before it was published in a peer-reviewed journal (by Thierry et al., 2008). At the time, press coverage was rather simplistic (and incorrect) about the observed findings, using phrases like &amp;quot;the brain is positively excited&amp;quot; to describe an EEG component of positive polarity. However, the published paper was written by an expert on EEG studies of language and is quite respectable. That is part of the point here: it&amp;#39;s best to not leave the neuroimaging   media sound bytes entirely up to the English professors.3In brief, Thierry, Davis and colleagues wanted to observe what happens to the brain when people read passages containing the Shakespearean functional shift, a linguistic device that involves using a noun to  serve as a verb (for example).To explain a little, the researchers recorded EEG while  participants read selections from Shakespeare. They were looking for  EEG signatures of semantic  violations (indexed by a negative voltage brain wave at ~400 msec,  called the N400)  and syntactic  violations (indexed by a positive-voltage brain wave at ~600 msec,  called the P600).Above figure from a different study, published in Biological Psychology by Isel et al.  (2006)The brain waves were obtained by averaging a  bunch of EEG trials together, and these event-related  potential (ERP) components reflect summed electrical activity  (post-synaptic potentials) from a huge number of pyramidal cells,  recorded remotely from the scalp (to put it simply). The polarity of  these components (i.e., positive or negative) does not indicate whether  they are excitatory or inhibitory.The stimulus materials were well-controlled for a number of factors. Some example sentences are given below.Alternatives to the critical word are given between brackets. The  functional shift is in bold, followed by...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/15/finally-some-good-news-for-simon-singh-2/"&gt;short background&lt;/a&gt; of the story: Singh wrote an article in 2008 saying that the British Chiropractic Association “is the respectable face of the chiropractic profession and yet it happily promotes bogus treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCA didn’t like that “bogus” was an accurate representation of the junk they promote, so they sued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Singh &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8598472.stm"&gt;won his appeal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 The High Court had said the words were fact not opinion — meaning Dr Singh could not use the fair comment defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, Master of the Rolls Lord Neuberger and Lord Justice Sedley ruled High Court judge Mr Justice Eady had “erred in his approach” last May, and allowed Dr Singh’s appeal.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.chiropractic-uk.co.uk/gfx/uploads/textbox/Singh/BCA%20statement%201st%20April%202010.pdf"&gt;BCA has responded&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) and &lt;strong&gt;Rebecca Watson&lt;/strong&gt; nicely &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/simon-singh-wins-appeal-bca-releases-statement/"&gt;paraphrases their press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“We’re not trying to stamp on free speech and scientific debate. We’re just bankrupting Simon Singh until he stops criticizing us and goes away. Yes, The Guardian offered us the opportunity to publicly defend our claims with science, but that’s absurd –- &lt;em&gt;we don’t have any science to defend our claims&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that at this point pretty much everyone thinks we’re a bunch of shit heads, but that’s because we were following our lawyers’ advice! And even though we’ll continue to look like bigger shit heads the longer we keep this charade going, we’re prepared to drag this out for years. After all, if we’re going to singlehandedly destroy the chiropractic industry, we’re going to take Simon Singh down with us. Because that’s exactly the kind of shit heads we are.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case isn’t over yet, but the advantage is now with Singh.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s hoping he can win the case in full.&lt;br&gt;

They claim to accept the findings of science but assert that those findings comport absolutely with religion, or at least religion as it’s “properly understood.”  But they’ve now surrendered any claim to scientific veracity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with their usual policy, they have a post on their website—a discussion with theologian Alister McGrath—that &lt;a href="http://biologos.org/blog/what-are-we-to-make-of-adam-and-eve/"&gt;deals with whether Adam and Eve were historical figures&lt;/a&gt; (see below).  As one might expect from BioLogos, McGrath asserts that it makes “more sense” to see Adam and Eve as metaphors that  “encapsulate the human race as a whole”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/02/biologos-abjures-science/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/yL5su0zmpKM/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, oh hai, in another place, discussing a different video that was removed from their website, BioLogos makes &lt;a href="http://biologos.org/blog/why-must-the-church-come-to-accept-evolution-an-update/"&gt;this statement&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Dr. Waltke believes in a historical Adam and Eve, and was  concerned that some might construe his appearance on our site as his own  tacit approval for their non-historicity.  In actuality, BioLogos does  not take an official position on the historicity of Adam and Eve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BioLogos does not take an official position on the historicity of Adam and Eve??&lt;/em&gt; Do they not realize what they’re saying?  This is like asserting that “BioLogos does not take an official position on the age of the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam and Eve &lt;em&gt;did not exist&lt;/em&gt;, and we know that because the entire human race did not descend from two people who were created &lt;em&gt;ex nihilo&lt;/em&gt; about 6,000 years ago.  Science tells us that.  If BioLogos doesn’t take an official position on Adam and Eve, then they’re flying in the face of scientific fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their refusal to take a stand on this issue is, pure and simple, intellectual cowardice, designed to avoid alienating some of their more literal-minded followers.  It’s equivalent to the Discovery Institute’s refusal to take an official position on the age of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And BioLogos no longer can credibly claim that they accept scientific truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As data, I used the transcripts of the Fisher English conversational speech corpus, recorded in 2003 and published by the LDC in 2004 and 2005. There are 11,699 conversations in all, or 23,398 conversational sides. As transcribed, the average number of words per conversational side is 960.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median rate of &lt;em&gt;uh&lt;/em&gt; usage was about 2.6 per thousand words. But 8,494 of the 23,398 conversational sides (36%) had no instances of &lt;em&gt;uh&lt;/em&gt; at all, at least as transcribed; and some had a lot — one conversational side had 80 uhs in 592 total words, for a rate of 135 per thousand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correlation between the rates of &lt;em&gt;uh&lt;/em&gt; usage on the two sides of a conversation was r= 0.383.  This is not especially high — it means that only about 15% of the variance in overall rate of &lt;em&gt;uh&lt;/em&gt; usage is explained by knowing the interlocutor's rate. Still, it's certainly statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some ways of looking at the relationship are more striking. Thus of the 4,235 conversations in which the A side never used &lt;em&gt;uh&lt;/em&gt;, in 3,507 cases (83%) the B side also never used &lt;em&gt;uh&lt;/em&gt;. In contrast, in the 7,464 conversations in which the A side used &lt;em&gt;uh&lt;/em&gt; at least once, there were only 752 (10%) in where the B side failed to use &lt;em&gt;uh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One graphical way to look at the relationship would be to compare the distribution of uh-usage rates for conversations where the partner's uh-usage was greater than the median, to the distribution of rates in conversations where the partner's uh-usage was less than the median. Here's a "&lt;a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v28/c01/paper"&gt;bean plot&lt;/a&gt;" that does this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/UhRate2.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/UhRate2.png" alt="" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've plotted the square root of the rate of &lt;em&gt;uh&lt;/em&gt; usage, just to spread out the distributions a bit. If we leave out the zero-rate cases, a comparison of the log of the &lt;em&gt;uh&lt;/em&gt;-rate distributions is suggestive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/UhRate3.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/UhRate3.png" alt="" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of trivial explanations for this pattern come to mind. For example, transcribers sometimes edit out disfluencies (though the transcribers were instructed not to do so in this case), and so it's conceivable that this correlation reflects variation in the behavior of the transcribers rather than variation in the behavior of the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the correlation is really (at least in part) a fact about the behavior of speakers, "accommodation" of filled-pause usage is not the only possible explanation for the correlation. There might well be shared factors (complexity of the subject-matter, for example) that would influence both participants at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we know that rates of &lt;em&gt;uh&lt;/em&gt; usage vary with age and sex. There&amp;#39;s no guarantee that this set of conversations is balanced for pairings of ages and sexes — in fact, the distribution of &lt;a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/docs/LDC2004T19/fe_03_topics.sgm"&gt;topics&lt;/a&gt; might well lead to sex or age correlations among speakers. So it would be helpful to use multiple regression to see if the interlocutor's rate of &lt;em&gt;uh&lt;/em&gt;-usage still had an effect, when sex and age were also included in the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I'll take these results as tending to confirm Michael's conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;

The goal of VS is to complement high-throughput screening (HTS) and the ideal goal is to at least partly substitute HTS in finding new hits.But this goal is still far from being achieved. VS still has to make a significant contribution in the discovery of a major drug and typical hit rates range from a few tenths of a percent to perhaps a percent or two. VS has been intensively investigated for more than a decade. What do we know about its limitations, and where do we go from here?Gisbert Schneider of ETH Zurich has some thoughts on VS in a recent review. Success in VS ultimately boils down to understanding the detailed structure and dynamics of protein-ligand complexes, a goal that we are still miles away from. We still struggle to realistically include entropy in any calculation, and we are still not completely clear about the role that buried water molecules play in dictating ligand binding. Plus we cannot yet take allosteric binding properly into account, let alone more complex interactions like protein-protein interactions. Thus, maybe, as pointed out in a past post and article, the correct question to ask would be the "anti-question", namely, why does VS work at all in spite of this supposedly woeful lack of understanding?First of all it is important to know what VS can do well and what it can't. As the article notes, VS is still best for negative selection, that is for weeding out inactive molecules which are bad binders. One of the goals of VS is also to duplicate the correct protein-bound x-ray conformation of the ligand, and in this endeavor (termed pose prediction) VS seems to be succeeding much better than in the ultimate goal which is to rank ligand binding to a protein in order of free energy of binding. As the article notes, the true binding interaction energy landscape for a protein might be more of a plateau; thus there may be a variety of protein-ligand contacts corresponding to a 'good' solution, rather than a global optimum. Plus, one may end up modeling details that are not very relevant to the gist of the ligand binding event; in such a case productive contacts can be preserved with no great sacrifice of qualitative prediction.Nonetheless, tiny details can sometimes radically shift the balance. No wonder that VS has been heavily dependent on the target rather than on the computational algorithm. Nature continues to throw up surprises as protein entropy, hydrophobic interactions and subtle behavior of water molecules continue to be uncovered as powerful forces operating for a particular protein-ligand complex.In the end, modeling the dynamic behavior of macromolecules is an absolute must for lending general utility to VS campaigns. In the absence of adequate modeling of entropy, it may be wise from a practical viewpoint to aim for ligand chemotypes whose binding is dominated more by enthalpic effects. It's interesting to note a past set of studies which I had highlighted which suggested that it's really the enthalpy rather than entropy which is rendered favorable in a drug discovery project as one proceeds from hit to lead.Finally, the author makes an appeal to fields spread far and wide to come up with ideas that could be applied in VS and related approaches. It is likely that while incremental improvements will continue to be made in the field through better understanding of protein-ligand interactions, only a novel idea would revolutionize the field. Thus insights could possibly come from unlikely quarters, including complexity theory, non linear dynamics, other aspects of physics and even engineering and architecture. How this might happen is not at all clear, but it definitely calls for more multidisciplinary work and for more scientists from diverse fields to become interested in the problem. After all VS is fundamentally an optimization problem, one of locating the optimal ligand energetic minimum in a multidimensional landscape of protein, ligand, ions and solvent. I can't see why any mathematician, physicist or engineer worth his or her salt won't find it exciting.Schneider, G. (2010). Virtual screening: an endless staircase?

&lt;p&gt;   A couple of recent news articles have helped me to see the bright side of poisoning the biosphere.&lt;br&gt;
  A border dispute between India and Bangladesh has been resolved by rising ocean levels.  A small island called South Talpatti Island (in Bangladesh) has disappeared beneath the waves.  It used to be just south of the Hariabhanga river, if you want to check your older maps.  This significant contribution to world peace may be just the start of the goodness to come.&lt;/p&gt;

I can tell you that things are abuzz at the JREF as we finalize plans, make arrangements, and put the finishing touches on what promises to be the biggest and most exciting TAM ever. Really. And though we say that every year, we've been right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you coming to TAM and for those of you considering it, I've put together a list of five things that you may not have thought you'd need. TAM can be a bit hard to explain, and this list might help some of you get a better grasp of what you're in for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) A Deck of Cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;No, you won't be bored enough to want to play solitaire, but you will be amazed at the numbers of amateur and professional magicians at the gathering. At my first TAM, I sat in amazement one lunch as a flaming wallet appeared from a man's pocket (Aye Jay), a fork bent before my eyes (Jonny Zavant), and a chosen card rose by mysterious powers from a normal Bicycle deck (Larry Thornton). This was just lunch. I also found out my table guests included the legendary Jay Marshall and one of Oppenheimer's assistants on the Manhattan Project. This was the moment I realized TAM was something special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Another reason to bring cards is that they make a great way to collect signatures. Most of the speakers are available for autographs throughout the conference, and it's becoming a tradition to have them sign playing cards. You'll have to decide who the King of Hearts and Ace of Spades are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) An iPhone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;It's becoming rather comical how many of us in the skeptical community have iPhones, and this year, we're going to take advantage of that. We're currently working on several iPhone apps, and one of them will be TAM-related. It's early yet and and we may not be able to pull it off in time, but your iPhone is still a valuable implement at TAM. Last year, the hotel's WiFi network did work in the conference center, so if you paid for WiFi in your room, you could use it during TAM (This is subject to change, YMMV). And for those of you who haven't joined the iCult yet, don't despair—there will be plenty of people there trying to show you how their phone can remotely start their car or bake a turkey. (Yes, I made those up. I hope.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Business Cards Too!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;TAM has become THE place for making contacts in the skeptical community. Many of the names you see now as leaders in the movement got their start by meeting people at TAM. Bring cards, even personal ones you've printed yourself, and hand them around. Lifelong friends, business partners, and life partners have been made during breaks at TAM. Last year's surprise wedding at TAM happened because I introduced a couple of folks at TAM 4. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Permission to Take Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;I tend to be "slow to warm," as they say down south; I'm not the type to go up to a group of strangers and join them for lunch. However, that's EXACTLY what you should do at TAM. These are YOUR people. They are friendly, and they want to get to know you. Many of them are just as curious as you are, so take a risk and take a chair. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at what results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) An Open Mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;TAM is many things wonderful things—welcoming, inviting, exciting, refreshing—but it can also be challenging. This is not a place where we get together just to agree on things, though that certainly happens. As skeptics, we expect to encounter new evidence and alter our conclusion, and TAM is an excellent place for that. You'll see presentations that you agree with 100% and others that you think are way off the mark. Which is more valuable? That's hard to say, actually, because chances are that you'll learn more from the one you don't agree with. Be prepared for that. Be prepared for others to ask you for evidence for you beliefs, and be prepared to ask others why they believe what they do. It's part of the experience, and is to be celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's less than two weeks left to take advantage of the early-registration discount for TAM. If you've come to previous TAMs, you can expect more of the same. And I mean A LOT more. If you've never been before, this is your year. It's an opportunity not to be missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crowdsourcing news, videos, reviews, and even books is common practice these days, but what about your kid’s name? Tina Roth Eisenberg, known as Swissmiss on her &lt;a href="http://www.swiss-miss.com/"&gt;popular design blog&lt;/a&gt;, just gave birth to a &lt;a href="http://www.swiss-miss.com/2010/02/please-welcome-tilo-red-eisenberg.html"&gt;beautiful baby boy&lt;/a&gt; on Valentine’s Day. His moniker was a given – she affectionately refers to him as swissmister on her site – but picking his real name proved more difficult. Like a true new media whiz, she went to the Web. She broadcast her search for a name, set the conditions (four-letter boy name), and &lt;a href="http://www.swiss-miss.com/2009/11/extreme-crowdsourcing.html"&gt;crowdsourced it from her readers and Twitter followers&lt;/a&gt;. She got some 10,000 suggestions, and her final choice was Tilo (pronounced &lt;em&gt;tee&lt;/em&gt;-lo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is she the pioneer of a novel way to name kids, or just someone who’s way too addicted to the Web? The glut of baby-name websites and books out there indicates that lots of people have a tough time coming up with a name they like, but many parents still prefer to keep the decision personal. So, would you crowdsource your baby’s name?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want an example of a well-run student atheist group?  They’re among the best (and largest) groups in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it looks like I’m not done with my trips just yet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be in Los Angeles in a few weeks (April 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;) — more information on that soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;Greta Christina&lt;/strong&gt; has apparently &lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2010/04/very-big-atheist-conference.html"&gt;booked me for this time next year&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop Using Plastic Bags!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d have to be living under a rock not to know that plastic bags are pretty bad for the planet – somewhere between &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/09/0902_030902_plasticbags.html"&gt;500 billion and a trillion plastic bags are consumed worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re not recyclable in most places. They end up in landfills and often in water, where sea animals often fatally mistake them for food. Luckily, so many people are hip to the benefits of skipping plastic, that there are plenty of great alternatives on the market. Instead of hefting heavy canvas bags, there are several lightweight, easy-to-carry totes available (&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/look/one-cool-thing/"&gt;OBOE&lt;/a&gt; makes some of our favorites).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Singh described the ruling as “brilliant”, but added that the  action had cost £200,000 “just to define the meaning of a few words”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After  two years of battling in this libel case, at last we’ve got a good  decision. So instead of battling uphill we’re fighting with the wind  behind us,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Court of Appeal’s made a very wise  decision, but it just shouldn’t be so horrendously expensive for a  journalist or an academic journal or a scientist to defend what they  mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s why people back off from saying what they really  mean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British Chiropractic Association, of course, won’t back down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;BCA president Richard Brown said: “We are considering whether to seek  permission to appeal to the Supreme Court and subsequently proceed to  trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our original argument remains that our reputation has  been damaged. The BCA brought this claim only to uphold its good name  and protect its reputation, honesty and integrity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honesty?  Like saying that chiropractic cures colic and earaches?&lt;/p&gt;

From the interview:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If anything has changed, I think my personal approach has become more direct. I don‘t hesitate to say certain things that are true: That FC has failed every test of science; that it has never once worked under properly controlled conditions; and that facilitator control has been repeatedly shown to be its primary mechanism of operation. These things are the baseline. I believe it is a moral obligation to say that FC is a fundamental human rights violation. Its use not only prevents the person with autism from learning real, functional independent living skills, but it replaces the real person with a fantasy identity of someone else‘s making. All that said, we must be exceedingly careful in dealing with the parents and caretakers who have been taken in by these cruel frauds. Smart people can be fooled, and once it happens they are in a trap. They have multiple investments that simply cannot be divested without significant psychological cost. No one wants to admit being taken in by a fraud. No one wants to discover he or she could have done something better for a child. If it‘s FC, they will not want to admit they have been talking to themselves and not the child for months or years.

Most of the victims are post- pubescent&lt;/strong&gt;. You have to get your facts straight. I&amp;#39;m sorry. If I&amp;#39;m the only one who is dealing with facts tonight, that&amp;#39;s it. &lt;strong&gt;The vast majority of the victims are post-pubescent. That&amp;#39;s not pedophelia, buddy. That&amp;#39;s homosexuality&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ROBERTS: Bill, I don&amp;#39;t think, as a person of faith, that you really know what you&amp;#39;re talking about when it comes to -- &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DONOHUE: If the study of criminal justice -- it&amp;#39;s not my opinion. Take a look at the social science data. I never said they&amp;#39;re homosexuals in that way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ROBERTS: They said they cut down on -- &lt;br&gt;(CROSSTALK) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KING: Sinead, quickly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O&amp;#39;CONNOR: Can I just ask very quickly with that gentleman -- sorry, I don&amp;#39;t know your name, sir. I&amp;#39;m not quite sure what post- pubescent means. Would you mind explaining that to me&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DONOHUE: Explain what? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O&amp;#39;CONNOR: Post-pubescent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DONOHUE: Post-pubescent means beyond puberty. In other words, you&amp;#39;re adolescent. That&amp;#39;s what homosexuals do, and of the molesters have been homosexuals in the Catholic church.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ROBERTS: So the boys deserved it because they&amp;#39;re post-pubescent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DONOHUE: If you want to take that conclusion, I think that&amp;#39;s scurrilous. I never said that. Why would you say that about homosexuals? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O&amp;#39;CONNOR: Larry, what age does somebody become, you know, become post-pubescent&lt;/strong&gt; in America, as a matter of interest? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KING: What is the age? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ROBERTS: I don&amp;#39;t know. Let&amp;#39;s ask Bill. He seems to know. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KING: Well, folks -- &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONOHUE: Twelve, thirteen years of age&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, try that defense in court – “but, your honor, she was over 13” – see how far it gets you. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to know what to say after that.  Mind-blowing.  Even the Catholic church has not to my knowledge used such a defense.  All I can really think of to say is, isn’t it time to stop asking Bill Donohue his opinions, to stop having him on network TV as though his opinions were in any way valid or relevant?  He should really be finished as a pundit after this.  Why would any serious news media ever quote this disgusting moron’s views on anything, ever again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270227132447"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/todays_carnivals_483.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4556a544c97ae2b6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2010-04-02T17:47:43Z</published><updated>2010-04-02T17:47:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/8lBVl8hJVFI/todays_carnivals_483.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/todays_carnivals_483.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I and the Bird&lt;/strong&gt; #122 is up on &lt;a href="http://www.chuqui.com/2010/03/i-and-the-bird-122/" title=""&gt;Chuqui 3.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing seems to personify the evil of modern medicine to Dr Mercola more than the concept of vaccination, and Gardasil, the &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/hpv/"&gt;vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV)&lt;/a&gt;, has been drawing a good deal of his ire of late.  Case in point is this train-wreck of a post comparing the recent Toyota recall to Gardasil entitled “&lt;a href="http://blogs.mercola.com/sites/vitalvotes/archive/2010/04/01/time-for-the-truth-about-gardasil.aspx"&gt;Time for the Truth About Gardasil&lt;/a&gt;.”  The post is ill-named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cervical cancer accounts for less than 1 percent of all cancer deaths — so it was somewhat surprising when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration fast-tracked approval of Gardasil, a Merck vaccine targeting the human papilloma virus that causes the disease.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cervical cancer &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/statistics/"&gt;tallied&lt;/a&gt; 11,982 new cases of cervical cancer and 3,976 deaths in 2006, not to mention the &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/"&gt;non-cervical cancers&lt;/a&gt; for which it is also responsible.  Worldwide it has an even greater impact as the second leading cause of cancer in women.  Unless Dr Mercola is trying to tell us that he considers the prevention of several thousand deaths per year in the US alone a waste of effort, the fact that cervical cancer isn’t one of the leading causes of cancer death in the US is irrelevant to the FDA’s approval of Gardasil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m certain the actual point Dr Mercola is trying to make is that in his opinion, Gardasil was inadequately tested prior to release, and that he does not accept the data supporting its efficacy or safety.  The fact is that it was tested on over 20,000 women in &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6T1B-4NVVDHV-12&amp;amp;_user=4932790&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=4932790&amp;amp;md5=da4a71d71e259309ee903475d8ac3f18"&gt;stage 3 trials&lt;/a&gt; where both its safety and efficacy profiles were excellent while identifying a few rare but legitimate side effects, and that &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19690307?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;post-licensure studies&lt;/a&gt; after over 23 million doses have supported the original licensure data (I covered this topic at some length &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1652"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, as has Dr David Gorski &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=98"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  If Dr Mercola insists on having such exceedingly high standards for the safety and efficacy of a vaccine, surely he holds the myriad concoctions and other products he endorses and sells on his site to the same standard.  Surely.  Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As of the end of January 2010, 49 unexplained deaths following Gardasil injections have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercola implies that the 49 “unexplained” deaths are in fact due to Gardasil (there were 48, not 49 on &lt;a href="http://wonder.cdc.gov/vaers.html"&gt;my check&lt;/a&gt; on April 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 2010).  There are two major problems with this statement.  First and foremost, an unexplained death is, by definition, &lt;em&gt;unexplained&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, of the deaths associated with Gardasil reported to CDC’s VAERS, the majority of them &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; explained.  At the time of the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19690307?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;post-licensure review&lt;/a&gt; published in JAMA in August of 2009, there had been 32 deaths reported following Gardasil injection occurring between 2 to 405 days after the last injection. This is the breakdown of those 32 reported deaths after investigation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eight of the reports were second-hand reports that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;could not be verified. Four were manufacturer reports with no&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;identifying information for confirmation or medical review… Causes of death (of the remaining 20) included 4 unexplained deaths, 2 cases of diabetic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;ketoacidosis (1 complicated by pulmonary embolism), 1 case related&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;to prescription drug abuse, 1 case of juvenile amyotropic lateral&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;sclerosis, 1 case of meningoencephalitis (Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;serogroup B), 1 case of influenza B viral sepsis, 3 cases of&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;pulmonary embolism (1 associated with hyperviscosity due to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;diabetic ketoacidosis), 6 cardiac-related deaths (4 arrhythmias&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;and 2 cases of myocarditis), and 2 cases due to idiopathic seizure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;disorder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that over 23 million doses of Gardasil had been administered in the US at this point.  It would be remarkable if none of those millions of women had died within a year or so of receiving the vaccine.  A rate of death similar to that of the control population with a random smattering of causes should be expected, and is exactly what is found.  As always, correlation does not necessarily mean causation, and Dr Mercola is deprived of his greatest source of rhetoric against Gardasil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that it will stop him from jumping another shark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By contrast, 52 deaths are attributed to unintended acceleration in Toyotas, which triggered a $2 billion recall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy false analogy, Batman!  He’s comparing apples to… I don’t know, mops or something.  Where to begin?  Let’s just accept the number of &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-02/toyota-sudden-acceleration-tied-to-43-fatal-crashes-u-s-says.html"&gt;52 deaths&lt;/a&gt; for now.  These deaths are not simply associated with unintended acceleration in Toyotas, they are &lt;em&gt;attributed to them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are two very different things!  If Dr Mercola wants to compare 52 deaths attributed to defective Toyotas, he needs to compare it to &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; deaths attributed to Gardasil, not 49.  On the other hand, if he wants his analogy to use the 49 deaths associated with Gardasil, he needs to figure out how many people have died &lt;em&gt;from any cause&lt;/em&gt; within a year or so of riding in a Toyota.  Methinks the number will be slightly higher than 52.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention that he completely ignores the starkly different risk/benefit ratios of using Gardasil and driving a Toyota.  No one risks developing cancer or dying from not driving a Toyota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There has been no recall for Gardasil, however. In fact, it is required for sixth-grade girls in D.C., Maryland, Virginia, and many other states. Merck denies any of the deaths are related to its vaccine — and of course, it is difficult for the grieving parents to prove they were.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, Merck doesn’t deny the deaths are related to the vaccine, the data does.  There has been no recall of Gardasil because no recall is warranted, and in the meantime the vaccine is protecting millions from contracting HPV and the cancers it can cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart goes out to the grieving families to whom Dr Mercola refers; their loss is tragic regardless of its cause.  But their grief is being needlessly compounded, and the memory of those lost insulted, as Dr Mercola insists on misrepresenting the conditions of their deaths and callously exploits their loss to spread misinformation and fear of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

From Wikipedia.

Even if they spend years in the field, researchers rarely witness predation on primates. Cats, birds, and other hunters regularly feed on primate species, but what we know about the habits of primate-hunters often comes from bones and fingernails picked out of predator droppings. Every now and again, though, someone is in just the right place at just the right time to observe a predator attempt to catch a primate for dinner, and one recent observation in the Amazon has revealed an ingenious hunting technique employed by a small spotted cat.

Despite being known to science for almost 200 years, the margay (Leopardus wiedii) is still one of the most enigmatic of the world's cats. It spends most of its life in the trees of the tropical forests of Central and South America, and, as with many arboreal species, this has made it especially difficult to track and study. As reported by Ellen Wang on the basis of 20 scat samples, we know that much of their diet is made up of small rodents, but how margays actually hunt these animals in the treetops is largely unknown.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Once thought to be rock art, carved depictions of soldiers, horses and other figures are in fact part of a written language dating back to the Iron Age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The ancestors of modern Scottish people left behind mysterious, carved stones that new research has just determined contain the written language of the Picts, an Iron Age society that existed in Scotland from 300 to 843.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "new research" is described in Rob Lee, Philip Jonathan, and Pauline Ziman, "&lt;a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/jonathan/PRSA10.pdf"&gt;Pictish symbols revealed as a written language through application of Shannon entropy&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Society A&lt;/em&gt;, in press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors use an argument of the same general shape as the one used by Rao et al. in arguing for linguistic structure in inscriptions from the Indus Valley civilization ("&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1374"&gt;Conditional entropy and the Indus Script&lt;/a&gt;", 4/26/2009). They calculate certain statistical measures for some known writing systems, for things that are clearly not writing, and for the inscriptions in question, and they find that in terms of these measures, the inscriptions look more like the writing sytems than like the non-writing sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble with this form of argument is that it&amp;#39;s heavily dependent on the particular combination of statistical measure and comparison sets that we choose. And the argument becomes especially unconvincing when there&amp;#39;s an obvious alternative choice of comparison set — generated by a simple random process — that would fall squarely on the side of the line that allegedly identifies &amp;quot;written language&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what Cosma Shalizi, Richard Sproat and I (independently) argued in the case of the Rao et al. article (see &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1374"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for details). And it looks to me as if the Lee et al. article on Pictish has got similar problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take the first part of their argument, summarized in their Figure 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Pictish1.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Pictish1.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows convincingly that the Pictish petroglyph symbols are not drawn randomly from a &lt;strong&gt;uniform&lt;/strong&gt; distribution. But symbols in writing systems are hardly the only phenomena whose statistical distribution is non-uniform. For example, if we plot the outcome of rolling 7 6-sided dice on the same graph, we get the red x shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Pictish2.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Pictish2.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 36 possible outcomes (sums from 7 to 42), so that the x-axis value for the dice will be log2(36), or about 5.17. And these outcomes are not equally likely, since there&amp;#39;s only one way to roll 7, but 7 ways to roll 8, 28 ways to roll 9, etc. — so if we calculate the entropy of the 36 probabilities, we get about 4.22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly don't mean to suggest that the ancient Picts generated their petroglyphs using throws of 7d6. The point is just that any process that is (in effect) sampling from a distribution with the right number of alternative outcomes (about 35 to 40) and the right amount of non-uniformity (around 20% relative redundancy for unigrams) will look similar on this measure. And we don't need to look very far to find a (non-writing-related) random process with these characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee et al. go on to repeat the same form of argument using a number of more sophisticated (or at least more complicated) measures. I haven't evaluated these in detail. But the way that they present Fig. 2 is not a good sign, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270222554121"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-1322367712309562088">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3d68a51de06eb2ed</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Still the most hated group in America</title><published>2010-04-02T15:10:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-02T15:10:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2010/04/still-most-hated-group-in-america.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">Just found out about the little brouhaha over the Mississippi ACLU dissing the American Humanist Association in regards to a proposed donation to provide an alternative prom for Constance McMillen's school.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a male senior in high school, and one of my friends, who is a girl, is going to become a nun. I have no sexual feelings for her, but I truly think she is not  meant for that lifestyle. She likes to drink and party, but still wants to  become a nun. Everytime I try to tell her she is not meant for the convent, she  says she feels that God is calling her. Everytime I call her a hypocrite, she  doesn’t want to talk to me, and I lose the chance to talk her out of becoming a nun. Do you know any ways that me, a closet atheist, can talk her out of it  becoming a nun, and in my opinion, throwing her life away in some secluded place, where I KNOW she will be miserable?      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Nick,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an opportunity for you to learn about yourself, and about how you interact with other people.  Your letter reveals more about you than about your friend.  I think you will benefit by looking at what is reflected in that mirror with an honest but compassionate attitude toward yourself, just as I’m going to be honest but compassionate toward you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not surprised that your friend says she doesn’t want to talk with you about this, because you’re taking the position that you know what is best for her better than she does. That is very annoying. I don’t think you would accept a friend trying that with you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You say that you truly think that she is not meant for that lifestyle. I cannot help but wonder if you simply disapprove of that lifestyle in general. The fact that she likes to drink and party does not mean that she is “not meant for the convent” nor does that make her a “hypocrite.” She’s not a nun &lt;em&gt;yet.&lt;/em&gt; Drinking and partying is not a deal breaker for a young person considering this kind of service. Having lived a life of perfect piety and purity is not a prerequisite. People and their lifestyle behaviors can and do change. Nuns are not born, they decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have a long time to think about it before they decide. I can’t think of a profession that has so much time and encouragement to reconsider built into its internship. Typically, to become a Catholic nun she would need to undergo six months to a year of initially testing the life, a period called a postulancy.  Then she would become a novice for between one and two years. After that, she would take temporary vows lasting one to three years each, which she can continue to renew for at least three years but not more than six.  Finally, after as long as nine years from her initial entry into this process, she would take her permanent, solemn vows.  At every step, either she or the nuns supervising her can decide that this is not her appropriate path. The modern use of the word “nun” can also mean a religious sister, such as the Sisters of Charity. Their vows can be different, and they don’t necessarily live in secluded places such as convents. Sisters often live and work amidst society, doing charity work or ancillary work in hospitals for instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick, by saying things such as she is not meant for this, or that you KNOW she will be miserable, you seem to be professing god-like knowledge. You cannot actually &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; this.  You have your opinion. You don’t agree, you don’t like it, and that is all perfectly okay for you to express as an opinion, but not as a certainty. You’d probably prefer that she became a teacher, pilot, nurse, businesswoman, scientist or a bus driver. If I knew her, I’d probably have such preferences too.  But I could not pretend that I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what walk of life will be best for her or best for the world around her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s considering a very powerful, very public commitment to her beliefs, and I’m sure that there are many people in her life besides yourself who are disapproving and trying to dissuade her.  You, on the other hand are a “closet atheist.” She is putting herself out there while you are being careful.  Perhaps that is wise of you, but it puts you at a distinct emotional and tactical disadvantage for debating this with her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve made your opinion clear to her.  Now try trusting your friend’s ability to know her own mind better than you know it, and trusting her ability to make a careful and well-considered decision. She’ll have plenty of opportunity to change her mind, so she’s not going to become a nun impulsively.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/02/05/ask-richard-my-friend-is-considering-becoming-a-priest/"&gt;another letter I received&lt;/a&gt; about two friends, and like that one, it’s an opportunity for you to move above and beyond your preferences, and to express a caring for another person that is completely free of agenda.  Such pure caring is not that common, but it does exist. You can be a shallow friend who supports her only if she does what you prefer, or a deep friend who supports her in her journey wherever it may lead.  I hope you choose the latter, because we need more deep friends in the world.  We need to accept each other far more than we need to conform with each other.  We need to understand each other far more than we need to agree with each other.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/04/haemophilus-genome-440.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="haemophilus genome 440" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/04/haemophilus-genome-440.jpg" alt="haemophilus genome 440" width="440" height="423"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Fifteen years ago, things were different. In 1995, scientists published &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7542800"&gt;the first complete genome of a free-living organisms ever&lt;/a&gt;–that of a nasty germ called &lt;em&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/em&gt;. Bear in mind, this was in the dark ages of the twentieth century, when a scientist might spend a decade trying to decipher the sequence of a single gene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, with a giant &lt;em&gt;thwomp&lt;/em&gt;, a team of scientists dropped not just one gene, but 1740 genes, spelled out across 1.8 million base pairs of DNA. At the core of the paper was an image of the entire genome, a kaleidoscopic wheel marking all the genes that it takes to be &lt;em&gt;H. influenzae&lt;/em&gt;. It had a hypnotizing effect, like a genomic mandala. Looking at it, you knew that biology would never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over that paper today, I’m struck by what a catalog it is. The authors listed every gene and sorted them by their likely function. They didn’t find a lot of big surprises about &lt;em&gt;H. influenzae&lt;/em&gt; itself. It had genes for metabolism, they reported, and genes for attaching to host cells, and for sensing the environment. But scientists already knew that. What was remarkable was the simple fact that scientists could now sequence so much DNA in so little time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came more microbes. Then, ten years ago this coming June, came a rough draft of the human genome. Then finished drafts of other animals: chickens, mice, flies, worms. Flowers, truffles, and malaria-causing parasites. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=genome"&gt;They came faster and faster, cheaper and cheaper.&lt;/a&gt; The acceleration now means that the simple accomplishment of sequencing a genome is no longer news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.iontorrent.com/ion-personal-genome-machine-sequencer/"&gt;&lt;img title="torrent220" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/04/torrent220.jpg" alt="torrent220" width="220" height="201"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On Wednesday I caught a talk at Yale by Jonathan Rothberg, a scientist who invented “next-generation sequencing” in 2005. By sequencing vast numbers of DNA fragments at once, the new technology made it possible to get a genome’s sequence far faster than earlier methods. Rothberg’s company, 454, got bought up by Roche, leaving him without a lot to do. So he came up with &lt;a href="http://www.iontorrent.com/"&gt;a new machine&lt;/a&gt;: a genome sequencer about the size of a desktop printer that can knock out complete genomes with high accuracy in a matter of hours. Rothberg has been unveiling details of the machine over the past few weeks. To convince his audience that the machine actually works, he flashed another mandala wheel–the 4.7 million base pairs of &lt;em&gt;E. coli.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recalled when &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/277/5331/1453"&gt;the first &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;genome was published&lt;/a&gt; in 1997. It was the result of years of work by 17 co-authors, an event celebrated in newspapers. Now Rothberg just threw up a quick slide of the germ’s genome just to show what he could do in a matter of hours. And I have to say that the sight of yet another circular map of a genome, on its own, no longer gave me a thrill. It’s a bit like someone waving you over to a telescope and saying, “Look! I found a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;star&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What remains truly exciting is the kind of research starts &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the genomes are sequenced: discovering what genes do, mapping out the networks in which genes cooperate, and reconstructing the deep history of life. Thanks to the hundreds of genomes of microbes scientists can now compare, for example, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2008/07/17/festooning-the-tree-of-life/"&gt;they can see how the history of life is, in some ways, more like a web than a tree&lt;/a&gt;. Insights like these are newsworthy. The sequencing of those genomes, on its own, is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet my email inbox still gets overwhelmed with press releases about the next new genome sequence. The press releases typically read like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Scientists have sequenced the genome of species X. Their research, published today in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Terribly Important Studies&lt;/em&gt;, will lead to new insights about this important species. Maybe it will even cure cancer or eliminate world hunger!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then those press releases give rise to news articles. Here&lt;img src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:5GvxSLYGX9j9_M:http://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0011/88535/Taeniopygia_guttata_Zebra_Finch_620.JPG" alt="" width="136" height="132"&gt; are &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news/more?q=zebra+finch+genome&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;ncl=dysAnwiUji3NDUMlO8z8m1YyP4CuM&amp;amp;ei=_gO2S6KXNoPGlQfnzLlz&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=news_result&amp;amp;ct=more-results&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ved=0CC8QqgIoADAA"&gt;dozens of pieces&lt;/a&gt; that came out over the past couple days, describing the freshly-sequenced genome of the zebra finch. What did the scientists actually learn about zebra finches through this exercise? The articles &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/04/01/MNET1CNUD0.DTL"&gt;typically referred&lt;/a&gt; to 800 genes involved in the birds learning how to sing. Of course, nobody seriously would expect them to use just one or two genes for something so complex, so this was no big surprise. The articles also mentioned that a lot of the genes were similar to human language genes. &lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050321"&gt;This is not really news, either&lt;/a&gt;. For the most part, the articles look to the future–to experiments that scientists will be able to do on zebra finches, in the hopes of learning about human speech. But that’s not news of an achievement–that’s a promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps press release writers and journalists are still operating on the assumption that any new genome is news. But that assumption has been wrong for years now. Let’s wait to see what scientists actually discover in those marvelous mandalas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: Thanks to Jonathan Eisen for coining the easy-t0-remember acronym for my current disorder: &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/phylogenomics/status/11485428142"&gt;YAGS&lt;/a&gt;. That goes into my personal lexicon right away.]&lt;/p&gt;

He lives and works in London, so we were able to check out his amazing office (you can &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=cory&amp;amp;w=81493359@N00"&gt;see some pics&lt;/a&gt; that don’t do it justice [I feel awkward when taking photos in private situations and so I just snapped a few and left it at that]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed the nature of online and offline privacy, copyright, and free speech. I really dig his passion when discussing his penchant for going beyond just talking about these issues to actively engaging in political activism. (The same day as our interview, he was headed to a rally against the &lt;a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/03/31/labour-mps-motion-to.html"&gt;Digital Economy Bill&lt;/a&gt;, and he’s on board with the libel reform movement.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shot some video of the interview, but my poor little camera could only do about 30 minutes. If you’d like to hear more from our interview, listen to &lt;a href="http://littleatoms.com/"&gt;Little Atoms&lt;/a&gt; tonight at 7pm BST or on the archived podcast anytime thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first had this thought recently when a guy at the store with a shopping cart filled with organic groceries cut in front of me at the checkout line. He must have seen me – I’m a size four, not invisible. After he piled his eco-purchases onto the conveyor belt, I saw him peer back into my cart; he was clearly disappointed with my decision to choose non-organic cereal and vegetables. (We’re still in a recession, people!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminded me of that “South Park” episode in which everyone bought hybrid cars, and instead of polluting the environment with smog, they clogged up the community with their smug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoppers who buy “green” and organic products may feel like ethical superstars, but according to a &lt;a href="http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/index.html"&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt; study by Nina Mazar and Chen-Bo Zhong titled “&lt;a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1463018"&gt;Do Green Products Make Us Better People?&lt;/a&gt;”, they’re far more likely to be jerks in everyday life. And after my recent experience at the checkout line, I’m not about to argue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the study goes further, claiming that these “green” consumers are prone to lying, and even have a thing for stealing. The culprit? A sense of entitlement fueled by the fact that they’ve “bought” moral authority. The study is a part of ongoing research into an oft-discussed theory that, ironically, some people who do good things feel they’ve earned the right to exhibit questionable behavior in other parts of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a rundown of one of the experiments: Nearly 100 University of Toronto students had to identify which side of a computer screen contained more dots – this was after they were told that one side would earn them a nickel for each dot counted, and the other side just half a penny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result? Those who had previously purchased eco-friendly products were more inclined to lie about the dots to accumulate more money. And here’s the kicker, some “green” shoppers even stole money from a nearby envelope that had been set aside for participants to take home their earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, students who said they were exposed to “green” products in the past (but didn’t make purchases) were more altruistic throughout the series of tests. So, although exposure to eco-friendly items can have a positive societal effect on people by influencing ethical acts, “purchasing these products can license indulgence in self-interested and unethical behaviors,” the report stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are all “green” shoppers selfish? Of course not. But at least this study validates my theory behind the asshole in the checkout line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, as from above, so it is from the side as well. Canadian tourist &lt;a href="http://news.globaltv.com/technology/story.html?id=2728354"&gt;Mary Jo Penkala&lt;/a&gt; was on a plane near Montserrat at the time, and after the pilot made an announcement for passengers to look out the port window, &lt;a href="http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=2728353"&gt;she snapped this&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=2728353"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/03/montserrat_volcano.jpg" alt="montserrat_volcano" title="montserrat_volcano" width="600" height="397"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! I’ve seen a lot of amazing things out my airplane window, but never &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; close to this. Ms. Penkala is enjoying a bit of well-deserved notoriety for the picture. It’s amazing in and of itself, but I love how we now can get so many views of volcanic plumes: from below, the side, and even from space. These natural disasters cause a huge amount of damage and grief, of course, but the good news is that with enough study we can learn more about them, how to predict them, and when is the best time to get people out of any potentially dangerous regions. &lt;/p&gt;

Not that it wasn't insightful; it's just that I've heard just about all these insights before.  PZ was a little more, eh, "strident" than I had expected -- closer to his blog persona than the persona I have seen in videos of other lectures by him -- but that just made it more enjoyable.  Since this was at RIT, which hosts the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTID"&gt;National Technical Institute for the Deaf&lt;/a&gt;, there are always American Sign Language translators at all speaking events... and I think at least one of the translators was a little freaked out by the content.  heh, she was a good sport though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What was the surprise was how many dumb questions there were in the Q&amp;amp;A from angry theists, &amp;quot;militant agnostics&amp;quot; (I&amp;#39;ll talk about this later), and general &amp;quot;why are you atheists so mean?&amp;quot; types.  It&amp;#39;s not even just that they asked so many questions, it&amp;#39;s that it was all the &lt;i&gt;same fucking things&lt;/i&gt; we've heard a million times.  It was driving me nuts...!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So without further ado, a few thoughts about all that:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;The One Intriguing Question&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;One young woman who identified herself as an atheist Buddhist had a question that I think could have been really interesting, though I think the way she phrased it was unclear, and PZ is part of the "there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; no meaning" camp which I think has it slightly wrong.  Well, let me back up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question, or rather statement, was, "I think you are missing the spirituality aspect."  She went on to describe her experiences with meditation and argue that scientific studies back up the efficacy.  PZ's answer was that, sure, meditation is great -- do that!  And that "spirituality" was a dangerous word because it is unclear what it means... he point blank asked, "You don't mean that you believe in spirits?", and of course she said no, which is sort of an answer, but only half way there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reading between the lines, what I think the woman was driving at was to try and position Buddhist "spirituality" as a rebuttal to an assertion PZ had just made in answer to another question, that the answer to "Why are we here?" was "No reason at all."  And this is where I diverge slightly from PZ, and where I think the woman's question maybe had a better answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When asking questions about meaning and purpose, the question is not fully parseable unless it is specified, whether explicitly or implicitly, what entity is doing the meaning or the purposing.  We don't think about this very much, because usually the meaning-er or purpose-er is clearly implied in the question.  If I ask the question, "What does 'verisimilitude' mean?", I don't need to specify who the meaning-er is, because it's pretty obvious by implication that the meaning-er is "a typical English speaker".  It gets slightly more complicated if I ask "What does 'enormity' mean?" for example, because this is a word whose definition is currently in flux.  A complete answer would have to answer the question for multiple different meaning-ers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When asking a question like, "What is the meaning of life?" or "What is our purpose here?", it's critical to explicitly identify the meaning-er or purpose-er.  Otherwise, the question is unaskable.  When atheists like PZ deign to answer a question without an explicit meaning-er, I think they give a misleading answer.  It's not so much that life has no meaning -- it's that the very concept of meaning without a meaning-er is nonsensical.  Life very much has a meaning to me, and I suspect it does to PZ, and to pretty much everybody except the most hardcore nihilist.  I don't like PZ's answer because it endorses this nihilistic position.  It sounds cheesy, but a for more accurate answer is, "The meaning of life is whatever each person decides it means to them."  (And even that is only half way, because you might be asking, "What does life mean to the government of North Korea?" for example, in which case we might answer more specifically.  But in any case, any answer must specify the meaning-er, otherwise the answer is wrong.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With this in mind, I think the questioner had a point in terms of Buddhist "spirituality" (though I share PZ's discomfort with that word) being one path to discovering this personal meaning.  More generally, I think the questioner had a potentially excellent point in that science alone is not sufficient for finding this personal meaning.  Science certainly ought to inform how we view life and how we find meaning in it, but ultimately the personal meaning each of us finds comes from a less rational way of thinking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And this ties in with a theme I find myself repeating often, especially since I think a lot of the freethinking community disagrees with me on this:  Science and rational inquiry do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; have an epistemological monopoly.  Science is always the preferred epistemology when it is practical, but sometimes it is simply more effective to employ a different, less accurate "way of knowing".  The example I like to use is that science might be an excellent tool for discovering why people like me fall in love with people like my wife, but it's a lousy tool for helping &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; to discover the individual I am in love with.  (I have a feeling that randomized double-blind placebo-controlled dating wouldn't work out very well...)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course I'm not going soft on faith here.  While I don't believe science has an epistemological monopoly, it seems clear that religion and faith are epistemologically bankrupt.  "In practice science can't provide a satisfactory answer to every question" does not imply that "Religion can provide a satisfactory answer to even one question."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Stupidest Question of the Night&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Somebody asked PZ, "What do you think about militant atheists?"  PZ kind of stared at him for a minute and then said, "I love myself!" to lots of laughs from the audience.  He continued, "Have you read my blog?  Do you know who I am?"  Funny stuff.  PZ continued on to give the standard answer, that if writing books now qualifies one as "militant", that's a pretty low bar, etc.  Still, it was funny that instead of saying, "Don't you think militant atheism drives people away?", he asked the question as if he was talking about some "other" atheists, with PZ being the nice respectful kind.  heh...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, I now think no answer to that question is complete without invoking Greta Christina's &lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2010/03/an-open-letter-to-concerned-believers.html"&gt;recent blog post about concern trolls&lt;/a&gt;.  In a nutshell, she observes that the vast majority of people who are suggesting that maybe atheists' message would be better received if they were quieter and nicer are people who have a vested interest in getting atheists to STFU.  Excuse us if we suspect an ulterior motive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two Questioners Ask About Morality Without God&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ho-hum.  So fucking sick of this one, and it's not only tedious, it's downright offensive to boot.  PZ answered it alright, but I was surprised he did not employ what I feel is the most powerful rebuttal to the idea that God is required for morality:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What if God commanded us that we all had to start raping children?  Ignoring the obvious answer, "Catholicism!", would that mean that raping children was now good?  I see three ways to answer this question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Yes".  Um, okay then.  Only the most fundtastic of fundies is going to answer this way, but even if you have the cajones to do so, this reduces "morality" to a worthless concept.  "Morality" now means nothing other than blindly doing what a more powerful being tells you to do.  That's "obedience", not "morality" as most people understand it.  If people want to take this position, let them hoist themselves from their own petard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"No".  Boom, argument won.  If God's commands don't necessarily line up with morality, then morality cannot come from God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Invalid question -- God is good so He would never command such a thing".  Slightly trickier, but argument still won.  This acknowledges a set of criteria external to God by which we can evaluate God's goodness.  If "God" is defined such that anything he or she commands must be good, then God cannot also be used to define "good", or else you are stuck with a circular argument.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This, by the way, is why even the vast majority of modern theologians have abandoned the idea that morality comes from God.  It is a philosophical impossibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Militant Agnostics"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least two questioners -- and maybe more -- were clearly pushing the agnostic position heavily.  One used the tired old line about how it takes faith to be an atheist.  PZ had already told the story about &lt;a href="http://rationalwiki.com/wiki/The_Dragon_in_My_Garage"&gt;The Dragon in My Garage&lt;/a&gt;, and repeated it for this questioner, but he didn't seem to get it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think we need a name for these folks.  Perhaps we should ironically call them "fundamentalist agnostics", in a hat-tip to the absurdity with which "fundamentalist" is now bandied about in regards to those to whom it could not possibly apply.  Or perhaps "militant" would be even better, since "militant" is a label that gets unfairly applied to feminists as well as atheists.  (And FWIW, though I would consider myself a feminist, I acknowledge that a tiny minority most certainly go too far... but you can't call them "militant" until they are suggesting retaliatory violence against men.  Seriously.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I Were Two Rows Closer to this Fuckwit...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Near the end, a question was asked that was very much on my mind:  How do you deal with raising a child in a skeptical/non-believing household, particular in such a god-soaked society?  The questioner specifically alluded to fears of bullying and such as a result of his children's (lack of) beliefs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PZ's answer was both enlightening and depressing.  First, he said that raising a child to be a skeptic is easy:  Just let them know from the start the daddy is not always right, and they will quickly realize that everybody else is not immune from questioning either.  That's good advice, and I will take it to heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second part of his answer, though, was that in many ways it is inevitable that a young skeptic/atheist will get picked on, and that you just need to be there for them as best you can.  He acknowledged that his kids had a very tough time going through school.  And then...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...this dickwad who had asked the first question (actually, the first &lt;i&gt;three&lt;/i&gt; questions) and had been fairly confrontational, though more or less civil, muttered "Thanks to you!", to the titters of some of his nearby godbot friends.  He was probably eight rows back, otherwise I would have turned around and given that asshole a piece of my mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You know what?  I was raised Mormon.  And I got shit for it.  I got shit for fucked up beliefs like not drinking caffeine, going to church for three hours every Sunday (plus a two hour young men's meeting on Wednesdays!) (plus seminary four days a week for an hour before school started!!), and just generally being different.  Is this fucking shithead going to now say that my parent's beliefs were invalid because I got picked on for them?  (Their beliefs are invalid anyway, but that's beside the point)  What about Jewish or Muslim kids who get picked on for being different?  Is it their parents fault they are being &lt;i&gt;picked on&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does this shit-eating motherfucker really think that any good parent should raise their kids in whatever the dominant religion is in their society, for fear their children will be ridiculed?  Is that seriously his contention?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If so, he should be kicked in the fucking nuts until he's sterile.  If not, then he is bigoted against atheists in the worst possible way -- criticizing our parenting! -- and should also be kicked in the fucking nuts until he's sterile.  What a fucking asshole.  I could fucking punch that guy.  Thinking now about everything that was wrong with what he said, I should have turned around anyway.

This time around, it was my wife. Last weekend, we were reading the newspapers. On the weekend, we happen to get the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; as well as our local newspaper. There, ensconsed in the USA Weekend advertisement section stuffed into the local newspaper, I saw it. I saw it, and I had to have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not really. But I had to blog about it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself: When you're in pain, what do you need? Is it enough just to have the power of magnet woo to heal you? Of course not! You need the triple threat, especially if that triple threat includes the healing power of Jesus. And there's only one product out there that can provide the triple threat, triple punch, religiously woo-tastic body blow to your pain that we all need and want. Are you ready?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you ready for the &lt;a href="http://www.dreamproductscatalog.com/details.cfm?item=12489"&gt;Copper Magnetic Therapy Jesus Bracelet&lt;/a&gt;? After all, it has the soothing power of copper, the penetrating power of magnets, and the healing power of Jesus, all rolled up into a single bracelet! Check it out:&lt;/p&gt;

The Academy Award-winning actress and contestant on last season’s “Dancing with the Stars” wanted to let people know about the Firls: a family of six living in California, who are all deaf except for their 15-year-old son, Jared, and three-year-old son, Elijah. No major networks were willing to air it; so she launched it on YouTube. Matlin recently talked with the &lt;a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/03/marlee-matlin-launches-youtube-channel.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about unveiling her project on the Web, and the inspiration behind it.

But chores are an integral part of teaching children about the value of work and the importance of responsibilities. Your kids will also build confidence and independence, because they feel like a valuable part of the family. And with the children pitching in, along with parents, the household will run more smoothly and most everything will get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:210px"&gt;&lt;img title="chores" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/chores-200x300.jpg" alt="Chores" width="200" height="300"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Giving children jobs around the home helps parents and teaches children they are important cogs in the household wheel,” said &lt;a href="http://extension.missouri.edu/news/DisplayStory.aspx?N=429"&gt;Kris Jenkins, a University of Missouri human development specialist&lt;/a&gt;. “Chores help children learn to take pride in their work and gain self-respect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chores can begin for children as young as toddlers. They can pick up toys, throw away trash, and handle other simple tasks. When your children reach school age, it may be time to establish a more formal routine for household chores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick &lt;a href="http://www.life123.com/parenting/young-children/chores/appropriate-chores-for-kids.shtml"&gt;chores that are age appropriate&lt;/a&gt;, but not gender specific. Boys can make beds and girls can take out the trash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rotate different chores weekly or monthly to keep children interested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give children a specific time when each chore should be finished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a &lt;a href="http://www.chorecharts.com/"&gt;chore chart&lt;/a&gt; on the refrigerator and mark with gold stars as tasks are completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead by example. Make sure that parents do their chores on time without complaints!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t reward with money. Chores are a responsibility and kids shouldn’t be bribed to do them. Only give rewards if a child goes the extra mile beyond their regular chores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

If you have a new man in your life – congratulations. Now, here’s help about how and when to introduce him to your kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:211px"&gt;&lt;img title="new-boyfriend" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/new-boyfriend-201x300.jpg" alt="New Boyfriend" width="201" height="300"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are You Serious?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If it’s just a casual thing, that’s all right – enjoy yourself. But there’s no reason to introduce these partners to your children if you don’t envision a future together. You don’t want your kids to get attached to someone who might be out of the picture in a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Reassure your kids that they’re your number one priority. Many children feel like you’re going to abandon them for a new relationship. Have an honest talk as a family before introducing your new boyfriend, to affirm your love and commitment to your little ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call the Fun Police&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you first introduce your boyfriend to your kids, make it in a relaxed environment where your children (and your partner) can feel comfortable and enjoy themselves. Go out for pizza or rent a movie together. But don’t make the event too formal or too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Is On Your Side&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don’t expect your children to accept your new boyfriend immediately. Youngsters may be sad, while older children (particularly teens) may express anger about the situation. Explain that you expect them to be polite and respectful, and reassure them that you aren’t trying to force them into having a new dad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;Multitasking is essential to productivity, and you can accomplish it on your daily commute or while traveling on the subway, train, bus, or plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://brainrules.blogspot.com/2008/03/brain-cannot-multitask_16.html"&gt;Some people are against multitasking&lt;/a&gt; – they say your brain can’t handle it and will go into information overload. However, if you pick the right tasks (driving, texting, and putting on mascara aren’t a smart combo), you can accomplish a lot with some simple on-the-go multitasking.&lt;/p&gt;

Your mom has left three messages on your voicemail. Give her a call in the morning on the train, while sorting through your email. Get organized and set up folders in your inbox for different clients, projects, and other subjects. While your mom is jabbering on about why you aren’t married or haven’t given her grandchildren yet, you can actually accomplish something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shop On the Subway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don’t just veg out on the train and listen to music – grab a digital voice recorder or even a good old-fashioned pen and paper to make your grocery shopping list (while your iPod earbuds are securely in place).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You shouldn’t talk on your cell phone or text while driving, but there’s nothing wrong with listening to your MP3 player or iPhone to catch up on your favorite podcasts. Or settle into the driver’s seat with a few audio books-on-tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You won for arguing there is no contradiction  between science and religion. Many disagree.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are two windows through which we  look at the world. Religion deals with our relationship with our  creator, with each other, the meaning and purpose of life, and moral  values; science deals with the make-up of matter, expansion of galaxies,  evolution of organisms. They deal with different ways of knowing. I  feel that science is compatible with religious faith in a personal,  omnipotent and benevolent God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some day, just some day, I’d like one of these people to describe in a bit more detail what religion helps us “know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and, like Ruse and other faitheists, Ayala claims that those among the faithful who see a conflict with science aren’t practicing proper religion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And yet conflict exists. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religion and science are not properly  understood by some people, Christians particularly. Some want to  interpret the Bible as if it were an elementary textbook. It is a book  to teach us about religious truths. At the same time, some scientists  claim they can use science to prove God does not exist. Science can do  nothing of the kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Dr. Ayala.  Now would you mind telling those millions of fundamentalists that they simply don’t understand Christianity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On mutual respect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You talk about mutual respect between science and  religion. How can we foster this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People of faith need better scientific  education. As for scientists, I don’t know what they can do: not many  argue in a rational and sustained way that religion and science are  incompatible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Au contraire&lt;/em&gt;: I think most of us make that argument fairly rationally, for at least we explicitly define what we mean by “compatible” (for me, compatibility would mean that religion and science have similar methods for learning about the universe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayala, like Ruse, sees evolution as way to resolve the problems of theodicy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you say creationism is bad religion?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creationism and intelligent design are  not compatible with religion because they imply the designer is a bad  designer, allowing cruelty and misery. Evolution explains these as a  result of natural processes, in the same way we explain earthquakes,  tsunamis or volcanic eruptions. We don’t have to attribute them to an  action of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is problematic because it still leaves the big question of theodicy unanswered: why would an omnipotent and beneficent God &lt;em&gt;allow&lt;/em&gt; the occurrence of natural disasters that kill a lot of innocent people? Note that Ayala claims that “science is compatible with religious faith in a personal,   omnipotent and benevolent God”. But why would such a God choose a plan for creation that requires millions of people and creatures to suffer needlessly?  If you’re religious, evolution—or the existence of “natural processes”—is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a sufficient explanation for evil or suffering. It just pushes the problem back a notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On morality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you say to people like Richard Dawkins, who  argue that we don’t need religion to lead moral lives?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can accept moral values without  being religious. However, by and large, people get their moral values in  association with their religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, they might &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; that they get their moral values in association with religion, but I really believe, with Plato, that most peoples’ morality comes from places far deeper than religion, and in fact is antecedent to religion.  I would claim that in a world without faith, morality would increase, not decline.  Look at atheistic Europe, for instance.  But at least Ayala avers that you can be moral without faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m an atheist. Am I missing out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, because you can have a meaningful  life without faith in God. But most people live in poverty and misery,  suffering from diseases. The one thing that brings them some hope and  meaning is their faith. I don’t want to take that from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really bad argument for refraining from criticizing religion. As P.Z. has noted, none of us are boorish enough to preach atheism to our dying religious grandmothers.  Indeed, religion does bring some hope and meaning: that’s why it is strongest in those societies that are most dysfunctional (e.g., the work of Gregory Paul and others).  But religion is also a potent &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; of poverty, misery and disease (look at AIDS in Africa, for instance, or the effect of Islam on the suppression of women, or of Catholicism on the abuse of children), and by and large it’s an excuse to do nothing.  Without faith, we have only ourselves to look to, and, rather than blaming God, we must realize that we have to roll up our sleeves and fix those problems ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that by now all of us could give these stock answers to questions about faith and science.  Just adhere to and preach the following principles, and you’re on your way to a Templeton Prize!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  Faith and science are alternative and complementary ways of knowing about the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  Faith and science should respect each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  Faith and science are not in conflict.  If they &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; to be, that’s simply because the faith is improper!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4   Faith is good because it makes us moral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.  If there is a God, He used evolution as His means of creation, and you shouldn’t ask questions about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.  Atheists (especially New Atheists) should refrain from criticizing  religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ohioskeptic.com/grassrootsskeptics/?page_id=648"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grassroots Skeptics Press Release: Grassroots Skeptic Launches Skeptical Speakers Bureau&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grassroots Skeptics today announced the official launch of its new Skeptical Speakers Bureau. The group’s most recent project is aimed at helping skeptical organizers find speakers for their events.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“There are skeptics’ groups meeting all over the world,” said Grassroots Skeptics founder K.O. Myers, “and many of them are moving from purely social gatherings, and adding more informative and educational content to their programs. We want to make it easier for organizers looking to expand that part of their mission to find the perfect speaker for their next meeting or conference.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;At launch, the Bureau features a lineup of 35 speakers from a wide range of backgrounds. The roster includes scientists, educators, bloggers, podcasters and skeptical activists, who are ready to educate and enlighten on many different facets of science, skepticism and critical thinking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We’re also looking to add to our roster of speakers,” Myers said. “We want to encourage new voices to add to the chorus, and to raise the profiles of skeptical activists who want to foster reason and critical thinking by educating the public.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;At GrassrootsSkeptics.org, organizers can get more information, see the full lineup of speakers, and request an appearance for their next event. Skeptics interested in joining the Speakers Bureau can also sign up on the site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grassroots Skeptics is a volunteer organization that promotes critical thinking and a reason-centered worldview by helping local skeptics groups to share tools, information and strategies, and connect with skeptical individuals and activists both locally and globally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/GRSkeptics@gmail.com"&gt;Contact: K.O. Myers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We would respectfully adopt what Judge Easterbrook, now Chief Judge of the US Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, said in a libel action over a scientific controversy, &lt;a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USCA7/1994/471.html"&gt;Underwager v Salter&lt;/a&gt; 22 Fed. 3d 730 (1994):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;""[Plaintiffs] cannot, by simply filing suit and crying 'character assassination!', silence those who hold divergent views, no matter how adverse those views may be to plaintiffs' interests. Scientific controversies must be settled by the methods of science rather than by the methods of litigation. … More papers, more discussion, better data, and more satisfactory models – not larger awards of damages – mark the path towards superior understanding of the world around us.""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In effect, the Court of Appeal has adopted on behalf of English law the simple yet fundamentally important maxim&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt; "&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;scientific controversies must be settled by the methods of science rather than by the methods of litigation&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those who attended the Court of Appeal hearing will remember that when the Easterbrook passage was read out at the end of the submissions by Simon's QC, it seemed to catch the mood of the court (apart from the BCA, of course).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2010/03/bca-v-singh-full-court-of-appeal.html"&gt; Transcript&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;LORD JUSTICE SEDLEY: What is the source?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MS PAGE QC: It was paragraph 76 of the skeleton argument put in at the time of permission.

Unless I can assist further, I do not propose to say any more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I recollect all three judges enthusiastically taking down the citation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One cannot yet know whether the Easterbrook passage will have any traction in future English libel litigation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although one would like it to have the effect of taking libel out of science, it is not a statement which will "bind" either the High Court or future Courts of Appeal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was an "adoption" made in passing in a case which was decided on other grounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, the maxim &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"scientific controversies must be settled by the methods of science rather than by the methods of litigation"&lt;/span&gt; could have what lawyers call &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"persuasive"&lt;/span&gt; effect on future libel litigation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ADDENDUM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The full credit for the unearthing and the wonderfully effective deployment of the Easterbook quotation must go to Adrienne Page QC and William McCormick (also now a QC) rather than, as I had previously wrongly supposed, Simon's highly Atlanticist solicitor Robert Dougans.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published; always use a name for ease of reference by other commenters.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-4282113953377509814?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270207126038"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=13194">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dac45e55afda9d93</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Psychics"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">Jimmy Kimmel Mocks Psychic Gary Spivey</title><published>2010-04-02T10:20:26Z</published><updated>2010-04-02T10:20:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/jimmy-kimmel-mocks-psychic-gary-spivey/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night, Jimmy Kimmel asked “psychic” &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Spivey"&gt;Gary Spivey&lt;/a&gt; to fill out an NCAA tournament bracket (that’s college basketball, for those not in the know) live on his show.

Normally, such self-indulgence would not merit notice, but in the process, he drops a few entertaining knee-slappers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own favorite is his criticism of the &lt;em&gt;Kitzmiller &lt;/em&gt;decision-or, rather, of the “endorsement test” in Establishment Clause jurisprudence. The “endorsement test” is simply the rule that the Constitution bars the government from engaging in activities that send the message that the government endorses some religious belief or other. One obvious question is, message to whom? The answer can’t, of course, be the hypersensitive, or the complete ignoramus, but our old stand-by, the reasonable person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the reasonable person is a very old concept-indeed, it’s the cornerstone of whole areas of the law. It is, of course, a hypothetical construct, not an actual person. As &lt;a href="http://alittlebitofjake.wordpress.com/2006/10/04/the-myth-of-the-reasonable-man-the-case-of-fardell-v-potts-a-p-herbert/" rel="external "&gt;humorist A.P. Herbert famously put it,&lt;/a&gt; the reasonable person&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;stands in singular contrast to his kinsman the Economic Man, whose every action is prompted by the single spur of selfish advantage and directed to the single end of monetary gain. The Reasonable Man is always thinking of others; prudence is his guide.… All solid virtues are his, save only that peculiar quality by which the affection of other men is won.…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is one who invariably looks where he is going, and is careful to examine the immediate foreground before he executes a leap or bound; who neither star-gazes nor is lost in meditation when approaching trap-doors or the margin of a dock…who never mounts a moving omnibus, and does not alight from any car while the train is in motion; who investigates exhaustively the bona fides of every mendicant before distributing alms, and will inform himself of the history and habits of a dog before administering a caress; who believes no gossip, nor repeats it, without firm basis for believing it to be true; who never drives his ball till those in front of him have definitely vacated the putting-green…never from one year’s end to another makes an excessive demand upon his wife, his neighbours, his servants, his ox, or his ass…never swears, gambles, or loses his temper; who uses nothing except in moderation, and even while he flogs his child is meditating only on the golden mean.…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have called him a myth; and, in so far as there are few, if any, of his mind and temperament to be found in the ranks of living men, the title is well chosen. But it is a myth which rests upon solid and even, it may be, upon permanent foundations. The Reasonable Man is fed and kept alive by the most valued and enduring of our juridical institutions–the common jury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The reasonable man is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;expected–in tort law, constitutional law, or anything else–to be omniscient and perfect. The question is whether a &lt;em&gt;hypothetical rational person&lt;/em&gt;, with the relevant information and background, would understand the government school to be endorsing the truth of a religious proposition. While subject to legitimate criticism, this is at least a &lt;em&gt;reasonable &lt;/em&gt;way to approach Establishment Clause questions. But Beckwith, whether out of ignorance or a desire to misrepresent the law, would prefer to caricature it. He writes that the reasonable person “would exhibit ideal epistemological excellence,” and would “not be limited by biases.” He oh, so cleverly asserts that the Judge Jones’s use of this common legal device was hypocritical, because “[t]he ROO [‘reasonable objective observer’] would seemingly possess…a ‘God’s Eye point of view,’” and therefore, “in order to expunge the divine, or at least allusions to it, from the public schools, Judge Jones requires the divine’s assistance, or at least the assistance of a hypothetical deity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is worse than a straw man–it is a juvenile attempt to make a joke at the expense of logic and the law. Indeed, it is the &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;“argument” that Beckwith offers against the use of the reasonable person standard in Establishment Clause jurisprudence. All for the purpose of introducing levity and silliness into a scholarly proceeding, Beckwith indulges himself by mischaracterizing the reasonable man standard, and, without bringing any &lt;em&gt;substantive &lt;/em&gt;criticism, or even explanation of his objections thereto, simply throwing this straw man overboard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, he shamelessly misrepresents what &lt;a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmiller/kitzmiller_342.pdf" rel="external "&gt;Judge Jones’ opinion&lt;/a&gt; actually says. For the record, Jones was not seeking to, and did  not, “expunge the divine, or at least allusions to it, from the public schools.” He faithfully applied existing precedent that enforces the Constitution’s absolute prohibition against government funding the propagation of religious opinions, or promoting them as true. Allusions to the divine are perfectly constitutional and perfectly routine, in the context of a literature or history class, where tax dollars may be, and are, spent teaching children &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; religion. But it is neither appropriate nor legal for the government to spend tax dollars finding clever methods to tell children that some religious doctrine or another is the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Beckwith happily continues stacking straw men. Another–and one that is a constant theme with Beckwith, and fully justifies &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/05/forrest-respond.html" rel=""&gt;Barbara Forrest’s dismissal of him as simply a non-epistemologist&lt;/a&gt;–comes when he repeats his now hoary assertion that science’s “methodological naturalism” is somehow unjustified, or, to be more precise, that methodological naturalism is just one way of knowing, and shouldn’t be “privileged” over “explanations” of phenomena that rely on supernaturalism and magic instead. Beckwith writes that he once believed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;that the best way to understand ID is to see it as a counter to the hegemony of philosophical materialism that some thinkers believe is entailed by Darwinian evolution as well as a particular understanding of science. It is a view of science that maintains that the hard sciences are the best or only way of acquiring exhaustive knowledge of the natural world and its genesis and that these sciences, in order to function, require methodological naturalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We’ll lay aside the obvious fact that few if any scientists (or others) claim that the “hard sciences” are the “only way” of gaining “exhaustive” knowledge. As &lt;a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1088905" rel="external "&gt;I’ve explained at length elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="http://www.creationismstrojanhorse.com/BrauerForrestGeyWULQ.pdf" rel="external "&gt;Forrest has explained better than I&lt;/a&gt;) methodological naturalism is not just one among other possible ways of knowing. It is employed because it has consistently shown that it yields results–predictable hypotheses, working technologies, and all that. Praying to the rain god doesn’t increase crop yields; figuring out how fertilizers work &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;. But more. Naturalism doesn’t just produce better results, it is also preferable from the outset. Its “hegemony” is not based simply on the overwhelming evidence that it succeeds where other approaches fail. It is also based on the fact that the world into which we are born is full of natural phenomena that impinge on our senses and call for &lt;em&gt;explanations&lt;/em&gt;–that is, accounts. Assertions that magic did it are not explanations, they are mere dazzle and mystery. They account for nothing. Moreover, given the obviousness of the material world, it appears &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; that such explanations should be in terms of the natural world. Maybe there is some other dimension necessary for explaining natural phenomena, and maybe some other method is better suited to explaining them. But if so, the person who makes that assertion who bears the burden of production to justify that claim. The &lt;a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/24635102/Richard-Dawkins" rel="external "&gt;teapot orbiting Pluto&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t just stand for observable entities–it also stands for thought processes. Material explanations for phenomena are a natural baseline; they are &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; starting point of our knowledge of the world. If there is some other dimension, and some other epistemology, it is up to the person who claims such to prove it. That’s just how logic works…unless Beckwith wants to reject logic, too, as simply one among many possible methods that unfairly enjoys “hegemony.” Don’t laugh. Some of his allies…er, &lt;em&gt;former &lt;/em&gt;allies?…er, &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.…have done just that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as logic remains with us, it is the person who claims that there is an invisible Man in the sky, tinkering with the physical makeup of animals, who bears the burden of showing that the natural world we automatically see around us falls short for some reason.

In this blog carnival, I collect some blog-posts, journal articles, original research, and miscellaneous online articles that might pique the interest of medically-inclined people. In this inaugural issue that I decided to not limit the posts with a theme, and instead tried to include freewheeling articles that attract my attention. So, here goes!

1. Vagus Journalis: Cure to AIDS - Bananas are the key!In this section I talk of original research articles which affect me in someway or the other. 

Swanson, M., Winter, H., Goldstein, I., &amp;amp; Markovitz, D. (2010). A Lectin Isolated from Bananas Is a Potent Inhibitor of HIV Replication Journal of Biological Chemistry, 285 (12), 8646-8655 DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M109.034926

Although the temptation to make superfluous puns is overwhelming, I am trying to keep myself in control here. Now, this research paper has shown that a Lectin associated with the banana Musa acuminata (called BanLec, REALLY? Now who would have thought THAT name up! Well, I have always been of the opinion that the medical fraternity has a penchant for giving REAL bad names to stuff, but this, like, takes the cake!) has the power to prevent the entry of HIV into cells. The idea that certain lectins have anti-HIV powers has been around for some time now, but this one is leaving the competition (not just other Lectins, but also a couple of anti-HIV drugs) behind. 

So now, let us go bananas for now we have the power of the banana in our hands to shoot the bad bug!(There there, that&amp;#39;s a pun unintended!) 

2. Blog Pressed: Dr. Grumpy in the House!The blog I would like to press today is that of an anonymous Neurologist in the US of A, who is into independent practice in an upstate part of the country, but seems to have a very funny patient base. His experiences could become fodder for a humongous volume of evidence of man&amp;#39;s stupidity! Like Einstein (methinks, I maybe wrong, correct me if I am) he makes us believe that there are only two things that are infinite - man&amp;#39;s stupidity and the universe, although there are some doubts regarding the latter!

Not only has he got the craziest bunch of neurology patients in the history of the world EVER, but also, he has a flair for the written word. And a healthy sense of humor - something I find supremely lacking in our profession (that probably explains why we suck at naming things!). He writes the occasional serious post that touches the heart. The only thing that is lacking in a blog of otherwise extreme excellence is the fact there is very little web 2.0 optimization. I really miss a Subscribe via email option that might intimate me whenever he posts! But then again, if he is such a popular blogger at the end of about a year and half of blogging, he&amp;#39;s doing something (nay, lots) right. Oh, that, and he is one of the few doctors who has a healthy skepticism for research which accomplishes nothing more than a publication (he himself cites his own rather humorous brush with the paper-production industry of medical research) and even the stalwarts of medical publishing are not spared his caustic sense of humor!

He goes by the Pseudonym of Ibee Grumpy and can be found at: http://drgrumpyinthehouse.blogspot.com. He is also available on the twitter-wagon at: @docgrumpy. A strong recommendation: Follow him, but don&amp;#39;t expect to be followed back. He is one of those snobbish, narcissistic (oops!) twitterers who desist from following ANYONE! Last I checked, his follow count was ZERO!

He also has a Cafepress shop open for the Grumpy groupies, link on his site. Read him, thank me later. And today&amp;#39;s funny bone also comes from this awesome guy!

Thanks, Dr. Grumpy for doing just a fabulous job of making us smile!

 

3. Funny Bone:Dr. Grumpy is awfuly pissed with all his patients all the time but thankfully, lets out the steam on his blog, where we get to learn about crazy shit. Some links to the great doc:

Dr. G&amp;#39;s foot-in-mouth moment.

We know Dr. G is omniscient but, well, you cannot expect him to know even THIS!

And now we know WHY the great doc is going bald!

 

4. Medical Education:Published at www.nejm.org March 31, 2010 (10.1056/NEJMp0911502) 

Cost Consciousness in Patient Care — What Is Medical Education&amp;#39;s Responsibility?

Molly Cooke, M.D. 

http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMp0911502?ssource=hcrc

This article in the NEJM is a wonderful read that impresses on the importance of the role of physicians as cost-controlling agents. By corollary, it draws upon the fact that since doctors are the ones with the key to control the excessive expenditure, they should be receiving training to do that from the levels of being a medical student or resident. However, the present medical curriculum has absolutely no course on training physicians in cost controlling measures. A key paragraph in the whole article which caught my attention is:

Philosophically, we physicians have conceived of ourselves as, and taught students that we are, advocates for each patient, obligated to eschew all considerations other than benefit to that patient and his or her preferences. Intensifying the challenges posed by this conception are the increased emphasis on patient-centered care and the expanded access of nonprofessionals to sophisticated medical information, which have transformed patients from dependent and acquiescent recipients of the physician’s care plan to activated, informed, and sometimes insistent consumers of health care services.

Well, honestly, it is a good thing to have patients empowered and informed, but often that leads to what  we commonly call in our hospital as the &amp;quot;Therapeutic X-Ray&amp;quot; demanding patient (patient comes in with an innocuous fall or hurt or whatever, and demands an X-ray although there is no clinical need for the same, patient complains of severe pain and ache and makes a scene, we concede, give him an X-Ray, everything turns up normal, we tell that to the patient and lo behold! miraculous cure!). Or our instincts to give a head CT to every patient with minimal head trauma. Or throw at them just about every expensive test we have in our repertoire just to cover our bases or safe guard ourselves from litigation (defensive medicine, yeah babe!)! 

However, I believe that in these regards, working in a limited-resources setting has helped me to be able to appraise the financial side of treatment as well. It is like an instinct now to apply our clinical knowledge or physical examination skills to bypass the testing which a patient cannot often afford. This has its pitfalls, of course, but, in my opinion, remains the way medicine was supposed to be practiced. And not just read off reports and investigations.

Now, in a hunt for fresh clues as to why ordinary people were so ready to harm another, Nestar Russell, at Victoria University of Wellington, has reviewed Milgram's personal notes and project applications, which are housed at Yale University's Sterling Memorial Library.Milgram trained under Solomon Asch, author of the famous conformity experiments, and the obedience project was originally conceived as an extension of Asch's work. Milgram was going to see how the behaviour of a group of cooperating participants (actually confederates working for the researcher) influenced the naive participants' willingness to harm another. A condition in which single participants followed the experimenter's orders on their own was planned as a mere control condition.It was during Milgram's extensive pilot work that he discovered the remarkable willingness for participants to obey instructions, without the need for group coercion, thus changing the direction of his project. The focus shifted to lone participants and Milgram began a process of trial and error pilot work to identify the perfect conditions for inducing obedience - what he described as 'the strongest obedience situation'. Early on, Milgram recognised the need for an acceptable rationale for harming another and so he invented the cover story that the experiment was about using punishment to improve learning. To counter participants' reluctance to harm an innocent person, Milgram also devised several other 'strain resolving mechanisms'. This included replacing the final shock level label 'LETHAL' with the more ambiguous 'XXX'; removing a Nazi-sounding 'pledge to obey' from the experiment instructions; and creating physical distance between the participants and the innocent, to-be-electrocuted learner.In fact, this latter factor worked too well. When Milgram removed any sight or sound of the learner, 'virtually all' participants showed a willingness to inflict lethal harm. Milgram realised this near-total obedience was counter-productive and would prevent his paradigm from 'scaling obedient tendencies'. For his first official experiment he therefore settled on auditory feedback only, in the form of the learner banging on the wall in distress.Another 'strain resolving mechanism' that Milgram devised included increasing the number of levels on the shock generator. This allowed for exploitation of the 'foot in the door' persuasion effect whereby people are more likely to cooperate once they have already agreed to a less significant request - a kind of piecemeal compliance.Milgram was also careful about the actors he chose to play the part of experimenter and learner. Though both non-professionals, the man acting as learner was chosen because he was 'mild and submissive; not at all academic' and a 'perfect victim', whilst the man playing the experimenter was 'stern' and 'intellectual looking'. Finally, Milgram was careful to plan things so that the 'experimenter', whenever challenged, replied that he was responsible for anything that happens to the learner. Taken altogether, Russell's new analysis shows how Milgram used ad hoc trial and error pilot testing to hone his methodology and ensure his first official obedience experiment achieved such a high obedience rate (of 65 per cent). 'Knowing step-by-step how Milgram developed this result may better arm theorists interested in untangling this still enigmatic question of why so many participants inflicted every shock,' Russell said. _________________________________Charles, N.

Because UK libel law is ass backwards, putting the burden of proof on the defendant, the court was not easy on Singh and the judge originally ruled against him based solely on his use of the word “bogus,” interpreting it as claiming deliberate deception on the part of the BCA even though no dictionary defines the word that way. So now the higher court has ruled that the first ruling was in error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new ruling, in essence, says that Simon’s statement  were an expression of his opinion, not a fact of the state of belief of  BCA chiropractors. Therefore Simon can use the “fair comment” defense.  This puts him in a very good position to win the overall case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the full judgment &lt;a href="http://www.indexoncensorship.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Singh_judgement_01Apr10.pdf"&gt;is  here (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle for UK libel reform isn’t over yet but this is definitely a major step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

This does not seem to be in the cards anytime soon. Here, then, are my suggestions for making the Center less dangerous and less of a marketing tool for pseudomedicine than it has been &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/ongoing_problem_with_the_national_center"&gt;since its inception&lt;/a&gt;. Some suggestions might even make the Center somewhat useful. They are listed in order of priority. The Center should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Abandon all unethical trials, beginning with the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2438277/?tool=pubmed"&gt;Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy&lt;/a&gt; (TACT, which is under the joint auspices of the NHLBI). This should be done in a very public manner. The reasons for abandoning the TACT, in summary, are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The TACT was conceived and approved not because of any scientific or medical promise, but because of pressure from a powerful demagogue in Congress, Rep. Dan Burton (R-IN). Burton was acting on behalf of a tiny, fringe group of physicians whom the editor of &lt;em&gt;Chest&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Archives of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt; had correctly called “&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/182097"&gt;pseudoscientific zealots&lt;/a&gt;” whose practices were “&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6378539"&gt;an abuse of the physician’s freedom of choice&lt;/a&gt;.” Barely 15 years later, TACT literature emanating from the NIH renamed the same practitioners “&lt;a href="http://www.circare.org/tact/tactprotocol_20010829.pdf"&gt;respected experts&lt;/a&gt;.” Their organization, the American Association for Advancement in Medicine (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=247"&gt;ACAM&lt;/a&gt;), actively &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000511115741/www.acam.org/newsletter.htm"&gt;lobbied&lt;/a&gt; for the TACT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The TACT Principal Investigator (PI) made numerous false statements in his &lt;a href="http://www.circare.org/tact/tactprotocol_20010829.pdf"&gt;application&lt;/a&gt; for the grant and in his subsequent &lt;a href="http://www.circare.org/tact/tactprotocolv2_20030530.pdf"&gt;protocol&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.circare.org/tact/tactprotocolv2b_20030530.pdf"&gt;submission&lt;/a&gt;, the effect of which was to give the erroneous impression that chelation is a promising treatment for coronary artery disease. I believe that those false statements constitute scientific misconduct. If the PI had offered an accurate review of the existing literature, any scientific review board or IRB worth its salt would have refused to approve the trial. In the event, the “&lt;a href="http://www.circare.org/tact/nccamsepZAT1K02_20020104.pdf"&gt;Special Emphasis Panel&lt;/a&gt;” that the NCCAM convened to review the application included the very practitioner who, as President of the ACAM, had been instrumental in &lt;a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_house_hearings&amp;amp;docid=f:59973.pdf"&gt;securing Rep. Burton’s influence&lt;/a&gt;. That practitioner was also named, in the application that he reviewed, as a member of a TACT committee, and would shortly thereafter become a TACT investigator. This is a violation of the NIH conflict of interest policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have shown, and both the federal Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) and the University of Miami IRB &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/detrm_letrs/YR09/may09b.pdf"&gt;have acknowledged&lt;/a&gt;, that the TACT proceeded with a misleading &lt;a href="http://www.circare.org/tact/tactconsentform_20030613.pdf"&gt;consent form&lt;/a&gt;—so misleading that any change now, more than 6 years after the trial began, couldn’t possibly reverse the damage already done. Misleading statements in the consent form included a strong implication that the study drug was the relatively less dangerous calcium-sodium ETDA, not the very dangerous disodium EDTA used in the trial. The consent form also failed to state important risks, including death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost 2 years ago the FDA &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/E8-13273.htm"&gt;withdrew its approval&lt;/a&gt; for disodium EDTA, which it had previously approved only for emergency treatments of digitalis toxicity and hypercalcemia. The FDA cited the dangers of the drug, including &lt;a href="http://hcrenewal.blogspot.com/2006/11/death-of-autistic-child-chelation.html"&gt;recent deaths&lt;/a&gt; associated with &lt;a href="http://www.circare.org/pd/mcbride_orders_20060510.pdf"&gt;unapproved uses&lt;/a&gt; by ACAM members. Thus there is now no point in studying this drug because it is, for practical purposes, illegal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also showed, and the OHRP and U. Miami IRB also agreed, that many of the investigators in the TACT have criminal records, histories of discipline by state medical boards, histories of membership in IRBs disciplined by the FDA, and other indications of incompetent practices or worse. They are the pseudoscientific zealots mentioned above. I have &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=132"&gt;argued on SBM&lt;/a&gt; that at least 2 deaths of human subjects in the TACT can be attributed to incompetent care at the hands of such investigators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The TACT protocols, including far-too-biased investigators, inadequate blinding methods, multiple primary and secondary endpoints, and more (discussed &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2438277/?tool=pubmed"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), are so tainted that whatever the reported outcome, it is unlikely that it will solve the very problem that it was intended to solve. The outcome will likely be equivocal, but even if it is reported as confirming or disconfirming, either conclusion will almost certainly be rejected by those who disagree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; This suggestion—to abandon the TACT—isn’t really optional, although I am not so naïve as to think that NIH policy-makers will agree. It is not optional because the TACT violates numerous tenets of internationally recognized human studies ethics and &lt;a href="http://www.circare.org/tact/tactindex.htm#tactohrp"&gt;numerous articles&lt;/a&gt; of the U.S. Federal Code of Regulations, and those violations are not retroactively remediable. As Henry Beecher wrote in his &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5327352"&gt;seminal article&lt;/a&gt; on human studies ethics, “an experiment is ethical or not at its inception; it does not become ethical &lt;em&gt;post hoc&lt;/em&gt;…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus to continue the trial, now that such violations are known, is not an ethically viable option for the NIH. Nor should the NIH succumb to political pressure framed as the “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2568"&gt;legislative mandate&lt;/a&gt;” of the NCCAM, which is its usual justification for such mischief. The reason is found in the &lt;a href="http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html"&gt;Helsinki Declaration&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicians should consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCCAM should also publicly address the horribly unethical trial of the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1545"&gt;Gonzalez regimen&lt;/a&gt; for cancer of the pancreas, even though that trial is over. It was spawned by much the same political pressure as was the TACT, it involved NIH-sponsored torture of hapless subjects, and its disconfirming outcome has done nothing to dissuade Gonzalez &lt;a href="http://www.dr-gonzalez.com/jco_rebuttal.htm"&gt;himself&lt;/a&gt; or his champions, including Burton and long time NCCAM advisee (and “Harkinite”) &lt;a href="http://www.cancerdecisions.com/content/view/232/2/lang,english/"&gt;Ralph Moss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the NCCAM must reconsider one of its recurrent public justifications for such trials: popularity. I have written about this several times (including in both the TACT article linked above and the Gonzalez regimen series here on SBM, also linked above) so I won’t go into detail here. In summary, “popularity”—which is almost always exaggerated, as it was in both of those cases—is a weak basis for a human trial: it should not trump a lack of scientific promise, and it never trumps welfare of individual subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Stop using its public information function as an advertisement for fanciful, implausible claims. That it does this is apparent from even a passing glance at its &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, but if examples are sought I refer you to a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=351"&gt;previous discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Start using its public information function for some good, such as informing citizens that homeopathy is nonsense, or that those who claim a vaccine-autism link are both wrong and dangerous. It needs to confront the longstanding, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19760163?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3"&gt;close affiliation&lt;/a&gt; between “CAM” proponents and antivax hysteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Stop putting the cart before the horse by giving grants to medical schools to create “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=153"&gt;integrative medicine&lt;/a&gt;” centers, and stop promoting puff treatments of &lt;a href="http://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/Abstract/2009/09000/An_Evaluation_of_the_Evidence_in__Evidence_Based_.19.aspx"&gt;“CAM” for medical students&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Stop funding studies of “CAM” use and popularity, and begin trying to find out why it is that some people are &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1639"&gt;drawn to implausible treatments&lt;/a&gt;, even in the face of compelling, contradictory evidence. Such investigations might begin by looking at the work of &lt;a href="http://www.sram.org/0302/bias.html"&gt;Beyerstein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/belief_engine/"&gt;Alcock&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

You might have wondered about it a little, or just thought that fructose is sweet like glucose, and gone on with your indulgence.  HFCS has now largely replaced table sugar (or sucrose) as the main sweetener in most confectioneries sold in most stores.  A huge reason for this has been the easy availability of the vast quantities of corn grown in the US, from which high fructose corn syrup is extracted, making it cheaper than sucrose.  While there has been speculation for a while (and increasing correlative data) suggesting that HFCS may increase obesity or other health problems related to sugar, much of this has been decried by the food industry.However, the data is slowly shifting towards the adverse health effects of HFCS.  A recent paper in Pharmacology Biochemistry and behavior (Bocarsly et al, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbb.2010.02.012) now suggests that HFCS causes the characteristics of obesity, from increases in body weight to increased triglycerides in the blood.Let's take a look at what this study shows.The researchers studied the effects of HFCS in captive rats.  Their experiments were simple.  They fed groups male or female rats, either normal rat chow, or rat food mixed with sucrose (sugar), or rat food mixed with equal amounts (and calories) of HFCS (and each sample size was ten rats).  They varied their experiment so that the rats could eat HFCS with every meal, or HFCS was provided only for 12 hours during the day.  They carried out these studies over a short time frame (two months) as well as a longer time frame (6 months).  Here is the rationale behind this experiment.  The experiment not only tested if HFCS could cause increase in weight, but compared it directly with consuming table sugar, sucrose.  Now sucrose is a compound that is made of one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose.  So when sucrose is broken down, it breaks down to fructose and glucose.  Secondly, the process by which glucose and fructose are broken down are similar, and the amount of energy they each can release is the same.  HFCS has around 55% fructose and 45% glucose.  So the food industry has always claimed that using sucrose, or using an equivalent amount of fructose would be biologically very similar.  However, when rats were fed either regular food, or food + sucrose, or food + HFCS, the results were quite different.Here is what the experiment unambiguously revealed. The male rats fed HCFS gained more weight than mice fed with regular chow or chow supplemented with sugar even over a two month period.  Over a six month period, this weight gain in male rats was very significant when compared with rats eating regular chow.  In male rats, after 6 months of these diets, the rats on HFCS weighed on average a 100g more than rats fed on regular food.  Female rats also gained weight eating HFCS, but at a lower rate than males.  After a 7 month duration on these diets, the rats fed with normal food weighed 177% over baseline.  However, the rats with continuous access to HFCS were ~200% heavier than baseline.  There were a few other interesting observations, indicative of the effects of HFCS on obesity.  In both male and female rats, the increase in body weight was accompanied by an increase in actual abdominal body fat, as well as increased triglycerides.  So if the same effects hold for humans, the weight gain would primarily be around the abdominal region.  There remain some limitations in this study.  The dramatic increases in body weight as well as abdominal fat was observed in rats that had food + HFCS available continuously.  In female rats that had access to HFCS only for 12 hours during the day (for a long duration) did not show those dramatic weight increases.  However, male rats even with controlled access to HFCS showed this increase in abdominal fat accumulation.  Since we care about human consumption of HFCS, does human consumption of HFCS reflect tightly controlled access to it, or a constant availability of HFCS with any meal?  Secondly, there will be some differences in the rates of metabolism of glucose and fructose between humans and rats.  However, the broad processes of absorption and breakdown of these nutrients are very similar in us and in rats, so it is quite likely that this general phenomenon will hold true in humans.  But doing these experiments in humans (where a long term study could be five or ten years) would be extremely difficult to control.  Secondly, the experiments were done in rats kept in cages in a laboratory.  One could argue that there is clearly nothing in common between laboratory rats and humans.  These rats exercise very little and are largely sedentary.  They don't run around as much as they should, are already somewhat obese even before feeding on HFCS, and have fairly unlimited access to food and can eat whenever they want to, and as much as they want to in one sitting.  Surely that can't be the way humans live.  Oh but wait a minute!The authors in their discussion speculate on why HFCS might cause increased body weight gain when compared to regular food or even food supplemented with an equivalent amount of sucrose, but their discussion only briefly touches on aspects of sugar metabolism that could explain this.  So I'll elaborate a little more, and add some of my own speculation based on how these sugars are metabolized.  In short, it all comes down to the body's way to regulate sugar levels, sense how much is there, and feedback to control the effects of these sugars.Firstly, glucose and fructose are absorbed very differently.  Glucose is absorbed early in the small intestine, while fructose is absorbed later.  But the big difference comes in how and where the two sugars, as well as sucrose itself are metabolized.  Sucrose has to be broken down in the stomach into glucose and fructose before it can be used.  Glucose can be used by just about every cell in the body through a process called glycolysis, to break it down into usable energy.  The process of glucose breakdown is a very tightly regulated process called glycolysis.  In this process, a key regulatory step happens when glucose is converted to another sugar called fructose-6-phosphate, and then to another sugar called fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, which is then broken down into triglycerides and then energy.  Now, the enzyme that does this conversion to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is called phosphofructokinase and it is highly and exquisitely regulated by multiple inputs, including other co-factors as well as other modifications.  This allows the cell to tightly and precisely control how much glucose is broken down.  Fructose however is broken down not in all cells but largely only in the liver through a process called fructolysis.  Here, instead of fructose being converted to fructose-6-phosphate,  and then being tighly regulated in its conversion to 1,6-bisphosphate and later triglycerides, it is converted into a similar (but biologically very different) sugar called fructose-1-phosphate.  This small change in the position of that single phosphate group makes a huge difference biologically, since the breakdown of this sugar into triglycerides happens very quickly and easily, and is not tightly controlled by many inputs.  The result of this is that fructose is very rapidly and easily broken down into triglycerides which can then be used for energy, or be converted into glycogen or fats for storage.  While the eventual outcome of glucose and fructose is similar, the way the two are regulated and controlled is very different.  In other words, the body has much more control over how fast glucose is broken down, but far less control over fructose breaking down.So this phenomenon, combined with the fact that HFCS has over 55% fructose, and 45% glucose means that the body is dealing with a much higher ratio of fructose to glucose when compared with just plain old table sugar (sucrose).  The difference is small over a few meals, but over a long period of time, this adds up to quite a lot.  Also, what this difference in circulating glucose (that is regulated and not tightly broken down) does is change the way the body responds to feeding.  Glucose controls insulin release, which in turn controls a hormone called leptin, which controls apetite and satiety in the brain.  Now, this small but continuous difference in fructose/glucose ratios (comparing HFCS to sucrose) alters how much circulating glucose remains in the blood, which can alter leptin levels as well as leptin sensitivity, and this finally alters the brain's ability to be satiated after a meal.  Over time, HFCS could change the satiety achieved by eating, and also finally alter eating patterns.  All this put together could cause the increase in body weight seen over time.Of course, there will be people unsatisfied with these data.  But the data is suggestive, and this idea is compelling....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.webchild.com.au/"&gt;The Child group&lt;/a&gt; of magazines, covering Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra and Perth are free monthly publications distributed via childcare centres and baby shops and are highly targeted to Australian parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website of &lt;a href="http://www.sydneyschild.com.au/index.php/home"&gt;Sydney’s Child&lt;/a&gt; describes the publication as, &lt;em&gt;“..well established in the marketplace and highly respected by readers.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“With six publications reaching across Australia, the Child group of magazines offer advertisers the ability to advertise nationally, or selectively depending on their needs. The tailored content within each magazine ensures that the publications always remain locally relevant to readers.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which combines to make this the perfect platform for the AVN to scare parents into not vaccinating with their misinformation about vaccines causing autism, SIDS, shaken baby syndrome etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that the AVN applied to purchase a 1/3 page ad in Sydney’s Child, Melbourne’s Child and Brisbane’s Child at a total estimated cost of $8000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a highly principled and responsible move, it appears that the magazine declined the AVN the opportunity to do so, thus forfeiting a large amount of advertising money. This is a honorable move on their part, especially since being a free publication, they rely heavily on advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At question here is how the AVN came to have a spare $8000, after their &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2010/02/07/have-we-seen-the-last-of-the-avn/"&gt;recent donation drive&lt;/a&gt; initiated apparently to keep them from going under. Meryl apparently needed the cash to cover debts, so just a few weeks later she has enough in the coffers to blow eight grand on advertising?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wonder if her donors would be happy to see their money being diverted from keeping the AVN running to this new venture. That is, if indeed it is their money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2009, she was asking for donations to run a Generation Rescue ad, for which they would cover half the costs. An ad which never ran mind you, because&lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/news/dick-smith-funds-pro-vaccination-advertisement/"&gt; we pipped her at the post&lt;/a&gt;. So it is possible that they have come to the party here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when Meryl was told that The Child group did not want her anti-vaccine money. If she was not already convinced there is a conspiracy to see her silenced, then she ought to be well and truly by now. Paranoid much? Well maybe you should be Meryl!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to clarify that neither Australian Skeptics, Stop the AVN or myself had anything to do with this decision. I’m sure Meryl will blame us, and I certainly wish I had the influence to persuade publishers and journalists to never publish her nonsense again, but I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Or do I? &lt;em&gt;*look over there, it’s a reptilian overlord*&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to The Child group for adhering to their editorial policy and extending this to advertising:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Editorial Integrity – Our editorial integrity ensures that advertisements are always viewed within the context of a highly regarded, quality publication. That our magazines are seen in such a favourable light contributes positively to how an advertiser’s message is received by our readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Child Group had done a great service to public health by limiting the exposure of the AVN’s misinformation. And by doing so, they may have saved a baby’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

It consists mostly of telling scientists what they think about evolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Evolution” is an ill-defined term. It can mean:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Change over time.&lt;br&gt;2) Common ancestry.&lt;br&gt;3) Random genetic errors filtered by natural selection as the purely materialistic mechanism that explains all of life’s complexity, information content, and information-processing machinery, not to mention human consciousness and its demonstrable creative intelligence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Change over time is obvious and undeniable. Common ancestry seems reasonable to me, although universal common ancestry appears to be in big trouble with mounting evidence that Darwin’s unidirectional “tree of life” never existed. It might have been something more akin to a hologram than a tree, as far as I can tell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Darwinists really want us to accept — without question, dissent, annoying logical/evidential challenges, or apostasy — is definition 3), so let me make a modest proposal to substitute it for “evolution,” and reveal the Darwinian bait-and-switch scam.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is unbelievable! The standard definition of evolution is in any evolutionary biology textbook and all it takes is a little effort to find it. (If you know how to read.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I'd like to know is whether there's any evolutionary biologist who accepts definition #3. Not even the most ardent adaptationist would accept such a silly definition of evolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does Intelligent Design Creationism select for people with very low IQ's or does accepting Intelligent Design Creationism just make you stupid? &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-2833625459620115307?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270182392915"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/twin_cities_anti-choice_protes.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ad0423dc361842c0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Twin Cities Anti-Choice Protest</title><published>2010-04-02T05:21:30Z</published><updated>2010-04-02T05:21:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/SgdMCfocppk/twin_cities_anti-choice_protes.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/twin_cities_anti-choice_protes.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You can help with your wallet.  &lt;a href="https://secure.ga0.org/02/ppmns_donate3"&gt;Click here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/twin_cities_anti-choice_protes.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/SgdMCfocppk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270181482960"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/a_battle_won_for_free_speech_and_science.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f85a7bde05672be8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">A battle won for free speech and science, but the war remains</title><published>2010-04-02T05:00:29Z</published><updated>2010-04-02T05:00:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/OwKf_3cNVkI/a_battle_won_for_free_speech_and_science.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/a_battle_won_for_free_speech_and_science.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it doesn't happen that often, but I'm forced to admit it. I was wrong. I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/simon_singh_appeals_judge_eadys_bogus_li.php"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that Simon Singh would likely lose his appeal against an &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/05/bca-v-singh-astonishingly-illiberal.html"&gt;astonishing illiberal ruling on his libel&lt;/a&gt; case by Sir David Eady. Singh, as you may recall, is the British science writer who wrote a now infamous article about chiropractic, in particular, Singh labeled claims that chiropractic could treat colic, sleeping and feeding problems, ear infections, asthma, and prolonged crying as "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/the_british_chiropractic_association_bew.php"&gt;bogus&lt;/a&gt;." Specifically, he wrote that the British Chiropractic Association "happily promotes bogus therapies." The BCA sued him for libel, claiming that this statement implies that they knowingly and dishonestly promote therapies that don't work. Singh countered that such was not his intent; rather, his view is that they believe in these nonsensical (i.e., "bogus") claims and that's why they happily promote them. Unfortunately, based on a narrow, highly legalistic interpretation of the use of the word "bogus," Judge Eady ruled in favor of the BCA, namely that Singh meant that the BCA was knowingly promoting false claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ruling put Singh in a bad situation. As I've pointed out numerous times before, be it discussing Singh's case or, for example, Holocaust denier David Irving's libel suit against Holocaust historian Deborah Lipstadt, British libel laws are hopelessly biased in favor of the plaintiff. In practice, they in essence necessitate that the defendant prove that what he wrote was true, rather than putting the burden of proof on the plaintiff to prove that what was written was either false or written with a reckless disregard for the truth. Worse, it's possible for a plaintiff to claim jurisdiction in the U.K. if even a single book or article is sold there or even if, as is true of any website, the article can be read by people in the U.K. The odds were seriously stacked against Singh, and the BCA was trying to portray Judge Eady's ruling as being vindication of its woo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/a_battle_won_for_free_speech_and_science.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/a_battle_won_for_free_speech_and_science.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/OwKf_3cNVkI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270181391473"><id gr:original-id="http://www.thetwentyfirstfloor.com/?p=254">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1a592445eec946e2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Magnets, Morality and Misrepresentation</title><published>2010-04-01T22:02:38Z</published><updated>2010-04-01T22:02:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/jH7i3kO82cM/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.thetwentyfirstfloor.com/?p=254"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Have you ever read a science story in a newspaper and just not understand what the point of the research was?

As always, you should &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/04/28/rating-articles-in-plos-one/" title=""&gt;rate the articles&lt;/a&gt;, post &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/04/07/why-post-comments-on-plos-one/" title=""&gt;notes and comments&lt;/a&gt; and send &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/05/04/the-how-and-why-of-trackbacks/" title=""&gt;trackbacks&lt;/a&gt; when you blog about the papers.  You can now also easily place articles on various social services (CiteULike, Mendeley, Connotea, Stumbleupon, Facebook and Digg) with just one click. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: you may have noticed that today's papers were not published last night as you are used to seeing them. Starting today, PLOS ONE papers are published online on the same date as the official publication date (at or close to 2pm Pacific, 5pm Eastern, I believe). That same date/time is when embrago lifts and that same date/time is the moment when article-level metrics start to get collected. Thus all four important dates/times are now one and the same - easy to remember that way, right? For those of you on the press list, the same old rule applies - before hitting the "Post" button on your blog (or Twitter, Facebook, anywhere online), first check if the paper itself is online on the PLoS site. If it is, you are free to publish your blog post. If it is not, hold off for a minute, re-check the embargo date/time, come back later and check again, or e-mail me to ask (there may be a technical problem delaying publication). By doing this, you are safe not to to break the embargo (no blogger has broken it in the past three years, so you are doing something right!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, after a court of appeal ruling hailed as a "resounding victory" for Singh, he has been spared having to stand up in court and prove that the comments that sparked a libel suit from the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) were factually correct - an experience that the three appeal judges compared to "an Orwellian ministry of truth".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we are pleased to present this year&amp;#39;s Pigasus Awards to the following very-deserving people. It was a hard call — there seem to be millions all over the world clambering to make it onto the following shortlist — but these folks had that &lt;em&gt;special something &lt;/em&gt;that commanded our attention and, in the end, impressed us like&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;no others. No matter if it was blatant cynicism, shocking callousness, lazy ignorance, or merely old-fashioned pig-headedness — these men and women took those qualities that most vex us to their wild, crazy extremes. We'd salute them, but we're too busy gaping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the scientist who did the most to promote woo in ’09…&lt;br&gt;Dr. Mehmet Oz&lt;/strong&gt; is a Harvard-educated cardiac physician whose current TV show, while providing some basic wisdom re medical matters, also promotes and endorses such quackery as Reiki – of which Oz’s wife is a practitioner – along with all sorts of “energy medicine” and other magic. Oprah Winfrey, following his appearance on her TV show, set him up with a show of his own, which has heavy ratings and brings him book sales and the other fruits of success. Proper scientific studies have found that Reiki offers no therapeutic effects, nor is it beneficial for any condition, though it does fatten the wallets of the practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the funding organization that wasted the most money on pseudo-science…&lt;br&gt;Iraq's Interior Ministry&lt;/strong&gt; had, by the end of 2009, spent USD $85,000,000 on a dowsing rod called the ADE 651. (Each individual unit cost up to USD $60,000.) Despite an international uproar and continual car bomb detonations in Iraq, the things are still being used, and the Ministry is still defending its decision to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the media outlet that reported as fact the most outlandish paranormal claim(s)…&lt;br&gt;The Oprah Winfrey Show. &lt;/strong&gt;Oprah&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is probably a decent lady. She is certainly a very silly lady. In the last year, she has made her show a platform for Suzanne Somers (at least twice), Jenny McCarthy (ditto), Dr. Oz (almost every week), and Michael Beckwith (the founder of New Thought Church). Now, lots of shows dabble in silliness from time to time, but Oprah’s can’t be compared to any of those: She is too famous, and her reach too long. There are many, many millions who believe that, if Oprah likes it, it’s the truth. (Though one must wonder why she thinks Suzanne Somers’ anti-aging supplements are so great when, as Rhonda Byrne once taught her, it’s possible to &lt;em&gt;think &lt;/em&gt;yourself young.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the psychic who tricked the most people with the least effort…&lt;br&gt;Chip Coffey &amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;is a clairvoyant, clairaudient and clairsentient psychic, as well as a fully-conscious medium.  He is the great-grandson of famed Native American medicine woman, Minnie Sue Morrow Foster, whose own amazing gifts were widely hailed in the early part of the 20th century.&amp;quot; And that&amp;#39;s nice, but what he really does for a living is take deluded kids and make them worse. See our &lt;em&gt;Swift &lt;/em&gt;about it &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/837-how-come-we-always-have-to-wait-until-night-to-do-this.html"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the group that most ardently refuses to face reality…&lt;br&gt;Scientologists. &lt;/strong&gt;It should be obvious by now that OT Levels IX, X, and XI don&amp;#39;t exist. (Click &lt;a href="http://leavingscientology.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/the-bridge-to-nowhere/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more info.) Also, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The LA Times &lt;/em&gt;and many other media organs have lately come forth with nearly identical stories exposing the Church&amp;#39;s dark side — which involves alleged penal colonies, covered-up rapes, coerced abortions, slave labor, and savage abuse at the hands of David Miscavige. It&amp;#39;s time for those drawn in by Scientology&amp;#39;s bright, shiny surfaces to smarten up.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jrefbrandon@gmail.com (The JREF)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270176221342"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=3013">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/96dcbf1dbd12617f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="You Tube"/><category term="April Fools"/><category term="Big Mean Carl"/><category term="bunnies"/><category term="bunny rabbit"/><category term="easter"/><category term="Easter Bunny"/><category term="Eat"/><category term="funny"/><category term="Hungry"/><category term="Muppet  Show"/><category term="Muppets  Studio"/><category term="Nasty"/><category term="Om  Num"/><category term="trick"/><title type="html">Happy Eater, Um Easter From The Muppet Show</title><published>2010-04-02T02:43:30Z</published><updated>2010-04-02T02:43:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/2JHa9btURxQ/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/2010/04/happy-eater-um-easter-from-the-muppet-show/"/><content xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCRUPWDIgYM"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCRUPWDIgYM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Dyslexic rats?  Really?  Well, these rats can’t read, but they’re still used as an animal model for dyslexia.

First, some background. The underlying cause of dyslexia is still under debate, but it’s generally accepted that it involves deficits in auditory and phonological (language sounds) processing, with a possibility of visual deficits as well.

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I respect Judaism more  than most religions is that the faith mandates a relatively humane treatment  towards animals. In contrast, every now and then I run into a Christian who seems to take the  perspective that God put animals on the Earth for humans to exploit, putting  them on a similar level to resources like oil or timber.  But Jews rarely take that view, and indeed, Israel might be the first country &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article7079509.ece"&gt;to  ban fur&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international anti-fur campaign, backed by animal  rights activists such as Brigitte Bardot and Sir Paul McCartney, has picked  Israel as the perfect starting point because the fur trade is tiny — worth about  $1 million a year — and because, under Jewish tradition, the undue suffering of  animals is forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The market here is not that big,” said Josh  Rotbart, a legal representative for the Israeli organisation Let The Animals  Live, which also runs an animal rescue centre in Lod, near Tel Aviv. “We are not  talking about Canada or the US or China. It’s a small industry and it’s pretty  easy to ban a small industry. It’s hot here. You don’t really need to wear fur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief opposition comes from ultra-Orthodox Jews who wear &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtreimel"&gt;shtreimels&lt;/a&gt; (pictured below), a  hat made out of sable fur. However, I think they would be better off using a  synthetic material, particularly since they might accidentally be wearing someone’s pet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign began when an Israeli news station reported that much of  the “fake” fur being imported from China was, in fact, made from the pelts of  cats and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TxtOpAB0ckU/S7UJ4s8JajI/AAAAAAAAA9A/52GIyK_VzKs/s1600/Shtreimels.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:10px;text-align:center;width:385px;height:185px;border:0pt none" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TxtOpAB0ckU/S7UJ4s8JajI/AAAAAAAAA9A/52GIyK_VzKs/s400/Shtreimels.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="385" height="185"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes, that’s some highly disturbing stuff, and another reason to avoid fur all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the ban succeeds or not is anyone’s guess, though Rotbart says he  is “pretty optimistic” of an eventual victory.  I can’t speak for other atheists, but I’m hoping he is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one thing I am sure of is that the United States won’t be banning fur anytime soon.  I happened  to witness a protest outside a fur store yesterday, and it was attended by  exactly three people.&lt;/p&gt;

On the other hand, there are plenty of champions of the status quo who argue that anonymous peer review is the essential mechanism by which reports of scientific findings are certified as scientific knowledge.

So how do scientists feel about anonymous peer review?  A 2008 paper in Science and Engineering Ethics by David B. Resnik, Christina Guiterrez-Ford, and Shyamal Peddada, titled "Perceptions of Ethical Problems with Scientific Journal Peer Review: An Exploratory Study", attempts to get a preliminary handle on that question.

&lt;p&gt;Then I went to the top sekrit ScienceBlogs and saw the news. Zuska's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2010/04/ed_yong_has_a_new_fanboi.php#comments"&gt;already let the cat out of the bag&lt;/a&gt;. Frankly, I'll be very sorry to see Greg Laden go. He writes one of the most highly trafficked blog on the network and posts daily, riveting content. I feel blessed to have had him as a colleague here. His contributions and hilarious youtubes will be sorely, sorely, missed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/04/discover_blogs_poaches_another.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/AwDJlVN-XmA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270160450871"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=23000">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6045248f1fe1c97a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheist Generosity"/><category term="Education"/><category term="GLBT"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Updates on the ACLU’s Rejection of an Atheist’s Money</title><published>2010-04-01T22:05:09Z</published><updated>2010-04-01T22:05:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/04/01/updates-on-the-aclus-rejection-of-an-atheists-money/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t seen it, the ACLU of Mississippi has apologized to the American Humanist Association for not accepting donor &lt;strong&gt;Todd Stiefel&lt;/strong&gt;’s donation.&lt;/p&gt;

Alberts is also professor emeritus in the department of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco, to which he returned in 2005 after serving two six-year terms as the president of the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During his tenure at the National Academies, Alberts was instrumental in developing landmark National Science Education Standards that have been implemented in school systems nationwide. "The type of science as inquiry teaching we need," said Alberts, "emphasizes logical, hands-on problem solving, and it insists on having evidence for claims that can be confirmed by others. It requires work in cooperative groups, where those with different types of talents can discover them--developing self-confidence and an ability to communicate effectively with others."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alberts is also one of the original authors of The Molecular Biology of the Cell, a preeminent textbook now in its fifth edition. For the period 2000 to 2009, he served as the co-chair of the InterAcademy Council, a new organization in Amsterdam governed by the presidents of 15 national academies of sciences and established to provide scientific advice to the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;That&amp;#39;s Bruce seated front right in a photo from 2007 when he was here to receive an honorary degree.

&lt;p&gt;I have posted many a picture purporting paranormal parts that are actually just our minds playing tricks on us. But this one really puts us to the test. Or testis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. &lt;a href="http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/2010/01/the_case_of_the_haun.html"&gt;It’s a haunted scrotum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks more like a monkey to me than a ghostly face, and there’s a vas deferens between them. Maybe you see something different. Leave a comment if you do, and please keep it clean… but have a ball.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet,  the small but important amount of research that has been done there shows that the NPCGP consists of many (alarmingly many) pieces of plastic that are very small, the largest being "about the size of the fingernail on your pinkey." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albatross may or may not be affected by garbage, but it is not likely that the garbage shown in the guts of the baby birds in these particular media comes  from the NPCGP.  Yes, the plastic in the NPCGP and elsewhere may have a negative environmental effect, but the pictures of floating garbage, which are all from coastal estuarine regions down river from major "third world" population centers, are NOT of the NPCGP and thus constitute bald faced lies. Bald faced lies by organizations like Green Peace is the fuel that right wing anti-environmental pro-business neo conservative yahoos run on.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the situation is even worse than that because of what appear to be the misguided efforts of a British Billionaire who has managed to frighten those best in a position to criticize him into remaining silent.  In fact, I'm a little nervous writing this blog post.  &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not often I’ll cite the rightwing UK newspaper &lt;em&gt;The Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;, but yesterday they picked up on an amazing set of photos by Polish amateur photographer Mirosław Świętek. Świętek, a 37 year old physiotherapist, went out into the woods at about 3am and took these stunning photos of dew-covered insects. There’s a Drosophilid in there, just for me and Jerry. Apart from their beauty, these photos show the way that physical characteristics change depending on what size you are. When you are the size of an insect, being covered in dew is primarily a problem of aerodynamics and temperature, not getting wet! You can see more of Świętek’s amazing macro photos &lt;a href="http://photo.net/photodb/member-photos?photo_id=10849135"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. [UPDATE: a far wider selection of his photos (not all macro) can be seen &lt;a href="http://karbonara.plfoto.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For those interested in the technical aspects, he uses a Canon EOS 40D camera, with a Tamron SP 90 mm/2.8 1:1 macro. And a lot of patience.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter One: Baseball&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening Day for Major League Baseball is April 5, which dovetails nicely with the beginning of this series. It’s also a good starting point because baseball has always induced the nostalgic sandlot memory-lane-strolls of aging white men like Doris Kearns Goodwin. And the season goes on for-freaking-&lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;, so you can knock all three books out of the park by the All-Star break (July).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Natural&lt;/em&gt; by Bernard Malamud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Stats: &lt;/strong&gt;For all the ink spilled about America’s “national pastime” (the one the NFL usurped about 30 years ago), there are very few great baseball novels. &lt;em&gt;The Natural&lt;/em&gt; is one of them. You’ve seen the movie; you know the story. A 19-year-old prodigy, Roy Hobbs, gets shot by a mystery woman, drops out of sight, then magically reappears as a 35-year-old making a comeback with the New York Knights. Swinging his trusty bat “Wonderboy,” Hobbs tears the cover off the ball, leads the Knights to the brink of a pennant, falls in love, and ends his career in dramatic fashion, drilling a home run off a light tower that sends celebratory sparks of glory raining down on the field like bolts from the hand of Zeus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kicker:&lt;/strong&gt; The pennant-winning homer is the climax of the film adaptation starring Robert Redford. But In Malamud’s &lt;em&gt;The Natural&lt;/em&gt;, Hobbs whiffs, the season ends, and he breaks down in tears as some kid asks him if it’s true what the newspapers are saying – that he threw the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Women Need to Read:&lt;/strong&gt; Most men know the movie version, but it’s common knowledge that books are always better, so your world-weary observations about the novel will be trenchant. Drop this during the 7th-inning stretch: “When Wonderboy cracks in two, it’s an allegory for Hobbs’ dreams. It’s the natural reduced to a mortal.” Men who prefer the book do so for the sadness that hangs over unfulfilled dreams and the loss of youth. Let the saps have their fairy tales. That Hollywood ending has lovely aesthetics; Malamud’s novel has failure, and soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Pitcher’s Stor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;y: Innings With David Cone&lt;/em&gt; by Roger Angell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Stats:&lt;/strong&gt; Speaking of failure – David Cone was one of MLB’s most dominant pitchers from 1988-99, amassing 180 wins. He was a five-time All-Star, a Cy Young award winner, a five-time World Series champ, and owner of a memorable perfect game in July 1999 (after having suffered an aneurysm in his right arm). A wild man in his younger days, Cone was a writer’s dream: Flaky, funny, gritty, and smart. Before 2000, the pitcher teamed up with avuncular &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; writer Roger Angell for an insider’s look at a cagey veteran in his twilight years. Presumably, Cone would have a typically impressive season and lead the Yankees to yet another World Series with Angell and his notepad riding shotgun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kicker:&lt;/strong&gt; The victory lap was a fiery crash. In 2000, Cone would go 4-14 with a 6.91 ERA. A terrible season, brutal on the psyche, which was somehow made worse by the fact that the Yankees were good enough that loyal manager Joe Torre kept letting Cone take the mound. Things went from bad to worse to worst to please-don’t-make-me-watch-this-anymore. Angell masterfully weaves Cone’s life story throughout the book, which makes the pain of reading about his deteriorating skills that much more acute. And I loathe the Yankees. In a nutshell, Angell tells Cone, “It must be torture to give up something tough and demanding that you once did extremely well.” Two paragraphs later, Angell notes that Cone was back to smoking more than a pack a day. (See? Millionaire MLB pitchers are just like us!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Women Need to Read:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A Pitcher’s Story &lt;/em&gt;is a tremendous book about failure, which makes it a tremendous book about, you know, life. Cone never “overcomes” much of anything – no word on if he still smokes – but, to his credit, he never took Angell’s offer to scuttle the project. There’s an old sportswriter’s axiom that the best stories come from the loser’s locker room. That season, Cone was a Charlie Brown-level loser, which led to a season of personal questioning, agita, analysis, new techniques, old tricks – anything to make pitches like he always had. He shares everything with Angell, which means A&lt;em&gt; Pitcher’s Story&lt;/em&gt; is a master clinic on what goes through the mind of a hurler who can’t make a five-ounce ball his bitch. Tame your man with Cone’s pitching insights, and he just may be yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt; by Michael Lewis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Stats: &lt;/strong&gt;The most important baseball book in a generation mirrors what happened in American society; it should be subtitled: “When the Geeks Took Over the Game.” It’s the story of how Oakland A’s general manger Billy Beane used different statistical metrics to gain a competitive advantage with a team that had little money to spend. (Shorthand: The A’s aren’t the Goldman Sachs Yankees. They aren’t even their yuppie neighbors, the Wells Fargo Giants. They’re the Bailey Savings &amp;amp; Loan.) In broad terms, Beane went after players who got on base a lot by hook or by crook. He labels coveted Red Sox product Kevin Youkilis the “Greek God of Walks,” which ain’t exactly an All-American slugger nickname like “The Sultan of Swat” or “Hammerin’ Hank.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kicker: &lt;/strong&gt;The A’s win more than their payroll says they should, but never enough to say that Beane beat the system, in terms of titles. The part of &lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt; that gets lost is that it’s a riveting profile of an outsider crashing the old boy’s party (i.e. shattering the glass ceiling for nerds). Beane struggled with self-doubt and washed out as a player before he joined management, but his thoughtfulness started a statistical revolution. Beane needed players on the cheap and his methodology pissed off the establishment until most teams adopted some form of his methodology. Joining ‘em then beating ‘em. Amazingly, there are still a few flat-Earthers in positions of baseball power who doubt the veracity of statistical modeling, because those eggheads “never played the game.” You don’t need me to tell you this, but some men never learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Women Need to Read:&lt;/strong&gt; A look at finding and exploiting inefficiencies in the Major League marketplace might sound as boring as, say, watching an actual A’s game, but the number-crunching vs. the-naked-eye arguments have dominated baseball for a decade, and you’ll want to be somewhat familiar with where it all started. Plus, it’s a fallacy (or it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be a fallacy…ladies?) that women only enjoy sports when they “know” an athlete, which is why the Olympics are overwrought with stories about living with shingles, overcoming Xanax addictions, and the pain of pan-sexuality. My guess is that there are plenty of geeky girls out there who would dig baseball a lot more if they knew that today’s game needs protractors and laptops as much as chewing tobacco and HGH. Perhaps &lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt; will spur a young woman, excuse me, &lt;a href="http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/la/community/executives/ng.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; young woman&lt;/a&gt;, to become a general manager. When you do, please email and explain &lt;a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?search=vorp"&gt;VORP&lt;/a&gt; to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ali Hussain Sibat&lt;/strong&gt; was the host of a popular show in Lebanon in which he “would predict the future on his show and give out advice to his audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, he was a Middle Eastern &lt;strong&gt;Miss Cleo&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, he went to Saudi Arabia to perform the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umrah"&gt;Umrah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he was there, &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/03/19/saudi.arabia.sorcery/index.html"&gt;police arrested him&lt;/a&gt; and took him to trial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… the judges in Medina issued a statement expressing that Sibat &lt;strong&gt;deserved to be executed&lt;/strong&gt; for having continually practiced black magic on his show, adding that this sentence would deter others from practicing sorcery.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re going to &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/03/31/saudi.arabia.sorcery/index.html"&gt;behead him on Friday&lt;/a&gt; for practicing something that isn’t even real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m all for stopping con artists who make money by pretending to see the future, but this punishment far exceeds his “crime.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
May El Khansa, the attorney for Ali Hussain Sibat, told CNN that she and Sibat’s family were informed about the upcoming execution…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Khansa said she has appealed to Lebanon’s prime minister, Saad Hariri, and president, Michel Suleiman, to stop the execution. Amnesty International, the human rights group, has called on Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah to block it as well.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope someone can get through to them, but I’m not optimistic.  The Saudi government is stuck in medieval times and they have a long way to go before they will come to their senses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m going to take a little mental health break and hopefully come back and finally finish up all the 263 draft posts that I have saved, half-written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a proven scientific fact that women spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on books designed to help them understand what makes men tick. Most of these titles are centered around a clumsy, soft-in-the-middle, oft-hungover, low-level filing clerk who gets whisked away by a handsome, Master-of-the-Universe type, only to realize that the smitten dry cleaner holds the key to her heart. The moral of the “chick lit” story is yes, there’s a man out there who will let you eat, pray, and love to your stomach’s, soul’s and heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the Cinderella fantasy, ladies. But know this: None of these books will teach you a damn thing about men. If you seek enlightenment on the simple creature known as “dude,” then you need to read as they read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not talking about books that you &lt;em&gt;wish &lt;/em&gt;they would read – or worse, ones you thrust upon them. Those books suck and should be thrown into a &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5207368/a-very-special-book+burning-glenn-beck-tea-party"&gt;Glenn-Beck-book-burning pyre&lt;/a&gt;. (Quick FYI: If your fella is currently reading Glenn Beck’s &lt;em&gt;Arguing With Idiots&lt;/em&gt;, Steve Harvey’s &lt;em&gt;Act Like A Lady, Think Like A Man&lt;/em&gt; or Dan Brown’s &lt;em&gt;The Lost Symbol&lt;/em&gt;, you should probably blog it on down the road. Nothing to see here. No hard feelings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you want to understand the apes, you’ve got to go into the jungle, which is where I come in. I will be your Jane Goodall, bringing you a deeper understanding of the literary monkeys. Each week, I’ll suggest three titles to help explain men, or at least men like me. My qualifications? I’ve been both a male and an avid reader for as long as I can remember. It’s also important to know that it’s been a lifelong dream of mine to turn “wasting yet another afternoon on the couch with Philip Roth” into “smart career move”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter One is one the way.&lt;/p&gt;

(Or,  idle slobs, take action!)﻿&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/toiletthumb.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/91384710.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="91384710" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/91384710-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Flush Wisely&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective flushing, or the “if it’s yellow, let it mellow” policy, is probably one of the easiest things you can do to conserve water. Most toilets use at least 1.6 gallons of water per flush, so even if you skip just two flushes a day, this adds up to 1,168 gallons of water saved per year. If the thought of leaving pee in your toilet rubs your inner Emily Post the wrong way, just try forgoing the flush at night – we promise no one will notice.&lt;/p&gt;

Wittkopp is a Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She got her Ph.D. in 2002 with Sean Carroll.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anything found to be true of E. coli must also be true of elephants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Jacques Monod (1954)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Wittkopp has just published a paper in PLoS Biology: &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000342"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Variable Transcription Factor Binding: A Mechanism of Evolutionary Change&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The second paragraph tells you something you didn't know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;During the last decade, researchers have discovered that the collection of proteins found in different animals is remarkably similar. In fact, many proteins are found not only in animals, but also in fungi and plants; some are even shared with bacteria. This unexpected—and truly astounding—finding has changed scientists' thinking about how biological diversity evolved ...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Isn't that cool? Before 1990, researchers didn't know that many animal proteins had homologs in fungi, plants, and even (gasp!) bacteria.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I presume she means that &lt;u&gt;she&lt;/u&gt; didn't know this because she was still in high school.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-5479478188189396065?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270149448062"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=13162">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bf6375a45c788a3f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Aliens/UFOs"/><category term="Chat"/><category term="Comments"/><category term="Conspiracy Theories"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">AI: Area 51 Comes Out of the Closet</title><published>2010-04-01T19:00:43Z</published><updated>2010-04-01T19:00:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/ai-area-51-comes-out-of-the-closet/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3221da5ab8e24207312429cc1db6787a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, please. Like no one knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smattering of newspapers ran &lt;a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/788046--area-51-vets-break-five-decades-of-alien-silence"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; yesterday about alleged &lt;a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2011461015_area51vets28m.html"&gt;former contractors&lt;/a&gt; at Area 51 who are now talking about their experiences at the “mysterious” base in the Nevada desert. No longer sworn to secrecy, folks are free to come forward, and tales are surfacing confirming the strict security measures always reported at Groom Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the sources in the newspaper articles, there in fact have been highly secret, highly classified military projects and aircraft tests being conducted at the base since its inception. Unfortunately, none of the reports from former contractors confirms any of the outlandish stories of crashed alien spacecraft, dead aliens, live aliens, or reverse engineering of alien technology that conspiracy nutters have repeated for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stupid truth. Ruining all the fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway . . . . In honor of Area 51 coming out of the closet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you dig air shows? Are you into the bad ass aircraft that was tested at Area 51? Have you ever seen a UFO? What’s your best guess as to what it actually was? Ever been abducted? Is alien sex all anal? Do aliens hold you afterward, or leave ’cause you know, they have to get up early for work the next day? Why don’t they call when they say they’re going to call? I just don’t understand it. I can’t do this anymore. It tears me up inside. I’m a man, damn it. I’m sensitive. . . . I’ll be at my mother’s for a few days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Kintisch is a reporter for Science magazine, and has also written for Slate, Discover, MIT Technology Review and The New Republic. He has worked as Washington correspondent for the Forward and science reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. In 2005 he won the Space Journalism prize for a series on private spaceflight. His new book, Hack the Planet, will be available April 19, and was just excerpted by Wired online.

I happen to know that this is a good show because, y’see, I’m in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, kinda. It’s an astronomy show, and they have lots of astronomers on talking about astronomy and astronomical things, including astronomers (I get paid every time I use the word &amp;quot;astronomer&amp;quot; I may have neglected to mention). So I will sometimes pop up when they decide that the other astronomers are too serious and interesting, and then I’ll talk about the end of the world or some other topic I’m typecast in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first episode is &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Collisions&lt;/em&gt; (see?) and I’m pretty sure I’m in that one. I filmed a bunch of green-screen interviews last year with them, talking about gamma-ray bursts. Colliding neutron stars came up, so given the title, I think I’ll be in it at some point gesticulating a lot and using words like &lt;em&gt;vast&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;titanic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And before you ask, no, this is not the Sooper Sekrit Project. If it were, I would have titled this post something obscure, like &lt;em&gt;The Sooper Sekrit Project revealed&lt;/em&gt; or some such. I’ll tell you more about that when I am legally obligated to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, &amp;quot;Known Universe&amp;quot; premiers tonight at 8:00 (check your local listings). If you love it, please feel free to leave a comment. If you hate it, then &lt;a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=unicorn+rainbow"&gt;try here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I was keeping tab on what others are saying: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/science_journalismcommunicatio.php" title=""&gt;Science Journalism/Communication week in review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/science_journalism_must-reads.php" title=""&gt;Science Journalism must-reads of the day&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/new_blog_on_science_journalism.php" title=""&gt;New blog on science journalism and communication&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/todays_must-reads_on_science_c.php" title=""&gt;Today's must-reads on science communication/journalism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/crowdsourcing_honesty_and_trus.php" title=""&gt;Crowdsourcing Honesty and Trust&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a post-publication peer-review of a paper about science blogging - &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/science_blogs_and_public_engag.php" title=""&gt;Science blogs and public engagement with science&lt;/a&gt; and collected some responses to that in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/more_on_science_blogs_and_publ.php" title=""&gt;More on 'Science blogs and public engagement with science'&lt;/a&gt;. That issue of Journal of Science Communication (Open Access) is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/the_new_issue_of_journal_of_sc.php" title=""&gt;now online&lt;/a&gt; so you can check out other papers there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this post, I think, is quite interesting: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/on_organizing_andor_participat.php" title=""&gt;On organizing and/or participating in a Conference in the age of Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was also a month of numerous local events. Of those, I went to and blogged about &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/ignite_raleigh_2_and_tedxrtp_-.php" title=""&gt;Ignite Raleigh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/tedxrtp.php" title=""&gt;TEDxRTP&lt;/a&gt; and the DPAC production of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/spring_awakening.php" title=""&gt;Spring Awakening&lt;/a&gt;. And it was generally a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/week_in_review.php" title=""&gt;busy time for me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was on radio again, discussing &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/how_to_organize_an_interactive.php" title=""&gt;How to organize an Interactive Conference&lt;/a&gt;. I also asked you to do something for me: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/the_online_news_association_me.php" title=""&gt;The Online News Association meeting - vote for my panel&lt;/a&gt;. And then I appeared, for the first time in my life, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/we_got_cartooned.php" title=""&gt;in a cartoon&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/researchblogging_awards_2010.php" title=""&gt;ResearchBlogging.org Awards were announced&lt;/a&gt; and I was among the winners - check them all out. And since one of the categories I won in was 'Biology' and my biology posts are scattered all over the archives, I put them &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/best_biology_posts_on_a_blog_a.php" title=""&gt;all together in one easy-to-find place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Laboratory 2009 was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/second_review_of_open_laborato.php" title=""&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; at BoingBoing. And we have &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/you_can_now_start_submitting_y.php" title=""&gt;started collecting submissions&lt;/a&gt; for the 2010 edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work-wise, I announced the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/plos_one_blog_pick_of_the_mont_5.php" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE Blog Pick of the Month&lt;/a&gt; and also announced the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/new_user_functionality_at_plos.php" title=""&gt;new user functionality at PLoS - referenced PDFs via Pubget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following ScienceOnline2010, I started &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;interviewing&lt;/a&gt; some of the participants. In March, I posted Q&amp;amp;As with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_11.php" title=""&gt;Andrea Novicki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_12.php" title=""&gt;Andrew Thaler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_13.php" title=""&gt;Mark MacAllister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_14.php" title=""&gt;Andrew Farke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_15.php" title=""&gt;Robin Ann Smith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_16.php" title=""&gt;Christine Ottery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_17.php" title=""&gt;DeLene Beeland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_18.php" title=""&gt;Russ Williams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_19.php" title=""&gt;Patty Gainer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_20.php" title=""&gt;John McKay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_21.php" title=""&gt;Mary Jane Gore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_22.php" title=""&gt;Ivan Oransky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_23.php" title=""&gt;Diana Gitig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_24.php" title=""&gt;Dennis Meredith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_25.php" title=""&gt;Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_26.php" title=""&gt;Misha Angrist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_27.php" title=""&gt;Jonathan Eisen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/the_best_of_march_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/UhXsqImEK-4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270143653509"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=30859">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ee624863ab27f75c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="fred shapiro"/><category term="quotes"/><title type="html">Quotes Uncovered: The Curious Cat</title><published>2010-04-01T17:30:45Z</published><updated>2010-04-01T17:30:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/fWbwgnIXUOw/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/quotes-uncovered-the-curious-cat/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">In this world there nothing is certain but death and misquotation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus has produced a new DVD resource to help churches respond to the  claims of new atheists like Richard Dawkins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘God: new evidence’ features Christian academics, including John  Polkinghorne, former Professor of Mathematical Physics at Cambridge  University, David Wilkinson, Principal of St John’s College, Durham, and  Rodney Holder of The Faraday Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They shed light on some of the developments in science in the last  half century that support the theory that the creation of the universe  and earth has been designed, contrary to the claims of new atheists that  it was a random change of events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producer David Couchman, said: “Dawkins claims that God is a delusion  and that religious faith is evil. But what if the scientific evidence  itself is telling a different story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the past fifty years, scientists have uncovered a series of  remarkable facts which show that the creation is an extremely unlikely  place, fine-tuned in many specific ways that make human life possible.  It shows all the signs that it has been purposefully designed as a place  for us to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve made ‘God: new evidence’ as a series of videos about these  remarkable discoveries that point us towards the Creator’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what’s the harm of organizations like Templeton and BioLogos, you ask? Just read the above.  They are enablers of woo, ultimately devoted to the idea that science proves superstition.  There’s no difference between their mischief and the blather of homeopaths and astrologers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s weird, you know, that—in the absence of evidence for God—the faithful always claim that even looking for such evidence is a misguided strategy. But whenever they think they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; some evidence, as with the so-called “fine tuning” of physical constants, they’re not hesitant to use it.  It reminds me of the intercessory prayer study.  When the study found no evidence that prayer speeded healing, the faithful dismissed that study as wrongheaded, but had the evidence come up positive, they would have trumpeted it to the skies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polkinghorne, of course, was a recipient of the Templeton Prize;  Rodney  Holder not only participated in a Templeton “Humble Approach”  conference on &lt;a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=205"&gt;“Multiverses  and String Theory,”&lt;/a&gt; but also wrote a paper on miracles that won a &lt;a href="http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/faraday/Biography.php?ID=19"&gt;Templeton  Foundation Prize&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find all the videos &lt;a href="http://www.focus.org.uk/?page_id=101"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I can’t bear to watch them; perhaps a stalwart reader will report?&lt;/p&gt;

Often, as in a recent editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, the argument is made that money collected through the tax could then be used to subsidize healthier foods.  This is an idea that I&amp;#39;ve found very appealing - we make the bad foods more expensive, the good foods less expensive, and people will probably shift at least some of their purchases to those healthier options.  But a very interesting new study by Leonard Epstein and colleagues suggests that things might not be so simple....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As I tugged my suitcase across the foyer of the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, I remembered the last time I visited the venue, about three years ago. The touring MindBodySpirit Festival—gleefully dubbed the Mind, Body, Wallet Festival on The Skeptic Zone podcast—is held annually in one of their large exhibition halls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back then I was so nervous of the sellers and psychics touting their goods, I spent the entire time pretending to text furiously on my mobile phone. By the time I was approached by a glossy-as-a-pamphlet promoter touting the pseudoscientific claims of the “cure for autism” Dore company, I was so hyped-up by the tension of being discovered as a skeptically minded tourist that I fled to the Amnesty International stand and begged them to show me the exit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This time, however, the venue was dominated by the Global Atheist Convention. It’s for rationalists, atheists, secularists, humanists … and maybe skeptics? I wasn’t quite so sure of that last one. I’m slightly more sure now that it’s finished, but I’m still (pardon the horrid pun) skeptical about whether skeptic groups have potentially as much impact on public perception of rationalism and the promotion of critical thinking…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Head to my article at&lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_token_skeptic_at_the_rise_of_atheism_global_atheist_convention/"&gt; ‘Curiouser and Curiouser’&lt;/a&gt; to read the rest!&lt;br&gt;

Today, the British organization &lt;a href="http://www.beatingbowelcancer.org/"&gt;Beating Bowel Cancer&lt;/a&gt; launched its &lt;a href="http://www.beatingbowelcancer.org/CheekyWarning/"&gt;Cheeky Warning&lt;/a&gt; awareness campaign, in an effort to educate  Britons about early warnings and symptoms. It’s the second-leading  cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.K., but it’s also a serious problem on our side of the pond, where it’s known as colon cancer. Over here, it’s the third leading cancer-killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With upbeat music and a lengthy discussion of bums (bottoms, not homeless people), this Cheeky Warning video aims to educate people and get them more comfortable talking about fannies, poop, and bowels. It may not be &lt;em&gt;Notting Hill&lt;/em&gt;, but it’s almost as entertaining as watching Hugh Grant fall all over himself in front of Julia Roberts. Leave it to the Brits to make colon cancer cute.&lt;/p&gt;

But even I think &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/03/31/saudi.arabia.sorcery/index.html"&gt;beheading is a bit severe&lt;/a&gt; for such nonsense. Apparently, though, the religious loons who run Saudi Arabia disagree:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Amnesty International is calling on Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah to stop the execution of a Lebanese man sentenced to death for "sorcery."

&lt;p&gt;In a statement released Thursday, the international rights group condemned the verdict and demanded the immediate release of Ali Hussain Sibat, former host of a popular call-in show that aired on Sheherazade, a Beirut based satellite TV channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to his lawyer, Sibat, who is 48 and has five children, would predict the future on his show and give out advice to his audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attorney, May El Khansa, who is in Lebanon, tells CNN her client was arrested by Saudi Arabia's religious police (known as the Mutawa'een) and charged with sorcery while visiting the country in May 2008. Sibat was in Saudi Arabia to perform the Islamic religious pilgrimage known as Umra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Arab News, an English language Saudi daily newspaper, after the most recent verdict was issued, the judges in Medina issued a statement expressing that Sibat deserved to be executed for having continually practiced black magic on his show, adding that this sentence would deter others from practicing sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/03/31/saudi.arabia.sorcery/index.html"&gt;Yesterday, an execution date was set for Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbaric. That's the only word that comes to mind to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How should "psychics" bet treated? Mockery, yes, absolutely!. Shutting psychics down so that they don't defraud people, yes. Cutting their heads off over a silly superstition? What is this, the Dark Ages? Children will lose their father over a nonsensical superstition for a "crime" he apparently didn't even commit &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Saudi Arabia! I don't know what's more depressing, though, the barbarism of the Saudis or the approval that some Americans demonstrate. Check out the comments, for instance from someone going by the 'nym LifeinVA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;OK, so I don't think socerey is real and this guy should not be beheaded. HOWEVER, the Saudi's know how to deal with their criminals. I was stationed in Saudia Arabia many years ago and watched a number of these beheadings. You see one of these and you will NEVER want to commit a crime...now that's effective law enforcement!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure that LiveinVA went to "a number of" these beheadings out of an academic interest and not because of a fascination with blood and gore. And then there's HobbitJeff (defiling one of my favorite sets of novels of all time with his idiocy):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Good for the Saudis. If you're going to pretend to be able to read the future and bilk the gullible, be prepared for the consequences. Now if we could do the same for the reprehensible "psychics" here in the US.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One wonders whom else HobbitJeff would like to behead. Before we start feeling to superior to the barbaric system in Saudi Arabia that would execute someone for witchcraft, we should look at our own bloodthirsty loons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/thats_a_bit_much_dont_you_think_saudi_ar.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/zKU5qICpLVE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270138368738"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/observations/2010/04/domesticated_dummies.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/920b580ee85eb223</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Does Domestication Produce Dummies?</title><published>2010-04-01T11:08:40Z</published><updated>2010-04-01T11:08:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/naUh9FV-vyU/domesticated_dummies.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/observations/2010/04/domesticated_dummies.php"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Domestication is by far man's greatest genetic experiment, and we've been at it for well over 10,000 years. While domestication can produce wild variation (see my post on dogs, for example), a few changes seem to be universal. These include behavioral changes, like reduced fear of humans and friendliness, as well as physiological ones, like floppy ears (they develop in domesticated foxes, too). One of the most well-documented differences between domesticated animals and their wild counterparts is their brains: across every species that has been looked at, the brains of domesticated animals are smaller. Why does domestication lead to shrinking brains? And what does this mean in terms of intelligence?

Needless to say, fire ants have adapted well in southern states like Texas, Louisiana and Florida, disrupting native wildlife and plants and causing problems for people ranging from shorting out street lights to stinging limbs.

But in the late 1990s and early 2000s, scientists brought over several strains of parasitoid flies from Argentina in an attempt to naturally eradicate the fire ants. A scientist recently found that one particular fly strain may be able to completely wipe out fire ants in northern Florida....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Prairie dogs have been generally regarded as a danger to cattle by ranchers and removed through poisoning or other means. Overgrazing can lead to desertification, further threatening these animals. But that&amp;#39;s a relatively new trend in a long and complex history of interaction between prairie dogs and megaherbivores like cattle....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Our species is just one branch of a withering part of the evolutionary tree, the great apes. Along with the handful of species of chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans, we are all that is left of the hominids, and considering the threats our close relatives face we could very soon be the only great apes left. It has not always been this way. During the swath of prehistory ~23-5 million years ago known as the Miocene a variety of ape species inhabited forests through much of Africa, Europe, and Asia, and a new study published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B looks at what the teeth of three fossil apes from Europe might tell us about their diets.

&lt;p&gt;But he wrote something today I had a problem with.  He had on his website &lt;a href="http://donmilleris.com/2010/03/31/ten-reasons-pastors-are-important/"&gt;a list of reasons pastors are important&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
1. They lead social movements that change the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. They speak truths that create guardrails to keep us out of danger and stop us from hurting each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. They introduce us and remind us about God, who redeems us and guides us in love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. They model good marriages and families (Your mind may have gone to an exception, but quickly list five who do. It’s an easy list to create.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. They bring people together to live and work in community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. They counsel hurting and broken people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. They bring the presence of God into the most dark and painful circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Most of them could be making lots more money doing something else, but they sacrifice to build God’s kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. They put up with our crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. Because without them the world would be unimaginably dark.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go through the list…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1 may be true, but it’s true for anyone who has a lot of “followers” — when people are listening to you, whether you’re a pastor, blogger, teacher, entrepreneur, or celebrity, you have the power to create social change.  Pastors aren’t special in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2 is completely wrong.  Their “truths” are often opinions or lies and they can do more harm than good.  You think what some pastors have to say about gay people has &lt;em&gt;helped&lt;/em&gt; that group?  You think what some pastors have to say about evolution have made our science classes &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#3 Christian theology aside, I can thank my parents and friends for those things as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#4 Some pastors have good marriages.  Some don’t.  Just like everybody else.  It’s not unique to the profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#5 And &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/jobs/ct-met-world-relief-20100531,0,5402848,full.story"&gt;exclude people&lt;/a&gt; who don’t think like them.  Hell, some churches have “Christian Yellow Pages” so you can restrict your business dealings with only other Christians… because everyone else is unworthy?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#6 Many pastors do counsel hurting and broken people (many, without any formal training).  But also doing that: Good friends, trusted colleagues, and professional counselors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#7 In other words, they offer false hope.  Some people like that.  I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#8 It’s true that most pastors don’t get paid much.  But neither do teachers and I’d argue they sacrifice just as much of their time and make a far bigger difference in the lives of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#9 I’m sure they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#10 That’s not true.  I can imagine a world without pastors and it’s perfectly sunny and fine to me.  What we need are good friends and a tight-knit community.  You don’t need a church or a pastor for either of those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear: Some pastors do amazing things and they really do help the people they shepherd.  I’ve met several of them.  (Hell, a terrific one posts on this website.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while some pastors may do very positive things, let’s not forget that they do a lot of awful things as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked people on Twitter and Facebook what pastors did that they disliked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responses were very interesting and some go completely against what Miller said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some pastors preach in favor of Creationism and Intelligent Design, both of which go against the face of all the evidence and the wisdom of professional scientists.  They dumb our society down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some pastors preach against homosexuality and homosexuals. This, in turn, spurs prejudice against perfectly fine people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some pastors view non-believers as a challenge, instead of just accepting us as we are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some pastors beg for money which is in turn used to further their lavish lifestyles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some pastors teach that women &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/24/women-not-allowed-to-speak-during-church-vote/"&gt;should not do certain things&lt;/a&gt; men can do (even though they could do them equally as well).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some pastors pretend to know what God thinks even when their guess is as good as anyone else’s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some pastors rape little kids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some pastors cherry pick parts of the Bible to support their own agenda and ignore the more barbaric, disturbing parts altogether&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some pastors impose a perverse set of sexual morals (and, in some cases, don’t live up to them themselves).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some pastors spread misinformation about sex, abortion, politics, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some pastors get involved in politics while illegally trying to maintain their church’s tax-exempt status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some pastors offer “spiritual guidance” when they’re really just offering platitudes (e.g. “We know that God is in control”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some pastors think that the plural of anecdote is fact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose it’s not all bad.  Some pastors get people to eventually leave the church &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Care to add to the list?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Christie Wilcox, my newest SciBling here (three blogs to the left, then around the corner) at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/observations/" title=""&gt;Observations of a Nerd&lt;/a&gt; to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I'm coming from geographically... That's a long story. I always love getting asked where I'm from, because it's such a fun answer to give. Since I always get asked this after the spiel I'm about to give, no, my family wasn't in the military - they just liked to move a lot. I was born in Boston, but my parents moved to Hawaii when I was too young to remember. Then they divorced a handful of years later, and my mom took me and my brother with her when she moved to Vermont. I spent much of my childhood bouncing back and forth, my winters in New England, and my summers in Hawaii, until my dad moved to California and bounced around there. And then moved to England. And then back to California. I went to a boarding school in Massachusetts for high school, then Florida for my undergrad, and now I've managed to wiggle my way back to Hawaii for my PhD. I spent about 5 years in each place so far, with a combined total of 14 different places to live (counting boarding school as only one, although the room and building changed every year, and not counting the 26 or so places my dad has moved to that I would visit). I even sound all over the place - I say "karaoke" with a Japanese accent, "Hawai'i" like a local, and "y'alls" with a Southern twang. To me, "home" is wherever I am at, and wherever the people I love are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for philosophically, l am first and foremost a biologist. I like to say that I've been a biologist my whole life, although it wasn't official until I received my undergraduate degree in Marine Science from Eckerd College in 2007. When I was a kid, I loved whatever animals I could find. I can distinctly remember early-morning gecko hunts with my dad, where I would go out in the yard and turn over every object I was capable of to find geckos. I have a report from my school when I was five where the evaluator specifically mentions my affinity for opening geckos' mouths to look at their tongues. Seriously. I can show it to you. I had hedgehogs for pets as a kid, because, you know, a dog and a cat weren't odd enough to keep me entertained. Of course, I kinda forgot this along the way, and in high school I didn't know what the heck I was supposed to do, so I did a little of everything. I directed a play, did an independent study in Hawaiian history, and took AP Physics. I really blame my physics teacher, Brian Giannino-Racine, for most of what I've become. He did the most blasphemous thing: he made science - and not just any science, but physics - seem like something fun and interesting to study. I liked his classes so much, I figured I could become a physicist, and, technically, that is what I started with when I got to Eckerd - a double major in Physics and Marine Science. It only took one advanced physics class to change my mind, but the passion for science in general that he brought out in me remained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although "biologist" sounds good, the truth is that biology is a huge field filled with a million different lines of work. As my time as an undergrad came to a close, I still hadn't really found my niche. I felt like I had to pick something - behavioral biologist, molecular biologist, etc, and I had no idea what I wanted to pick. Instead of applying to grad schools right away, and committing myself for five or more years to a project I was unsure of, I took a couple years to think about my options while working as a biochemist in a research lab in Florida. Finally, I came to the conclusion that a five year old me would have found obvious, which is that I should do whatever I like to do most, and so I ended up where I am now, in Hawaii pursuing my PhD (which though on paper is in "Cell and Molecular Biology," is really in "Playing with Ocean Creatures"). As a career, I am forced to do the kinds of things that most people spend lots of money to be able to do. I have to live in paradise, and must dive all the time as a part of my job. I am forced to travel all over the Pacific to help others in sample collection, to places like the Marquesas, Kiribati and American Samoa. I even might have to go to conferences in places like Thailand and South Africa to present my work to others. Isn't being a biologist absolutely dreadful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Christie Wilcox pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Christie%20Wilcox%20pic.jpg" width="448" height="336" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After biologist in my self-descriptive terms comes writer. I love to write. I've always liked writing - I was that weird kid that everyone hated because I actually enjoyed essays in school. I wrote all the time, whether for school or just for myself. I used to think I would publish a book about my life someday. Actually, I still think that, but now for different reasons. Anyhow, I blog because I love to write, and by the time I graduated from Eckerd I had stopped doing a lot of that. I only wrote what I had to, and I had forgotten my love for it. When my friend &lt;a href="http://ohfortheloveofscience.com/" title=""&gt;Allie&lt;/a&gt; told me she had to write a blog for a class she was taking, I thought, damn, that's a good idea. And thus &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/observations" title=""&gt;Observations of a Nerd&lt;/a&gt; was born. I wanted a place where I could write about what I loved, and maybe some other people would like to hear about it, too. Logically, most of what I write about it biological in nature, but I get sidetracked every once in awhile. My writing career is in its infancy compared to my "real" one, but I love them both. Now, if only I could find the time to do them both as well as live a normal life...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think everything I do is interesting, but others might disagree. Along the way I have done a number of internships and volunteering that have given me a unique set of experiences. In retrospect, I remember them by the animals they brought me in contact with. For example, I learned that spotted eagle rays feel like puppies when they gently nibble shrimp off your hands, thanks to volunteer work I did at the Florida Aquarium. Cownose rays, on the other hand, feel like sand-papery vacuum cleaners. I worked an entire summer in Mote Marine Laboratory's sea turtle program, where I walked up and down the beaches of Sarasota, flagging, protecting, and even moving turtle nests. During that time, I got to hold and care for at least fifty baby sea turtles, who are, officially, the cutest things that nature has ever produced (sorry, baby fennec foxes). Let's see, what else have I done... Oo! I once helped electrically ejaculate an anesthetized river otter. That's always the best story. People make the funniest faces when I talk about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I'm working on my PhD. I want to study lionfish. They're a nasty invasive species in the Caribbean, yet here in Hawaii, one of the many places in the Indo-Pacific where they are native to, they're almost impossible to find. No one really knows anything about the entire group of these animals. My goals are to understand a bit about the evolution of the group as a whole and, more specifically, their populations here to determine if their distribution patterns can give us any insights in the Atlantic. Furthermore, I want to study their venom, learn what it contains and how it works, and maybe give people some incentive to fish them in their invasive habitats. Mostly, though, I think I just want to spend a lot of time underwater looking for the buggers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, my goals are to get that PhD, and with it go on to some post-docs, and eventually, settle in somewhere as a researcher or a researcher/professor. The details are still fuzzy, but somewhere along the lines I'll end up with a family and publishing a book or two. Hey - I'm only 24! I've got a lot of time left to figure out the particulars :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging is something I do for fun. I find little tid bits of science interesting, and being the ever-talkative extrovert that I am, I want to tell other people about them. If you have met me in person, my blog makes perfect sense. Reading a blog post if mine is what it is like to spend 15 minutes having a conversation with me about something I'm passionate about (including it being mostly me talking. I talk a lot. And fast.), although the blog post is probably a little more grammatically correct. I love to share what I care about with others. That's why I worked on the education and public outreach side of many of my science endeavors. Blogging is my way of doing that when I don't have the time to volunteer for five hours a day in an aquarium or a zoo. I think everyone would find science cool if only more people would explain it better, which is something, I think, that I can do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as other outlets go, I have to confess: I've become somewhat of an addict to social networking. They're great ways to pass information around. I do it all now - &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/NerdyChristie" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/christielynn" title=""&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.networkedblogs.com/blog/observations_of_a_nerd" title=""&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, etc. I get a lot of news and ideas for my blogging from the world of social networking I have created around myself. As for whether that's a good thing... you'll have to get a trained psychologist to answer that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any cool &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Participants_Blogroll/" title=""&gt;science blogs by the participants&lt;/a&gt; at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first discovered science blogs back in 2008 when I started blogging. Last time I counted, I follow 80+ science blogs on my Google Reader... so I like a lot of them! Some of my personal favorite writers include &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/" title=""&gt;Brian Switek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia" title=""&gt;Scicurious&lt;/a&gt;, those crazy &lt;a href="http://deepseanews.com/" title=""&gt;Deep Sea&lt;/a&gt; folks Kevin, Craig and Miriam, the &lt;a href="http://www.southernfriedscience.com/" title=""&gt;other ocean trio&lt;/a&gt; Andrew, Amy and David, and of course, &lt;a href="http://ohfortheloveofscience.com/" title=""&gt;Allie&lt;/a&gt;, since she's the one to blame for getting me into this whole thing. But I have to give special note to Ed Yong and his blog &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience" title=""&gt;Not Exactly Rocket Science&lt;/a&gt;. His was one of the first blogs I began reading, and I see NERS as a kind of model to strive for (with my own flare, of course). I was honored to even be considered for two of the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/03/23/research-blog-of-the-year/" title=""&gt;Research Blogging Awards that he ended up winning&lt;/a&gt; - the idea that he and I might have anything in common is, to me, a huge, probably underserved, compliment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh. And there's also that silly Bora guy, of course. Though, I think anyone reading this already knows who he is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a number of new blogs to read through the conference - like the kids from the &lt;a href="http://missbakersbiologyclass.com/blog/" title=""&gt;Extreme Biology Blog&lt;/a&gt;. They simply blew my mind this year. I wish I'd have been that smart and driven at that age... I can't even imagine where I'd be now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part, for me, was meeting all the people I only knew by name or pseudonym. There's something about putting a face or a voice to the words you read that makes them seem even better. Meeting all of the people I admire and read was a treat, and getting to know new people I'd never even heard of was icing on the cake.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think what I took with me from the conference wasn't as much a specific quote or idea as it was... dedication. I blog for fun, as anyone who blogs should, but I also blog to say something that I think is important, and the conference really instilled in me a sense of urgency to write these things that I think matter in a way that matters. It's as if the conference pushed me from being just a blogger to being a writer and a journalist, too. I feel like it's more than just for me now. It's for everyone who reads Observations of a Nerd, or follows me on twitter. It's for a larger community of science writers and educators. And because of that, I am continually trying to improve what I do, whether that means &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/observations/2010/02/how-twitter-made-me-into-a-citizen-journalist.php" title=""&gt;live tweeting a tsunami&lt;/a&gt;, explaining something complicated in a better way, or finding a creature that is atypically cute to draw attention to an animal that others might not think to care about. Science Online 2010 revitalized my passion for all of it! I can only hope I can make it out again next year, and every year after that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as suggestions go, make it longer! I want more time with more people! I didn't even meet half the people that went, and I really would have liked to get to know everyone better and learn more about their projects, ideas and what they do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to finally meet you in person and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aloha,&lt;br&gt;
Christie&lt;/p&gt;

I’m very interested in how they’re coming along . . . you can follow the progress on the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=111011592249703&amp;amp;ref=ts"&gt;Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; or on some YouTube channels like &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4JcvLndzFs"&gt;SkepticallyPwned&lt;/a&gt;, who really brought the emotion, and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF89S4ebKbU&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;Hayley Stevens&lt;/a&gt; who FYI is adorable. I’ll post another blog entry to publicize their results (and any others I find with good controls) when they’re finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my own experiment, I used three pieces of the same apple: one was spoken to lovingly, one with hate, and one with neutral statements (“the control apple of indifference”). If we assume that any three pieces of apple will decompose at varying rates, we could assume that each apple has a &lt;strong&gt;1/3 chance&lt;/strong&gt; of producing the desired result, so by chance alone we’d expect to see one apple of our three correspond. If Nikki Owens’ theory was correct, though, we would expect that 3 out of 3 apples would correspond, meaning that the love apple would look the best, the hate apple would look the worst, and the neutral apple would be somewhere in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on to discover if that’s what happened. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I posted my first video, many people offered adjustments to the study in order to control for all variables. These included sterilizing the knife and cutting board to ensure no microbes would transfer to one piece but not another, and holding each jar for the same amount of time to control for variations caused by the transfer of heat from my hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting thing to me was how many of Nikki Owens’ fans offered adjustments, too. They suggested I use “love” and “hate” labels instead of mustaches, because mustaches are inherently funny and would cause the hate apple to “feel” better. They also suggested that I should use halves instead of quarters (because that’s what Owens did), and that I get angrier at the hate apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re absolutely right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us might laugh at the idea that mustaches instead of labels might affect the mood of an apple, because let’s face it, that’s completely absurd. The apple slices couldn’t even &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the mustaches. If they’d had eyes. But think of it this way: these people, who bought into Owens’ story without question, were questioning me in a very skeptical way. Owens didn’t record her process, or even note how she prepared the apples and jars. She also didn’t acknowledge the statistics involved: with two apple halves, there is near 100% certainty that they will decompose in unique ways, which means that there’s a 50% chance that the “love” apple will look better than the “hate” apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My on-call mathematician &lt;a href="http://www.standupmaths.com/"&gt;Matt Parker&lt;/a&gt; commented on this statistical quirk, saying, “when people have done the ‘positive words’ experiment at home with two halves of an apple, 50% of people have gotten a strong ‘positive’ result, and 50% a strong ‘negative’. It’s not hard to guess which half went rushing to upload their photos and which half thought they might try it again. It explains the supply of seemingly supporting photos of apples halves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that my experiment was much better than Owens’ because I described my process, considered the variables, used a control, and publicized every step. But as many people pointed out, my experiment was far from perfect. Even after I &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/03/the-great-apple-experiment-time-to-weigh-in/"&gt;posted the photos here on Skepchick&lt;/a&gt; and asked you all to tell me which apple looked the best and which looked the worst, you all quite rightfully pointed out that there were too many shadows in the pics and that each apple slice should have been shot with direct light, preferably from multiple angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s awesome that so many of you and so many of Owens’ fans are thinking about this admittedly silly experiment in a critical manner, because it exposes exactly how much the press and believers missed when Owens presented her “results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I’ll be repeating the experiment next week with all the controls suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first: on to the results!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;Your votes were, according to Matt, were quite conclusive on both polls:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img title="Which apple looks the worst" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Picture-1.png" alt="Which apple looks the worst? Apple 1: 40% Apple 2: 50% Apple 3: 10% 1,238 votes total" width="389" height="134"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Which apple looks the best" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Picture-2.png" alt="Which apple looks the best? Apple 1: 16% Apple 2: 12% Apple 3: 72% 1,100 votes total" width="435" height="135"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll quote Matt’s results in full so you can see the statistics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to do much maths to see that Apple 3 has a mighty big bar. I’ve still crunched the numbers and your confidence value is off the proverbial chart. (Also: the literal chart. Yes, I drew a chart. It was off it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both cases, Apple 3 definitely is the best (or least worst). There is a zero chance this is by chance, either it does look the best or everyone is playing a trick on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then discounted damn Apple 3 and just looked at Apples 1 and 2. In both cases the difference between them is “very significant” in a statistical sense. Your voters had a very definite preference for Apple 1 looking better than Apple 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to stick some numbers on it, if Apple 1 and 2 actually did look identical and voters were just picking at random which looks best, there is only a 0.36% chance you would that difference in votes (anything below 0.5% is “very significant”).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt has offered to write more about the statistics for a future post, for you math geeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically what this means is that Apple #3 looks the best, Apple #2 looks the worst, and Apple #1 is somewhere between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though my photos weren’t ideal, I will say I photographed each slice in the same place under the same lighting, and I’ll also mention that your results mirror my own in-person notes. Apple #3 was just about as discolored as the other two but had no mold spores. Apple #1 had a spot of mold, and Apple #2 definitely had the most mold and the most discoloration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_1519.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_1519-300x225.jpg" alt="Apple 1: HATE, Apple 2: INDIFFERENT, Apple 3: LOVE" title="Apples" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly what we’d expect by chance! &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Apple3FULL.jpg"&gt;Apple #3&lt;/a&gt;, voted the best looking, was in fact the love apple. But the control apple, which received no love and no hate, was &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Apple2FULL.jpg"&gt;Apple #2&lt;/a&gt;, voted the worst looking. The hate apple, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Apple1FULL.jpg"&gt;Apple #1&lt;/a&gt;, was somewhere in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion? The experiment failed to prove Nikki Owens’ hypothesis that saying loving or hateful things to an apple will affect its rate of decay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; The Case for Changing Our Pronunciation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its December 2009 meeting, the APS Board of Directors was unanimous in support of a proposal by the APS Pronunciation Committee to change how we say the words &lt;em&gt;psychology&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;psychological&lt;/em&gt; (and &lt;em&gt;psychologist&lt;/em&gt;) to include the initial "p" sound. In keeping with APS bylaws, such a change in pronunciation needs to be decided by a vote of our membership. If approved, members would be required, or at least strongly encouraged, to pronounce the "p" sound in the name of our science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;puh&lt;/strong&gt;-sy-&lt;strong&gt;kol&lt;/strong&gt;-uh-jee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The word &lt;em&gt;psychology&lt;/em&gt; has a long and hallowed tradition&lt;/strong&gt;, having been coined in the 16th Century by the German theologian Melanchthon based on the Latin &lt;em&gt;psychologia&lt;/em&gt;, meaning"study of the breath" - exactly what the word means for today's researchers. From then until early in the last century, the initial phoneme in &lt;em&gt;psychology&lt;/em&gt; was said aloud. Psycholinguists speculate that nonpronunciation of the "p" can be traced to none other than James McKeen Cattell, who idiosyncratically left the sound off, and to his students and colleagues, who imitated his affected way of saying &lt;em&gt;psychology&lt;/em&gt; in the hope of posthumously getting a Cattell sabbatical award. Thus the silent "p" has its origins in sycophantism, much like the Castilian lisp. Since Cattell's time, the "p" has remained silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, increasingly the trend among both professionals in the field and laypeople alike is to once again pronounce the "p," and the APS initiative represents an attempt to keep our relatively young organization in step with the times. This change would also better distinguish our Association from other organizations whose members continue, anachronistically (and, we think, pretentiously), to leave the "p" silent. In the halls of psychology departments, and at meetings, it will no longer be difficult to tell who is a member of which organization: How you pronounce &lt;em&gt;psychology&lt;/em&gt; will be like a badge of loyalty: &lt;strong&gt;Are you a scientist or are you … something else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And there is a final, long-term consideration&lt;/strong&gt;. The trend in written English is toward simplification of spellings to conform to how words are commonly pronounced. Witness the words plow (formerly plough), catalog (formerly catalogue), and the increasingly common CUL8R ("see you later"). If this trend continues and English speakers continue to leave the "p" silent, the time may soon come when &lt;em&gt;psychology&lt;/em&gt; is spelled sykolojy. Our acronym would then become ASS. Nobody wants that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we respectfully submit, let's look again at the pronunciation of our Association's middle name. Think it over, members, and decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an added note, the APS Pronunciation Committee is also currently considering a motion to pronounce the first, silent "c" in &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; as a hard "c" - i.e., "skience." If approved by the committee, this proposal will also be put to a vote. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a real skientist; I have a degree in &lt;strong&gt;skience&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Further addendum: I originally didn't open this posting to comments because I feared that comments would branch off in a number of different directions, several of which have been touched on in Language Log. But a number of people have their favorite plays on "silent letters" in English spelling, so I'm opening up comments for people who want to cite some of the vast number of these.

But first, to recap: Simon was sued by the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) over an article called &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=663"&gt;Beware the Spinal Trap&lt;/a&gt; – which I and other bloggers have since reproduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The particular line of interest was Simon writing that the BCA “happily promotes bogus therapies.” The BCA contends that this implies they dishonestly promote therapies that they know do not work. This has become the first point of contention for the libel suit. Simon maintains, and this is backed up elsewhere in the article, that he never implied that and in fact BCA chiropractors are likely self-deluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of science and medicine, this is a minor point – the treatments are bogus (specifically chiropractic manipulation for childhood ailments, like colic) whether or not the BCA believes in them. But from a legal point of view, this distinction is everything. Originally a judge ruled that Simon’s line should be interpreted as saying the BCA was knowingly lying about their therapies. This would have put Simon in the position of having to prove in court that the BCA institutionally, and perhaps BCA chiropractors individually, believed that their treatments did not work. This would have been nearly impossible, and many feared that Simon may have lost his case on a technical point about definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well – Simon appealed that original ruling, was granted the right to appeal, and now the higher court has just ruled that the original ruling was in error. The new ruling, in essence, says that Simon’s statement were an expression of his opinion, not a fact of the state of belief of BCA chiropractors. Therefore Simon can use the “fair comment” defense. This puts him in a very good position to win the overall case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three important issues at stake with this trial. The first is the easiest as it is a scientific question – is there evidence to support the use of chiropractic manipulation for childhood ailments, like ear infections, colic, and bed wetting. The answer to this question is a clear no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reviewed the evidence for these claims &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=555"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; In my article I also discuss the fact that the BCA put out a statement listing the evidence they believed supported their treatments. The list contained many irrelevant references, and also excluded many negative studies. What the BCA provided, however, was evidence to support the notion that they in fact do promote treatments they know to be bogus, because they could not provide evidence to support their treatments and they ignored evidence which shows their treatments do not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second issue is the use of libel suits to silence public discourse on important scientific subjects. This case has become a signature case for this issue – and science journalists and bloggers are paying close attention. In the UK in particular it is easy to silence criticism or open discussion by the threat of lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third issue, which is related to the second, is that the libel laws in England are out of step with the rest of Europe and Western countries. Specifically it is much more expensive to defend a libel case – 140 times as expensive as the European average. &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8598472.stm"&gt;Simon reports&lt;/a&gt; that it cost him 200,000 pounds to determine the meaning of his single phrase – and he is not through yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unreasonable expense means that even successfully defending a libel case can be financially ruinous. It allows deep pockets to intimidate individuals or small publishers. And it also creates libel tourism, where people from around the world will file libel cases in England in order drag their targets into the ruinously expensive English courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientifically the BCA is on thin ice, and they have already been exposed as charlatans. Further, this is a significant victory for Simon in this specific libel case, and I am optimistic that he will prevail in the overall case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the bigger battle is to reform the libel laws in England as they are a menace to free speech and the necessary free exchange of ideas that science requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Simon has doggedly continued to defend his case specifically to use it as a platform for lobbying for libel reform. A &lt;a href="http://www.libelreform.org/"&gt;libel reform campaign &lt;/a&gt;is now in full swing. The fight is not over.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270132233441"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-488262047686109051.post-5294116909573635863">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3db73ad7211b1827</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Appeal upheld in Singh vs BCA - a significant victory for Simon, the libel reform campaign and free speech</title><published>2010-04-01T12:44:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-01T12:44:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://teekblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/appeal-upheld-in-singh-vs-bca.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>teekblog</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270131398306"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=13172">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f2e39b1c7b1ee8c8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 4.1</title><published>2010-04-01T14:00:59Z</published><updated>2010-04-01T14:00:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/skepchick-quickies-4-1/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

He interviewed me for it, and I’m pleased with how it came out. Otto is one of the good guys, and one of the few in the MSM willing to take this topic on without pandering to nonsense to provide false &amp;quot;balance&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of [Plait's] latest causes has been debunking the antivax movement that he sees as dangerous. “They don’t have anything to stand on except emotions,” he says. “They play on the heartstrings, and unfortunately, people tend to listen to their emotions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says the antivax movement is having an effect. “You can see it,” he says. “The number of people getting vaccines is going down.” What he finds particularly annoying is that when things change — for example, thimerosal has been largely, although not entirely, eliminated as a preservative in vaccines — antivax groups just “move the goalposts” and claim vaccines do something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad to see this getting more press, and I’m very glad to see the antivaxxers getting hit harder and harder. Every time their garbage is aired out, a few more kids get a chance to live a life with a lower risk for preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not so sure how I feel about it...  On one hand, I think there are some positives to this, not just in terms of mindfulness about what we have, but also I think that one of the challenges to families sitting down together for a meal is if there is no delineation as to when the meal actually &lt;i&gt;starts&lt;/i&gt;, and having a pre-meal ritual can help with that.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, like many "non-joiners" (as atheists tend to be), it is not just the philosophical objections to religion that bother me; on a personal level, I just don't like the trappings most of the time.  I don't think I would like saying "grace" very much, even a purely secular one.  Also, I think it will be easy to slip into things I that I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have a philosophical objection to, e.g. we tried it last night and I refused to participate after my wife said we should bow our heads.

And the Lord, for a lark, covered the earth with a blue dome that stretched from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. And the dome caused the humidity to rise and the plants to grow without limit. And the Reptiles ate of the abundant plants and were fruitful and multiplied and every moving thing that lived was meat for them. And terrible Lizards grew to gigantic proportions and drove Man to the edges of the earth, to the wilderness of Zin, where the humidity was low. And the Lord saw that the dome was not so good and became wroth with himself and said oops.  And the Lord removed the dome, and the Lizards died (save those that were covered with feathers). And Man was fruitful and multiplied and colonized the earth, and every moving thing that lived was meat for him (except for the Pig). And God said let the sky be blue* as a token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* It is not known whether God made the sky blue at the same time as he made the rainbow.&lt;/p&gt;

But it will take an exceptional hoax to mount a serious challenge to what is arguably the finest science-themed April Fool’s joke of all time, which today celebrates its fifteenth anniversary: &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/1995/apr/01-molelike-animal-melts-ice-tunnels-with-its-head"&gt;the tale of the hotheaded naked ice borer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then-&lt;em&gt;Discover&lt;/em&gt;-senior-editor, now-contributing-editor, and forever-all-around-good-guy &lt;a href="http://timfolger.net/bio.html"&gt;Tim Folger&lt;/a&gt; concocted an article detailing the mystery of penguins vanishing from sight, and the discovery of a thermally endowed rodent that melted the ice under their feet and dragged them into their frozen tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite naming the scientist April Pazzo (I mean, come on, people), Tim fooled many a reader, as reflected in the flood of letters we received. &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/1995/apr/01-molelike-animal-melts-ice-tunnels-with-its-head"&gt;You can read the story and some letters here&lt;/a&gt;. The beast even has &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotheaded_Naked_Ice_Borer"&gt;its own Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fairness to the fooled, science is often so bizarre, it’s not always easy to distinguish the reality from the hoax. (And fortunately, this morning’s good news about &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/apr/01/simon-singh-wins-libel-court"&gt;science writer’s Simon Singh’s victory&lt;/a&gt; against chiropractors and the ridiculous libel laws of England is no joke.) So far, here the ones I’ve encountered that have made me smile…add you own in the comment thread.&lt;/p&gt;

Haldane,  a real character (check out &lt;a href="http://nsm.uh.edu/~dgraur/Texts/Cancerhaldane.htm"&gt;the poem he wrote about his rectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;) who had a terribly exciting life; but his biography, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/J-B-S-Haldane-Paperbacks/dp/0192814303"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JBS&lt;/em&gt; by Ronald Clark&lt;/a&gt;, doesn’t really lay out why he’s famous.  Or, when biographers try to do that, the writing is turgid.  I’ve dutifully endured many deadly scientific biographies, including the acclaimed &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Lord-Science-Albert-Einstein/dp/0195204387"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subtle is the Lord: the Science and Life of Albert Einstein&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Abraham Pais. I even had trouble finishing the Pulitzer-winning biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Prometheus-Triumph-Tragedy-Oppenheimer/dp/0375412026/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1270126252&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Prometheus&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, the only biography that I thought combined great writing and a full and accurate account of scientific achievement was Janet Browne’s magisterial two-volume &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Charles-Darwin-Biography-Vol-Voyaging/dp/1844133141/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1270126379&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;life of Darwin&lt;/a&gt;.  (This isn’t just my pro-evolution bias: it really is a scientific page-turner.)  But now I’ve found another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m giving two thumbs up to a splendid new life of P. A. M. Dirac (1902-1984) by Graham Farmelo: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465018270/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=0571222781&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=1SK0FS136W4NE8G4GYF4"&gt;The Strangest Man: The Hidden Life of Paul Dirac, Mystic of the Atom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  Yes, the title is a bit wonky, for Dirac was no mystic (he was in fact a militant atheist), but he was a strange and brilliant character who, along with Heisenberg, was a major architect of quantum physics.  Dirac’s life was hardly exciting: he was a laconic, antisocial man, and even his physics colleagues couldn’t pry more than a few words out of him.  He had a tyrannical father, a fawning mother, and his brother committed suicide, all of which may account for Dirac’s asociality.  His real life was in his head, but what a head!  Somehow Farmelo manages, without burdening the reader with equations, to convey the wonder of Dirac’s accomplishments and turn his life into a triumph of the ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the high point of Farmelo’s tale is Dirac’s prediction, from first principles, of the existence of antimatter.  It turned out that one of his quantum-mechanical equations, the famous &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation"&gt;“Dirac equation,” &lt;/a&gt;predicted the existence of antimatter: particles the size of electrons but with a positive charge.  For several years Dirac’s colleagues poo-pooed this prediction, for there was no evidence of antimatter.  Dirac even thought that his equation might be wrong.  But cloud-chamber experiments conducted by Carl Anderson at Caltech finally confirmed the existence of the predicted “positrons.” In 1933, at the age of only 31, Dirac shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Erwin Schrödinger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout his life, Dirac insisted that the truth about nature was approached better through equations than experiments, and it still amazes me—in fact, I find this unbelievable—that Dirac accepted the existence of antimatter simply because it was demanded by his equations.  The notion that, with minimal input from observation or experiment, equations themselves can tell us what is real about the universe is something completely alien to a biologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get this book; you won’t be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is one of my favorite science photos. It shows Dirac (left) having a “conversation” with Richard Feynman at a relativity meeting in Warsaw in 1962.  The lanky Dirac, with an impossibly small head atop a stretched-out frame, leans back as the garrulous Feynman gesticulates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="feynman_dirac" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/feynman_dirac.jpg?w=496&amp;amp;h=546" alt="" width="496" height="546"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="http://www.dirac.ch/PaulDirac.html"&gt;a Dirac anecdote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the question period after a Dirac lecture at the University of Toronto, somebody in the audience remarked: “Professor Dirac, I do not understand how you derived the formula on the top left side of the blackboard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is not a question,” snapped Dirac, “it is a statement. Next question, please.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve read only a few biographies as engrossing as Farmelo’s, and none (except for Browne’s)  dealing with scientists.  Just to note my favorite non-scientific  biographies: two are by Robert Caro, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Power-Broker-Robert-Moses-Fall/dp/B001F51WKQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1270070649&amp;amp;sr=1-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The  Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and his  still-in-progress biography of LBJ, &lt;em&gt;The Years of Lyndon Johnson&lt;/em&gt; (  &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Path-Power-Years-Lyndon-Johnson/dp/0679729453"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The  Path to Power&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Means-Ascent-Years-Lyndon-Johnson/dp/067973371X/ref=pd_sim_b_1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Means  of Ascent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Master-Senate-Lyndon-Johnson-Vintage/dp/0394720954/ref=pd_sim_b_2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Master  of the Senate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).  And my all-time favorite biography is a real  masterpiece, and, sadly, will always be unfinished: William Manchester’s  &lt;em&gt;The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill&lt;/em&gt;.  There are two  volumes, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Lion-Winston-Churchill-1874-1932/dp/0385313489/ref=pd_cp_b_3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visions  of Glory, 1874-1932&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Lion-Winston-Churchill-1932-1940/dp/0385313314/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1270070907&amp;amp;sr=1-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alone,  1932-1940&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s a great tragedy that Manchester died before  finishing the third (and probably not the last) volume, one that would have described  Churchill’s greatest achievement, shepherding Britain through World War  II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I need to point out that this is not an entirely new development. &lt;a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1624797"&gt;Hearsay&lt;/a&gt;, CMU's early-1970s speech recognition system, was built using the best Artificial-Intelligence theories of the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The system consists of a set of cooperating independent processes, each representing a source of Knowledge. The knowledge is used either to predict what may appear in a given context or to verify hypotheses resulting from a prediction. The structure of the system is illustrated by considering its Operation in a particular task situation: Voice-Chess. The representation and use of various sources of knowledge are outlined. Preliminary results of the reduction in search resulting from the use of various sources of knowledge are given.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the "sources of Knowledge" was the state of the chess board and the list of currently-valid moves, arranged in rough order of plausibility. And the "source of Knowledge" representing the analysis of the acoustic input was somewhat, shall we say, open-textured. As a result, it was possible to play a decent game of chess against the machine by barking at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similarly Bayesian approach to pattern recognition is clearly built into this new animal-communication app.  A cough played to the cat-to-English translator produces the output "Might go out on the town tonight, don't wait up!" The same sound, input to the dog-to-English engine, produces the output "Seriously, what's with the stick thing? It's getting old."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other prior art:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001936.html"&gt;The dogs of speech technology&lt;/a&gt;" (3/1/2005)&lt;br&gt;
"&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005331.html"&gt;It&amp;#39;s a dog&amp;#39;s life — 0.3 bits at a time&lt;/a&gt;" (1/19/2008)&lt;br&gt;
"&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005335.html"&gt;Dog language mailbag&lt;/a&gt;" (1/21/2008)&lt;br&gt;
"&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005336.html"&gt;Not Professor Milton, but Professor Schwartzman&lt;/a&gt;" (1/21/2008)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those looking for a niche not yet occupied might consider the possibility of incorporating chemical sensors into cell phones, allowing them to deal with the sorts of animal communication involved in an interesting recent paper by Fiona Berry and Thomas Breithaupt ("&lt;a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/25/abstract"&gt;To signal or not to signal? Chemical communication by urine-borne signals mirrors sexual conflict in crayfish&lt;/a&gt;", BMC Biology 8:25, 2010):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Sexual selection theory predicts that females, being the limiting sex, invest less in courtship signals than males. However, when chemical signals are involved it is often the female that initiates mating by producing stimuli that inform about sex and/or receptivity. This apparent contradiction has been discussed in the literature as &amp;#39;the female pheromone fallacy&amp;#39;. Because the release of chemical stimuli may not have evolved to elicit the male&amp;#39;s courtship response, whether these female stimuli represent signals remains an open question. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Urine-blocking experiments demonstrate that female urine contains sex-specific components that elicit male mating behaviour. The coincidence of chemical signalling and aggressive behaviour in both females and males suggests that urine release has evolved as an aggressive signal in both sexes of crayfish. By limiting urine release to aggressive behaviours in reproductive interactions females challenge their potential mating partners at the same time as they trigger a sexual response. These double messages should favour stronger males that are able to overcome the resistance of the female. We conclude that the difference between the sexes in disclosing urine-borne information reflects their conflicting interests in reproduction. Males discontinue aggressive urine signalling in order to increase their chances of mating. Females resume urine signalling in connection with aggressive behaviour, potentially repelling low quality or sexually inactive males while favouring reproduction with high quality males.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strikes me as a worthy continuation of &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001800.html"&gt;D.

The opinion may be mistaken, but to allow the party which has been denounced on the basis of it to compel its author to prove in court what he has asserted by way of argument is to invite the court to become an Orwellian ministry of truth. Milton, recalling in the Areopagitica his visit to Italy in 1638-9, wrote: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;""I have sat among their learned men, for that honour I had, and been counted happy to be born in such a place of philosophic freedom, as they supposed England was, while themselves did nothing but bemoan the servile condition into which learning among them was brought; …. that nothing had been there written now these many years but flattery and fustian. There it was that I found and visited the famous Galileo, grown old a prisoner of the Inquisition, for thinking in astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan and Dominican licensers thought."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"That is a pass to which we ought not to come again." &lt;/em&gt;[from para. 23]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[On evidence]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"What "evidence" signifies depends heavily on context. To a literalist, any primary fact – for example, that following chiropractic intervention a patient's condition improved – may be evidence of a secondary fact, here that chiropractic works. To anyone (and not only a scientist) concerned with the establishment of dependable generalisations about cause and effect, such primary information is as worthless as evidence of the secondary fact as its converse would be. The same may equally well be true of data considerably more complex than in the facile example we have given: whether it is or not is what scientific opinion is there to debate. If in the course of the debate the view is expressed that there is not a jot of evidence for one deduction or another, the natural meaning is that there is no worthwhile or reliable evidence for it. That is as much a value judgment as a contrary viewpoint would be." &lt;/em&gt;[para. 26]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[On the meaning of the words complained of]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Once the allegation that there is "not a jot of evidence" to support the claims is properly characterised as a value judgment, the word "happily", even if synonymous with "knowingly", loses its sting. But we respectfully doubt whether the judge was justified in any event in attributing to the word any significance beyond, say, "blithely". The natural meaning of the passage, in other words, was not that the BCA was promoting what it knew to be bogus treatments but that it was promoting what Dr Singh contended were bogus treatments without regard to the want of reliable evidence of their efficacy – a meaning which takes one back to the assertion that there was not a jot of evidence for the BCA's claims." &lt;/em&gt;[para 30]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[On libel and scientific controversy, and note the strong word "adopt", rather than just "note" or "refer to"]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"We would respectfully adopt what Judge Easterbrook, now Chief Judge of the US Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, said in a libel action over a scientific controversy, Underwager v Salter 22 Fed. 3d 730 (1994): &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;""[Plaintiffs] cannot, by simply filing suit and crying 'character assassination!', silence those who hold divergent views, no matter how adverse those views may be to plaintiffs' interests. &lt;strong&gt;Scientific controversies must be settled by the methods of science rather than by the methods of litigation.&lt;/strong&gt; … More papers, more discussion, better data, and more satisfactory models – not larger awards of damages – mark the path towards superior understanding of the world around us.""&lt;/em&gt; [para. 34, emphasis added]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[And the stress which needs to be placed on free expression on the now renamed "honest opinion" defence]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The law of defamation surely requires that language should not be used which obscures the true import of a defence to an action for damages. Recent legislation in a number of common law jurisdictions - New Zealand, Australia, and the Republic of Ireland - now describes the defence of fair comment as "honest opinion". It is not open to us to alter or add to or indeed for that matter reduce the essential elements of this defence, but to describe the defence for what it is would lend greater emphasis to its importance as an essential ingredient of the right to free expression. Fair comment may have come to "decay with … imprecision". 'Honest opinion' better reflects the realities." &lt;/em&gt;[From para. 36]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And there is a lot more besides.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One must pay the highest possible tribute to Simon Singh, whose determination not to be bullied, led to this most pleasing of judgments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Full case analysis over the weekend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published;

Indeed, the Judges went further to say that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt; [plaintiffs] cannot, by simply filing suit and crying 'character assassination!', silence those who hold divergent views...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;In a significant boost to the defence of scientific discourse, the judgement continued:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;Scientific controversies must be settled by the methods of science rather than by the methods of litigation. … More papers, more discussion, better data, and more satisfactory models – not larger awards of damages – mark the path towards superior understanding of the world around us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia;font-size:medium"&gt;Let's take stock at this point, however. Simon's won his appeal on meaning, but the matter is far from over; according to the BCA's statement put out in response to the verdict,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:17px"&gt;&lt;blockquote style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;we are considering whether to seek permission to appeal to the Supreme Court and subsequently proceed to trial. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;Now, it is up to the reader to decide whether they feel that, considering the BCA's statement concluded with the thought that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;the BCA brought this claim only to uphold its good name and protect its reputation, honesty and integrity, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;whether or not they have succeeded in this aim and would be wise to continue to trial in light of today's judgement. What is clear, nonetheless, is that whatever the outcome in Simon's own case, this judgement does two things. Firstly, it provides a precedent in case law to allow future victims of libel chill to bring a serious public interest defence - as Simon's solicitor Robert Dougans said, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:17px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:normal;font-family:Georgia,serif"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:17px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:17px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:normal;font-family:Georgia,serif"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;Scientists have been – rightly – concerned about the consequences they might face if opponents seek to counter their arguments with a libel claim rather than by engaging in debate and research. The Court of Appeal’s brave decision today gives hope that important research on scientific matters will be protected against libel threats, and will hopefully make people think again before embarking on legal action hoping to shut down debate. It is clear from the judgment that the Court of Appeal is not satisfied with the current state of English libel laws, and recognises the absurdities and injustices that can result from them as they currently stand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;The second thing it does it highlight the pressing need for statutory reform - for Parliament to re-write English libel law to reflect the urgent need to protect freedom of speech from libel suits that threaten to quash responsible journalism and scientific debate. The Campaign for Libel Reform does not end here, even if today's judgement is seen as a turning point in Simon's case - as he himself says,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;It is ridiculous that it has cost £200,000 to establish the meaning of a handful of words... I am still angry that libel is so horrendously expensive... There are hundreds more cases that never make it to court because people back down and apologise, and thousands more where writers, journalists and bloggers self-censor to avoid the chilling effect of libel law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;So in many ways today marks a significant moment not only in Simon's defence of his critical take on chiropractic, but a milestone in the battle to defend free speech - the Conservative MP David Davies, present at today's hearing, hoped that today would write a new chapter in the history of free speech. Here's hoping that his party will follow the Liberal Democrats in adding libel law reform to their manifesto, so that writers such as Simon no longer have to fear the iniquitous libel laws and can be free to discuss, debate, criticise and investigate the issues of scientific and political import that form our zeitgeist.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/488262047686109051-5294116909573635863?l=teekblog.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (teekblog)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://teekblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://teekblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">consider, evaluate, act</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://teekblog.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270125335823"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/04/finnish_mail_to_scan_paper_mai.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0dbe573f6e76cffc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Tech"/><title type="html">Finnish Mail to Scan Paper Mail and Email It</title><published>2010-04-01T13:20:03Z</published><updated>2010-04-01T13:20:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/8CKVCKmm5K0/finnish_mail_to_scan_paper_mai.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/04/finnish_mail_to_scan_paper_mai.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like Swedish Mail, many mail services worldwide, I believe, offer a service where you e-mail them a letter and a list of addresses and they do the paper mailing for you. But now Finnish Mail is trying something pretty badass: they're doing it the other way around to cut costs and CO2 emissions. Instead of delivering paper mail five days a week to the village of Andersböle-Anttila, &lt;a href="http://sverigesradio.se/cgi-bin/ekot/artikel.asp?artikel=3598126"&gt;they are opening all the mail&lt;/a&gt;, scanning it, sending it to the villagers by e-mail and then delivering the paper originals only twice a week. Participants opt in. Those without computers are given machines by Finnish Mail.&lt;/p&gt;

His latest escapade is to &lt;a href="http://rawstory.com/rs/2010/0331/catholic-league-boys-pubescent/"&gt;pardon a priestly abuser because his victims were over some magical age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The head of the influential Catholic League says that the priest who allegedly sexually abused 200 deaf boys in Wisconsin did not engage in pedophilia because 'the vast majority of the victims [were] post-pubescent."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Bill Donohue made the argument during a raucous debate on Larry King Live Tuesday night, during which he repeatedly pointed the finger to homosexuality -- rather than pedophilia -- as the cause of the church's sex abuse problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s playing word games, and managed to successfully derail the discussion into a debate over how young the victims have to be for it to count as pedophilia — Donohue is claiming that once a kid is over 12 or 13, he&amp;#39;s fair game. At that age, it&amp;#39;s just homosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where to even begin? The problem is not the sex of his victims, it&amp;#39;s that this was a priest abusing his authority, acting as a sexual predator on much, much younger members of his flock — young people who were in his charge, who were dependent on him, and who had been indoctrinated with the belief that they should trust the priest. Donohue is resorting to arguing that because a 13-year-old had pubic hair, he had the full autonomy of an adult and the abuse of the priest was simply a love affair between equals. And that is bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a mistake to get into an argument about a chronological dividing line at all. The one thing Donohue is really good at, though, is spewing out distractions, and that&amp;#39;s what he has accomplished here — he&amp;#39;s obscuring a clear pattern of abuse with a lot of irrelevant noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The British Chiropractic Association claims that their members can help treat children with colic, sleeping and feeding problems, frequent ear infections, asthma and prolonged crying, even though there is not a jot of evidence. This organisation is the respectable face of the chiropractic profession and yet it happily promotes bogus treatments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCA sued for libel, and won an initial victory in May of 2009, when Sir David Eady, the presiding judge in the English High Court, decided that Singh's piece involved assertions of fact rather than opinion, and that the word &lt;em&gt;bogus&lt;/em&gt; in effect meant "fraudulent" and not just "ineffective". This decision meant that in order to defend himself successfully, Singh would have to prove that the BCA was deliberately and knowingly dishonest in promoting treatments that it knew did not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Guardian withdrew the article, Singh chose to appeal Eady's judgment, and attracted considerable support for his goal of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1500"&gt;keeping libel laws out of scientific debate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals had this to say about the question of fact vs. opinion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;One error which in Ms Page's submission affects Eady J's decision on meaning is that in §14, quoted above, he treats "verifiable fact" as antithetical to comment, so that any assertion which ranks as the former cannot qualify as the latter. This, it is submitted, is a false dichotomy. It led the judge to postulate the resultant issue as "whether those responsible for the claims put out by the BCA were well aware at the time that there was simply no evidence to support them". This, he held, was "a matter of verifiable fact".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It seems to us that there is force in Ms Page's critique – not necessarily because fact and comment are not readily divisible (that is a philosophical question which we do not have to decide), but because the subject-matter of Dr Singh's article was an area of epidemiology in which the relationship of primary fact to secondary fact, and of both to permissible inference, is heavily and legitimately contested. The issue posed by the judge is in reality two distinct issues: first, was there any evidence to support the material claims? and secondly, if there was not, did the BCA's personnel know this? If, as Dr Singh has contended throughout, the first issue is one of opinion and not of fact, the second issue ceases to matter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In our judgment Eady J, notwithstanding his very great experience, has erred both in conflating these two elements of the claim and, more particularly, in treating the first of them as an issue of verifiable fact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to the question of deliberate dishonesty vs. careless disregard for evidentiary status, the court wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Once the allegation that there is "not a jot of evidence" to support the claims is properly characterised as a value judgment, the word "happily", even if synonymous with "knowingly", loses its sting. But we respectfully doubt whether the judge was justified in any event in attributing to the word any significance beyond, say, "blithely". The natural meaning of the passage, in other words, was not that the BCA was promoting what it knew to be bogus treatments but that it was promoting what Dr Singh contended were bogus treatments without regard to the want of reliable evidence of their efficacy – a meaning which takes one back to the assertion that there was not a jot of evidence for the BCA's claims.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milton is quoted, and not in a good way for the BCA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;… the material words, however one represents or paraphrases their meaning, are in our judgment expressions of opinion. The opinion may be mistaken, but to allow the party which has been denounced on the basis of it to compel its author to prove in court what he has asserted by way of argument is to invite the court to become an Orwellian ministry of truth. Milton, recalling in the Areopagitica his visit to Italy in 1638-9, wrote:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; "I have sat among their learned men, for that honour I had, and been counted happy to be born in such a place of philosophic freedom, as they supposed England was, while themselves did nothing but bemoan the servile condition into which learning among them was brought; …. that nothing had been there written now these many years but flattery and fustian. There it was that I found and visited the famous Galileo, grown old a prisoner of the Inquisition, for thinking in astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan and Dominican licensers thought."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;That is a pass to which we ought not to come again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court's conclusions could not, as far as I can understand them, be more favorable to Singh.  And the opinion further suggests that he may be succeeding in his quest to reform English libel law more broadly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It may be said that the agreed pair of questions which the judge was asked to answer … was based on a premise, inherent in our libel law, that a comment is as capable as an assertion of fact of being defamatory, and that what differ are the available defences; so that the first question has to be whether the words are defamatory even if they amount to no more than comment. This case suggests that this may not always be the best approach, because the answer to the first question may stifle the answer to the second.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the judgment, the court cites "[r]ecent legislation in a number of common law jurisdictions - New Zealand, Australia, and the Republic of Ireland", and quotes from the opinion of an American judge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;We would respectfully adopt what Judge Easterbrook, now Chief Judge of the US Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, said in a libel action over a scientific controversy, Underwager v Salter &lt;a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USCA7/1994/471.html"&gt;22 Fed. 3d 730 (1994)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"[Plaintiffs] cannot, by simply filing suit and crying 'character assassination!', silence those who hold divergent views, no matter how adverse those views may be to plaintiffs' interests. Scientific controversies must be settled by the methods of science rather than by the methods of litigation. … More papers, more discussion, better data, and more satisfactory models – not larger awards of damages – mark the path towards superior understanding of the world around us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that this sort of attention to legislation and legal opinion in other countries is not a normal part of English appeals-court judgments, and represents an implicit (and well-deserved) rebuke to the current state of the law of defamation in England and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

So ingrained in our culture has it become that nearly everyone (at least in the U.S.) knows what you are talking about when you refer to it. It's been featured in movies as diverse as &lt;em&gt;Independence Day&lt;/em&gt; (one of my favorite big budget, brain-meltingly silly end-of-the-world movies about alien invasion) and, of course, &lt;em&gt;Area 51&lt;/em&gt;. Forests of trees have been slain in order to publish books on the subject, and cable TV channels serve up near constant stream of documentaries either about Area 51 or mentioning it as a place of secret government studies of aliens who crash landed and deep conspiracies to keep The Truth About The Aliens from the American people. While there is no doubt that something secret was going on at Area 51, which is in fact a military base located on the shore of Groom Lake within the U.S. Air Force's Nevada Test and Training Range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single blog post is too little space to document the sorts of conspiracy theories that have spring up around Area 51. The most famous legend is that the U.S. government brought the wreckage and alien corpses from a space ship crash at Roswell, NM in 1947. Indeed, the very plot of &lt;em&gt;Independence Day&lt;/em&gt; has the movie's heroes visiting Area 51, where a functional alien spaceship had been studied since 1947, and it turns out that it was a spaceship piloted by a scout from the alien race who had invaded the earth and caused such devastation. In a scenario that's hard to believe even suspending disbelief for purposes of a shoot-'em-up blockbuster science-fiction alien invasion movie, two of the protagonists figure out how to pilot the ship to the alien mothership to deliver a computer virus that would shut down the alien fleet's defenses (not to mention a nuclear bomb to blow up the mothership), so that a coordinated world-wide counterattack would have a chance of succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other conspiracy theories that have sprung up around Area 51 include the aforementioned storage and attempted reverse engineering of the alleged alien space ship claimed to have crashed at Roswell; meetings with extraterrestrials; the development of all manner of secret weapons programs, such as energy weapons; and all manner of imaginative (and not so imaginative) activities. Given the secrecy that has been maintained by the U.S. government over the years regarding Area 51, it's not too surprising that conspiracy theories took hold, although, despite the fact that the events that inspired the conspiracy theories took place in the 1940s and 1950s, most of the myths surrounding Area 51 didn't actually start to spring up so much until decades later, when a man named Bob Lazar claimed that he had worked on alien spacecraft at Papoose Lake, which is south of Area 51. Since then, Area 51 has become, with Roswell, the twin capitals of alien abduction paranoia in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder how alien abduction conspiracy theorists will react to a recent news story entitled &lt;a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2011461015_area51vets28m.html"&gt;Area 51 vets break silence: Sorry, but no space aliens or UFOs&lt;/a&gt;. It turns out that some of the secret projects that have been carried out at Area 51 have been declassified. Veterans are talking, and--surprise! surprise!--they aren't telling any tales of space aliens or UFOs:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/area_51_veterans_speak_no_space_aliens.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/area_51_veterans_speak_no_space_aliens.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/zRDWtOHwZUg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270123514735"><id gr:original-id="http://duncan.hull.name/2010/04/01/easter-bunn/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3903a58b432f6b60</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Καλό Πάσχα: Happy Easter: Frohe Ostern</title><published>2010-04-01T06:24:40Z</published><updated>2010-04-01T06:24:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/tUnG2IHUDCY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://duncan.hull.name/2010/04/01/easter-bunn/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Whatever your inclination, it’s difficult to ignore that sandwiched between the Vernal equinox and Beltane, it’s Easter time already.

&lt;p&gt;Born early or not, every kid will enter the next age group and play against other kids a year older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, taking the very best ever (i.e., the definition of outlier), Wayne Gretzky, we see this (from Wikipedia): “Gretzky’s first team, at age six, was a team of ten-year-olds, starting a pattern where Gretzky always played at a level far above his peers through his minor hockey years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="http://www.journalism.co.uk/2/articles/538127.php"&gt;Singh won his appeal.&lt;/a&gt; A British justice ruled that Singh’s statement was not a statement of fact but “fair comment”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . the material words, however one represents or paraphrases their meaning, are in our judgment expressions of opinion.  The opinion may be mistaken, but to allow the party which has been denounced on the basis of it to compel its author to prove in court what he has asserted by way of argument is to incite the court to become an Orwellian ministry of truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh isn’t out of the woods yet, but this goes a long way towards extricating him from the forest of insanity that is British libel law.  And it’s a great victory for freedom of speech in the UK, especially the freedom to question quackery and pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve followed this case, you’ll want to read the full judgment (10 pages) &lt;a href="http://blogs.journalism.co.uk/editors/2010/04/01/the-simon-singh-appeal-judgement-in-full/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Half were from low-income families and half high.  All mom&amp;#39;s had at least one child between the ages of 6 and 18 at home and all mom&amp;#39;s were their family&amp;#39;s primary grocery shopper.  Researchers set up a make believe grocery store and divided food into high-calorie for nutrient foods (bad foods) and low-calorie for nutrient foods (good foods) based off of Drewnowski&amp;#39;s scoring system.  Participants were given $22.50 in make believe dollars and told to imagine that she had no food in the house and she was to purchase groceries for her family for the week.  Prices of foods were based off grocery prices and different scenarios were played out.  Two of the scenarios involved lowering the prices of the good for you foods.The results?When good for you foods were subsidized mom&amp;#39;s did in fact buy more of them.  But they also bought more bad for you food - in fact they bought more extra bad for you food than extra good for you food.  When the price of the good for you foods was lowered by 10%, mom&amp;#39;s bought10.3% more bad for you food but only 6.8% more good for you food.  The authors&amp;#39; conclusions?If we&amp;#39;re looking to use pricing to motivate healthier dietary choices sticks (taxes) may well work better than carrots (subsidies).Epstein, L., Dearing, K., Roba, L., &amp;amp; Finkelstein, E.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Early last month the mayor of Topeka, Kansas stunned the world by announcing that his city was &lt;a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/03/02/google.kansas.topeka/index.html"&gt;changing its name&lt;/a&gt; to Google. We’ve been wondering ever since how best to honor that moving gesture. Today we are pleased to announce that as of 1AM (Central Daylight Time) April 1st, Google has officially changed our name to &lt;strong&gt;Topeka&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schmidt's post includes some instructions on the proper use of the company's new trademark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Topeka1.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pleased to see that the instructions were graded as to degree of violation, rather than being an all-or-nothing matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new name is going to take some getting used to –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we hate to see that jaunty Google logo going unused on the internet, an early-morning board meeting at Language Log Plaza decided that it would be inappropriate to dilute our brand equity by picking it up:&lt;/p&gt;

The full judgment &lt;a href="http://www.indexoncensorship.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Singh_judgement_01Apr10.pdf"&gt;is here (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCA has released a statement, which I will sum up here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not trying to stamp on free speech and scientific debate. We’re just bankrupting Simon Singh until he stops criticizing us and goes away. Yes, The Guardian offered us the opportunity to publicly defend our claims with science, but that’s absurd – &lt;em&gt;we don’t have any science to defend our claims&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that at this point pretty much everyone thinks we’re a bunch of shit heads, but that’s because we were following our lawyers’ advice! And even though we’ll continue to look like bigger shit heads the longer we keep this charade going, we’re prepared to drag this out for years. After all, if we’re going to singlehandedly destroy the chiropractic industry, we’re going to take Simon Singh down with us. Because that’s exactly the kind of shit heads we are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m surprised they didn’t mention in their press release that &lt;a href="http://heresycorner.blogspot.com/2010/03/bca-lawyers-want-simon-singh-to-pay-for.html"&gt;they want to bill Simon for the time they spent dealing with the activists who have been inspired to take down chiropractorss making fraudulent claims&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t worry, BCA, this totally won’t change our opinion of you. We already know you’re a bunch of shit heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their full, unedited statement follows after the jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More media information from Carl Courtney on 07785397321  1st April 2010&lt;br&gt;
Statement from the British Chiropractic Association regarding the BCA vs Simon Singh&lt;br&gt;
Commenting on the Court of Appeal ruling allowing the Appeal by Simon Singh,&lt;br&gt;
Richard Brown, President of the British Chiropractic Association (BCA), said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The case against Dr Singh has always been simply to set the record straight and&lt;br&gt;
correct what the BCA considered were libellous comments by Simon Singh in the&lt;br&gt;
Guardian. Originally we asked Dr. Singh for a retraction and an apology and he&lt;br&gt;
declined. The Guardian subsequently offered a right of reply but this fell short of our&lt;br&gt;
expectations, not least of which because the original libel would have remained&lt;br&gt;
uncorrected. Having reached stalemate and feeling our reputation had been&lt;br&gt;
tarnished we sought legal advice which unambiguously indicated that in order to get&lt;br&gt;
an appropriate apology and retraction, a writ needed to be served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same advice was that this was best achieved by directing the action against the&lt;br&gt;
author rather than the newspaper. The BCA has followed its legal advice throughout&lt;br&gt;
this case. The motivation for this action was always to clear our good name,&lt;br&gt;
particularly in respect of the implication that we acted dishonestly. It never was, and it&lt;br&gt;
is still not our intention, to curb freedom of speech, whether in the field of scientific&lt;br&gt;
research or elsewhere, although sadly we recognise that this is how it has been&lt;br&gt;
portrayed by Dr. Singh and his supporters”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCA brought the case because in his article Dr Singh made a serious attack on&lt;br&gt;
the reputation of the BCA, which stated in print and on-line, that the Association&lt;br&gt;
“….happily promotes bogus treatments”. In May 2009 Mr Justice Eady, one of the&lt;br&gt;
country’s leading libel judges, agreed with the BCA’s interpretation of the article. He&lt;br&gt;
ruled that Dr Singh had made the “plainest allegation of dishonesty”. Today the Court&lt;br&gt;
of Appeal ruled, by virtue of their interpretation, that the words published were&lt;br&gt;
“comments” or “opinions” and not allegations of fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCA is considering its position in the light of the ruling. Richard Brown concluded&lt;br&gt;
“We are of course disappointed to lose the appeal, but this is not the end of the road&lt;br&gt;
and we are considering whether to seek permission to appeal to the Supreme Court&lt;br&gt;
and subsequently proceed to trial. Our original argument remains that our reputation&lt;br&gt;
has been damaged. To reiterate, the BCA brought this claim only to uphold its good&lt;br&gt;
name and protect its reputation, honesty and integrity”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca Watson</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270116605460"><id gr:original-id="http://www.conservationmaven.com/frontpage/activated-carbon-helps-native-plants-attain-dominance-agains.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a337f9eb5f4cee35</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Activated carbon helps native plants attain dominance against invasive species</title><published>2010-04-01T05:00:15Z</published><updated>2010-04-01T05:00:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/4IOPmUC8-5o/activated-carbon-helps-native-plants-attain-dominance-agains.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.conservationmaven.com/frontpage/activated-carbon-helps-native-plants-attain-dominance-agains.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science writer Simon Singh has won an appeal for the right to rely on the defence of “fair comment” in a libel action being brought against him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr Singh took the case to the Appeal Court following the action by the British Chiropractic Association…. The High Court had said Mr Singh’s comments were factual not opinion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/"&gt;Thanks to Jack of Kent&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/9nMpVG"&gt;statement from the BCA in pdf form. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additional report: &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8598472.stm"&gt;BBC Technology: Science Writer Simon Singh Wins Libel Appeal:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Court judge Mr Justice Eady said last May the comments were factual not opinion – meaning Mr Singh could not use the defence of fair comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, the Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, Master of the Rolls Lord Neuberger and Lord Justice Sedley ruled the High Court judge had “erred in his approach” and allowed Mr Singh’s appeal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr Singh described the ruling as “brilliant”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;He said: “It is extraordinary this action has cost £200,000 to establish the meaning of a few words.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a subject of grim amusement among scientists that while it is perfectly acceptable for wrinkle creams to claim to be “&lt;a title="L&amp;#39;Oral: Youth Code: Inspired by the science of genes" href="http://www.loreal-paris.co.uk/skincare/face-care/youthcodelaunch.aspx"&gt;inspired by the science of genes&lt;/a&gt;” (whatever that means), real discussion of scientific process and results could result in a lawsuit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone say hi to Ruby!

Unfortunately, this is because her wireless on her normal computer suddenly decided that it was too good for her modem.  Perhaps it's an April Fool's Day joke.  This is not a good time for this to happen, but of course the not good times ARE the times when this happens, as we all know.  And so, until that gets fixed, we are stuck on the netbook, which may mean increased typos and various other things that happen when Sci's hands are confined to a 10" space.

Anyway.

A few days ago Sci looked at a recent study which has come out on dopamine and obesity, which showed changes in reward-related behaviors and changes in the dopamine D2 receptor after rats got really fat.  This paper (which apparently some people decided to interpret as "food is just like heroin", which is just silly) was based on the hypothesis that severe chronic overeating results in some changes in the brain which are similar to those seen in drug addiction. 

Sci hasn't really looked into this before, but this really began to interest her.  She decided to dig in a little, and take a look at some of the clinical literature, in particular some of the human stuff. 

And so here we go.

&lt;p&gt;This post recounts a complicated story that started in January 2009, but has recently come to what looks like a happy ending.  The story involves over a year’s writing of letters and meetings, but for those not interested in the details, I’ll start with a synopsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Synopsis of the synopsis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2009, a course in &amp;quot;integrated medicine&amp;quot; was announced that, it was said, would be accredited by the University of Buckingham. The course was to be led by Drs Rosy Daniel and Mark Atkinson.   So I sent an assessment of Rosy Daniel’s claims to &amp;quot;heal&amp;quot; cancer  to Buckingham’s VC (president), Terence Kealey,  After meeting Karol Sikora and Rosy Daniel, I sent an analysis of the course tutors to Kealey who promptly demoted Daniel, and put &lt;a href="http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/publicity/dofe/miles.html"&gt;Prof Andrew Miles&lt;/a&gt; in charge of the course.  The course went ahead in September 2009.  Despite Miles’ efforts, the content was found to be altogether too alternative. The University of Buckingham has now terminated its contract with the &amp;quot;Faculty of Integrated Medicine&amp;quot;, and the course will close. Well done.Buckingham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Synopsis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 2009. I saw an announcement of a Diploma in Integrated Medicine, to be accredited by the University of Buckingham (UB).  The course was to be run by Drs Rosy Daniel and Mark Atkinson of the College of Integrated Medicine, under the nominal directorship of Karol Sikora (UB’s Dean of Medicine). I wrote to Buckingham’s vice-chancellor (president), Terence Kealey, and attached a reprint of &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/ernst-carctrol-2009.pdf"&gt;Ernst’s paper on carctol,&lt;/a&gt; a herbal cancer ‘remedy’ favoured by Daniiel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike most vice-chancellors, Kealey replied at once and asked me to meet Sikora and Daniel.  I met first Sikora alone, and then, on March 19 2009, both together.  Rosy Daniel gave me a complete  list of the speakers she’d chosen. Most were well-known alternative people, some, in my view, the worst sort of quack. After discovering who was to teach on the proposed course, I wrote a long document  about the proposed speakers and sent it to the vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, Terence Kealey on March 23rd 2009..  Unlike most VCs, he took it seriously.   At the end of  this meeting I asked Sikora, who was in nominal charge of the course, how many of the proposed tutors he’d heard of.  The answer was &amp;quot;none of them&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortly before this meeting, I submitted a complaint to Trading Standards about Rosy Daniel’s commercial site, HealthCreation, for what seemed to me to be breaches of the Cancer Act 1939, by claims  made for &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/ernst-carctrol-2009.pdf"&gt;Carctol&lt;/a&gt;.  Read &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/health-creation-ts-complaint%20v2.pdf"&gt;the complaint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On 27th April 2009, I heard from Kealey that he’d demoted Rosy Daniel from being in charge of the Diploma and appointed &lt;a href="http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/publicity/dofe/miles.html"&gt;Andrew Miles&lt;/a&gt;, who had recently been appointed as Buckingham’s Professor of Public Health Education and Policy &amp;amp;Associate Dean of Medicine (Public Health). Terence Kealey said &amp;quot;You’ve done us a good turn, and I’m grateful&amp;quot;. Much appreciated. Miles said the course “needs in my view a fundamental reform of content. . . “&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although Rosy Daniel had been demoted, she was still in charge of delivering the course at what had, by this time, changed its name to the Faculty of Integrated Medicine which, despite its name, is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; part of the university.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throughout the summer I met Miles (of whom more below) several times and exchanged countless emails, but still didn’t get the revised list of speakers. The course went ahead on 30 September 2009. He also talked with Michael Baum and Edzard Ernst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By January 2010, Miles came to accept that the course was too high on quackery to be a credit to the university, and simply fired The Faculty of Integrated Medicine. Their contract was not renewed. Inspection of the speakers, even after revision of the course, shows why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a consequence, it is rumoured that Daniel is trying to sell the course to someone else.  The University of Middlesex, and unbelievably, the University of Bristol, have been mentioned, as well as Thames Valley University, the University of Westminster, the University of Southampton and the University of East London. Will the VCs of these institutions not learn something from Buckingham’s experience? It is to be hoped that they would at the very least approach Buckingham to ask pertinent questions? But perhaps a more likely contender for an organisation with sufficient gullibility is the Prince of Wales newly announced &lt;a href="http://www.fih.org.uk/media_centre/new_integrated.html"&gt;College of Integrated Medicine.&lt;/a&gt; [but &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/#fih"&gt;see stop press&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The details of the story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/"&gt;University of Buckingham&lt;/a&gt;  (UB) is the only private university in the UK.  Recently it announced its intention to start a &lt;a href="http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/medicine/"&gt;school of medicine&lt;/a&gt; (the undergraduate component is due to start in September 2011).  The dean of the new school is &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466#sikora"&gt;Karol Sikora&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karol Sikora&lt;/strong&gt; shot to fame after   he &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/may/13/advertising-campaign-nhs-us-healthcare-reforms"&gt;appeared in a commercial&lt;/a&gt; in the USA. The TV commercial was sponsored by a far-right Republican campaign group,   “Conservatives for Patients’ Rights” It designed to prevent the election of Barack Obama, by pouring scorn on the National Health Serrvice. A very curious performance.  Very curious indeed. And then there was a bit of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/may/22/karol-sikora-honorary-professor-imperial-college"&gt;disagreement about the titles&lt;/a&gt; that he claimed to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as being dean of medicine at UB. Karol Sikora is also medical research director of &lt;a href="http://www.cancerpartnersuk.org/"&gt;CancerPartnersUK&lt;/a&gt;. a private cancer treatment company. He must be a very busy man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karol Sikora’s attitude to quackery is a mystery wrapped in an enigma.  As well as being a regular oncologist, he is also a &lt;a href="http://www.fih.org.uk/about_us/foundation_fellows.html"&gt;Foundation Fellow&lt;/a&gt; of that well known source of unreliable information, The Prince of Wales Foundation for Integrated Health.  He &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466#sikora"&gt;spoke at their 2009 conference&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the light of that, perhaps it is not, after all, so surprising thet the first action of UB’s medical school was to accredit a course a &lt;strong&gt;Diploma in Integrated Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;. This course has been through two incarnations. The first prospectus (created 21 January 2009) advertised the course as being run by the British College of Integrated Medicine.But by the time that UB issued a press release in July 2009, the accredited outfit had changed its name to the &lt;a href="http://www.integratedmedicine.org.uk/"&gt;Faculty of Integrated Medicine&lt;/a&gt; That grand title makes it sound like part of a university.  It isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/bcim-sikore-daniel-s.jpg" alt="BCIM Jan 2009" width="500" height="353"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosy Daniel runs a company, Health Creation which, among other things, recommended a herbal concoction. Carctol. to &amp;quot;heal&amp;quot; cancer, . I wrote to Buckingham’s vice-chancellor (president), Terence Kealey, and attached a reprint of &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/ernst-carctrol-2009.pdf"&gt;Ernst’s   paper on Carctol. &lt;/a&gt; . Unlike  most university vice-chancellors, he took it seriously. He asked me to meet Karol Sikora and Rosy Daniel to discuss it.  After discovering who was teaching on this course, I wrote a document about  their backgrounds and sent it to Terence Kealey.  The outcome was that he removed Rosy Daniel as course director and appointed in her place Andrew Miles, with a brief to reorganise the course.  A &lt;a href="http://www.integratedmedicine.org.uk/prospectus.pdf"&gt;new prospectus&lt;/a&gt;, dated 4  September 2009, appeared. The course is not changed as much as I’d have hoped, although Miles assures me that while the lecture titles themselves may not have changed, he had ordered fundamental  revisions to the teaching content and the teaching emphases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new prospectus the British College of Integrated Medicine has been renamed as the &lt;a href="http://www.integratedmedicine.org.uk/"&gt;Faculty of Integrated Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, but it appears to be otherwise unchanged. That’s a smart bit of PR. The word : “Faculty” makes it sound as though the college is part of a university.   It isn’t.  The &amp;quot;Faculty&amp;quot; occupies some space in the &lt;a href="http://www.apthorpcentre.com/"&gt;Apthorp  Centre in Bath&lt;/a&gt;, which houses, among other things, Chiropract, Craniopathy (!) and a holistic vet,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospectus now starts thus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/FIM-sikore-daniel-040909-s.jpg" alt="Sept 2009 version" width="500" height="385"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Board consists largely of well-know advocates of alternative medicine (more information about them below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/FIM-advisory-board.jpg" alt="FIM advisory board" width="500" height="722"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these advisory board members are the usual promoters of &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733"&gt;magic medicine&lt;/a&gt;.  But three of them seem quite surprising,Stafford Lightman, Nigel Sparrow and Nigel Mathers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/neuroscience/research/groups/pidetails/36"&gt;Stafford Lightman&lt;/a&gt;? Well actually I mentioned to him in April that his name was there and he asked for it to be removed, on the grounds that he’d had nothing to do with the course. It wasn’t removed for quite a while, but the &lt;a href="http://www.integratedmedicine.org.uk/advisory_board.php"&gt;current advisory board &lt;/a&gt;has none of these people. Nigel Sparrow and Nigel Mathers, as well as Lightman, sent letters of formal complaint to Miles and Terence Kealey, the VC of Buckingham, to complain that their involvement in Rosy Daniel’s set-up had been fundamentally misrepresented by Daniel.   With these good scientists having extricated themselves from Daniel’s organisation, the FIM  has only people who are firmly in the alternative camp (or quackery, as i’d prefer to call it). For example, people like &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=219"&gt;Andrew Weil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=131"&gt;George Lewith&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Weil, for example, while giving his address as the University of Arizona, is primarily a supplement salesman.  He was recently &lt;a href="http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/URItheFlu/16508"&gt;reprimanded by the US Food and Drugs Administration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Advertising on the site, the agencies said in the Oct. 15 letter, says “Dr. Weil’s Immune Support Formula can help maintain a strong defense against the flu” and claims it has “demonstrated both antiviral and immune-boosting effects in scientific investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claims are not true, the letter said, noting the “product has not been approved, cleared, or otherwise authorized by FDA for use in the diagnosis, mitigation, prevention, treatment, or cure of the H1N1 flu virus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time I’ve come across people’s names being used to support alternative medicine without the consent of the alleged supporter.  There was, for example, the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=44"&gt;strange case of Dr John Marks&lt;/a&gt; and Patrick Holford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misrepresentation of this nature seems to be the order of the day. Could it be that people like Rosy Daniel are so insecure or, indeed, so unimportant within the Academy in real terms (where is there evidence of her objective scholarly or clinical stature?), that they seek to attach themselves, rather like limpets to fishing boats, to people of real stature and reputation, in order to boost their own or others’ view of themselves by a manner of proxy? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the  course was originally proposed, a brochure appeared. It said accreditation by the University of Buckingham was expected soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much detail appeared in the brochure, Fine words are easy to write but what matters is who is doing th teaching. So I wrote to the vice-chancellor of Buckingham, Terence Kealey. I attached a reprint of &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/ernst-carctrol-2009.pdf"&gt;Ernst’s paper on carctol,&lt;/a&gt; a herbal cancer ‘remedy’ favoured by Daniel (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Health-Creation-carctol-cached.pdf"&gt;download the cached version&lt;/a&gt; of her claims, now deleted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="kealey"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terence Kealey&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kealey is regarded in much of academia as a far-right maverick, because he advocates ideas such as science research should get no public funding,and that universities should charge full whack for student fees.  He has, in fact, publicly welcomed the horrific cuts being imposed on the Academy by Lord Mandelson. His &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article7067726.ece"&gt;piece in The Times&lt;/a&gt; started &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wonderful news. The Government yesterday cut half a billion pounds from the money it gives to universities” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;though the first comment on it starts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Considerable accomplishment: to pack all these logical fallacies and bad  metaphors in only 400 words&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He and I are probably at opposite ends of the political spectrum. Yet he is the only VC who has been willing to talk about questions like this.  Normally letters to vice-chancellors about junk degrees go unanswered.  Not so with Kealey.  I may disagree with a lot of his ideas, but he is certainly someone you can do business with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kealey responded quickly to my letter, sent in January 2009, pointing out that Rosy Daniel’s claims about Carctol could not be supported and were possibly illegal. He asked me to meet Sikora and Daniel. I met first Sikora alone, and then, on March 19 2009, both together. Rosy Daniel gave me a complete list of the speakers she’d chosen to teach on this new Diploma on IM.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After discovering who was to teach on the proposed course, I wrote a long document about the proposed speakers and sent it to Terence Kealey on March 23rd 2009. It contained many names that will be familiar to anyone who has taken an interest in crackpot medicine, combined with a surprisingly large element of vested financial interests. Unlike most VCs, Kealey took it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remarkable thing about this meeting was that I asked Sikora how many names where familiar to him on the list of people who had been chosen by Rosy Daniel to teach on the course. His answer was &amp;quot;none of them&amp;quot;. Since his name and picture feature in all the course descriptions, this seemed like dereliction of duty to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing my analysis of the speakers, Terence Kealey reacted with admirable speed. He withdrew the original brochure, demoted Rosy Daniel (in principle anyway) and brought in Prof Andrew Miles to take responsibility for the course. This meant that he had to investigate the multiple conflicts of interests of the various speakers and to establish some sort of way forward in the ‘mess’ of what had been agreed before Miles’ appointment to Buckingham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="miles"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Miles&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miles is an interesting character, a postdoctoral neuroendocrinologist, turned public health scientist.  I’d come across him before as editor-in-chief of the &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118000968/home?CRETRY=1&amp;amp;SRETRY=0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    This is a curious journal that is devoted mainly to condemning Evidence Based Medicine.  Much of its content seems to be in a style that I can only describe as post-modernist-influenced libertarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The argument turns on what you mean by ‘evidence’ and, in my opinion, Miles underestimates greatly the crucial &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1435"&gt;problem of causality&lt;/a&gt;, a problem that can be solved &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; by randomisation, His recent views on the topic &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/miles-sapienza-2010.pdf"&gt;can be read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; An article in Miles’ journal gives its flavour: &amp;quot;Andrew Miles, Michael Loughlin and Andreas Polychronis, Medicine and evidence: knowledge and action in clinical practice&amp;quot;. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice&lt;/em&gt; 2007, &lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt;, 481–503 [&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Miles-Loughlin-Polychronis-2007.pdf"&gt;download pdf&lt;/a&gt;].  This paper launches an attack on Ben Goldacre, in the following passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Loughlin identifies Goldacre [36] as a particularly luminous example of a commentator who is able not only to combine audacity with outrage, but who in a very real way succeeds in manufacturing a sense of having been personally offended by the article in question. Such moralistic posturing acts as a defence mechanism to protect cherished assumptions from rational scrutiny and indeed to enable adherents to appropriate the ‘moral high ground’, as well as the language of  ‘reason’ and ‘science’ as the exclusive property of their own favoured approaches. Loughlin brings out the Orwellian nature of this manoeuvre and identifies a significant implication.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If Goldacre and others really are engaged in posturing then their primary offence, at least according to the Sartrean perspective adopted by Murray &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. is not primarily intellectual, but  rather it is moral. Far from there being a moral requirement to ‘bend a knee’ at the EBM altar, to do so is to violate one’s primary duty as an autonomous being.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This attack on one of my heroes was occasioned because he featured one of the most absurd pieces of post-modernist bollocks ever, in his &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2006/aug/19/badscience.uknews"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; column in 2006. I had a go at the same paper&lt;/a&gt; on this blog, as well as an earlier one &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=35"&gt;by Christine Barry&lt;/a&gt;, along the same lines. There was some hilarious &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2006/12/338/"&gt;follow-up on badscience.net&lt;/a&gt;.  After this, it is understandable that I had not conceived a high opinion of Andrew Miles.  I feared that Kealey might have been jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After closer acquaintance I have changed my mind, In the present saga Andrew Miles has done an excellent job. He started of sending me links to heaven knows how many papers on medical epistemology, to Papal Encyclicals on the proposed relationship between Faith and Reason and on more than one occasion articles from the &lt;em&gt;Catholic Herald&lt;/em&gt; (yes, I did read it). This is not entirely surprising, as Miles is a Catholic priest as well as a public health academic, so has two axes to grind.  But after six months of talking, he now sends me links to junk science sites of the sort that I might get from, &lt;em&gt;ahem&lt;/em&gt;, Ben Goldacre. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Teachers on the course&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Andrew Miles best efforts, he came in too late to prevent much of the teaching being done in the parallel universe of alternative medicine,  The University of Buckingham had a pre-Miles, legally-binding contract (now terminated) with the Faculty of Integrated Medicine, and the latter is run by Dr Rosy Daniel and Dr Mark Atkinson.  Let’s take a look at their record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="daniel"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosy Daniel  BSc, MBBCh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Rosy Daniel first came to my attention through her commercial web site, &lt;a href="http://www.healthcreation.co.uk/"&gt;Health Creation&lt;/a&gt;. This site, among other things,  promoted an untested herbal concoction, Carctol, for &amp;quot;healing&amp;quot; cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/ernst-carctrol-2009.pdf"&gt;Carctol: Profit before Patients?&lt;/a&gt; is a review by Edzard Ernst of the literature, such as it is, and concludes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carctol and the media hype surrounding it must have given many cancer patients hope. The question is whether this is a good or a bad thing. On the one hand, all good clinicians should inspire their patients with hope [6]. On the other hand, giving hope on false pretences is cruel and unethical. Rosy Daniel rightly points out that all science begins with observations [5]. But all science then swiftly moves on and tests hypotheses. In the case of Carctol, over 20 years of experience in India and almost one decade of experience in the UK should be ample time to do this. Yet, we still have no data. Even the small number of apparently spectacular cases observed by Dr. Daniel have not been published in the medical literature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this basis I referred Health Creation to Trading Standards officer for a &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; breach of the Cancer Act 1939. ]Download &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/health-creation-ts-complaint%20v2.pdf"&gt;the complaint document]&lt;/a&gt;. Although no prosecution was brought by Trading Standards, they did request changes in the claims that were being made.  Here is an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Google search of the Health Creation site for “Carctol” gives a link&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Daniel has prescribed Carctol for years and now feels she is seeing a breakthrough. Dr Daniel now wants scientists to research the new herbal medicine &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But going to the link produces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access denied.&lt;br&gt;
You are not authorized to access this page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Health-Creation-carctol-cached.pdf"&gt;download the cached version&lt;/a&gt; of this page, which shows the sort of claims that were being made before Trading Standards Officers stepped in.  There are now only a few oblique references to Carctol on the Health Creation site, e.g. &lt;a href="http://www.healthcreation.co.uk/node/76"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Rosy Daniel and Karol Sikora were speakers at the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466#sikora"&gt;2009 Princes’s Foundation Conference&lt;/a&gt;, in some odd company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="atkinson"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Atkinson MBBS BSc (Hons) FRIPH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Mark Atkinson  is co-leader of the &lt;a href="http://www.integratedmedicine.org.uk/mark_atkinson.php"&gt;FiM course&lt;/a&gt;. He is also a &lt;a href="http://www.drmarkatkinson.com/pages/Products.php"&gt;supplement salesman&lt;/a&gt;, and he  has &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-398105/Good-vibrations.html"&gt;promoted the Q-link pendant&lt;/a&gt;.  The Q-link pendant is a simple &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2007/05/the-amazing-qlink-science-pedant/"&gt;and obvious fraud&lt;/a&gt; designed to exploit paranoia about WiFi killing you. When Ben Goldacre bought one and opened it. &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2007/05/the-amazing-qlink-science-pedant/"&gt;He found&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No microchip. A coil connected to nothing. And a zero-ohm resistor, which costs half a penny, and is connected to nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, &lt;a href="http://www.activebryantsystems.com/q-link.html"&gt;Mark Atkinson has waxed lyrical&lt;/a&gt; about this component-free device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As someone who used to get tired sitting in front of computers and used to worry about the detrimental effects of external EMF’s, particularly as an avid user of mobile phones, I decided to research the various devices and technologies on the market that claim to strengthen the body’s subtle energy fields. It was Q Link that came out top. As a Q link wearer, I no longer get tired whilst at my computer, plus I’m enjoying noticeably higher energy levels and improved mental performance as a result of wearing my Q Link. I highly recommend it.” Dr Mark Atkinson, Holistic Medical Physician&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Mark Atkinson is also a fan of Emo-trance. &lt;a href="http://dragonrising.com/reviews/dr_mark_atkinson_on_emotrance.htm"&gt;He wrote&lt;/a&gt;, In &lt;em&gt;Now Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I wanted you to know that of all the therapies I’ve trained in and  approaches that I have used (and there’s been a lot) none have excited  me and touched me so deeply than Emotrance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Silvia Hartmann’s technique is based on focusing your thoughts on parts  of your body and guiding energy. It can be used for everything from  insomnia to stress. The good news is that EmoTrance shows you how to  free yourself from these stuck emotions and release the considerable  amounts of energy that are lost to them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aha so this particular form of psychobabble is the invention of Silvia Hartmann. Silvia Hartmann came to my attention because her works feature heavily in on of the University of Westminster’s barmier “BSc”  degrees, in ‘naturopaths’, &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812"&gt;described here&lt;/a&gt;.  She is fanous, apart from Emo-trance, for her book &lt;a href="http://dragonrising.com/store/magic_spells_and_potions/?r=DR0609MSAP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magic,  Spells and Potions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dr Hartmann has created techniques that will finally make magic work for you in ways you never believed to be possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/em&gt; printed a piece with the title &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=409054"&gt;‘Energy therapy’ project in school denounced as ‘psychobabble’&lt;/a&gt;. They’d phoned me a couple of days earlier to see  whether I had an opinion about “Emotrance”.  As it happens, I knew a bit  about it because it had cropped up in a course given at, guess where, &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812"&gt;the University of Westminster&lt;/a&gt; .    It seems that a secondary school had bought this extreme form of  psychobabble.  The comments on the &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=409054"&gt;Times Higher piece&lt;/a&gt; were unusually long and  interesting.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the inventor of “Emotrance”, Dr Silvia  Hartmann PhD., not only wrote books about magic spells and potions, but  also that her much vaunted doctorate had been &lt;em&gt;bought&lt;/em&gt; from the Universal  Life Church, current cost $29.99.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rest of the teachers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the teachers on the course, despite valiant attempts at vetting by Andrew Miles, includes many names only too well-known to anybody who has taken and interest in pseudo-scientific medicine. Here are some of them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damien Downing&lt;/strong&gt;:, even the &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1023351/The-great-autism-rip---How-huge-industry-feeds-parents-desperate-cure-children.html"&gt;Daily Mail sees through him&lt;/a&gt;. Enough said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The University of Buckingham removes accreditation of the Faculty of Integrated Medicine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correspondence has been long and, at times, quite blunt. Here are a few quotations from it, The University of Buckingham, being private, is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (2000) but nevertheless they have allowed me to reproduce the whole of the correspondence. The University, through its VC, Terence Keeley, has been far more open than places that are in principle subject to FOIA, but which, in practice, &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2747"&gt;always try to conceal material&lt;/a&gt;. I may post the lot, as time permits, but meanwhile here are some extracts. They make uncomfortable reading for advocates of &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733"&gt;magic medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miles to Daniel, 8 Dec  2009&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ” . . . now that the University has taken his [Sikora&amp;#39;s] initial advice in trialing the DipSIM and has found it cost-ineffective, the way forward is therefore to alter that equation through more realistic financial contribution from IHT/FIM at Bath or to view the DipSIM as an experiment that has failed and which must give way to other more viable initiatives.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The University is also able to confirm that we hold no interest in jointly developing any higher degrees on the study of IM with IHT/FIM at Bath.  This is primarily because we are developing our own Master’s degree in Medicine of the Person in collaboration with various leading international societies and scholars including the WHO and which is based on a different school of thought. &amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miles to Daniel 15 Dec 2009&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dear Rosy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that you have not fully assimilated the content of my earlier e-mails and so I will reiterate the points I have already made to you and add to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DipSIM is an external activity – in fact, it is an external collaboration and nothing more.  It is not an internal activity and neither is it in any way part of the medical school and neither will it become so and so the ‘normal rules’ of academic engagement and scholarly interchange do not apply. Your status is one of external collaborator and not one of internal or even visiting academic colleague.  There is no “joint pursuit” of an academically rigorous study of IM by UB and IHT/FIM beyond the DipSIM and there are no plans, and never have been, for the “joint definition of research priorities” in IM. The DipSIM has been instituted on a trial basis and this has so far shown the DipSIM to be profoundly cost-ineffective for the University. You appear to misunderstand this – deliberately or otherwise.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel to Miles 13 Jan 2010&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;However, I am aware that weather permitting you and Karol will be off to the Fellows meeting for the newly forming National College (for which role I nominated you to Dr Michael Dixon and Prof David Peters.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been in dialogue with Michael and Boo Armstrong from FIH and they are strongly in favour of forming a partnership with FIM so that we effectively become one of many new faculties within the College (which is why we change our name to FIM some months ago). &lt;br&gt;
    I have told Michael about the difficulties we are having and he sincerely hopes that we can resolve them so that we can all move forward as one. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miles to Daniel 20 Jan 2010&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Congratulations on the likely integration of your organisation into the new College of Integrative Health which will develop out of the Prince’s Foundation for Integrated Health.  This&lt;br&gt;
    will make an entirely appropriate home for you for the longer term.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your image of David Colquhoun &amp;quot;alive and kicking&amp;quot; as the Inquisitor General, radiating old persecutory energy and believing &amp;quot;priestess healers&amp;quot; (such as you describe youself) to be best &amp;quot;tortured, drowned and even burnt alive&amp;quot;, will remain with me, I suspect, for many years to come (!). But then, as the Inquisitor General did say, ‘better to burn in this life than in the next’ (!).  Overall, then, I reject your conclusion on the nature of the basis of my decision making and playfully suggest that it might form part of the next edition of  Frankfurt’s recent volume [&amp;quot;On Bullshit]  &lt;a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7929.html"&gt;http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7929.html&lt;/a&gt;   I hope you will forgive my injection of a little academic humour in an otherwise formal and entirely serious communication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of IM, with its foundational philosophy so vigorously opposed by mainstream medicine and the conitnuing national and international controversies which engulf homeopaths, acupuncturists, herbalists,  naturopaths, transcendental meditators, therapeutic touchers, massagers, reflexologists, chiropractors, hypnotists, crystal users, yoga practitioners, aromatherapists, energy channelers, chinese medicine  practitioners &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, can only bring the University difficulties as we seek to establish a formal and internationally recognised School of Medicine and School of Nursing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not believe my comments in relation to governance at Bath are  &amp;quot;offensive&amp;quot;.  They are, on the contrary, entirely accurate and of concern to the University.  There have been resignations at senior level from your Board due to misrepresentation of your position and there has been a Trading Standards Authority investigation into further instances of misrepresentation.  I am advised that an audit is underway of your compliance with the Authority’s instructions.  You have therefore not dealt with my concerns, you have merely described them as &amp;quot;offensive&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I note from your e-mail that you are now in discussions with other universities and given the specific concerns of the University of Buckingham which I have dealt with exhaustively in this and other correspondences and the incompatibility of the developments at UB with the DipSIM and your own personal ambitions, etc., I believe you to have taken a very wise course and I wish you well in your negotiations.  In these circumstances I feel it appropriate to enhance those negotiations by confirming that the University of Buckingham will not authorise the intake of a second cohort of students and that the relationship between IHT and the University will cease following the graduation of those members of the current course that are successful in their studies – the end of February 2011.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Miles 2 Feb 2010&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Here is the list of teachers – you can subtract me (I withdrew from teaching when the antics ay Bath started) and also Professor John Cox (Former President of The Royal College of Psychiatrists and  Former Secretary General of the World Psychiatric Association) who withdrew when he learned of some of the stuff going on….  Karol Sikora continues to teach.  Michael Loughlin and Carmel Martin are both good colleagues of mine and, I can assure you – taught the students solid stuff!  Michael taught medical epistemology and Carmel the emerging field of systems complexity in health  services (Both of them have now withdrawn from teaching commitments).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutors shown are described by Rosy as the finest minds in IM teaching in the country.  I interviewed tham all personally on (a) the basis of an updated CV &amp;amp; (b) via a 30 min telephone interview with me personally.  Some were excluded from teaching because they were not qualified to do so academically (e.g. Boo Armstrong, Richard Falmer, not even a first degree, etc, etc., but  gave a short presentation in a session presided over by an approved teacher) and others were approved because of their academic qualifications, PhD, MD, FRCP etc etc etc) and activity within the IM  field.  Each approved teacher was issued with highly specific teaching guidance form me (no bias, reference to opposing schools of thought, etc etc) and each teacher was required to complete and sign a Conflicts of Interest form.  All of these documentations are with me here.  Short of all this governance it’s impossible to bar them from teaching because who else would then do it?!  Anyway, the  end is in sight – Hallelujah! &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Miles 19 Feb 2010&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dear David&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just got back to the office after an excellent planning meeting for the new Master’s Degree in Person-centred Medicine and a hearty (+ alcoholic) lunch at the Ath!  Since I shall never be a FRS, the Ath seems to me the next best ‘club’ (!).  Michael Baum is part of the steering committee and you might like to take his thoughts on the direction of the programme.  Our plans may  even find their way into your Blog as an example of &lt;em&gt;how to do things&lt;/em&gt; (vs how &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do things, i.e. CAM, IM, etc!).  This new degree will sit well alongside the new degrees in  Public Health – i.e. the population/utilitarian outlook of PH versus the individual person-centred approach., etc. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And an email from a senior UB spokesperson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Rumour has it that now that Buckingham has dismissed the ‘priestess healer of   Bath’, RD [Rosy Daniel] , explorations are taking place with other universities, most of which   are subject to  FoI request from DC at the time of writing.  Will these institutions have to make the same mistakes Buckingham did before taking the same action?  Rumour also has it that RD changed the name  of her institution to FIM in order to fit neatly into the Prince’s FIH, a way, no doubt, of achieving ‘protection’ and ‘accreditation’ in parallel with particularly lucrative IM ‘education’ (At £9,000 a student and with RD’s initial course attracting 20 mainly GPs, that’s £180,00 – not bad business….  And Buckingham’s ’share of this?  £12,000!”&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="fih"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The final bombshell; even the Prince of Wales’ FIH rejects Daniel and Atkinson?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only today (31 March) I was sent, from a source that I can’t reveal, an email which comes from someone who &amp;quot;represent the College and FIH . . . &amp;quot;.. This makes it clear that the letter comes from the Prince of Wales’ Foundation for Integrated Health&lt;/p&gt;

Dr Rosy Daniel BSc MBBCh&lt;br&gt;
Director of the Faculty of Integrated Medicine &lt;br&gt;
Medical Director Health Creation&lt;br&gt;
30th March 2010 
&lt;p&gt;RE:  Your discussion paper and recent correspondence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for meeting with [XXXXXX] and myself this evening to discuss your proposals concerning a future relationship between your Faculty of Integrated Medicine and the new College. As you know, he and I have been asked to represent the College and FIH in this matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are aware of difficulties facing your organisations and the FIM DipSIM course. As a consequence of these, it is not possible for the College to enter into an association with you, any of your organisations nor the DipSIM course at the present time. It would, therefore, be wrong to represent to others that any such association has been agreed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will appreciate that, in these circumstances, you will not receive an invitation to the meeting of 15th April 2010 nor to other planned events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sorry to disappoint you in this matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll confess to feeling almost a little guilty for having appeared to persecute the particular individuals involved in thie episode. But patients are involved and so is the law, and both of these are more important than individuals,  The only unfair aspect is that, while it seems that even the Prince of Wales’ Foundation for Integrated Health has rejected Daniel and Atkinson, that Foundation embraces plenty of people who are just as deluded, and potentially dangerous, as those two.  The answer to that problem is for the Prince to stop endorsing treatments that don’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the University of Buckingham.  Well, despite the ‘right wing maverick’ Kealey and the ‘anti-evidence’ Miles, I really think they’ve done the right thing.  They’ve listened,  they’ve maintained academic rigour and they’ve released all information for which I asked and a lot more. Good for them, I say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="follow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15 April 2010.&lt;/strong&gt;  This story was reported by &lt;em&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/em&gt;, under the title “&lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411217"&gt;It’s terminal for integrated medicine diploma&lt;/a&gt;“.  That report didn’t attract comments.  But on 25th April Dr Rosy Daniel replied with “&lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411354"&gt;‘Terminal’? We’ve only just begun&lt;/a&gt;“. This time there were some feisty responses.  Dr Daniel really should check her facts before getting into print. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Colquhoun</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">DC&amp;#39;s Improbable Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270105142157"><id gr:original-id="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2881">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/db07f82b990633bc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">University of Buckingham does the right thing.

&lt;p&gt;Who would think that Internet, ideas, disease, money, birds, and &lt;a href="http://www.eoearth.org/article/Climate_Literacy-_The_Essential_Principles_of_Climate_Sciences"&gt;climate literacy&lt;/a&gt; have anything in common? Recent progress on complex systems and network theory suggests that they all can be described in terms of a  ‘&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levy_flight"&gt;Levy flight&lt;/a&gt;‘. A recent and lengthy paper with the title ‘A study on interconnections between climate related ideas in complex networks’ (Ann. Trans. ICCPRS Soc. 52(3):1647-71; subscription required) by John McVenus argues that new ideas can be traced over the Internet just like dollar bills are traced at &lt;a href="http://www.whereisgeorge.com"&gt;Wheresgeorge&lt;/a&gt;. Our take on this is that this study muddles things more than clarifying the facts – probably because McVenus tries to explain almost everything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk"&gt;Random walks&lt;/a&gt; (RW) may have a much wider applicability than just describing climatic processes (see ‘&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/12/naturally-trendy/"&gt;Naturally trendy?&lt;/a&gt;‘). Recent progress on complex systems and nonlinear network information theory suggests that many information transfer and evolution processes exhibit characteristics that are effectively modeled by RW or its variants. These concepts can help us to understand the transmission and evolution of ideas in science, particularly when an extensive communication network (i.e. the internet) is a dominant communication medium, as it very much is today, and probably will be for some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, in particular, one type of random walk known as a “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levy_flight"&gt;Levy flight&lt;/a&gt;“, which is simply a walk in which a highly skewed distribution of step distances leads to a small percentage of steps that are much larger than average (“jumps” or “flights”), altering the system state rather abruptly. Such behaviour can be studied with methods such as the &lt;a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/709859"&gt;agent-based approach&lt;/a&gt; for describing the spread of disease and &lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/2265556"&gt;meta-population models&lt;/a&gt;, but are used in McVenus to describe how information travels. Similar “agent-based” approaches are also used for example, in ecology for the modeling of metapopulation dynamics and the spread of diseases and wildfires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After briefly laying out some conceptual and mathematical bases for Levy flight behavior and analysis, McVenus gets quickly to details. He begins a long litany of interesting examples with the &lt;a href="http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/images/stories/papers/originals/climate_change_cause.pdf"&gt;recently proposed idea&lt;/a&gt; that orbital patterns in Jupiter and Saturn can in fact affect the solar center of mass, which in turn influences the level of solar activity, and hence the climate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The McVenus paper also cites a small group in Norway which argues that &lt;a href="http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/63/3/401"&gt;changes in the moon’s orbit affects the climate&lt;/a&gt; through changes in ocean circulation, sea-ice cover, and hence the climate. This group coordinates a project called ‘Luna-Ticks’, and is interested in the idea of Jupiter and Saturn. But nobody has ever seen a Jupiter-tide or Saturn-tide here on Earth, and hence, they fear that critics convincingly will argue that the effect of the planets is pretty weak. But they really do like the idea, and instead proposed that the general principle could be translated to the moon and its measurable effect here on Earth. Everything but greenhouse gases, they argue, affects our climate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some bloggers have dubbed the process through which such arguments spread as ‘&lt;a href="http://gnuosphere.wordpress.com/2007/10/21/top-law-professors-spread-ip-confusion/"&gt;dispersion of confusion&lt;/a&gt;‘, which does not follow a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"&gt;simple diffusion law&lt;/a&gt;, but exhibits strange characteristics in addition to distant leaps in space. In addition to spreading, the ideas also change over time, morphing into new concepts, according to the McVenus paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While much more investigation into this topic is needed to get any sort of reasonable estimate of when and exactly how such conditions might be important, from an information flow analysis perspective, it is a fairly easy trace from there to the &lt;a href="http://legis.state.sd.us/sessions/2010/Bill.aspx?File=HCR1009P.htm"&gt;recent proclamation&lt;/a&gt; that astronomical alignments (astrology) can cause the climate to change, however strangely misguided such a pronouncement may be. Fair and straightforward enough; a good choice of examples with which to illustrate McVenus’ overall approach. But from here things start to get more complex–and highly interesting–pretty quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McVenus further proposes that there is also a wealth of information to derive from all the “gates” and network analysis, because their number is rather limited and their identification is easy. Usually, a “gate” is a label telling the media to start a hype, being proposed by someone with limited imagination. But there are exceptions to this rule, such as “Colgate”. This notion also exists in plural form, such as “Billgates”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent “&lt;a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/geraldwarner/100031389/now-its-cowgate-expert-report-says-claims-of-livestock-causing-global-warming-are-false/"&gt;Cowgate&lt;/a&gt;” appears to be a highly noteworthy Levy flight example. However, the gender of this gate turned out to be wrong – it later turned out really to be a “Bullgate”. It was traced by McVenus back to its press source via a &lt;a href="http://www.climatedepot.com/"&gt;principal system node&lt;/a&gt; in the propagation and evolution (usually via catastrophic mutation) of multiple climate science ideas at a web site called ‘the Gate Depot’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could have been no small task for McVenus to accurately trace these ideas as they went through the conceptual sausage grinder, rarely resembling anything remotely like their original form, much less some aspect of external reality as we know it. But perhaps this is just the typical warmist nitpicking about evidence, discernment, truth, reality and larger scale meaning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This node represents what McVenus calls (using the slanderous invective of scientists, which has generated 99% of the bad blood in public discussions) “a mad man with an affinity for black listing”. The language here is unfortunate, even if the idea sleuthing is still first rate. And speaking of bloodsucking and bad blood, we apparently now have a ´&lt;a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/24/climategate_oxburgh_globe/"&gt;Draculagate&lt;/a&gt;‘, fresh from the Gate Depot. But here we note that McVenus may have misinterpreted things slightly. Is that really the blood bank Dracula is in charge of, or is he rather just caught up &lt;a href="http://ketchupwiththat.blogspot.com/"&gt;fang-deep in ketchup&lt;/a&gt;? Where’s the photographic, or even metaphoric, evidence? &lt;a href="http://wotsupwiththat.wordpress.com/"&gt;What’s up with that&lt;/a&gt;? Caution is urged; the analysis is good but not without errors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in illuminating such otherwise opaque connections that we simply would not otherwise make, that McVenus is at his best. For example, he tracks down how the longer term surface temperature increases are based exclusively on the completely untrustworthy HadCRUT data, which are contaminated by siting issues and more generally by the impossibility of calculating a global mean temperature.  These issues also affect the regional to local scales that really affect the man in the street, where urban heat island effects are exceedingly extreme, notwithstanding &lt;a href="http://ifglobalwarmingisrealthenwhyisitcold.blogspot.com/"&gt;all the snow this winter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the temperatures are still not a problem to humans in the summer because of manifest human adaptability exemplified by air conditioned buildings and vehicles, even in the third world where they are just not as obvious because of there being fewer of them. And even if we jump back to the first world, the European heat wave of 2003 that killed a lot of people in urban areas cannot be due to AGW because for the umpteenhundredth time weather is not climate, and thus the hyperbolic and incendiary alarmist exaggerations based entirely on the now utterly discredited computer modeling of Pachauri’s IPCC in Himalayanglaciermeltrategate need to stop forthwith. One does not often run across comprehensive arguments of this magnitude in one place. McVenus shines like the morning star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But an even stranger change is seen in the disperion of confusion process in terms of a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/science/earth/04climate.html?ref=science"&gt;combination of the the Jupiter-Saturn hypothesis with the intelligent design&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design"&gt;ID&lt;/a&gt;) concept. This aspect is not really fully acknowledged in the McVenus paper. To give some quick and concise background on this vast subject, it is important to note that Richard Bawkin, the author of “The Evil Particle” is critical to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design"&gt;ID&lt;/a&gt;, and has argued that due to symmetry, everything has opposites in the universe. The particles have anti-particles, there are opposite spins in quantum physics (e.g. top spin and bottom spin), and so on. If there is intelligent design, there has to be stupid design too if symmetry holds. A quote from Oscar Wilde puts it nicely into perspective: “Where the devil is the Devil in intelligent design?”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In logical terms, idiotic designs just proves natural selection, because over time, idiotic design doesn’t survive. A new research project proposed by John Spence had an objective to try to prove the existence of the anti-intelligent design. Colleagues have informally and jokingly threatened to nominate him for the &lt;a href="http://improbable.com/ig/"&gt;igNobel prize&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway the project proposal had changed when it was submitted to the Norwegian Research Foundation: Instead of looking into evil issues, the project proposed to look for stupid designs. In particular it aims to look into stock markets, Icelandic banks, Greek economy, and accelerator pedals in hybrid cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the McVenus paper turns into a more tangled mess when it at great length discusses the propagation of ideas based on the church of ‘&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_flying_spaghetti_monster"&gt;The Flying Spaghetti monster&lt;/a&gt;‘ (FSM) and almost neglects ID. The paper should have noted that FSM is an anti-thesis to the ID. Nevertheless, FSM has a say on global warming and hence influences the dispersion of confusion. According to FSM, global warming is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster#Pirates_and_global_warming"&gt;inversely related to the number of pirates in the world&lt;/a&gt;. In November 2003, ‘&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_bay"&gt;Pirate Bay&lt;/a&gt;‘ was founded in Sweden, correctly acknowledged in McVenus, and the Swedes managed to elect representatives from their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party_(Sweden)"&gt;Pirate Party&lt;/a&gt; into the European parliament. Since then, some FSM-climate-protagonists have argued that the recent levelling off in the global mean temperature (from CRU!) can be explained. We think that this idea is unconvincing, even though the global mean temperature from CRU hasn’t really increased much since 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting and somewhat related point is that John Spence also has claimed that there must be anti-blogs too, and that there exists an unrealClimate-site. It’s not so straight forward to find it, as it uses a different name, however. Bart Verheggen from &lt;a href="http://ourchangingclimate.wordpress.com/2010/03/01/global-average-temperature-increase-giss-hadcru-and-ncdc-compared/"&gt;&lt;del&gt;wuttsupwiththat&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has pointed out the site UnrealClimate’s real name may be “blogal cooling”, but others suggest that the name of the anti-site is just made up with ‘real’ and ‘climate’ in reverse order (although they would have to swap ‘.org’ with ‘ists.com’). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also experts and un-experts, and organizations such as the Hartland institution provides a list of known experts in the world – and they say that an ‘expert’ is a person who does not think that an increase CO2 can lead to climate change. Many of these men and women provide part of the nodes in the agent-based approach models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one remarkable conclusion about the spread of confusion in the McVenus paper, published by the &lt;em&gt;Silly Paper Publishing Inc&lt;/em&gt; (SPPI), is that it’s distribution has a strong resemblance to the migration of cuckoos. In addition, cuckoos do lay eggs, and hence form new generations with new characteristics, thus changing over time, just like the ideas. Hence, he concludes, it is very likely that the confusion is spread by birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:  Apparently the &lt;a href="http://www.ecoenquirer.com/south-pole-tragedy.htm"&gt;recent story&lt;/a&gt; regarding the global warming activist who froze to death was missed by us.  We apologize for this rank oversight; fortunately numerous other highly reputable news outlets known for their thorough fact checking&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;amp;q=global+warming+activist+freezes+to+death&amp;amp;aq=&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;gs_rfai=&amp;amp;fp=bcdf8cbbf06dc4f"&gt; have been all over it&lt;/a&gt;, even if their original reports of this tragedy have in some cases gone missing for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE AGAIN!&lt;/strong&gt; Apparently, there are some who deny this story about network – they claim there are &lt;a href="http://www.worldscibooks.com/popsci/7714.html"&gt;disrupted networks&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>rasmus</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270103603690"><id gr:original-id="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/?p=1594">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/737a20f2bdd554f4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">XKCD</title><published>2010-04-01T06:30:42Z</published><updated>2010-04-01T06:30:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2010/04/01/xkcd_bash/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I know many of you love XKCD, but you should see what &lt;a href="http://www.xkcd.com"&gt;XKCD&lt;/a&gt; looks like today.

The &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/pregnant_woman_tasered/"&gt;police are authorized to torture you for traffic violations&lt;/a&gt;; the courts have recently decided that a case of a pregnant woman who was tasered for refusing to sign a traffic ticket was a fair use of force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman was driving her 12-year-old to the African American Academy in Seattle when she was pulled over on suspicion of speeding in 2004. The child left the car for school and a verbal spat with the police resulted in the woman receiving three, 50,000-volt shocks, first to her thigh, then shoulder and neck while she was in her vehicle. An officer was holding Brooks' arm behind Brooks' back while she was being shocked.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Brooks gave the officer her driver&amp;#39;s license, but Brooks refused to sign the ticket — believing it was akin to signing a confession. She was ultimately arrested for refusing to sign and to comply with officers asking her to exit the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what the police should do in these cases? Add penalties to the ticket, refer it to the courts, and hit her up with extra fines. Wrestling her out of the car and zapping her with intent to cause pain is a bit out of line, and really didn't contribute to the enforcement of the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court's decision is bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority noted that the M26 Taser was set in "stun mode" and did not cause as much pain as when set on "dart mode." The majority noted that the circuit's recent and leading decision on the issue concerned excessive force in the context of a Taser being set on Dart mode, which causes "neuro-muscular incapacitation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stun mode, the court noted, didn't rise to the level of excessive force because it imposes "temporary, localized pain only."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it's OK for the police to &lt;i&gt;cause pain&lt;/i&gt; for traffic offenses? Maybe they should be equipped with cattle prods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/dont_speed_in_seattle.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/aI3GW4mcgn0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270102387079"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=5502">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/110ef8d81ea8e783</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Freedom of Speech"/><category term="General Skepticism"/><category term="Ariane Sherine"/><category term="libel"/><category term="Simon Singh"/><category term="UK"/><title type="html">Simon Singh is now a folk hero</title><published>2010-04-01T06:12:55Z</published><updated>2010-04-01T06:12:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2010/03/31/simon-singh-is-now-a-folk-hero/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ariane Sherine’s “The Simon Singh Song” promotrd libel reform in the UK while making a folk hero in the process:&lt;/p&gt;

This genetic manipulation is one of a number of ways to beneficially alter the insulin-like growth factor system to increase life span in lower animals. It also appears to slow the decline of the immune system with age. Here is a paper in which researchers present more details on their PAPP-A knockout mice: The pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A knockout (PAPP-A KO) mouse is a model of reduced local insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I activity with normal circulating IGF-I levels. In this study, PAPP-A KO mice had significantly increased mean (27%), median (27%), and maximum (35%) life span compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. End-of-life pathology indicated that the incidence of [cancer] was not significantly different in the two groups of mice; however, it occurred in older aged PAPP-A KO compared with WT mice. Furthermore, PAPP-A KO mice were less likely to show degenerative changes of age. Scheduled pathologies at 78, 104, and 130 weeks of age indicated that WT mice, in general, had more degenerative changes and tumors earlier than PAPP-A KO......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***Update 2***&lt;/strong&gt;: There are some choice quotations from this whole debacle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/aclu-apologizes-american-humanist-association"&gt;From the ACLU&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A staff person at the ACLU of Mississippi made an error in judgment in sending an e-mail to the American Humanist Association expressing concerns about accepting its donation and sponsorship offer. To our understanding, MSSC has not made a decision regarding the acceptance of this funding and sponsorship offer. The decision is up to MSSC. The American Humanist Association has been made aware of the error, and the ACLU of Mississippi has expressed its apologies to the association for that error and the sentiments expressed in the e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sentiments expressed by the ACLU of Mississippi staff person in the referenced e-mail do not reflect the views of the ACLU of Mississippi or the National ACLU in any way. The ACLU remains a stalwart defender of freedom of belief and expression for all.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.americanhumanist.org/news/details/2010-04-humanists-feeling-sting-of-rejection-by-aclu-chapter-"&gt;From the AHA&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“We accept the apology, but we feel that an apology is owed not just to us but to the people of Mississippi,” said David Niose, president of the American Humanist Association. “To suggest that the good people of Mississippi are so unenlightened that they can’t be accepting and welcoming to the goodwill of a humanist group is insulting to them, not just to us. We are confident that our involvement would have been met with warmth and Southern hospitality.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From donor &lt;strong&gt;Todd Stiefel&lt;/strong&gt;’s Facebook page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hooray!  The ACLU apologized to the AHA.  They should have also apologized for misleading people into thinking that the AHA was making unreasonable demands.  The AHA was not putting conditions on their donation, it was the ACLU that was putting a condition on accepting it. ACLU would only accept it if they could hide who the money came from, which would mean AHA would have to hide the gift from their members.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They should also apologize to the people of Mississippi and Southern Baptists for insinuating they are intolerant bigots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best news is that it looks like Constance and her school will get an amazing “Second Chance Prom.”  Hopefully, the AHA will be one of the sponsors.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="http://secular.org/node/236"&gt;Secular Coalition for America&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Secular Coalition for America has repeatedly lobbied the Obama administration for safe schools legislation that includes gay students as well as nonbelieving students.  The behavior of this local school underscores the clear need for schools that are safe and welcoming environments for gay students and nonbelievers as well. More broadly, the notion that a civil liberties organization would themselves ‘tremble’ to associate with a positive, humanitarian group like the AHA, simply because they are nonbelievers, makes clear the necessity of the work of the Secular Coalition for America as it advocates for federal law that increases the visibility and respect of the nonreligious in American society.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the ACLU of Louisiana (in an email written to members of the New Orleans Secular Humanist Association (NOSHA)):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Harry, Charlotte, and the rest of NOSHA:  I’m just reading the story in today’s NY Times about the ACLU of Mississippi having rejected money from the American Humanist Association for a prom for Constance McMillen.  I’m shocked, embarrassed, and appalled that any ACLU entity would turn down such a generous offer from good friends to help a client with a worthy cause.  This is not a reflection of the entire ACLU, certainly not the ACLU of Louisiana, and I want to assure you that we do not shy away from the word or the concept of “atheism,” or from our friends who support us in our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please accept this as an apology on behalf of the ACLU of Louisiana  for the actions of the ACLU of Mississippi, over which we have no control.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/12/school-cancels-prom-instead-of-allowing-lesbian-to-attend/"&gt;Mississippi high school that canceled prom&lt;/a&gt; because one of the students, &lt;strong&gt;Constance McMillen&lt;/strong&gt;, wanted to attend with her girlfriend (and wear a tux)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember how atheist &lt;strong&gt;Todd Stiefel&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.americanhumanist.org/news/details/2010-03-humanists-prepare-to-hold-lgbt-inclusive-prom-in-miss"&gt;donated $20,000 to the American Humanist Association&lt;/a&gt; so that they could help hold an alternative prom that would be inclusive of GLBT students?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the ACLU is helping with the alternative prom, and they have a message for Stiefel and the AHA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We don’t want your money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/us/01prom.html"&gt;They’re rejecting the gift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll never believe why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“Although we support and understand organizations like yours, the majority of Mississippians tremble in terror at the word ‘atheist,’”&lt;/strong&gt; Jennifer Carr, the fund-raiser for the A.C.L.U of Mississippi, wrote in an e-mail message to Roy Speckhardt, executive director of the humanist group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the A.C.L.U. move, Ms. Carr wrote to Mr. Speckhardt: “Our staff has been talking a lot about your donation offer and have found ourselves in a bit of a conflict. We have fears that your organization sponsoring the prom could stir up even more controversy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Speckhardt said he was “really shocked” to hear the gift had been rejected. “We’ve worked with the A.C.L.U. many times in the past,” he said, “so this really felt like a slap in the face to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’d think they would have learned a lesson from the very case they’ve been working on,” [Stiefel] said. “The school board was trying to avoid a controversy by silencing a controversial minority, and now the A.C.L.U. is making the same mistake.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://mssafeschools.org/"&gt;Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition&lt;/a&gt; (MSSC) is organizing the alternative prom and they don’t know why the ACLU is acting this way.  They could certainly use the donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
According to Matthew Sheffield, a spokesman for the Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition, the organization arranging the event, the A.C.L.U. of Mississippi did not have authority to decline the gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We asked someone at the A.C.L.U. to assist us in handling all the donations, and that person told them we were not interested and that is not true,” he said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, why is the ACLU shying away from atheists and the word “atheist”?  The ACLU, of all groups, ought to be on our side in making that term acceptable.  There’s no reason to reject it on account of potential controversy.  Of all the controversial issues here, that atheists want to help the situation is not the biggest one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, there are a lot of distractions in this whole story, but ultimately, I hope Constance gets to attend prom.  &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; prom.  Her school’s being ridiculous and that’s just sad.  But I held the ACLU in far higher regard.  They’ve really let me down with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give money to the national ACLU.  I don’t want to have to think twice before renewing my membership next time.  What the Mississippi ACLU is doing may turn some progressives away from being members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not too late to rectify the mistake, though.  The ACLU could accept Todd’s donation on behalf of MSSC and throw in some of their own money as a way to make amends.  I’m sure everyone would appreciate that — especially the kids brave enough to attend the alternative prom.&lt;br&gt;

Yesterday was a record-setting day for humanity.  Over at CERN, the Large Hadron Collider achieved a new record for the most energy ever created in a laboratory collision in the history of humanity: &lt;b&gt;7,000,000,000,000 electron Volts&lt;/b&gt;, or 7 TeV (Tera- or Trillion-electron-Volts) for short.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/starting_with_a_little_bang_th/lhc-sim.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/starting_with_a_little_bang_th/lhc-sim-thumb-500x174-43960.jpg" width="500" height="174" alt="lhc-sim.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, we get energies higher than this all the time from black holes, neutron stars, and other catastrophic processes in space.  Occasionally, we even &lt;i&gt;observe&lt;/i&gt; them, in the form of Cosmic Rays!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/starting_with_a_little_bang_th/Joh%20Kelly%20-%20plaatje%20bij%20samenvatting.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/starting_with_a_little_bang_th/Joh%20Kelly%20-%20plaatje%20bij%20samenvatting-thumb-500x375-43962.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Joh Kelly - plaatje bij samenvatting.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are two big differences between cosmic rays and collisions in an accelerator like this.  First, cosmic rays are moving &lt;i&gt;incredibly&lt;/i&gt; quickly with respect to the Earth, which is at rest!  A cosmic ray striking the Earth is like a hollow-point bullet striking its target; the target suffers incredible damage not just at the point of impact, but all throughout it.  In terms a physicist cares about, the &lt;b&gt;energy gets distributed throughout the target&lt;/b&gt;, over a wide volume and over a huge number of particles.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/starting_with_a_little_bang_th/336958770_7ae82de444.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="336958770_7ae82de444.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a collider, however, we can &lt;i&gt;control&lt;/i&gt; this collision.  We take a proton moving very close to the speed of light moving clockwise throughout the accelerator, and another proton moving very close to the speed of light moving &lt;i&gt;counterclockwise&lt;/i&gt; throughout the accelerator!  This is like shooting two bullets at the same speed directly at each other, and hitting them dead on!  (Sorry for the low-res image below; it's the best I could find!)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/starting_with_a_little_bang_th/images.jpeg" width="500" alt="images.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this happens, the energy can &lt;i&gt;nearly all&lt;/i&gt; go into producing new particles!  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that's the first big advantage to having a collider.  The second is that you can control &lt;b&gt;where&lt;/b&gt; these collisions occur, and so you can choose a collision point and build a giant detector around it!  What do I mean by "giant detector?"  There are two.  There's the CMS detector (the "C" stands for Compact, believe it or not):
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/starting_with_a_little_bang_th/193849781_72947d460e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/starting_with_a_little_bang_th/193849781_72947d460e_b-thumb-500x332-43966.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="193849781_72947d460e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the other one is the ATLAS detector, which is even bigger!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/starting_with_a_little_bang_th/muo_gen_1006_004.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/starting_with_a_little_bang_th/muo_gen_1006_004-thumb-500x334-43968.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="muo_gen_1006_004.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you build these giant detectors around your collision points, and you track what comes out!  If you record the right data, and you do your analysis properly, you can reconstruct what happened during the collision.  This is &lt;b&gt;a huge deal&lt;/b&gt;, because something spectacular happened at the LHC.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That 7 TeV collisions that took place yesterday were &lt;b&gt;more than three times as powerful&lt;/b&gt; as the previous "world's most powerful accelerator," the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tevatron"&gt;Tevatron&lt;/a&gt; at Fermilab.  After just a few months, the LHC will have more data at a higher energy than Fermilab has ever achieved over its entire existence!  (And that means cumulative, since the 1970s!)  This was a snapshot from the main control room at the LHC yesterday,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/starting_with_a_little_bang_th/lhc_celebration.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/starting_with_a_little_bang_th/lhc_celebration-thumb-500x282-43970.jpg" width="500" height="282" alt="lhc_celebration.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and this is what the tracks looked like from one of the very first 7 TeV collisions that took place there!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/starting_with_a_little_bang_th/lhc_atlas_tracks.jpg" width="500" alt="lhc_atlas_tracks.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Universe hasn't seen consistent collisions at energies like this since it was &lt;b&gt;just a few hundred microseconds old&lt;/b&gt;, or less than a second after the big bang!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What this means is that we have an opportunity to discover new, more energetic and more exotic particles that might exist in our Universe than ever before.  Does the Higgs exist?  We should know in just a few years.  Do supersymmetric particles exist?  If they do, the LHC should find them; if not now, than in about three years, after the upgrade to &lt;b&gt;double&lt;/b&gt; its current energy: &lt;b&gt;14 TeV!&lt;/b&gt;  Are there extra dimensions?  If they're relevant to our existence, we should find that out relatively soon, too!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I'm curious to know what &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; think?  Is the LHC likely to find any of these?  Do you think that there are exciting possibilities (like technicolor, maybe?) that I missed that are worth exploring?  Or will the LHC turn up nothing new at all, and force us to re-think how things as fundamental as &lt;i&gt;mass&lt;/i&gt; work?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/starting_with_a_little_bang_th.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270083948579"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/musiccognition/sqUn/~3/mlsICU93mS0/is-music-mere-play.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/909e43f4bb660189</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Is music mere play?</title><published>2010-03-31T20:01:10Z</published><updated>2010-03-31T20:01:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/yyyxxjl8WlI/is-music-mere-play.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/musiccognition/sqUn/~3/mlsICU93mS0/is-music-mere-play.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Not too long ago I was called by the Dutch radio for a daily question on science, and was confronted with the question: Why do we like music? Since why-questions are generally almost impossible to answer, I was happy —just in time— to think of the idea of ‘music as play’. But because all of this went almost too quickly, I thought I would eloborate on this in a slightly more slower pace in this blog...The idea is that music, as a human phenomenon, can be seen as something that plays with our senses, our memory, our attention and our emotions, in the way young lions play, without any real threat. Music, generally, does not harm us, it also doesn’t make us less hungry, nevertheless it directly addresses our physiological and cognitive functions. For many music listeners this is a pleasant, rewarding, purposeful and sometimes even a consoling play.I like this idea of ‘music as play’ (or &amp;#39;music as a game&amp;#39;) far better than the discussion on whether music is an adaptation or a mere evolutionary by-product of more important functions, such as those involved in language (Pinker, 1997). Also Geoffrey Miller’s alternative suggesting sexual selection to be the primary mechanism in the evolution of music is still lacking the proper arguments and evidence. ‘Music as play’ is far more attractive, because it might explain several of our strange behaviors, such as listening to ‘sad’ music when we are sad, to make us even more sad — we apparently know it will not really harm us!The idea of ‘humans as players’ was brought forward by several authors, including the brilliant Johan Huizinga who wrote Homo Ludens (‘Man the Player’) in the 1930s. It also was the topic of the 2007 Huizinga lecture by Tijs Goldschmidt - a biologist and writer known from, e.g., Darwin&amp;#39;s Dreampond. His lecture was called  Doen alsof je doet alsof (‘Pretend to pretend’) and he even spent a few words about music (Goldschmidt, 2007:20-21).

Unfortunately for the students only four could actually be solved - the other six were a meaningless jumble of letters!They were told they could take as long as they needed to complete the task - up to a maximum of 20 minutes. What&amp;#39;s more, they measured their anxiety levels both before and afterwards.All the students also got some prework, including forming sentences from a word salad. For half of them, these sentences included words related to God and religion. In fact, this was a subliminal prime to get them thinking subconsciously about God.So the question is, how did the students who got the subliminal God prime fare in the anagram task?Well, the graph reveals the overall results. Those people who got the subliminal god prime stuck at the task longer and became more anxious when they couldn&amp;#39;t solve it.Interestingly, this effect  wasn&amp;#39;t weaker in people who had weaker beliefs in God. other priming studies have also found this - it might be down to the fact that students in the US are raised in religious environments, even if they are not religious themselves.The authors think the primes might have this effect because they made people people feel that God was watching them. Alternatively, they suggest that merely reminding people about authority figures might also do the trick.Either or both of these things might be happening - only further research will show. But it&amp;#39;s interesting to contrast this with other research into anxiety.For example, people who are more religious tend to be less, not more anxious (although anxiety seems to trigger churchgoing).Even more relevant to the current study is a finding that religious people show less &amp;#39;error response negativity&amp;#39;  when they make mistakes. This is a pattern of brain activity that&amp;#39;s linked to anxiety over making mistakes.Taken at face value, these two results together suggest that religious people are inherently less worried about making mistakes, but when reminded of their god they get highly stressed about failure!Toburen, T., &amp;amp; Meier, B.

She tells the story of her groundbreaking Parikrma Humanity Foundation, which brings hope to India's slums by looking past the daunting statistics and focusing on treating each child as an individual.

&lt;p&gt;Shukla Bose is the founder and head of the Parikrma Humanity Foundation, a nonprofit that runs four extraordinary schools for poor children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word "Parikrma" implies a full revolution, a complete path around -- and Shukla Bose's Parikrma Humanity Foundation offers literally that to kids in poor urban areas around Bangalore. Parikrma's four Schools of Hope teach the full, standard Indian curriculum to children who might not otherwise see the inside of a classroom, with impressive results. Equally important, the schools build an "end-to-end" environment that supports learning -- offering lunch every day, health-care and family support. Beyond these schools, Parikrma has inaugurated several afterschool programs and has plans for setting up a central teacher-training hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bose left behind a corporate career in 1992 to found Parikrma with a small group of friends. The nonprofit holds itself to formal business goals and strict accountability, and has developed some clever fundraising and marketing campaigns. As Bose puts it, the goal of Parikrma is to help build a better India by tapping its greatest strength: the vitality and potential of its people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Education of children is at the core of our aim to transform poor communities into self-sustaining, contributing communities. "&lt;/p&gt;

This thing is basically a child psychologist, a personal assistant, and a grandma all rolled into one. It keeps track of feedings; alerts you when it’s time to take your kid to the doctor; and tracks your little one’s developmental progress. For $4.99, this iPhone app lets you monitor up to six small children. (If you have more than six children, you need way more than just an app.)&lt;/p&gt;

You probably don’t see your iPhone as a learning tool, but that’s exactly what it’ll turn into with this app. Preschoolers can learn letters and animals with digital flashcards. The app also helps with handwriting and phonics. ($1.99)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when none of the above apps do the trick, check out the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/webapps/entertainment/pocketbarmobilecocktailrecipesfortheiphone_vishalseth.html"&gt;PocketBar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; app for cocktail recipes to help take the edge off. Thank God there’s an app for that.&lt;/p&gt;

At issue, of course, is whether the brain represents information in a localist or distributed fashion and Jeff has used his case for grandmother cells as evidence against a basic assumption of parallel distributed processing (PDP) models. But the PDP folks don&amp;#39;t seem to think &amp;quot;distributed&amp;quot; is a necessary property of PDP models.  So in the guest post below, Jeff asks, What does the D in PDP actually mean?  This is an interesting question, and Jeff would like to know your thoughts (see the new survey to respond).  I&amp;#39;d also be interested in your thoughts on grandmother cells!Guest Post from Jeff Bowers:I’ve been involved in a recent debate regarding the relative merits of localist representations and the distributed representations learned in Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) networks. By localist, I mean something like a word unit in the interactive activation (IA) model – a unit that represents a specific word (like a “grandmother cell”). By distributed, I mean that a familiar word (or an object or a face, etc.) is coded as a pattern of activation across a set of units, with no single unit sufficient for representing an item (you need to consider the complete pattern). In Bowers (2009, 2010) I argue that the neuroscience is more consistent with localist coding compared to the distributed representations in PDP networks, contrary to the widespread assumption in the cognitive science community. That is, single-cell recordings of neurons in cortex and hippocampus often reveal neurons that are remarkably selective in their responding (e.g., a neuron that responds to one face out of many). I took this to be more consistent with localist compared to distributed PDP theories.This post, however, is not with regards to whether localist or PDP models are more biological plausible. Rather, I’m curious as to what people think is the theory behind PDP models; specifically, what is your understanding regarding the relation between distributed representations and PDP models? In Bowers (2009, 2010) I claim that PDP models are committed to the claim that information is coded in a distributed format rather than a localist format. On this view, the IA model of word identification that includes single units to code for specific words (e.g., a DOG unit) is not a PDP model. Neither are neural networks that learn localist representations, like the ART models of Grossberg. On my understanding, a key (necessary) feature of the Seidenberg and McClelland model of word naming that makes it part of the PDP family is that it learns distributed representations of words – it gets rid of localist word representations.However, Plaut and McClelland (2010) challenge this characterization of PDP models. That is, they write:In accounting for human behavior, one aspect of PDP modelsthat is especially critical is their reliance on interactivity andgraded constraint satisfaction to derive an interpretation of an inputor to select an action that is maximally consistent with all of thesystem’s knowledge (as encoded in connection weights betweenunits). In this regard, models with local and distributed representationscan be very similar, and a number of localist models remainhighly useful and influential (e.g., Dell, 1986; McClelland &amp;amp;Elman, 1986; McClelland &amp;amp; Rumlehart, 1981; McRae, Spivey-Knowlton, &amp;amp; Tenenhaus, 1998). In fact, given their clear andextensive reliance on parallel distributed processing, we think itmakes perfect sense to speak of localist PDP models alongsidedistributed ones. (p 289).That is, they argue that the PDP approach is not in fact committed to distributed representations. Elsewhere they write:In fact, the approach takes no specific stance on the number of units thatshould be active in representing a given entity or in the degreeof similarity of the entities to which a given unit responds.Rather, one of the main tenets of the approach is to discoverrather than stipulate representations (p. 286)So on this view, the PDP approach does not rule out the possibility that a neural network might actually learn localist grandmother cells in the appropriate training conditions.With this as background, I would be interested in people’s views on this. Here is my question:Are PDP theories of cognition committed to the claim that knowledge is coded in a distributed rather than a localist format?

I&amp;#39;d rather not in this case either, but I have to as they&amp;#39;re prominently featured in the news today, including this article from the &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/03/31/2010-03-31_bill_oreilly_helps_albert_snyder_after_weird_westboro_baptist_church_protests_hi.html"&gt;New York Daily News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albert Snyder's son was a U.S. marine killed in the line of duty while serving in Iraq. At his funeral, the Westboro Baptist Church appeared waving signs thanking God for "dead marines," among other well-known hate speech. Albert Snyder sued for emotional distress, and initially won a multi-million dollar award from a jury in a Maryland court. The church appealed, and won, nullifying the award to Snyder. The kicker: the court granted the church's request for reimbursement of legal costs, and Albert Snyder now owes them about $16,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, a man's son dies for his country, a hate group protests at the funeral (claiming that the son is now in Hell, among other things), and now Albert Snyder has to pay them $16,000. It hardly seems fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first learned about this from skeptics via an Internet chat room, and the reaction was along the lines of "Damn, that sucks. I hate those guys." An Internet poll had 92% of participants claiming that the court made a mistake in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while I certainly agree that the church's actions and very existence are an affront to humanity, I'm glad they were granted their legal costs by the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, that's right... I'm supporting the court. They did the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's simple: a suit was filed, and the appeals court ruled that the church's first amendment rights protected them from the suit, so they deserve to have their court costs reimbursed by the plaintiffs. The system worked, as it should. Say what you want about the church, but they know what they're doing. They know the law, and they follow it, and despite my personal feelings, I'm glad the courts realized this. Judge Robert B. King wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;As utterly distasteful as these signs are they involve matters of public concern, including the issues of homosexuals in the military, the sex-abuse scandal within the Catholic Church, and the political and moral conduct of the United States and its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three judge panel split the vote 2:1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only wish the that the courts had been as fair to the JREF. We have been sued many times over the years, never successfully, but we've had to pay court costs each time. Though we've asked to be compensated for our legal costs in the face of some obviously fraudulent suits (we were sued by "God," for example), we've never received a cent. The situation as it is right now is that anyone willing to pony up enough money can sue a non-profit group such as the JREF, and force them to pay legal costs... even if they don't have a legal leg to stand on. This is a state issue, and though the circumstances are different from Snyder's, the JREF is being penalized for using its right to free speech by what appears to me to be an oversight in the legal statutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do we do when groups we loathe are protected by the same rights we want to be protected by? We celebrate it. There is a reason Lady Justice is wearing a blindfold. If your battle is with Westboro, do your fighting in other ways than by wishing the courts would be prejudicial towards them. Protest yourself, or write articles, or... my favorite solution: ignore them completely. Whatever you choose, hopefully you'll follow the law and receive the same protections they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, my heart goes out to Albert Snyder and his family. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case, and if they overturn the decision of the Court of Appeals, Snyder won&amp;#39;t have to pay. But just in case, a fund has been started to help make the payment should that be the final outcome. If you&amp;#39;re interested, you can donate at &lt;a href="http://www.matthewsnyder.org/help.html"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;matthewsnyder.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom of speech is an essential tool for skeptics, and the only way we can have it is if it's universal. We shouldn't want it any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

This latest incident is interesting in that it appears to share some qualities of the militia movement, the Christian Identity movement, and the Tea Party movement (although what sorts of ideologic connections there really are will take some time to figure out.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cults in general scare me.  They scare me not just because of their acts and their ideas, but their attractiveness.  They have the ability not just to attract those of similar ideas, but they also seduce those who may simply be vulnerable to their philosophies.  The flames of hatred are being fanned by those on the right, including teabaggers and&lt;a href="http://viigo.im/2XIf"&gt; so-called mainstream right wing commentators&lt;/a&gt;. The economic times, an "ethnic" president who represents the future of the US population, and an utter failure of others on the right to speak out against the hate feed these right-wing violence cults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But cults don't just feed on hatred.  Cults, like street gangs, also seduce with love, with pleasant-sounding ideas that are congruent with and confirm one's own beliefs.  The antivaccine movement (as opposed to individuals with their individual beliefs) are a cult.  They have charismatic leaders (such as Barbara Loe Fisher, JB Handley, and Jenny McCarthy), they have their own beliefs that are impervious to the assault of actual facts, and they accrue followers, spreading their lies.  Their lies have helped to lower vaccination rates and increase the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases.  And their success depends upon a general cheapening of the meaning of "experts", and a vilification of earned scientific authority when it disagrees with their beliefs.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s talk about Deepak Chopra.  He is probably not an evil guy.  In fact, he seems rather compassionate and well-meaning. But the credulous bullshit he continually spews helps fortify the foundation of anti-scientific beliefs such as those of the antivaccine movement.  One of his &amp;quot;big ideas&amp;quot; is that consciousness is/can be independent of brain.  This idea is of course completely unoriginal, being the default belief of most of humankind until the scientific era. It is probably &lt;i&gt;still &lt;/i&gt;the default belief, but the majority of the reality-based community have come to the obvious conclusion that belief in an immaterial soul would require the invalidation of most of modern science.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Chopra &lt;i&gt;feels &lt;/i&gt;that soul.  He just knows it&amp;#39;s there, but he&amp;#39;s smart enough to know that most ideas of &amp;quot;soul&amp;quot; are incompatible with science.  So he is trying to bend the ideas of soul and of physics around each other to try to preserve his desire to retain his beliefs. His current favorite strategy is &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/quantum-consciousness_b_518940.html"&gt;the abuse of the language of physics&lt;/a&gt;. This strategy has twisted the ideas of soul and of physics so acutely that he has broken them both.  At a recent conference he was confronted by an actual physicist.  I&amp;#39;ll let them speak for themselves:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/G1MBKwMLLmg%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=320" width="500" height="320"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It&amp;#39;s instructive that Chopra is so attached to his beliefs that he cannot speak the same language as the physicist (&amp;quot;I know what each of those words means, but...&amp;quot;).  It&amp;#39;s also spectacularly arrogant of him to think that this video somehow &lt;i&gt;supports &lt;/i&gt;his beliefs.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For a number of reasons, I would very much like to believe in an immaterial, immortal soul right about now.  But if I am that casual with reality, what might I believe next?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/C7VJlaxPTHE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270070008076"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/6Vw2yUq7J6M/preventing_plagiarism.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/88d5eb6b0dca3b4d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Preventing Plagiarism.</title><published>2010-03-31T16:58:42Z</published><updated>2010-03-31T16:58:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/ImhWFFkJSr8/preventing_plagiarism.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/6Vw2yUq7J6M/preventing_plagiarism.php"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Especially in student papers, plagiarism is an issue that it seems just won't go away.  However, instructors cannot just give up and permit plagiarism without giving up most of their pedagogical goals and ideals.  As tempting a behavior as this may be (at least to some students, if not to all), it is our duty to smack it down.

Is there any effective way to deliver a preemptive smackdown to student plagiarists?  That's the question posed by a piece of research, "Is There an Effective Approach to Deterring Students from Plagiarizing?" by Lidija Bilic-Zulle, Josip Azman, Vedran Frkovic, and Mladen Petrovecki, published in 2008 in Science and Engineering Ethics.  

To introduce their research, the authors write:

Academic plagiarism is a complex issue, which arises from ignorance, opportunity, technology, ethical values, competition, and lack of clear rules and consequences. ... The cultural characteristics of academic setting strongly inﬂuence students' behavior. In societies where plagiarism is implicitly or even explicitly tolerated (e.g. authoritarian regimes and post-communist countries), a high rate of plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty and scientiﬁc misconduct may be expected. However, even in societies that ofﬁcially disapprove of such behavior (e.g. western democracies), its prevalence is disturbing. (140)

Here, there is some suggestion of potentially relevant cultural factors that may make plagiarism attractive -- and not the cultural factors I tend to hear about here in California, on the Pacific Rim.  But maybe we can extend Tolstoy's observation about how each unhappy marriage is unhappy in its own way to recognize the variety of cultural contexts that spawn dishonest students.

And this is not just a matter of the interactions between students and teachers.  Bilic-Zulle et al. point to plagiarism in school as something like a gateway drug for unethical behavior in one's professional life -- so potentially, reducing academic dishonesty could have important consequences beyond saving professors headaches.

In any case, the big question the researchers take on is how to reduce the prevalence.  Is it effective to emphasize the importance of academic integrity, or to threaten harsh penalties if plagiarism is detected?

&lt;p&gt;Turn your lights down low. Like, off. Everyone forgets to flip the switch sometimes, or falls asleep before putting out the lights, but even a few hours a week can make a difference. Artificial lighting is responsible for about 15 percent of home energy bills, according to the &lt;a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/lighting_daylighting/index.cfm/mytopic=11980"&gt;U.S. Department of Energy&lt;/a&gt; – and cutting back on the bulbs that are on in your house will save energy and bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone tells you they never lie to their kids, they’re lying. Some truth-stretching is essential in order to spare youngsters from life’s harsh realities, or just make parents’ lives a little easier. Stephen Colbert, host of Comedy Central’s “The Colbert Report,” coined his own term for it: &lt;em&gt;Truthiness – truth that comes from the gut, not books&lt;/em&gt;. So, here are four instances when we give you permission to lie straight to your kids’ faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Santa/Easter Bunny/Tooth Fairy Dilemma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We know this one is controversial. Some hardcore parents spill the beans from day one about Santa Claus and the rest of them being big fat phonies. But those families miss a lot – leaving out cookies for Santa and carrots for his reindeer, hunting for eggs on Easter Sunday, getting a quarter (a dollar? a Benjamin?) under your pillow in exchange for that first bloody tooth. Your kids will resent you later for plenty of things, but not for propelling these myths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No. More. Cookies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes, there may very well be an unopened bag of Oreos on the top shelf, but your toddlers don’t need to know that. When they’ve had enough snacks or other junk food, it’s perfectly permissible to whip out this classic line: “All gone!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Grades&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;= The Presidency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Odds are you didn’t score straight As every single semester, and you didn’t walk five miles to school in the snow. However, there’s nothing wrong with setting the bar high for your kids when it comes to their education. Instead of emphasizing the negative (&lt;em&gt;If you don’t go to school, you’ll end up in prison!&lt;/em&gt;), accentuate the positive. Tell them they’ve got CEO potential. Better yet, mention that getting an education is the only way they’ll be able to move far away from you at age 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mommy and Daddy Will Live Forever!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little kids hear about murder, death, and destruction every day from TV, the Internet, and even playground chatter. So they’ll likely ask you how long you plan to be around. It’s fine to feed them a little (okay, big) white lie here; just revisit the subject more honestly when they’re older. But for now, think &lt;em&gt;truthiness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Especially in student papers, plagiarism is an issue that it seems just won't go away.  However, instructors cannot just give up and permit plagiarism without giving up most of their pedagogical goals and ideals.  As tempting a behavior as this may be (at least to some students, if not to all), it is our duty to smack it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any effective way to deliver a preemptive smackdown to student plagiarists?  That's the question posed by a piece of research, &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/3252541u2372884u/"&gt;"Is There an Effective Approach to Deterring Students from Plagiarizing?"&lt;/a&gt; by Lidija Bilic-Zulle, Josip Azman, Vedran Frkovic, and Mladen Petrovecki, published in 2008 in &lt;em&gt;Science and Engineering Ethics&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To introduce their research, the authors write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Academic plagiarism is a complex issue, which arises from ignorance, opportunity, technology, ethical values, competition, and lack of clear rules and consequences. ... The cultural characteristics of academic setting strongly inﬂuence students' behavior. In societies where plagiarism is implicitly or even explicitly tolerated (e.g. authoritarian regimes and post-communist countries), a high rate of plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty and scientiﬁc misconduct may be expected. However, even in societies that ofﬁcially disapprove of such behavior (e.g. western democracies), its prevalence is disturbing. (140)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, there is some suggestion of potentially relevant cultural factors that may make plagiarism attractive -- and not the cultural factors &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2006/10/cultural_differences_of_opinio.php"&gt;I tend to hear about&lt;/a&gt; here in California, on the Pacific Rim.  But maybe we can extend Tolstoy's observation about how each unhappy marriage is unhappy in its own way to recognize the variety of cultural contexts that spawn dishonest students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is not just a matter of the interactions between students and teachers.  Bilic-Zulle et al. point to plagiarism in school as something like a gateway drug for unethical behavior in one's professional life -- so potentially, reducing academic dishonesty could have important consequences beyond saving professors headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, the big question the researchers take on is how to reduce the prevalence.  Is it effective to emphasize the importance of academic integrity, or to threaten harsh penalties if plagiarism is detected?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hint:&lt;/strong&gt; the joke is that laymen often state that the LHC is searching for the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson"&gt;Higg’s Boson&lt;/a&gt;, a.k.a. the “God Particle” &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)"&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newsbiscuit.com/2010/03/31/near-miss-as-large-hadron-collider-discovers-%E2%80%98son-of-god%E2%80%99-particle/"&gt;Near miss as Large Hadron Collider discovers ‘Son of God’ particle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newsbiscuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/CERN_LHC.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Little bit of God particle  may be in everyone" src="http://www.newsbiscuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/CERN_LHC.jpg" alt="" width="222" height="145"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Happy  scientists exchanged water for wine
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘It’s not quite the God particle we’ve been looking for, ’said  Professor Mann, head of the Atlas Project at CERN, ‘but it’s a miracle  nonetheless.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The particle arose from a collision between a J and an M particle in a  way which no one thought possible, and the bright light created sucked  in three K particles from the East.  Although it only existed for a  fraction of a second, scientists are adamant that the Son of God  particle will re-appear by Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Make no mistake there’ll be lots written about this and it will  become the standard textbook for how we do things in future,’ said  Professor Mann.  ‘I’ve no doubt it will lead to peace, harmony and  wisdom among all men with sandals, beards and tank-tops.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excitement at the news was heightened when it was revealed that, on  the same day, a technician in the CERN canteen opened a marmite sandwich  to discover a perfect image of esteemed physicist Professor Peter  Higgs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I’m happy to bring you another edition of &lt;em&gt;Get To Know Your Skepchicks&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;img src="http://img199.imageshack.us/img199/6559/elyse2small.jpg" alt="Elyse Close Up" width="213" height="320"&gt; Sorry there has been a lag between these posts but the Skepchick jet was “in the shop” and so I had to book a regular flight to Chicago. But it was completely worth the hassle of flying with the masses it because I had a total blast photographing and spending time with gorgeous and super-smart Elyse and I hope you will enjoy the results!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click below to read the interview!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; What was the first experience that got you thinking about skepticism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m getting better at making this ridiculously long story shorter, but I’m not getting better at making it less sad. &lt;img src="http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/1418/elyse5small.jpg" alt="Elyse 1" width="213" height="320"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002 my sister died and, shortly after, the Catholic Church rape brouhaha erupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead sister + raped babies = God, dude? WTF? Who are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not the same guy who helped me find my lost Carmex when I was in high school. He changed. And I was ready to move on… at least on to a different religion. I liked Buddhism for about a week, then realized that I’d rather be Catholic. At least as a Catholic I got to drink during Sunday mass. I also strongly believed that you can’t just change religions. You don’t get to choose what kind of god exists. You don’t get to tell God what you want him to think and how you want him to act and how you want his world to function. He tells you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back to school during this time. I took a genetics course and psychology course back to back and suddenly I was realizing that one, God didn’t do it and two, it’s pretty easy to trick yourself into believing whatever you want. So I walked away from God. And that was hard. I had to come to terms not only with the fact that everything I believed about myself, my life, and the universe was wrong, but also with the fact that most everyone I loved and respected and admired… who are all far smarter than I could ever pretend to be… were wrong, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there I realized that no god meant no afterlife meant no ghosts meant no spirits meant no psychics meant no connections with lost loved ones meant no encounters with the departed meant &lt;img src="http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/3936/elyse8small.jpg" alt="Elyse 2" width="320" height="213"&gt;no Ouija boards meant no tarot cards meant no one knew the future meant no one controlled or could change the future… and it spiraled on and on until I discovered that even vitamins were bullshit. And I spent like a week reading every single article on Snopes. At some point you just give up and you and your brain just agree to start asking more questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summarized: My sister died. A bunch of kids got raped. Snopes was awesome. I got skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; I think it’s fascinating how you look at skepticism as a way of protecting yourself from making mistakes. Could you explain that a little?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll believe anything at all. Anything. Really. I can make it make sense to me. So I’ve forced myself to stop and ask, “Does this really make sense? Find the holes in this.” Because if I don’t, I’ll be wearing magnet necklaces on my next ghost hunt and asking a phone psychic where I should spend my money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not even kidding, before I was a skeptic, I consulted a phone psychic on how to treat a chronic illness. Now that I’m a parent, I have a responsibility to not do stupid shit like that. I have a &lt;img src="http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/1525/elyse9small.jpg" alt="Elyse is cool" width="213" height="320"&gt;responsibility not to lose our house and all of our money seeking bad advice and chasing pyramid-scheme money. I need to not take crap medicine because I need to stay alive. No one is going to question everything for me. I’ve got to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; You recently organized a Skepticamp in Chicago. &lt;a href="http://ohioskeptic.com/skepchicamp/"&gt;Skepchicamp&lt;/a&gt; was extremely successful and I was very happy to be a small part of it. An event like that takes hours and hours of planning.&lt;br&gt;
What motivates you to do all that hard work for free? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love it. I love every second of being a part of the skeptical community and I want more of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I spend a whole lot of time doing a whole lot of nothing. Most days I don’t have an excuse for neglecting my child and my housework. Coming up with a plan like Skepchicamp gives me the opportunity to say, “I can’t do it. I’m working.” And that’s really cool because saying I’m working makes me feel like I’m a grown-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, and I’ll murder people if I have to use Facebook apps to pass the time. &lt;img src="http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/4751/elyse3small.jpg" alt="Elyse Close up 2" width="213" height="320"&gt;When whatever you’re doing to otherwise kill time is less fun than pretending to farm, it’s time to put yourself on a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; What advice would you give to someone interested in organizing a similar event?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get a great planning team together. Keep everyone motivated. Don’t take your event planning too seriously. Don’t take your event too seriously. Only bother fixing the fixable stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask your venue if they have enough chairs for at least half of your attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/tensekids"&gt;Tense Kids&lt;/a&gt; to play at your camp. I think the band was one of those extra touches that made the day/night amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; You are one of my favorite bloggers because you have such a sharp wit and you are so funny and honest. That isn’t a question, I just thought you should know that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re one of my favorite artists because you’re so awesome. I just thought you should know that back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’d say that I’m probably more “lacking a filter” than “honest”… &lt;img src="http://img717.imageshack.us/img717/9546/elyse16small.jpg" alt="Elyse is Awesome" width="213" height="320"&gt;but it works for me. And it’s harder to change than to not. So I run with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; On a similar note, I really enjoyed the “&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/02/what-pregnant-women-wont-tell-you-ever/"&gt;What Pregnant Women Won’t Tell You&lt;/a&gt;” post, and I was wondering: will you carry my baby for me? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Because I love you. But I’ll be charging you a hefty fee. And you have to agree to give up booze with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; How do you plan to respond when the Oprah network offers you a daily talk show on skeptical parenting? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sell the fuck out and tell you all that it’s your jobs to think for yourselves cuz I’ll be too rich to care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah, don’t read this next part:&lt;br&gt;
And I’ll secretly funnel money into Skepchick and leak information… but really quietly because you don’t fuck with Oprah. No one cares about the mafia anymore in Chicago. You don’t need Capone when you’ve got Oprah running your town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; If you did get a network television show and could book anyone, who would you chose as your first guest and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to say Jon Stewart. Because I love him. &lt;img src="http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/3500/elyse20small.jpg" alt="Elyse Kicks Ass" width="320" height="213"&gt;And I want to make out with him. And I really want to talk to him… and pick his mind. He’s brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem is that I can’t be funny in front of Jon Stewart. I guess I don’t have to be if we’re making out. So yeah, Jon Stewart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; What do you think are the most important issues in skepticism today? Where should we direct our energy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines. There is no reason that the children of wealthy, educated, insured parents should be dying of the fucking measles in 2010. The measles. Does anyone even get how absolutely crazy that is? No, seriously. Grab your iPhone. Open the calendar app. Look at the date today. Close your calendar. Open your Chipotle app. Order me a burrito. Check the weather. Check what traffic is like between your house and Chipotle. Set the burrito pick up time for how ever long the traffic app will say it will take to get there. Open Echofon and update your status as you get my burrito #livetweetgettingElyseaburrito. Open your Facebook app. Write on my wall that you’re home with my burrito.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I eat the burrito, look at your phone and think about what you just did and how easy it was, and put that into perspective that KIDS ARE STILL DYING OF THE FUCKING MEASLES. In America. In homes with 6-figure incomes. Go back to your iPhone. Look at the calendar again. Enter a note on today’s date saying, “This makes me sad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; You walk outside and encounter Sylvia Browne and Jenny McCarthy in a hot oil wrestling match on your lawn. What do you do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img8.imageshack.us/img8/7896/elyse22small.jpg" alt="Elyse is Rad" width="213" height="320"&gt;Light a match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No no no… that’s not nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light a match then try to put the grease fire out with water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. That’s not nice either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light a match, throw some water on the grease fire, come to terms with the fact that I’m not a nice person, then make a dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives and read a book by the fire. If the smell starts to bug me, I’ll call 9-1-1 and let the news media report on how I’m a hero for trying to save their lives… but that, tragically, I failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And wow, by the way, the homeowners association is going to be pissed when they see that I’ve burned up all the grass. I may have to rent out some womb space to pay off that fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; What online resources do you use on a regular basis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouPorn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Answers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for me, I’m part of this incredible group of brilliant women bloggers. And behind the scenes, there’s absolutely nothing you can ask them that’s off limits. Sometimes I feel like I’ve managed to infiltrate a team of super-human women. When you’re a part of that, your resources take care of themselves. If one of you can’t answer my question, one of you knows where to point me to find that answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if that’s not working, the second best way to find information is to go to Yahoo Answers, find the question you need to know the answer to, read the answer, and do exactly the opposite of &lt;img src="http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/9926/elyse1small.jpg" alt="Elyse is Bitchen" width="213" height="320"&gt;that. I’m not even kidding. Yahoo’s birth control advice to me was “get drunk and have unprotected sex”… two weeks later, First Response and First Response Digital both told me that I should have done the opposite. As it turns out, not getting drunk and not having unprotected sex is a great plan for not getting pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, YouPorn is good for not getting pregnant. Despite what Y!A says, you cannot get pregnant from watching porn by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless my husband is reading this… then it’s totally possible to get pregnant from watching porn by yourself while your husband is out of town. And internet porn specifically gives you a 93% chance of that baby being Hispanic. And that thing about the drunk sex was me being funny. I do that a lot. I make jokes. You know that, Brian. We live together. I’m always making jokes. Like that one time I sent you a bouquet of “get well soon” balloons at work… that’s good stuff! One day you and me and Moose and Rosita are going to laugh like crazy over this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; What one book and one podcast would you recommend to people who want to learn more about skepticism or science?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I’ve spent 3 days trying to come up with a good answer to this. And really, I can’t come up with one book and one podcast… at least nothing that everyone isn’t already reading and listening &lt;img src="http://img237.imageshack.us/img237/7253/elyseandmoosesmall.jpg" alt="Elyse and Moose!" width="320" height="249"&gt;to already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess I’ll go with the shameless self-promotion of &lt;a href="http://foundationbeyondbelief.org/fbbpodcast/"&gt;Podcast Beyond Belief&lt;/a&gt; and for a book, I recommend &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictably_Irrational"&gt;Predictably Irrational&lt;/a&gt; by Dan Ariely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But mostly Podcast Beyond Belief. Because we’re new. And we need love.&lt;br&gt;
And we deserve that love. Gimme sommadat love!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christianity flees power as Jesus did; Christianism seeks it above everything else. And there is nothing more powerful than killing others, except for torturing them. Hence my distinction, which I make from no authority. I merely think that declaring a homeless, apolitical, non-violent hippie in first century Palestine as someone who would bless a twenty-first century terrorist militia in North America is a bit of a stretch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny thing, that: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/lets_keep_agreeing.php"&gt;that was my whole point&lt;/a&gt;. Modern Christianity is nothing but Christianists, then, and it's a distinction that makes no difference. His Pope runs an official state, a member of the UN, that is dripping with extravagantly displayed wealth. Would his homeless, apolitical, non-violent hippie bless this man, this Pontifex Maximus, this Goldfather?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/andrew_sullivan_replies/goldpope.jpeg" width="315" height="297" alt="goldpope.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps Urban II, the man who fired off the First Crusade, would be a man more to the hippie's taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/andrew_sullivan_replies/crusader.jpeg" width="400" height="577" alt="crusader.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think I've missed any distinction at all. If your Palestinian hippie were here today, he'd be horrified and damn the whole mad carnival that has been established in his name, and they're all Christianists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that matter, the weird theology that the old hippie espoused would be a ghastly basis for a world, and any culture in which Jesus would be comfortable would be a nightmare for the rest of us. &lt;/p&gt;

Here’s our &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/women-who-rule/"&gt;second group&lt;/a&gt; of super-cool charitable nonprofits run by women for women (or, in this case, girls).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:292px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/Girl-and-Molly-B-2-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Girl and Molly B (2) (2)" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/Girl-and-Molly-B-2-2.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="188"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Girls on the Run Founder Molly Barker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.girlswritenow.org/gwn/"&gt;Girls Write Now&lt;/a&gt; – Founded by Maya Nussbaum, this awesome after-school organization in New York City pairs underserved or at-risk girls ages 13 to 20 with adult female mentors. The literacy-based program provides girls with weekly one-on-one mentor sessions, monthly writing workshops, college prep seminars, and a chance to publish their work in a “Girls Read Now” anthology. For the past five years, Girls Write Now mentees have had a 100 percent college acceptance rate. Serious pomp and circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://girlsforachange.typepad.com/national/"&gt;Girls for a Change&lt;/a&gt; – Founded by Whitney H. Smith, this national leadership program gives urban middle-school and high-school girls the tools to make social change happen. Women volunteers provide leadership training, workshops, and a national Girls Camp summit that brings more than 2,500 young women together every year to learn about the power of stepping up to the plate. The girls also gain access to a network of community leaders, and even legislators, who can help them effect real change. Lead on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.girlsontherun.org/"&gt;Girls on the Run&lt;/a&gt; – This impressive national outfit, started by Molly Barker, combines running and life lessons to bolster health and self-esteem in young girls. Volunteer coaches administer 24 lessons each year, teaching girls about teamwork, running practices, and relating to the world at large. The year culminates in a 5K race, where each girl matches with an adult volunteer running buddy. Girls with better self-esteem, body images, and general health? Let’s run with that.&lt;/p&gt;

Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m gonna make you famous, baby! Famous! All you have to do is submit some writing to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skepchick is now accepting your submissions for guest posts/rants/poetry about interpretive dance/essays. We will be picking one post a week and running it in place of the old Wednesday Afternoon Inquisition. You can write whatever you want, and submit it. Each Wednesday, we’ll choose one submission and post it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s preferable that this submission is previously unpublished. If you’re not a great writer, that’s not a big deal; we can clean up your article (within reason).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you guys get me some things to post, I’ll post one next week! So get writing! And when you’re done, send it to &lt;a href="mailto:skepchick@skepchick.org"&gt;skepchick@skepchick.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

voted down the attempt by the Ministry of Justice to reduce conditional fee arrangements (CFAs) for defamation, privacy and malicious falsehood cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Best news report &lt;a href="http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;amp;storycode=45251&amp;amp;c=1"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The current rate for the uplift in a CFA is up to 100% - and the government would like to reduce this to 10%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(The very brief draft statutory instrument is &lt;a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2010/draft/ukdsi_9780111496510_en_1"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt; and explanatory notes &lt;a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2010/draft/em/ukdsiem_9780111496510_en.pdf"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So why does this matter?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, first of all it is important to know what a CFA actually is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A CFA provides for an additional amount to be paid to the lawyers of a party in certain civil cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is an amount over and above what the lawyers have actually incurred in a case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a windfall for the lawyers, but with a slight catch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if a party's lawyer bills £50,000, the CFA will operate when that party is successful to give the lawyer a windfall of up to an additional £50,000.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is paid by the losing side, on top of the normal legal costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And this is money which goes directly to the law firm, not the client - however poor the client is, and however much the client is not one of the "rich and the powerful".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given the organisation of many law firms as partnerships, this windfall goes to the profits of the partners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there is a catch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the party with the CFA loses, then their lawyer gets nothing.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The losing party will still have to pay the the winning party's costs, which may also include the other side's CFA uplift.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is, therefore, a downside; there is a risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The uplift is justified as covering the risk of the lawyer: a windfall of doubling their fees for no extra work, against not getting any fees at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But are there real risks being adopted here by the lawyers involved?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Undoubtedly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But do the risks warrant the invariable 100% uplift adopted in libel cases?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government, following a consultation exercise, thinks not: see paragraphs 7 and 8 of the &lt;a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2010/draft/em/ukdsiem_9780111496510_en.pdf"&gt; Explanatory Notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so, the government, in a bold move, proposed cutting the uplift from 100% to 10%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That means that the successful lawyers will now only get an additional 10% windfall of unearned income.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, there is a group of City lawyers strongly opposing this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are doing this, we are told, to ensure there is "access to justice".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there is nothing in the government's proposal which goes to abolishing the CFA regime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government's proposal is only that lawyers should only have a reward of 10% of unearned income against their fees instead of a 100% when they take a case on a CFA basis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There will actually be nothing stopping law firms acting for just the same clients on a 10% CFA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I doubt that even City libel lawyers will be callous enough to turn actually winnable cases down because they will get only 10% windfall instead of a 100% one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or they won't say so aloud, anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There will be a great smoke and fog generated as the government presses to limit these uplifts - one expects "access to justice" to be invoked again and again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all this really means is that libel lawyers are threatening not do for 10% what they are currently doing for 100%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, "access to justice" is in their hands, not in those of the government's.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do wonder if they are bluffing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After all, there will still be libel and privacy litigation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;For media lawyers, like the poor, are always with us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I plan to blog more extensively on this in a few days, including a full response to an upcoming blogpost by &lt;a href="http://www.tom-watson.co.uk/"&gt;Tom Watson MP&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) When challenged about their bizarre and provably false beliefs, a lot of antivaxxers claim that they have personal experience with their kid. That’s anecdotal and uses a small sample size, and so is prone to all sorts of logical failings. But what if the sample size is much larger and uses scientific reasoning? Then you get something like &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2010/03/21/lifesaving_safe_vaccines/"&gt;this good spanking of antivax nonsense by an actual pediatrician&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip o’ the syringe to David Whalley.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) The Australian Vaccination Network is one of the most pernicious and awful of the antivax groups, as regular readers know. They may be on their way out — science, apparently, &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; inoculate us against such infections — but it’s still worth keeping up with the sort of offal they spew, since other groups do it as well. &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/blog/the-truth-behind-the-avn-claims/"&gt;This article by The Australian Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent exposé of AVN mendacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Healthday &lt;a href="http://healthday.com/Article.asp?AID=637218"&gt;has an alarming article&lt;/a&gt; about the San Diego 2008 measles outbreak which exposed over 800 people because one family decided not to vaccinate their kid. Yes, &lt;em&gt;one family&lt;/em&gt; started an minor epidemic that cost over $170,000 to contain and nearly killed one infant. I hope antivaxxers are proud of that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Orac once again leaps into the fray with &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4431"&gt;a magnificent exposure of some bold antivax lies&lt;/a&gt;. It’s amazing to me just how low some antivaxxers are wiling to go — cheating, twisting, distorting, and out-and-out lying — to promote their agenda of bringing back preventable diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say they care about kids. Maybe they do. But making sure children get measles, rubella, pertussis, and other life-and-limb-threatening diseases is sure a funny way of showing it.&lt;/p&gt;

But how do you know where to send your money? Just follow the stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, every celebrity has a cause near-and-dear to their heart. Promoting non-profit organizations is almost part and parcel of being on the big screen (or the small one, for that matter). &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sienna-miller/the-spirit-of-haiti_b_510889.html"&gt;Sienna Miller&lt;/a&gt; is one of the latest luminaries to join the ranks of starlets on a mission, working to raise money for Haiti as Global Ambassador for International Medical Corps. (Watch her pitch, below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/nTrlfQ5rSO0%26ap%3D%252526fmt%253D18&amp;amp;width=590&amp;amp;height=442" width="590" height="442"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you actually listen to what she’s saying, it’s no different from what you might read in the paper, on a .org website, or a pamphlet sent in the mail. But it’s in a pretty package, and if you want your hair to look like hers, well then, you must want to donate your dough to the same place, right? Or maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do celebrity endorsements make you more likely to get involved, give money, or simply care about an issue?  Take our poll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re using the day to “&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=107131439318135&amp;amp;index=1"&gt;raise awareness about the Roman Catholic Church and its policies on contraception&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We will have a booth on the Quad on Good Friday to distribute information about the Church’s policies, especially those related to contraception and HIV/AIDS. The group will also be distributing free condoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just over a year ago, the Pope told Africans that condoms actually help to propagate AIDS rather than prevent it. Statements like these are irresponsible and illustrate the disconnect of the Vatican hierarchy from reality. Nearly two thirds of the estimated 33 million people with HIV/AIDS live in Africa.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since many people will already have religion in the back of their minds, I love the positive way AAF is getting people to think &lt;em&gt;critically&lt;/em&gt; about the church and some of its more dangerous beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know exactly how creationists will reply, though, since I've heard it often enough. She's making a theological argument, they'll say, claiming to know God's intent and making an assumption of his goals. It will be a restatement of the old chestnut, "God works in mysterious ways."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that's not the argument here. Imperfections and sub-optimal properties are an outcome of evolutionary theory; this is a positive argument that observations of the world best fit a model positing a history of accidents and refinements constrained along lines of descent. If the creationists want to complain, they first have to propose a set of predictions that would discriminate between accident and design, and starting from a god who can do anything at any whim is not a fruitful source of hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/design_flaws_support_evolution.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/A0tnSlazb9c" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270052830653"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=13134">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4f5191ee453ae0d7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion &amp; Spirituality"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">Monsters of Folk: Dear God Video</title><published>2010-03-31T16:00:04Z</published><updated>2010-03-31T16:00:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/03/monsters-of-folk-dear-god-video/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the opener from Monster of Folk’s self-titled album: &lt;em&gt;Dear God (Sincerely M.O.F.)&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Dear god, I’m trying hard to reach you&lt;br&gt;
Dear god, I see your face in all I do&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes it’s so hard to believe in&lt;br&gt;
Good god I know you have your reasons &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear god I see you move the mountains&lt;br&gt;
Dear god I see you moving trees&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes it’s nothing to believe in&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes it’s everything I see &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I’ve been thinking about,&lt;br&gt;
And I’ve been breaking it down without an answer&lt;br&gt;
I know I’m thinking aloud but if your love’s&lt;br&gt;
Still around why do we suffer?&lt;br&gt;
Why do we suffer? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear god, I wish that I could touch you&lt;br&gt;
How strange sometimes I feel I almost do&lt;br&gt;
And then I’m back behind the glass again&lt;br&gt;
Oh god what keeps you out it keeps me in &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I’ve been thinking about,&lt;br&gt;
And I’ve been breaking down without an answer&lt;br&gt;
I know I’m thinking aloud but if your love’s&lt;br&gt;
Still around why do we suffer?&lt;br&gt;
Why do we suffer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lyrics&lt;br&gt;
Dear God, hope you got the letter, and&lt;br&gt;
I pray you can make it better down here.&lt;br&gt;
I don’t mean a big reduction in the price of beer&lt;br&gt;
but all the people that you made in your image, see&lt;br&gt;
them starving on their feet ’cause they don’t get&lt;br&gt;
enough to eat from God, I can’t believe in you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear God, sorry to disturb you, but I feel that I should be heard&lt;br&gt;
loud and clear. We all need a big reduction in amount of tears&lt;br&gt;
and all the people that you made in your image, see them fighting&lt;br&gt;
in the street ’cause they can’t make opinions meet about God,&lt;br&gt;
I can’t believe in you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you make disease, and the diamond blue? Did you make&lt;br&gt;
mankind after we made you? And the devil too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear God, don’t know if you noticed, but… your name is on&lt;br&gt;
a lot of quotes in this book, and us crazy humans wrote it, you&lt;br&gt;
should take a look, and all the people that you made in your&lt;br&gt;
image still believing that junk is true. Well I know it ain’t, and&lt;br&gt;
so do you, dear God, I can’t believe in I don’t believe in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t believe in heaven and hell. No saints, no sinners, no&lt;br&gt;
devil as well. No pearly gates, no thorny crown. You’re always&lt;br&gt;
letting us humans down. The wars you bring, the babes you&lt;br&gt;
drown. Those lost at sea and never found, and it’s the same the&lt;br&gt;
whole world ’round. The hurt I see helps to compound that&lt;br&gt;
Father, Son and Holy Ghost is just somebody’s unholy hoax,&lt;br&gt;
and if you’re up there you’d perceive&lt;br&gt;
that’s my heart’s here upon my sleeve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing I don’t believe in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca Watson</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270052202302"><id gr:original-id="http://www.imachordata.com/?p=300">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/33c939f1c1406bc5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Our Future: Hot n’ Tasty?</title><published>2010-03-31T10:55:59Z</published><updated>2010-03-31T10:55:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/hjt7rL3qeJE/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.imachordata.com/?p=300"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Climate change.

Charles Darwin's visit to the Galapagos Archipelago has been celebrated time and again for its influence on his evolutionary thoughts, but I have to wonder what would have happened if the Beagle skipped the Galapagos and visited Madagascar instead. What would Darwin have made of the animals which had been evolving in splendid isolation on the African island? Would "Darwin's lemurs", rather than Darwin's finches, be among the most recognizable icons of evolution?

Answers to such questions are beyond our grasp, but the diverse array of lemurs which dwell on Madagascar are a stunning example of evolutionary diversification on an island. After the ancestors of modern-day lemurs rafted across the Mozambique Channel between 50 and 60 million years ago, the primates evolved and diversified into a variety of forms, including the 100 or so species endemic to the island today. As suggested by a new study published this week in PLoS One, there may even be more species yet to be found.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/europe/25vatican.html"&gt;Vatican Declined to Defrock U.S. Priest Who  Abused Boys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/europe/25vatican.html"&gt;&lt;img title="25vatican2_337-395-articleLarge" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/25vatican2_337-395-articlelarge.jpg?w=440&amp;amp;h=249" alt="" width="440" height="249"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top Vatican officials — including the future &lt;a title="More articles about Benedict XVI." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/benedict_xvi/index.html?inline=nyt-per"&gt;Pope  Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; — did not defrock a priest who molested as many as 200  deaf boys, even though several American bishops repeatedly warned them  that failure to act on the matter could embarrass the church, according  to church files newly unearthed as part of a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal correspondence from bishops in Wisconsin directly to  Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future pope, shows that while church  officials tussled over whether the priest should be dismissed, their  highest priority was protecting the church from scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents emerge as Pope Benedict is facing other accusations that  he and direct subordinates often did not alert civilian authorities or  discipline priests involved in sexual abuse when he served as an  archbishop in Germany and as the &lt;a title="More articles about the Roman Catholic Church." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/r/roman_catholic_church/index.html?inline=nyt-org"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt;’s  chief doctrinal enforcer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is almost as horrifying as these revelations of the systemic sexual abuse of children by pedophile priests and the effort on the part of Church officials to cover it up, apparently going all the way to the upper echelons of the Vatican, is the reaction from the Vatican in the last week.  Specifically, I am referring to the absolutely staggering level of &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/cognitivedissonance.html"&gt;cognitive dissonance&lt;/a&gt; being displayed by the Vatican regarding any responsibility their institution has in this scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider, if you will, the various reactions from the Vatican as it attempts to spin its way out of this mess, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/opinion/31dowd.html"&gt;outlined by this NYTimes Op-Ed…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First: Declare any new revelation old and unimportant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At  Palm Sunday Mass at St. Patrick’s, Archbishop Timothy Dolan of New York  bemoaned that the “recent tidal wave of headlines about abuse of minors  by some few priests, this time in Ireland, Germany, and a re-run of an  old story from Wisconsin, has knocked us to our knees once again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few priests? At this point, it feels like an international battalion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A re-run of an old story? So sorry to remind you, Archbishop, that one  priest, Father Lawrence Murphy, who showed no remorse and suffered no  punishment from “Rottweiler” Ratzinger, abused as many as 200 deaf  children in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archbishop Dolan compared the pope to  Jesus, saying he was “now suffering some of the same unjust accusations,  shouts of the mob, and scourging at the pillar,” and “being daily  crowned with thorns by groundless innuendo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second: Blame  somebody else  —  even if it’s this pope’s popular predecessor, on the  fast track to sainthood.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vienna’s Cardinal Christoph Schönborn  defended Pope Benedict this week, saying that then-Cardinal Ratzinger’s  attempt in 1995 to investigate the former archbishop of Vienna for  allegedly molesting youths in a monastery was barred by advisers close  to Pope John Paul II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third: Say black is white.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his  blog, Archbishop Dolan blasted church critics while stating: “The Church  needs criticism; we want it; we welcome it; we do a good bit of it  ourselves,” adding: “We do not expect any special treatment. …so bring  it on.” Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth: Demonize gays, as Karl Rove did in 2004.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ad in The Times on Tuesday, Bill Donohue, the Catholic League  president, offered this illumination: “The Times continues to  editorialize about the ‘pedophilia crisis,’ when all along it’s been a  homosexual crisis. Eighty percent of the victims of priestly sexual  abuse are male and most of them are post-pubescent. While homosexuality  does not cause predatory behavior, and most gay priests are not  molesters, most of the molesters have been gay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donohue is still  talking about the problem as an indiscretion rather than a crime. If it  mostly involves men and boys, that’s partly because priests for many  years had unquestioned access to boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fifth: Blame the victims.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fr. Lawrence Murphy apparently began his predatory behavior in  Wisconsin in the 1950s,” Donohue protested, “yet the victims’ families  never contacted the police until the mid-1970s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sixth: Throw  gorilla dust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donohue asserts that “the common response of all  organizations, secular as well as religious,” to abuse cases “was to  access therapy and reinstate the patient.” Really? Where in heaven’s  name does that information come from? It’s absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And finally,  seventh:&lt;/strong&gt; Use the Cheney omnipotence defense, most famously employed in  the Valerie Plame case. Vice President Cheney claimed that his lofty  position meant that the very act of spilling a secret, even with  dastardly intent, declassified it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vatican lawyers will argue in  negligence cases brought by abuse victims that the pope has immunity as a  head of state and that bishops who allowed an abuse culture, endlessly  recirculating like dirty fountain water, were not Vatican employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they worked for Enron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ouch, that pretty well sums up the response from the Catholic Church to date.  But why is it that the Vatican is so resistant to accepting any sort of responsibility for these crimes, or the fact that some people wish to even investigate said crimes and the Church’s potential role in them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem has to do with the notion of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_infallibility"&gt;papal infallibility&lt;/a&gt;, which is the idea that the Pope, being God’s anointed representative on Earth, speaks for God in all matters.  This idea has been codified in Catholic doctrine for centuries, ever since the First Vatican Council, and states unequivocally that the Pope is not to be questioned in matters of faith &amp;amp; morality.  But now, in the 21st century, we see very clearly the danger in such thinking.  I think it can be best summed up in this &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125324218"&gt;NPR article on the subject…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current Vatican would likely resist openness with every fiber of its  being. Secrecy has been considered the mode of operations by the ruling  class of the church. To reverse this policy, by allowing investigators  into these inner workings, is hardly imaginable. For the past 150 years,  since the First Vatican Council declared the pope infallible in faith  and morals, the Catholic hierarchy has run against the tide of history.  While nations and institutions were toppling monarchical structures and  embracing democracy, the church’s hierarchy was enhancing its power and  control. Papal infallibility elevated that office to new levels of  influence and invested it with an image of moral perfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s the crux of the matter, right there.  When an organization such as the Vatican so deeply convinces itself that it’s doing the work of God, it naturally assumes the role of being unquestionable.  This is one of the problems I have with religion in general, and it should be noted that numerous other religious groups have had trouble with sexual abuse scandals (just note how the &lt;a href="http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070415/southern-baptist-abuse-cases-garnering-more-attention-warnings/index.html"&gt;Southern Baptist Convention is having similar troubles&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By extension, clinging to such a deeply engrained religious mentality of infallibility, “speaking The [one and only] Truth”, representing God, whatever, is anathema to the spirit of free inquiry which is necessary to expose falsehood and show us reality as it is (not as we’d like it to be).  By hiding behind their cloaks of religious rhetoric &amp;amp; superiority, the Vatican displays for all to see just how corrupting the thinking of the true-believer can really be.  It also displays the necessity of free inquiry into &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; matters, including those of various forms of religious dogma, no matter how docile they may seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And try as the Vatican might to cast blame elsewhere while dodging their own responsibility, now that Pandora’s box has been opened, nothing will (or should) stop the investigation into these crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final thought, let me conclude with this: Whenever we surrender our capacity for reason and critical thinking to someone who claims to speak for an ultimate authority, such as a god, how can we be surprised when the inevitable atrocities occur?  History is filled with the unfortunate results of such irrationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, we’ve learned our lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Jonathan Eisen of &lt;a href="http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Tree Of Life&lt;/a&gt; blog (and Academic Editor in Chief of PLoS Biology) to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Jonathan Eisen pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Jonathan%20Eisen%20pic.jpg" width="300" height="448" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;I am an evolutionary biologist interested in how organisms invent new functions. In particular I am interested in what causes differences in this "evolvability" between organisms.  Or, in other words, the evolution of evolvability.  I study this mostly in microbes, because, well, microbes rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was born in Boston, MA and grew up in Bethesda, MD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of background - I have always been interest in microbes and their evolution.  Though I do not remember, I &lt;a href="http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2008/01/what-kid-would-want-to-study-bacterial.html" title=""&gt;even wrote an essay on this in 9th grade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In college (Harvard) I was originally an East Asian Studies major but switched to Biology after coming to my senses. I worked in multiple labs as an undergrad, first studying hummingbird circadian rhythms, then plant physiological ecology, and then found my true calling by working in a lab studying deep sea organisms and the microbial symbionts that live inside of them.  I liked it so much I worked in the lab after graduating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then went to grad school at Stanford, originally to work on butterfly evolution, but then came to my senses and switched to working on how microbes protect their genomes from mutations (and in particular, why the mutation rates and patterns varied within and between species).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting that PhD thing I moved to The Institute for Genomic Research, where I was for eight years, and there I worked on sequencing microbial genomes and also on developing computational methods to study the evolution of microbes via analysis of their genome sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I moved to where I am now - UC Davis. I moved here b/c of many things: (1) they have one of the best evolution and ecology departments in the country (2) my wife is from Berkeley and Davis, (3) we wanted to be closer to family in N. California (4) I like small towns that are obsessed with cycling (like Davis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) I want to create a full and complete field guide to microbes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) I want all the worlds scientific publications to be free (really free, not just at no cost - free as in freedom, that is)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) I live for my kids, Analia (5) and Andres (3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the most interesting and important thing is accelerating the pace of scientific discovery and education through the use of a combination of tools (web included) as well as opening up the restrictions that have been historically placed on knowledge (e.g., fees for access).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these have been very important in communicating with the broader world.  I view all of these things as tools to experiment with.  None are good or bad in and of themselves but all can be used to communicate science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any cool &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Participants_Blogroll/" title=""&gt;science blogs by the participants&lt;/a&gt; at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure when I discovered them.  I think when I went to SciFoo camp years ago I really became aware of the potential value of blogging. My favorites come and go.  I try to sample from lots of different ones and not read the same ones over and over.  Just like with scientific journals and scientific papers, some are good, some are bad but most are a mix, with bad and good and everything in between.  So I like to look around at different ones, more by topic than by author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I &lt;a href="http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2010/01/enough-w-good-here-are-top10-problems-w.html" title=""&gt;already blogged about this here&lt;/a&gt; (tongue in cheek post about what was bad at the meeting - this is really about what was good in case you can't tell  )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I also wrote about what I &lt;a href="http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2010/01/top-11-things-i-learned-at-science.html" title=""&gt;learned at the meeting here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The closeups are beautiful, but now the ESA &lt;a href="http://webservices.esa.int/blog/post/7/1073"&gt;has posted a &lt;em&gt;stunning&lt;/em&gt; full-body shot of Phobos&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/images/6_7926_phobos_nadir.tif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/03/phobos_hires.jpg" alt="phobos_hires" title="phobos_hires" width="610" height="505"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[As usual, click the pix to embiggen.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution is an amazing 9 meters (30 feet!) per pixel. Clearly, Phobos has been through a lot. Mars orbits near the inner edge of the asteroid belt, which may explain how battered its surface is. The grooves were once thought to be ripples from a big impact that created the whopping crater Stickney (not seen in this view, but you can see it really well &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/04/09/phobos-up-close-and-very-personal/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but are now thought to be from boulders rolling around in the low gravity of the moon, perhaps ejected rocks from various impacts landing back down in the feeble gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the one winding path going from the upper left to lower right: that looks very much like a boulder bounced its way across the surface! The curvy path is an indication of the changing gravity field of Phobos: it’s not a smooth sphere, but a lumpy potato, so the surface gravity — what you’d think of as &amp;quot;down&amp;quot; if you were standing there — changes greatly depending on position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/images/7_7926_phobos_anaglyph.tif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/03/phobos_anaglyph.jpg" alt="phobos_anaglyph" title="phobos_anaglyph" width="300" height="256"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;They also put together this stunning 3D anaglyph. You can really see the depth of the craters and grooves on the surface. Run, don’t walk, to get a pair of red/green glasses for this one! Phobos really pops out of the screen. The depth and clarity of the 3D is amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pass of the moon was designed to obtain as much scientific data as possible before the launch of the Russian mission called &lt;a href="http://www.russianspaceweb.com/phobos_grunt.html"&gt;Phobos-Grunt&lt;/a&gt;, which will land on the moon and send a sample of its surface back to Earth for study. Phobos looks an awful lot like an asteroid itself, and its origin is still something of a mystery. More data like these — and obtaining a sample of its surface material! — may clear up its story once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;

He has a Ph.D. in Biophysics and Computational Biology and currently teaches at Biola University. He is a Fellow of the Discovery Institute and the author of several books that I have not read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter has devoted most of his blogging efforts to attacks on science. This seems to be the most popular strategy of the Intelligent Design Creationists in spite of their claims to the contrary. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His latest posting is &lt;a href="http://darwins-god.blogspot.com/2010/03/why-evolutionists-say-evolution-is-fact.html"&gt;Why Evolutionists Say Evolution is a Fact&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Evolutionists say evolution is a fact, every bit as much as gravity is a fact. That is remarkable. We see and even feel gravity everyday. Evolution, on the other hand, entails rather dramatic, one-time, events that were supposed to have occurred long ago, when no one was around to witness them. How could we be sure of such a theory? There must be some extremely powerful and compelling scientific evidence for evolution to make it a fact as gravity is a fact. That is what one would think. But, surprisingly, there is no such evidence. When evolutionists try to explain why evolution is a fact, it is a tremendous anticlimax. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Hunter has not been paying attention. Many of us have written on the subject of evolution as a fact [&lt;a href="http://bioinfo.med.utoronto.ca/Evolution_by_Accident/Evolution_Fact_and_Theory.html"&gt;Evolution Is a Fact and a Theory&lt;/a&gt;]. Evidence for the "factness" of evolution is overwhelming. It ranges from evidence that chimps and humans descend from a common ancestor to evidence that the frequencies of alleles are changing in populations as we speak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That last point is important. Evolution is &lt;u&gt;defined&lt;/u&gt; as a change in the frequency of alleles in a population over time and as long as we can demonstrate that change, the fact of evolution can't be disputed. I wonder how Cornelius Hunter explains the differences between the Japanese and the Masai of Kenya and Tanzania? I wonder how he explains the fact that native North Americans are practically homogeneous for O blood type? I wonder how he explains the many studies that have directly tracked heritable change over many generations?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why are the IDiots so stubborn and so ignorant? Why couldn't Cornelius Hunter demonstrate that he understands why evolution is a fact while disputing some forms of macroevolution? That would be a sensible position. Instead, he comes off looking like an IDiot.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-6109687378492457735?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270047769195"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/somebody_asked_about_syracuse.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f1da5f8afe647b38</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">Somebody asked about Syracuse University…</title><published>2010-03-31T15:13:32Z</published><updated>2010-03-31T15:13:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/INQCdo40hUo/somebody_asked_about_syracuse.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/somebody_asked_about_syracuse.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'd hate to think that someone at Syracuse University might be driving to RIT tomorrow to hear my lecture, since I've been invited by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=18129534066"&gt;The Atheists, Agnostics and Freethinkers Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to speak at Syracuse &lt;i&gt;next week&lt;/i&gt;, on 8 April.

The UK set a parliamentary Science and Technology Committee to review the affair and see if there was any substance to the claims of the denialists, and the &lt;a href="http://watchingthedeniers.wordpress.com/2010/03/30/climategate-inquiry-no-proof-of-fraud-better-disclosure-called-for/"&gt;report of the inquiry has been released&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the much cited phrases in the leaked e-mails—&amp;quot;trick&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hiding the decline&amp;quot;—the Committee considers that they were colloquial terms used in private e-mails and the balance of evidence is that they were not part of a systematic attempt to mislead.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Insofar as the Committee was able to consider accusations of dishonesty against CRU, the Committee considers that there is no case to answer.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Committee found no reason in this inquiry to challenge the scientific consensus as expressed by Professor Beddington, the Government Chief Scientific Adviser, that "global warming is happening [and] that it is induced by human activity". But this was not an inquiry into the science produced by CRU and it will be for the Scientific Appraisal Panel, announced by the University on 22 March, to determine whether the work of CRU has been soundly built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well. Case closed, right? Or is this another sign of the &lt;i&gt;Global Conspiracy to Hide the Truth™&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The committee did have one mild criticism of the Climate Research Unit. They said that while the policy of holding some of the raw data privately is in line with common research practice and not grounds for complaint, they would like the policy to change…and I agree. Openness is always good in science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/that_settles_that_then_i_hope.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/uI7XlkKmRdA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270047769194"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/botanical_wednesday_the_convol.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/78a915dd3d4fcf6c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Organisms"/><title type="html">Botanical Wednesday: the convoluted things some will do for sex</title><published>2010-03-31T14:06:51Z</published><updated>2010-03-31T14:06:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/XXKE97Fp4dc/botanical_wednesday_the_convol.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/botanical_wednesday_the_convol.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/botanical_wednesday_the_convol/coryanthes_speciosa.jpeg" width="500" height="347" alt="coryanthes_speciosa.jpeg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Coryanthes speciosa&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

And in most branches of medicine, preventing diseases, or detecting early signs and treating them pre-emptively before the symptoms appear, is an important art.Not in psychiatry. At least not yet. But the prospect of predicting the onset of psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia, and of &amp;quot;early intervention&amp;quot; to try to prevent them, is a hot topic at the moment.Schizophrenia and similar illnesses usually begin with a period of months or years, generally during adolescence, during which subtle symptoms gradually appear. This is called the &amp;quot;prodrome&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;at risk mental state&amp;quot;. The full-blown disorder then hits later. If we could detect the prodromal phase and successfully treat it, we could save people from developing the illness. That&amp;#39;s the plan anyway.But many kids have &amp;quot;prodromal symptoms&amp;quot; during adolescence and never go on to get ill, so treating everyone with mild symptoms of psychosis would mean unnecessarily treating a lot of people. There&amp;#39;s also the question of whether we can successfully prevent progression to illness at all, and there have been only a few very small trials looking at whether treatments work for that - but that&amp;#39;s another story.Stephan Ruhrmann et al. claim to have found a good way of predicting who&amp;#39;ll go on to develop psychosis in their paper Prediction of Psychosis in Adolescents and Young Adults at High Risk. This is based on the European Prediction of Psychosis Study (EPOS) which was run at a number of early detection clinics in Britain and Europe. People were referred to the clinics through various channels if someone was worried they seemed a bit, well, prodromalReferral sources included psychiatrists, psychologists, general practitioners, outreach clinics, counseling services, and teachers; patients also initiated contact. Knowledge about early warning signs (eg, concentration and attention disturbances, unexplained functional decline) and inclusion criteria was disseminated to mental health professionals as well as institutions and persons who might be contacted by at-risk persons seeking help.245 people consented to take part in the study and met the inclusion criteria meaning they were at &amp;quot;high risk of psychosis&amp;quot; according to at least one of two different systems, the Ultra High Risk (UHR) or the COGDIS criteria. Both class you as being at risk if you show short lived or mild symptoms a bit like those seen in schizophrenia i.e.COGDIS: inability to divide attention; thought interference, pressure, and blockage; and disturbances of receptive and expressive speech, disturbance of abstract thinking, unstable ideas of reference, and captivation of attention by details of the visual field...UHR: unusual thought content/ delusional ideas, suspiciousness/persecutory ideas, grandiosity, perceptual abnormalities/hallucinations, disorganized communication, and odd behavior/appearance... Brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms (BLIPS) i.e. hallucinations, delusions, or formal thought disorders that occurred resolved spontaneously within 1 week...Then they followed up the 245 kids for 18 months and saw what happened to them.What happened was that 37 of them developed full-blown psychosis: 23 suffered schizophrenia according to DSM-IV criteria, indicating severe and prolonged symptoms; 6 had mood disorders, i.e depression or bipolar disorder, with psychotic features, and the rest mostly had psychotic episodes too short to be classed as schizophrenia. 37 people is 19% of the 183 for whom full 18 month data was available; the others dropped out of the study, or went missing for some reason.Is 19% high or low? Well, it&amp;#39;s much higher than the rate you&amp;#39;d see in randomly selected people, because the risk of getting schizophrenia is less than 1% lifetime and this was only 18 months; the risk of a random person developing psychosis in any given year has been estimated at 0.035% in Britain. So the UHR and COGDIS criteria are a lot better than nothing.On the other hand 19% is far from being &amp;quot;all&amp;quot;: 4 out of 5 of the supposedly &amp;quot;high risk&amp;quot; kids in this study didn&amp;#39;t in fact get ill, although some of them probably developed illness after the 18 month period was over.The authors also came up with a fancy algorithm for predicting risk based on your score on various symptom rating scales, and they claim that this can predict psychosis much better, with 80% accuracy. As this graph shows, the rate of developing psychosis in those scoring highly on their Prognostic Index is really high.  (In case you were wondering the Prognostic Index is  [1.571 x SIPS-Positive score &amp;gt;16] + [0.865 x bizarre thinking score] + [0.793 x sleep disturbances score] + [1.037 x SPD score] + [0.033 x (highest GAF-M score in the past year – 34.64)] + [0.250 x (years of education – 12.52)]. Use it on your friends for hours of psychiatric fun!)However they came up with the algorithm by putting all of their dozens of variables into a big mathematical model, crunching the numbers and picking the ones that were most highly correlated with later psychosis - so they&amp;#39;ve specifically selected the variables that best predict illness in their sample, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;ll do so in any other case. This is basically the non-independence problem that has so troubled fMRI, although the authors, to their credit, recognize this and issue the appropriate cautions.So overall, we can predict psychosis, a bit, but far from perfectly. More research is needed. One of the proposed additions to the new DSM-V psychiatric classification system is &amp;quot;Psychosis Risk Syndrome&amp;quot; i.e. the prodrome; it&amp;#39;s not currently a disorder in DSM-IV. This idea has been attacked as an invitation to push antipsychotic drugs on kids who aren&amp;#39;t actually ill and don&amp;#39;t need them. On the other hand though, we shouldn&amp;#39;t forget that we&amp;#39;re talking about terrible illnesses here: if we could successfully predict and prevent psychosis, we&amp;#39;d be doing a lot of good.Ruhrmann, S., Schultze-Lutter, F., Salokangas, R., Heinimaa, M., Linszen, D., Dingemans, P., Birchwood, M., Patterson, P., Juckel, G., Heinz, A., Morrison, A., Lewis, S., Graf von Reventlow, H., &amp;amp; Klosterkotter, J.

This simply continued a string of posts that I've done over the years, the longest (and, in my not-so-humble-opinion, the best) deconstructs a lot of the bad scientific arguments used by animal rights activists to claim that animal research is useless, or nearly so, as well as other arguments made by extremists. One of the key points emphasized in these responses is that, regardless of their shortcomings, animal models for many conditions provide useful data, have lead to medical breakthroughs, and are better than any of the alternatives currently touted by animal rights activists. Someday, for example, cell culture and computer models may allow us to replace the use of animals for a lot of studies.

Not surprisingly, then, I've had a few readers make me aware of a recently released study published in PLoS Biology, entitled Publication Bias in Reports of Animal Stroke Studies Leads to Major Overstatement of Efficacy. I actually knew about this study last week, because I'm on the PLoS press list. But the study was embargoed until Monday night, and for some reason I let Mike Adams distract me from taking on a real scientific study. On the other hand, it's always a good time to have some fun with our favorite woo-meister of all. It's just fortunate that my readers didn't let me forget about this study.

Science-based medicine depends upon preclinical studies in cell culture and animal models in order to determine disease mechanisms and, just as importantly, to test new therapies before testing them in humans. I've pointed out before that animal studies don't always correlate as cleanly as we would like with human studies. However, for all their imperfections, animal studies can allow us to study phenomena that require three dimensional structure with all the different types of cells normally in the organ in question. One example I like to use is the study of tumor angiogenesis, which requires complex interactions between the tumor cells, vascular cells, and the stroma. Although I'm aware of models that examine endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and tumor cells in three dimensional coculture that can produce some pretty cool results, but they are still just cells in dishes. They're cells in dishes using sophisticated culture systems, but cells in dishes nonetheless.

It's thus of great interest to know what the predictive capability of animal models is. In the case of this study, the authors performed a metaanalysis of animal models of acute ischemic stroke to try to estimate the effect of publication bias on the reported results. As you may be aware, publication bias is an insidious generalized form of bias that creeps into the medical literature because studies showing a positive result are more likely to be published than studies that show a negative result. Also known as "the file drawer effect" (where negative studies tend to be left in the "file drawer" rather than to be published, publication bias is a problem in the clinical trial literature, so much so that clinical trial registries such as Clinicaltrials.gov, have been set up to make sure that the results of all human clinical trials see the light of day. The authors lay out this problem right in the introduction: Read the rest of this post... | Read the comments on this post......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

But while Mr. Obama has staked out middle ground on other environmental matters — supporting nuclear power, for example — the sheer breadth of the offshore drilling decision will take some of his supporters aback. And it is no sure thing that it will win support for a climate bill from undecided senators close to the oil industry, like Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, or Mary L.

The Senate is expected to take up a climate bill in the next few weeks — the last chance to enact such legislation before midterm election concerns take over. Mr. Obama and his allies in the Senate have already made significant concessions on coal and nuclear power to try to win votes from Republicans and moderate Democrats. The new plan now grants one of the biggest items on the oil industry’s wish list — access to vast areas of the Outer Continental Shelf for drilling.

I really love you, Mommy&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was Dr. Isis to do?  If she gave in and snuggled, she&amp;#39;d miss her meetings with science.  But, she simply could not get the enemy to cease snuggling.  That&amp;#39;s when Dr, Isis had to play the nuclear option...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Little Isis, go get in the shower and pee on Daddy.  It&amp;#39;ll be hilarious.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sent Little Isis running to the bathroom, stripping clothes and stumbling around as he went.  And, sure enough, when I heard Mr. Isis&amp;#39;s high pitched squeal from our shower, it was hilarious and I knew that this battle had been won.  What I did not expect, however, was the emergence of a third front in the war.  You see, moments later, Mr. Isis emerged from the shower smelling of Irish Spring and &lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/pantene-markets-new-shampoo-as-best-for-masturbati,2783/"&gt;Pantene&lt;/a&gt;, but without Little Isis in tow.  When I asked Mr. Isis why Little Isis was not following closely behind, he responded...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I told him that he could stay in there and play until the shower got cold."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...thus sentencing Dr. Isis to either a freezing cold shower, or 45 minutes with which to blog about this morning's battles. I did not expect Mr. Isis to emerge as the mole, engaging in treachery on behalf of the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, I should have realized that the men would stick together...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/03/why_dr_isis_had_to_take_a_cold.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/M1Gilob0_ws" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270043066562"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/todays_carnivals_482.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/892abfdcc4ff7b2a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2010-03-31T14:27:51Z</published><updated>2010-03-31T14:27:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/Qu5c4xAweLg/todays_carnivals_482.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/todays_carnivals_482.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berry Go Round&lt;/strong&gt; #26 is up on &lt;a href="http://sarcozona.org/2010/03/30/berry-go-round-26/" title=""&gt;Gravity's Rainbow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

After all, some research suggests that a &lt;a href="http://www.askbaby.com/name-affect-future.htm"&gt;child’s name can really impact their life growing up&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, it was weird for Gwyneth Paltrow to dub her daughter Apple, or Anne Heche to anoint her son Atlas, but they don’t even come close to making our list of the five worst baby names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audio Science Clayton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This unlucky boy is the offspring of Shannyn Sossamon. Who? She’s not a household name, but you may know her as the chick from “The Rules of Attraction” who lost her virginity doggie-style while a guy vomited on her back. We know it’s a stretch to consider her a celebrity, but we just couldn’t keep little Audio Science off our list. He’ll probably be good at math, but we hope he becomes a shoe salesman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilot Inspektor Riesgraf-Lee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Pilot Inspektor. Seriously. Actor Jason Lee and actress ex-fiancée Beth Riesgraf supposedly came up with this doosy after listening to the song “He’s Simple, He’s Dumb, He’s the Pilot” by the indie-rock band Grandaddy. Yes, he’s dumb – but we don’t mean the Pilot – daddy should have known better. We predict a fear of flying and the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peaches Honeyblossom Michelle Charlotte Angel Vanessa Geldof&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It’s just wrong – on so many levels. Poor Peaches barely edged out her sisters Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence Geldof, Little Pixie Geldof, and of course, Fifi Trixibelle Geldof. We’ve counted at least 15 Geldof kids in there so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moxie CrimeFighter Jillette&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Penn Jillete of Penn &amp;amp; Teller must have thought long and hard before bestowing his child with the title Moxie CrimeFighter. It’s great to be a crime fighter with moxie, but not in name only. And there’s too much pressure to become a superhero. Oddly, his son’s name is pretty standard – Zolten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reignbeau Rhames&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It could have just been Rainbow, but nope. The cutesy, faux-fancy misspellings of celebrity baby names must be stopped. But, let’s face it, her dad is named Ving – this kid has no chance. (There’s no escape for his son Freedom, either.)&lt;/p&gt;

I know this may be bit strange for the people who judge the papers simply based on their abstracts or conclusion section. But trust me it works because I know what I am looking for. I always avoid the sleep inducing papers full of creepy tables and bar graphs, in fact so lacking in interest as to cause mental weariness. When I say illustration appeal, I mean something which can inspire  your  readers to wake them up, something which can give enough value for their time and effort to read your technical jargon. In simple words put some dazzle in your paper. Having said that I think the scientist are very poor on communicating their results in a stimulating way. I am not talking about the blogs or their writing skills, I am certainly speaking about how to create the visual impact for your scientific article. Why this is so important now, because with emergence of data intensive science things begin to get very complicated. Science is constantly shifting landscape, both in terms of data type and quantity. We are swamped by data deluge and next generation of science not only demands better data management skills but also superior ability to present the data in a innovative way so that we can enable discovery in this noisy environment. Thinking about clever visualization always inspires chance discovery. Rather than restructuring you write-up again and again, spent time to find new inspiring ways to visualize your data. The only reason you&amp;#39;re still using old chart and graphs is you did not attempt. Try to inspire yourself by looking in other domains first, there is always a possibility to mix and fix existing visual schemes  according to your needs. For instance, in a latest PNAS paper Carlson et. al have presented interactive Sequence Specificity Landscapes SSLs) which simultaneously displays the affinity and specificity of a million-plus DNA sequences by plotting them as several concentric circles. That&amp;#39;s a hell of a lot of innovation. Circular SSLs display the binding intensities of a given DNA ligand across all DNA permutations. For the inspiration they looked &amp;quot;from the energy funnels used to represent protein folding to the painting of twentieth-century master of shape and color Wassily Kandinsky&amp;quot;. This is one of the examples where visual thinking has changed the final outcome.In a circular SSL, the innermost ring displays sequences that contain a perfect match to a given seed motif (0-mismatch). The subsequent circles, going outward, represent increasing mismatches from the seed motif. The height of each color-coded peak on the individual rings corresponds to the CSI binding intensity data.To convince you more I will give another example, this one is picked from the paper published by Chen et. al in Molecular Systems Biology. The ErbB signaling pathways is very complex which arises from hetero- and homo-oligomerization among receptors having distinct ligand-binding properties and different intracellular binding partners, and from the multiplicity of intracellular proteins that interact with these receptors. Consider all permutations and combinations, and you will come up with reaction network worth 3 pages (check out the supplementary material for the paper and how much complex it was). They came up with a simplified schematic representation of their ErbB model in a more intuitive way. I was so impressed that I was not surprised to see the number of citations this article has collected in a very short time. Simplified version of ErbB model networkI am sure these are only few selected examples which I came across, there are lot more  to learn and that&amp;#39;s what really inspire us. This kind of effective visuals illustrations are very helpful in dissemination of scientific knowledge.Reference: Carlson, C., Warren, C., Hauschild, K., Ozers, M., Qadir, N., Bhimsaria, D., Lee, Y., Cerrina, F., &amp;amp; Ansari, A.

While said undergrad has done a fair amount of reading on the topic, the post is still subject to many errors. Tread carefully. [/disclaimer]I won&amp;#39;t go into an all-out discussion of neutral evolution here: I&amp;#39;m neither qualified enough nor have enough spare time at the moment. However, some issues seem to crop up multiple times, both here and on other blogs. I figured I&amp;#39;d try to briefly adress some of them, although do take my discussion with a grain of salt. That said, while neutral theory require a certain amount of effort to grasp properly (just like any other aspect of evolutionary biology), it is not something worth dismissing. In fact, if you consider how horribly misunderstood evolutionary biology is on the whole (even among grad students: Gregory &amp;amp; Ellis 2008 BioScience), the neutral elements of evolution seem to be understood by a very small fraction of biologists even.Perhaps part of the problem is that adaptive evolution is just...flashier. It makes for fun and fairly simple stories: Eg. the peacock has a huge tail to signal to the females that it has nice genes that would compensate for the problems it causes. This &amp;quot;Good Genes&amp;quot; theory is actually taught in first year curricula, and makes very little sense upon further examination, and definitely does not survive Occam&amp;#39;s Razor. A simpler explanation would, of course, entail something like runaway sexual selection (ie. female happened to prefer flashy tail, males with flashier tails outcompete their dimmer counterparts, tail gets longer) or that the tail may have a more important function, like scaring away predators. In any case, the adaptive approach very often results in what is mostly a story-telling exercise, and one that is very difficult to deal with experimentally. Worst of all, those stories very easily make sense upon first glance, and thus the field becomes cluttered with poorly thought out theories that sound reasonable.This post became way too long, so I broke it up into three parts; table of contents here:Part I-Adaptationism vs. Neutralism-&amp;quot;Population genetics ignores reality!&amp;quot;-Existence of neutrality and near-neutralityPart II-Neutral evolution is relevant-Evolution lacks foresight; it can neither anticipate nor respond-Rise of complexity through non-adaptive means-Further examples of constructive neutral evolutionPart III-Discussion of what sparked this argument: Evolution of ciliate nuclear dimorphismAdaptationism vs. NeutralismOf course, none of what I said is new by any margin: the famous Gould and Lewontin 1979 Spandrels of San Marco (free access) paper does a nice job at pointing out many of the fallbacks of panadaptationism. And I don&amp;#39;t find it much of an &amp;#39;attack&amp;#39;, as it is often described by diehard adaptationists, but perhaps that&amp;#39;s just me. Since so many before me have pointed out the fallbacks of the &amp;#39;adaptationist programme&amp;#39;, I won&amp;#39;t bother dwelling on it any further. Besides, this type of thing causes a great polarising effect on the community, with people being either hardcore adaptationists or hardcore neutralists. This seriously fucks up any progress on the topic, because biology hardly tolerates dichotomies. In fact, the truth in this case does not even lie &amp;#39;somewhere in the middle&amp;#39;, but in the fact that both adaptive and neutral processes work in tandem.Let me reiterate that: Selective and neutral mechanisms work in tandem. Simultaneously. In some situations (eg. large effective population sizes, in bacteria; Lynch 2007 PNAS, Yi 2005 Bioessays), adaptive processes are more dominant; in some cases, adaptive &amp;#39;forces&amp;#39; are negligible compared to neutral phenomena (small effective population sizes). Considering some specific structure, parts of its evolutionary history have been driven more by drift and mutational bias, interspersed with parts dominated by selective pressures. It&amp;#39;s not like selection takes a nap for a while, and then gets back to work while drift, bias et al. chill out. There is no point to dismiss one or the other, like so many tend to do.Curiously, I&amp;#39;ve heard numerous times that &amp;quot;Well, maybe selection is less important for bacteria, but it is the dominant force in vertebrates&amp;quot;. How hilarious is it that any population geneticist will tell you the exact opposite: bacteria are under overwhelming selective pressure due to their freaking massive effective pop sizes, meaning that drift is much less effective in that situation relative to selection. Vertebrates are actually an awesome example of selection going rather easy: being a large multicellular thing with a backbone is a damn stupid way to copy your genes. Seriously!Now, you may wonder why should anyone who&amp;#39;s not an evolutionary biologist care about any of this? For a cell or developmental biologist, why not assume everything is there for a reason?Because this leads to rather convoluted explanations for things. Take signalling pathways, for example. Is there any particular reason you have tens of genes required to turn on a particular behaviour in the end when you could&amp;#39;ve &amp;#39;designed&amp;#39; it instead to use only one or two? Here we have again a problem with the adaptationist approach: you can pretty much always think of some reason why something is &amp;#39;useful&amp;#39; or adaptive. That doesn&amp;#39;t make it right. What if some features of these pathways originally evolved as a form of adaptively-neutral &amp;#39;bloating&amp;#39; of the system? See Lynch 2007 PNAS, Lynch 2007 Nature Rev Genet  for more on non-adaptive processes in evolution of genetic pathways. (Or just stop reading this post and go through this short list instead ;-)).&amp;quot;Population genetics ignores reality!&amp;quot;Now, there&amp;#39;s some complaints that popgen kind of fails at taking reality into account. For some work in the field, that is true -- just like in any other field. Did you seriously think everyone, to the last moron, is in touch with reality in your field? If so, I&amp;#39;d love to hear! (no philosophers need apply, heh... although to be fair, there are some &amp;#39;fringe lunatics&amp;#39; there who actually make sense by our standards.) That said, mathematical modeling requires simplifications to be made to get somewhere. If you have a problem with that, note all those humanities scholars who are sneering at us because we make simplifications as scientists! They wisely take the easy way out and conclude that reality is a social construct and understanding is actually impossible and thus not worthy losing sleep over...Good mathematical biologists note their simplifications, keep track of them, and know when to simplify what, and what the limitations of their models are. Even better mathematical biologists test their models empirically, thereby producing work that is truly relevant to the rest of us. In my [admittedly still quite inexperienced] opinion, Michael Lynch belongs to that category. Seriously, I despised and dismissed the entire field of population genetics as well, and thanks to some of his papers realised it&amp;#39;s probably not a very good idea to do that. In a field as messy as biology, any tidbit of information, even if it comes from simulations, is not only valuable, but essential to the very hope of sorting stuff out. We, that is -- all biologists -- are in no position to discard entire fields because of our petty tribalistic snobbery. Tread with caution -- yes. Dismiss without a second thought -- absolutely not.Existence of neutrality and near-neutralityTo touch on the existence of &amp;#39;true&amp;#39; neutrality, let me show you a few diagrams. The first one outlines the history of selectionist and neutral theories:...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

I saw this on the news last night; you can read the transcript a&lt;a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/36096371/ns/today-white_house/"&gt;t MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning to personal matters, Lauer asked the  president why he has yet to choose a regular church to attend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve decided for now  not to join a single church. The reason is because Michelle and I have  realized we are very disruptive to services,” Obama replied. “We  occasionally go across the street to St. John’s, which is a church that a  lot of presidents traditionally have gone to. We love the chapel up in  Camp David. It’s probably our favorite place to worship because it’s  just family up at Camp David. There’s a wonderful chaplain up there who  does just a great job. So usually when we go to Camp David we go to  church on Sundays there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama also revealed that he avails himself of modern technology in his  spiritual life.  “I  get a daily devotional on my BlackBerry, which is a wonderful  thing,”  Obama said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of going to church in Washington he gets a daily devotional on his BlackBerry? Who is he kidding? The man’s an atheist&lt;/p&gt;

This simply continued a string of posts that I've done over the years, the longest (and, in my not-so-humble-opinion, the best) &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/answering_scientific_arguments_of_an.php"&gt;deconstructs a lot of the bad scientific arguments&lt;/a&gt; used by animal rights activists to claim that animal research is useless, or nearly so, as well as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/answering_other_arguments_of_animal_righ.php"&gt;other arguments made by extremists&lt;/a&gt;. One of the key points emphasized in these responses is that, regardless of their shortcomings, animal models for many conditions provide useful data, have lead to medical breakthroughs, and are better than any of the alternatives currently touted by animal rights activists. Someday, for example, cell culture and computer models may allow us to replace the use of animals for a lot of studies, but that day is not today, nor is it likely to arrive anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, then, I've had a few readers make me aware of a recently released study published in PLoS Biology, entitled &lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000344"&gt;Publication Bias in Reports of Animal Stroke Studies Leads to Major Overstatement of Efficacy&lt;/a&gt;. I actually knew about this study last week, because I'm on the PLoS press list. But the study was embargoed until Monday night, and for some reason I let Mike Adams distract me from taking on a real scientific study. On the other hand, it's always a good time to have some fun with our favorite woo-meister of all. It's just fortunate that my readers didn't let me forget about this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science-based medicine depends upon preclinical studies in cell culture and animal models in order to determine disease mechanisms and, just as importantly, to test new therapies before testing them in humans. I've pointed out before that animal studies don't always correlate as cleanly as we would like with human studies. However, for all their imperfections, animal studies can allow us to study phenomena that require three dimensional structure with all the different types of cells normally in the organ in question. One example I like to use is the study of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/answering_scientific_arguments_of_an.php"&gt;tumor angiogenesis&lt;/a&gt;, which requires complex interactions between the tumor cells, vascular cells, and the stroma. Although I'm aware of models that examine endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and tumor cells in three dimensional coculture that can produce some pretty cool results, but they are still just cells in dishes. They're cells in dishes using sophisticated culture systems, but cells in dishes nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's thus of great interest to know what the predictive capability of animal models is. In the case of this study, the authors performed a metaanalysis of animal models of acute ischemic stroke to try to estimate the effect of publication bias on the reported results. As you may be aware, publication bias is an insidious generalized form of bias that creeps into the medical literature because studies showing a positive result are more likely to be published than studies that show a negative result. Also known as "the file drawer effect" (where negative studies tend to be left in the "file drawer" rather than to be published, publication bias is a problem in the clinical trial literature, so much so that clinical trial registries such as Clinicaltrials.gov, have been set up to make sure that the results of all human clinical trials see the light of day. The authors lay out this problem right in the introduction:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/is_there_publication_bias_in_animal_stud.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/is_there_publication_bias_in_animal_stud.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/88oNeah5iaQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270038972141"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=10261">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9de8c7024540fc1a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Templeton claws its way to respectability</title><published>2010-03-31T12:36:04Z</published><updated>2010-03-31T12:36:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/31/templeton-claws-its-way-to-respectability/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The 1.5-million-dollar Templeton Prize that the John Templeton Foundation awarded Francisco Ayala was a fantastic investment.  For one thing, it’s bought the Foundation an article by Yudhijit Bhattacharjee in the new issue of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/327/5973/1565"&gt;“Latest prize bolsters Templeton’s shift to mainstream.”&lt;/a&gt; The title alone shows you the JTF’s long-term strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharjee describes how Templeton used to support the Discovery Institute and its intelligent-design activities. (They gave grants, for example to William Dembski and Guillermo Gonzalez for work on ID.) Subsequently, however, Templeton “disavowed support for the ID movement, allaying the fears of many critics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templeton pulled their support of the DI, of course, because they finally realized that while the DI did adhere to Templeton’s mission of uniting science and faith, supporting that Institute would ultimately cost Templeton all credibility with mainstream scientists.  If Templeton had any interest in supporting &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; science, they never would have funded the Discovery Institute in the first place.  The withdrawing of their support was a tactical rather than a principled decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templeton is good at tactical decisions: that’s why they pay their management team big bucks.  And now, after years of giving Templeton Prizes to religious figures (like Billy Graham and Mother Teresa) or woo-laden theologian/philosophers (like John Polkinghorne and Charles Taylor), they’ve finally realized that the direct road to credibility is this: give prizes to mainstream scientists who believe that both science and faith are valid ways of apprehending truth, and that each has something to contribute to the other. Ayala was a brilliant choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But their mission remains the conflation of science with faith.  Dan Dennett, quoted in the article, recognizes this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are using the prestige and authority of science to improve the prestige and credibility of theology,” says Daniel Dennett, a philosopher at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. In his opinion, Templeton-funded discussions between scientists and religious figures do for religion what debates between ID proponents and evolutionary biologists would do for ID: “They create the perception that scientists and theologians are academic co-equals, which they are not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physicist Steven Weinberg (surprisingly, in view of his past writings on religion) is not as critical:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am not enthusiastic about the message they seem to be selling to the public—that science and religion are not incompatible; I think there is real tension between the two,” says Steven Weinberg, a Nobel Prize winning physicist at the University of Texas, Austin, who has been an outspoken critic of religion. “But for an organization with a message, they are pretty good at not being intrusive in the activities they fund. I don’t wish them well, but I don’t think they are particularly insidious or dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennett objected to Templeton’s award of several million dollars to Notre Dame for a “Science of Generosity” initiative, studying, among other things, “how empathy affects charitable donation” and “how generosity spreads through social networks.”  Dennett’s take: “What they are trying to do is paint certain topics with a holy glow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharjee also quotes molecular biologist Matthew Gibson, who got a Templeton grant to study cell division:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibson says he decided to accept the foundation’s money “after poking around and finding nothing fishy.” Now a researcher at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Missouri, Gibson admits that he may have been influenced by need. “At the time, I don’t think anybody else would have funded what we were doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many scientists &lt;em&gt;aren&lt;/em&gt;‘t influenced by need? We’re always chasing scarce bucks to fund our research.  Science have the need; Templeton has the bucks.  That’s how they buy respectability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll stop carping at Templeton when they stop pretending that science and religion have something to say to each other beyond this:  there is no empirical evidence for the tenets of religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mucking around on the blessed web, I now find that the man was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes,_Sr."&gt;Oliver Wendell Holmes&lt;/a&gt;, an American 19th century physician and author. But it was ether, not opium, and turpentine, not kerosene. &lt;a href="http://books.google.se/books?id=c5rOGqwLGaEC&amp;amp;lpg=PA47&amp;amp;ots=LgrcBbekUh&amp;amp;dq=%22smell%20of%20turpentine%22%20%22Mechanism%20in%20Thought%20and%20Morals%22&amp;amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;Here's what OWH writes&lt;/a&gt; in his essay "Mechanism in thought and morals : an address delivered before the Phi Beta Kappa Society of Harvard University, June 29, 1870".&lt;blockquote&gt;I once inhaled a pretty full dose of ether, with the determination to put on record, at the earliest moment of regaining consciousness, the thought I should find uppermost in my mind. The mighty music of the triumphal march into nothingness reverberated through my brain, and filled me with a sense of infinite possibilities, which made me an archangel for the moment. The veil of eternity was lifted. The one great truth which underlies all human experience, and is the key to all the mysteries that philosophy has sought in vain to solve, flashed upon me in a sudden revelation. Henceforth all was clear: a few words had lifted my intelligence to the level of the knowledge of the cherubim. As my natural condition returned, I remembered my resolution; and, staggering to my desk, I wrote, in ill-shaped straggling letters, the all-embracing truth still glimmering in my consciousness. The words were these (children may smile; the wise will ponder): "&lt;i&gt;A strong smell of turpentine prevails throughout.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of a time at a party when one of my buddies was drunkenly talking about how great other drugs than the beer bottle in his hand are, and described some deeply meaningful and intense insights he had attained while tripping on acid. Sadly, as I was sober as always, I failed to see their import. Like my friend the philosopher once said, "When you have that eureka feeling of really having made an intellectual breakthough, you're generally wrong".&lt;/p&gt;

Essentially, the authors conclude that there is a significant file-drawer effect – failure to publish negative studies – with animal studies and this impacts the translation of animal research to human clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SBM is greatly concerned with the technology of medical science. On one level, the methods of  individual studies need to be closely analyzed for rigor and bias. But we also go to great pains to dispel the myth that individual studies can tell us much about the practice of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliable conclusions come from interpreting the literature as a whole, and not just individual studies. Further, the whole of the literature is greater than the sum of individual studies – there are patterns and effects in the literature itself that need to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One big effect is the file-drawer effect, or publication bias – the tendency to publish positive studies more than negative studies. A study showing that a treatment works or has potential is often seen as doing more for the reputation of a journal and the careers of the scientists than negative studies. So studies with no measurable effect tend to languish unpublished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual studies looking at an ineffective treatment (if we assume perfect research methodology) should vary around no net effect.  If those studies that are positive at random are more likely to be published than those studies that are neutral or negative, than any systematic review of the published literature is likely to find a falsely positive effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we do not live in a perfect world and many studies have  imperfect methods and even hidden biases. So in reality there is likely  to be a positive bias to the studies.  This positive bias magnifies the positive publication bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are attempts in the works to mitigate the problem of publication bias in the clinical literature. For example, clinicaltrials.gov is a registry of all trials involving human subjects – before the trials are completed and the results known. This way reviewers can have access to all the data – not just the data researchers and journal editors deem worthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new study seeks to explore if publication bias is similarly a problem with animal studies. The issues are similar to human trials. There is an ethical question, as sacrificing animals in research is justified by the data we get in return. If that data is hidden and does not become part of the published record, than the animals were sacrificed for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also, publication bias can lead to false conclusions. This in turn can, for example, lead to clinical trials of a drug that seems promising in animal studies. This could potentially expose human subjects to a harmful or just worthless drug that would not have made it to human trials if all the negative animal data were published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study itself looked at a database of animal models of stroke. They examined 525 publications involving 16 different stroke interventions. There are a few different types of statistical analysis that can be done to infer probable publication bias. Basically, without publication bias there should be a certain distribution of findings in terms of effect sizes. If only positive or larger effect sizes are being published, then the distribution will be skewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of analysis provides an estimation only. They found that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egger regression and trim-and-fill analysis suggested that publication bias was highly prevalent (present in the literature for 16 and ten interventions, respectively) in animal studies modelling stroke. Trim-and-fill analysis suggested that publication bias might account for around one-third of the efficacy reported in systematic reviews, with reported efficacy falling from 31.3% to 23.8% after adjustment for publication bias. We estimate that a further 214 experiments (in addition to the 1,359 identified through rigorous systematic review; non publication rate 14%) have been conducted but not reported. It is probable that publication bias has an important impact in other animal disease models, and more broadly in the life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there was some disagreement between the methods used, but both showed that there is likely to be a significant publication bias. If their analysis is correct, about one third of systematic reviews of animal studies in stroke that conclude an intervention works may be due to publication bias rather than a real effect. The authors also speculate that this effect is likely not unique to stroke, and may be generalizable to animal studies in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is just an individual study, and further analysis using different data sets are needed to confirm these results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of this study are not surprising and are in line with what is known from examining clinical trials. They suggest that similar methods to minimize publication bias are necessary for animal studies in addition to human trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this kind of self-critical analysis will lead to improvement in the technology of medical research. It should further lead to more caution in interpreting not only single studies but systematic reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, in my opinion, it highlights the need to consider basic science and plausibility in evaluating animal and clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Parliment in the UK &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/tom_watson/status/11326057761"&gt;Tom Watson&lt;/a&gt; apparently tweeted the following (pictured).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally he’s then faced with a flurry of questions in regards to what exactly that statement means (’proposals won’t work’? Is ‘in favour of reform’? Explain!). In addition, Watson has responded  with: &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/tom_watson/status/11331204455"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Friends, voting on the Budget until early hours. Promise to give you a detailed reason why the proposed libel reforms were floored tomorrow.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might guess, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ProfBrianCox/status/11355949946"&gt;friend of Simon Singh and scientist Professor Brian Cox isn’t impressed, and has Tweeted in response as well&lt;/a&gt;. I can see this going on for quite some time… &lt;a href="http://Friends,votingontheBudgetuntilearlyhours.Promisetogiveyouadetailedreasonwhytheproposedlibelreformswereflooredtomorrow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Picture-15.png" alt="" width="302" height="143"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As if it hasn’t been going on for long enough, mind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Guardian reports how &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/feb/19/no-win-no-fee-lawyers-shackling-newspapers"&gt;defamation lawsuits in England and Wales are around a hundred and forty times more expensive&lt;/a&gt; than the average in any other European nation, you can understand the fury! Do note, just in time for April 1st, &lt;a href="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/cause.htm"&gt;Simon Singh returns to court&lt;/a&gt; to hear whether his appeal is upheld – otherwise, &lt;a href="http://nedroidcomics.livejournal.com/279161.html"&gt;he’ll have to continue the struggle further.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it’s on that rather somber note that I link to Ariane Sherine’s new song:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5tZKCcLLWs"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5tZKCcLLWs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Many people have e-mailed me this story with the comment that it seems fishy to them. Using magnets and changing morality so simply triggered their skeptical detectors, which is reasonable. But in this case the research seems perfectly legitimate, although some of the reporting has been superficial or dubious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole notion of using magnets as a biological or medical intervention has long been exploited by the dubious magnetic therapy industry. I do agree that there are many fraudulent or quacky magnetic devices out there with unscientific claims. I do not recommend that people buy magnetic insoles for their shoes or strap refrigerator magnets to their joints to relieve pain or promote healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is different. The brain is an exquisitely electrical organ, allowing for electromagnetic interventions to its function. We have recently developed the technology to use strong magnetic fields, precisely tuned and focused, to either stimulate or inhibit the electrical activity in brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1691"&gt;I recently wrote about a study &lt;/a&gt;that showed that such an intervention could potentially help relieve migraine headaches. TMS is also being used to treat depression – a more modern manifestation of the old electric shock treatment (ECT). Implantable stimulators are being used to treat seizures and symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. It is likely in the future we will be using many more electromagnetic interventions for neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So don’t be put off by the whole magnet thing – in this context it is legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing Morality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other aspect of this story that triggered many people’s BS detectors is the notion of changing moral choices by simply affecting one small part of the brain. This aspect of the study was misrepresented in many of the mainstream reports that I saw. The &lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/moral-control-0330.html"&gt;discussion on the MIT website itself &lt;/a&gt;is much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain region in question, the right temporo- parietal junction (TPJ) is involved with a function known as the theory of mind – the ability to imagine what some other creature is thinking or feeling. In other words, we understand that other people have their own thoughts and feelings similar to our own , and this enables us to consider their possible motivations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has obvious survival advantages, especially for such a social creature such as humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory of mind is also critical to making moral judgments. Most moral judgments are strongly connected to the intention of the person, not just the final outcome. It is the theory of mind, and therefore the TPJ that enables us to consider a person’s intention in arriving at a moral judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the study in question posed to subjects the following scenario: Two people are visiting a chemical plant. Person A asks person B to get them a coffee. Person B does so, and puts a substance in person A’s coffee that is labeled “poison.” It turns out the substance was just sugar, and person A is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scenario is designed to separate out intention from outcome. Subjects were asked to rate the behavior of person B from a moral perspective, rating it from totally forbidden to permissible. When the TPJ was inhibited by TMS (but not a nearby area) subjects were more likely to find the behavior permissible, because there was no bad outcome. This suggests that their theory of mind was impaired and their judgments therefore were less based upon intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research is a follow up to earlier research where fMRI scans were used to see what brain regions are active when making such moral judgments. This new evidence helps confirm the prior association and show probable causation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research shows how fMRI and TMS are being used in a complementary way to determine the functional anatomy of the cortex – even the most abstract intellectual functions. These technologies are still tricky to use, however, and I always emphasize that I would consider all such results preliminary until they are independently replicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, regarding moral judgments, the researchers emphasize that there is no one “moral center” in the brain, but rather moral judgments involve coordinating multiple different types of processing in the brain and bringing it all together for a final decision. It is literally a balancing of many small assessments and then deciding what the net result is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this research shows us is the role of the theory of mind in weighing the intention of a moral actor. We consider not only the outcome of people’s actions, but what they intended. It is fascinating that there is a specific neurological function that underlies these moral judgments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270034147333"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=22953">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fc36bbed0a8fb18c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Education"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Should the College Keep “Our Lord” Phrase in Diploma?  Yep.</title><published>2010-03-31T11:00:26Z</published><updated>2010-03-31T11:00:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/31/should-the-college-keep-our-lord-phrase-in-diploma-yep/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_University_(Texas)"&gt;Trinity University&lt;/a&gt; in Texas is a private school that was founded by Presbyterians in 1869 but isn’t really religious anymore.  It hasn’t been for over 40 years now.  It has an independent board of trustees.  The student body is made up of people from a variety of religious faiths and of no religious faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that, some students are upset that their diplomas say “In the Year of Our Lord” on them and they’re &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/03/29/college-students-want-lord-phrase-diplomas/"&gt;fighting to have it removed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“A diploma is a very personal item, and people want to proudly display it in their offices and homes,” Sidra Qureshi, president of Trinity Diversity Connection, told the Chronicle. “By having the phrase ‘In the Year of Our Lord,’ it is directly referencing Jesus Christ, and not everyone believes in Jesus Christ.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qureshi, a Muslim student at the school, is leading the campaign to remove the words. The Board of Trustees is expected to vote on the matter during a meeting next month.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Tuttle&lt;/strong&gt;, the Dean of Students, suggests &lt;a href="http://trinitydean.blogspot.com/2010/02/diploma-see.html"&gt;it might be a good change to make&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It has appeared to me that the students pushing for a change have more at stake than those who wish to retain the current language. It would mean more to the students who object to the wording to have the language removed than it would mean to the students who want it to stay the same. For the former it is personal and about acceptance and inclusion. For the others it is primarily philosophical. Most wouldn’t feel that the change would lessen the diploma. Most didn’t know the language was even there in the first place. &lt;strong&gt;In a year, no one would miss the current phrasing. Shouldn’t we respect the wishes of those who feel hurt by this? Removing the language, ironically, would seem the Christian thing to do.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes some sense… so what’s the argument for keeping it?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s ask a Republican:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Any cultural reference, even if it is religious, our first instinct should not be to remove it, but to accept it and tolerate it,” said Brendan McNamara, president of the College Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McNamara pointed out that Trinity displays other signs of its Christian heritage, including a chapel on campus, a chaplain, Christmas vespers and a Bible etching on the Trinity seal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once you remove that phrase, where do you draw the line?” McNamara asked.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right… because Republicans know all about acceptance and  tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he does have a point.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the issue is the overt religious reference in the phrasing, then why not get rid of the overt religious reference in the Bible etching on the school’s seal?  Or the chapel on campus?  I don’t see that as a slippery slope argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kate Shellnutt&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Houston Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; thinks &lt;a href="http://blogs.chron.com/believeitornot/2010/03/im_ok_with_having_in_the_year_1.html"&gt;the students shouldn’t be fighting the battle&lt;/a&gt; in this case.  After all, several other historically-religious schools still have the phrase on their diplomas — it’s more of a tradition thing than any real reference to a god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Other institutions, both public and private, use the phrase, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.txtapic.com/harvard_diploma/harvarddiplomaexample.php"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vintageagnes/156523967/"&gt;Yale University&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(in Latin)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mcguirk/527793236/"&gt;Brown University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (also in Latin)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/robeast/156576903/"&gt;The University of Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.linxuscommunications.com/emp/Tolliver/Training/Ohio_State_University_Diploma.jpg"&gt;Ohio State&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/MVVKulish/PhD_diploma_of_Dr_Kulish.jpg"&gt;Southern Methodist University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at the University of Tennessee and Ohio State University would have a stronger case for getting rid of “Year of Our Lord” because they are state schools.  When it’s a private school with historically-religious ties, it’s a much harder case to make that they should reinvent themselves as secular in all ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I support the sentiment of what Qureshi is trying to do, you can’t go to a private school named &lt;em&gt;Trinity&lt;/em&gt; University and expect that you won’t encounter a Christian reference or two along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I would love to see the public university students take a stand… &lt;/p&gt;

The issue at hand was an important changed needed to bring defamation lawsuits into line with those of other developed nations: reducing the amount of money that “no win, no fee” lawyers can collect from 100% (double their fee) to 10%. Currently, defamation lawsuits in England and Wales &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/feb/19/no-win-no-fee-lawyers-shackling-newspapers"&gt;are approximately 140 times more expensive&lt;/a&gt; than the average defamation lawsuit in other European countries.&lt;/p&gt;

Frank Keil and colleagues asked children aged between five and thirteen, and adults, to rate the difficulty of questions from physics (e.g. How does a spinning top stay upright?), chemistry, biology, psychology (e.g. Why is it hard to understand two people talking at once?) and economics. The questions had been carefully chosen from earlier pilot work in which they&amp;#39;d all been rated as equally difficult by adults. Consistent with the pilot work, the adults in the study proper rated the questions from the different disciplines as equally difficult. However, children from age 7 to 13 rated psychology as easier than the natural sciences - physics, chemistry and biology, which they rated as equally difficult.Young children can&amp;#39;t possibly have the depth of understanding to know which scientific questions are more difficult. Instead they must resort to some kind of mental short-cut to make their verdict. Keil&amp;#39;s team think that children&amp;#39;s feelings of control over their own psychological faculties - memories, emotions and so forth - and the superficial familiarity of those kinds of concepts, likely lead them to believe psychological concepts are easier to understand.A second study provided this account with some support. This time children and adults rated the difficulty of questions from within the various branches of psychology. Similar to the first study, the children, but not the adults, rated questions related to social psychology, personality and emotions as progressively easier, compared with questions related to cognition, perception and biological psychology, which they rated as progressively more difficult.So, when do these childish misconceptions leak through into adult judgments? For a third study, another batch of children and adults were again presented with the same questions from the different scientific disciplines, but this time they were asked to say whether they would be able to solve each question on their own (or require expert help) and to estimate what proportion of the adult population would know the answers.This time the adults as well as the children tended to say they could solve more psychology questions on their own, compared with questions in the other sciences, and kids and adults estimated that more people knew the answers to the psychology questions. Remember these were psychology questions that adults had already rated as just as difficult and complex as questions in the other sciences. &amp;#39;Such biases [towards seeing psychology as easy] may be observed when tasks do not so directly ask about difficulty of understanding and instead use measures such as ease of learning on one&amp;#39;s own,&amp;#39; the researchers said.Keil&amp;#39;s team said their findings have real-life implications, for example in the court-room. &amp;#39;If psychological phenomena are seen as usually quite easy to understand and largely self-evident and if such judgments are inaccurate and underestimate the need for experts,&amp;#39; they warned, &amp;#39;cases might well be decided in ways that unfairly exclude valuable expert insights.&amp;#39;In fact, the researchers pointed out that such situations have already occurred. In the US trial of former Presidential Assistant I. Lewis &amp;#39;Scooter&amp;#39; Libby, for example, the judge disallowed the use of psychology experts on memory, on the basis that the jury could rely on their common sense understanding of memory. This is particularly ironic given that prior psychology research has shown that jurors and judges&amp;#39; have a woefully poor understanding of how memory actually works. _________________________________Keil FC, Lockhart KL, &amp;amp; Schlegel E (2010).

&lt;p&gt;Wow, that’s one hell of a path of destruction caused by a single anti-vax family. Thanks &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It also further illustrates how absurd the evangelical notion of “objective morality” from “God” is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not all kids are brought up to be such critical thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/monkey-frustrated.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="monkey-frustrated" src="http://skepacabra.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/monkey-frustrated.jpg?w=143&amp;amp;h=145" alt="" width="143" height="145"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://www.amateurscientist.org/2010/03/many-people-are-morons.html"&gt;New Harris poll confirms most Americans are dummies&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poll involved 2,320 adults responding to true or false questions.   Among many other disturbing facts, 14% of respondents said they believed  Obama could be the Antichrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When broken into partisan results, it seems 24% of all Republican  respondents hold this view, while only 6% of Democrats are that batshit  crazy.  But taken as a whole, the numbers in this poll are depressing.   32% think Obama is a Muslim.  23% think Obama is a racist.  And 20% say  Obama is “doing many of the things Hitler did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m pretty sure Hitler didn’t hold a Passover seder in the White House…or cut out the middleman in student loans…or sleep with Michelle Obama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:YJ3DBf6fDBtQHM:http://www.austinchronicle.com/binary/76f6/Donohue.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:YJ3DBf6fDBtQHM:http://www.austinchronicle.com/binary/76f6/Donohue.jpg" alt="" width="102" height="118"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;5. &lt;a href="http://www.towleroad.com/2010/03/catholic-leagues-bill-donohue-takes-out-nyt-ad-defending-pope-claims-most-priests-who-did-molesting-.html"&gt;Bill Donohue continues shameless campaign defending child rapists&lt;/a&gt; – Now he’s taken out an ad in the NY Times defending the man most responsible for ensuring the child rapists could continue to prey on more children, The Pope. Oh, and he’s moved on from blaming the families of the victims to blaming the gays. It won’t be long now before he blames everyone on Earth except for The Pope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he’s not the only one defending child rapists. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bay-of-fundie.com/img/2008/pope-benedict2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bay-of-fundie.com/img/2008/pope-benedict2.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="284"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;6. &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100331/ap_on_re_eu/eu_the_vatican_s_defense"&gt;The Vatican has selflessly thought up 3 reasons why they feel The Vatican is not liable&lt;/a&gt; – The first is that the Pope, as head of state, is immune from prosecution (aka Joey Ratz does whatever Joey Ratz wants and if you get in the way, he’ll whack you or have your children horribly raped). The second excuse is that the American priests were not Vatican employees  (This should go over really well with the American Catholics). And the third excuse is that they’ve declared by fiat that the smoking gun evidence that has been confirmed by high ranking church officials is really not smoking gun evidence at all (I call this the Jedi Mind Trick defense – these aren’t the droids you’re looking for. Now move along):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;McMurry insisted Tuesday that Crimen is a smoking gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact is, this document and its predecessors make it an  excommunicable offense to reveal any knowledge of allegations that a  priest has sexually abused,” he said in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of Crimen did not become publicly known until 2003, when a  lawyer noticed a reference to the document while reading a 2001 letter  written by Benedict, then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. McMurry is seeking  to subpoena Ratzinger’s letter, which instructed all bishops to send  cases of clerical sex abuse to him and to keep the proceedings secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for that first excuse that a head of state can’t be sued, fine, let’s call it an act of war then. I hope the Vatican has a strong military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4259"&gt;J.B. Handley and the anti-vaccine movement: Gloating over the decline in confidence in vaccines among parents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (David Gorski)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.B. Handley brags that the U.S. vaccine program is being brought to its knees by the efforts of anti-vaccine activists to spread fear and doubt. He’s wrong: despite the misinformation, ignorance, outright pseudoscience, and paranoid conspiracy theories about vaccines, most parents are still vaccinating their children, and the anti-vaccine movement is starting to get bad press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4240"&gt;A Sleep Remedy with Proprietary Secrets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Harriet Hall) Dream Water is a “natural” sleep remedy containing melatonin, GABA and tryptophan, but the dosage of each is not on the label: it’s a “proprietary secret.” There is little evidence that the individual components are safe and effective, and the mixture has not been tested. Caveat emptor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4304"&gt;Placebo Effects Revisited&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Steven Novella) When implausible treatments like acupuncture are shown to work no better than placebo, we often hear special pleading that placebos work too. Actually, they don’t: there is no measurable objective benefit, only bias in reporting and observation and non-specific, subjective effects. Any potential placebo benefit worth having can be fully realized with science-based interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4334"&gt;Vaccines and autism: are we number 1?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Peter Lipson) Jenny McCarthy says other countries give their kids one-third as many shots as we do, implying that their recommendations are safer and result in less autism. A look at the actual numbers shows that she is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4238"&gt;H Pylori, Plausibility, and Greek Tragedy: the Quirky Case of Dr. John Lykoudis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Kimball Atwood) A discussion of plausibility and how it affects the reception of new ideas in medicine, illustrated by the case of a Greek doctor who discovered in 1958 that peptic ulcers were caused by bacteria and treatable with antibiotics. He was ignored not because the idea seemed implausible but because he was unable to identify the bacteria and the context was not prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4416"&gt;Brief Note: Followup on Spinal Decompression Machines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Harriet Hall) An investigative consumer TV show in Canada did a scathing exposé of the DRX 9000 spinal decompression machines, with hidden cameras and a revealing interview of a chiropractor using weasel words.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009883" title=""&gt;Delimiting Species without Nuclear Monophyly in Madagascar's Mouse Lemurs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Speciation begins when populations become genetically separated through a substantial reduction in gene flow, and it is at this point that a genetically cohesive set of populations attain the sole property of species: the independent evolution of a population-level lineage. The comprehensive delimitation of species within biodiversity hotspots, regardless of their level of divergence, is important for understanding the factors that drive the diversification of biota and for identifying them as targets for conservation. However, delimiting recently diverged species is challenging due to insufficient time for the differential evolution of characters--including morphological differences, reproductive isolation, and gene tree monophyly--that are typically used as evidence for separately evolving lineages. In this study, we assembled multiple lines of evidence from the analysis of mtDNA and nDNA sequence data for the delimitation of a high diversity of cryptically diverged population-level mouse lemur lineages across the island of Madagascar. Our study uses a multi-faceted approach that applies phylogenetic, population genetic, and genealogical analysis for recognizing lineage diversity and presents the most thoroughly sampled species delimitation of mouse lemur ever performed. The resolution of a large number of geographically defined clades in the mtDNA gene tree provides strong initial evidence for recognizing a high diversity of population-level lineages in mouse lemurs. We find additional support for lineage recognition in the striking concordance between mtDNA clades and patterns of nuclear population structure. Lineages identified using these two sources of evidence also exhibit patterns of population divergence according to genealogical exclusivity estimates. Mouse lemur lineage diversity is reflected in both a geographically fine-scaled pattern of population divergence within established and geographically widespread taxa, as well as newly resolved patterns of micro-endemism revealed through expanded field sampling into previously poorly and well-sampled regions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009881" title=""&gt;A Mathematical Model of Sentimental Dynamics Accounting for Marital Dissolution&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marital dissolution is ubiquitous in western societies. It poses major scientific and sociological problems both in theoretical and therapeutic terms. Scholars and therapists agree on the existence of a sort of second law of thermodynamics for sentimental relationships. Effort is required to sustain them. Love is not enough. Building on a simple version of the second law we use optimal control theory as a novel approach to model sentimental dynamics. Our analysis is consistent with sociological data. We show that, when both partners have similar emotional attributes, there is an optimal effort policy yielding a durable happy union. This policy is prey to structural destabilization resulting from a combination of two factors: there is an effort gap because the optimal policy always entails discomfort and there is a tendency to lower effort to non-sustaining levels due to the instability of the dynamics. These mathematical facts implied by the model unveil an underlying mechanism that may explain couple disruption in real scenarios. Within this framework the apparent paradox that a union consistently planned to last forever will probably break up is explained as a mechanistic consequence of the second law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009889" title=""&gt;Words and Melody Are Intertwined in Perception of Sung Words: EEG and Behavioral Evidence&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Language and music, two of the most unique human cognitive abilities, are combined in song, rendering it an ecological model for comparing speech and music cognition. The present study was designed to determine whether words and melodies in song are processed interactively or independently, and to examine the influence of attention on the processing of words and melodies in song. Event-Related brain Potentials (ERPs) and behavioral data were recorded while non-musicians listened to pairs of sung words (prime and target) presented in four experimental conditions: same word, same melody; same word, different melody; different word, same melody; different word, different melody. Participants were asked to attend to either the words or the melody, and to perform a same/different task. In both attentional tasks, different word targets elicited an N400 component, as predicted based on previous results. Most interestingly, different melodies (sung with the same word) elicited an N400 component followed by a late positive component. Finally, ERP and behavioral data converged in showing interactions between the linguistic and melodic dimensions of sung words. The finding that the N400 effect, a well-established marker of semantic processing, was modulated by musical melody in song suggests that variations in musical features affect word processing in sung language. Implications of the interactions between words and melody are discussed in light of evidence for shared neural processing resources between the phonological/semantic aspects of language and the melodic/harmonic aspects of music.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_265.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/hQlKldG5cWU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270009303489"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2010/03/surgery_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e4a8a16d9e69a877</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medical Education"/><title type="html">Surgery</title><published>2010-03-31T05:06:47Z</published><updated>2010-03-31T05:06:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/f_EiLRqMDdU/surgery_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2010/03/surgery_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have now completed almost a year of surgical internship, and as I'm sure you've noticed from my sparse blogging, I've had little free time for writing.  It's a shame too because surgery is just so cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intern year is mostly about learning to manage surgical patients, basically people in varying degrees of health who have the added stress of having surgery recently performed on them.  Although the 80-hour workweek and case requirements have pushed more exposure to the operating room into the process than previously existed, it's still mostly medical management of patients at this stage.  We are required to perform at least 750 cases in our 5 years of training.  Of these cases, we are required to have exposure to a broad range of different surgeries with certain "defined" major cases counting towards specific quotas.  For example, a recent requirement was added that we have at least 85 surgical endoscopy cases, including upper endoscopy and colonoscopies before we graduate.  As a result, most of my day is spent dealing with medical issues with post-surgical patients, and if I'm lucky I get to go to the OR and, with an attending of course, learn some simple procedures.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As your training progresses you take care of more critical patients, with your second year largely devoted to ICU care.  You also are involved more extensively in complicated cases, so by the time you're a third year you are able to help attendings with complex surgical cases, are responsible for evaluating surgical admissions, and begin to manage patients as a chief in some cases.  In fourth and fifth years you are in charge of managing whole surgical services and are operating a majority of the time.  By fifth year you are a chief, and you should be preparing for eventually operating on your own as an attending or for additional specialty training in a fellowship position.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My day starts at about 5AM, when I pre-round on patients, collect the data from the previous day for the all-important list, and get signout (news on what happened overnight) from the intern who was on call.  By 6AM the chief arrives, you round on the patients, and formulate a plan for the day.  You've got to discharge patients who have recovered, manage the medical issues of your post-surgical patients, admit new patients and see the new surgical consults.  Basically general surgeons get training to be excellent medical doctors who also learn to do surgery.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day ends around 5-6PM when you either sign out to the surgeon on call overnight, or take signout from the other services you will cover overnight.  Surgical interns usually cover 3 services overnight, so I might be taking care of pediatric patients, plastic patients and urology patients, or emergency surgery, minimally invasive surgery, and surgical oncology patients for 12 hours until the next shift comes in the morning.  This means you work for about 30 hours straight, the maximum allowed by the new hours limitations.  You address any issues that come up in the night, staff any consults that can't wait until morning, and every once in a while deal with some terrifying emergency that arises at 2AM.  It's not that bad, but after a full shift you sleep like the dead.  Saturday calls are of course the worst, because you start at 6AM on Saturday and don't go home until around noon the next day, basically losing your whole weekend.  Usually we only have to take one Saturday call a month so we don't lose our minds.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that's why I haven't been blogging.  When not at work I'm usually eating, sleeping, or trying to keep my life in some kind of order.  The goal though is to get back into this, to manage my time so we can still talk about medicine, and crankery, and the ever increasing tide of denialist movements.  Not to mention TV shows.  Anyone else seen Jesse Ventura's new show?  It's like crank crack.  Leave it to Ventura to figure out how to free-base illogical thinking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2010/03/surgery_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/f_EiLRqMDdU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270008582335"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PallimedAPalliativeMedicineBlog/~3/kzQsjIP277M/fear-of-morphine-persists-in-around.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c043e7c22583364a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Fear of morphine persists in around the globe</title><published>2010-03-30T23:28:50Z</published><updated>2010-03-30T23:28:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/ALhi8GlUyuQ/fear-of-morphine-persists-in-around.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PallimedAPalliativeMedicineBlog/~3/kzQsjIP277M/fear-of-morphine-persists-in-around.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Last summer I had the distinct pleasure of hosting three medical students from Tongji University Medical School, Shanghai for a month elective in palliative care.  The three students voraciously absorbed information about tending to patients with life-limiting illness - including communicating difficult news, negotiating goals of care, basic and complex symptom management.  We reflected on the differences in practice and in palliative care medical education between UMass and Tongji U in Shanghai.

They were frankly surprised by how commonly morphine was prescribed for severe cancer pain.  In China, they shared with me, meperidine is the drug of choice.  I was equally stunned by their response as they were to our prescribing practices, to say the least.  I wondered how much this was their level of experience versus a more general practice in China.  Not long after, Supportive Care in Cancer published an article reviewing just this issue.

Physicians (including internists, surgeons, breast cancer specialists, gynecologists, orthopedists) from four tertiary care hospitals in Changchun (Northern China) and Changsha (Southern China) were surveyed, and the 201 of the 210 selected responded (97.5% response rate).  The questionnaire evaluated 3 general categories:Knowledge of WHO guidelines and preference with drug choice for cancer pain management;

Knowledge of cancer pain management and actual morphine utilization patterns;

Physician perception of factors impeding use of morphine in clinical practice.

A brief overview of the results: Close to 50% of physicians had comprehensive understanding of the WHO guidelines. The drug of choice for severe cancer pain was meperidine (pethidine).  Only 33.8% understood basic principles of opioid dosing (such as the lack of a maximal dose of morphine - despite China&amp;#39;s State Food &amp;amp; Drug Administration officially supporting this fact since 2000), and this knowledge gap did not correlate with experience level of the physician, but rather with whether physicians had received specific training on opioids.  The principle barriers to prescribing morphine included lack of training in cancer pain management, fear of addiction or diversion, and personal preference.  Certainly, China&amp;#39;s government has been on the forefront of supporting WHO initiatives in this arena and has one of the highest world-wide levels of access of opioids for severe pain.

Since that time, I have reflected on this data with trainees from different countries, including Peru and Korea - similar perceptions arise by the physicians reflecting on practice standards in their home countries.  Experiences by colleagues teaching around the world suggest similar knowledge gaps, and fortunately, like this study suggests: providing education on cancer pain management quickly changes knowledge and practice by clinicians who have access to morphine and other opioids.

I applaud the efforts by Open Society Institute, Institute for Palliative Medicine, Institute Catalan de Oncologia (a palliative medicine WHO demonstration site), and the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care in increasing expertise in pain management and palliative care across the globe.  These groups have lead educational and consulting sessions in host countries, funded and invited physician leaders from across the globe to study with Palliative Care experts and take their knowledge home.  Young physicians and medical students interested in International Medicine may want to consider HPM as a specialty because of the opportunity for international collaboration.  Holly Yang MD - a good friend, excellent teacher, and Midwesterner-turned-California-surfer - is a great example of the upcoming Palliative Care physicians (HPM-LEAD participant) delving into international medicine by teaching international fellows at San Diego Hospice and traveling across the Globe to &amp;quot;spread the knowledge&amp;quot; of this field, promising to continue and to expand upon the work of current leaders in this field like Frank Ferris MD and Kathy Foley MD.

I will be traveling to Shanghai this spring, and look forwards to sharing what I&amp;#39;ve learned from our Chinese colleagues upon my return.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedebate2008.com/www/index.php?id=2"&gt;&lt;img title="Uncle Sam Science" src="http://www.sciencedebate2008.com/www/assets/images/uncle_sam_SD08VOTE.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="391"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the major challenges now facing the nation revolve around  science.  Of the 535 members of Congress, how many do you suppose  are scientists and engineers?  Here’s the answer: three physicists, one  chemist, six engineers including a biomedical engineer, and one  microbiologist.  How  many do you suppose are lawyers, who often avoided science classes like  the plague?  225.  It’s little wonder we see more rhetoric than facts.   It would be less of a problem if Congress had a science advisory body  that gave it quality, non-partisan advice.  Advice that could save  billions by preventing costly policy or spending errors that are not  informed by the best available science.  They used to, and it was called  the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://fas.org/ota/"&gt;Office of Technology Assessment &lt;/a&gt;.  But they closed that 15 years ago to save a relative pittance.   Since then, the science-based challenges facing the nation have  multiplied.  Congressional staffers need access to timely and top  quality science advice on the issues before their Members.  Today, there  are at least two efforts that we are aware of to revive Congress’s  science and technology advisory body.  Working with Science Debate  co-chair and U.S. Representative  Rush Holt (D-NJ), the Union of Concerned  Scientists has organized a letter from scientists supporting the  revival of the OTA that is &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://secure3.convio.net/ucs/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&amp;amp;page=UserAction&amp;amp;id=2361"&gt;open  for signature.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I've had a couple of recent epiphanies regarding that fact, and I haven't been comfortable with how I look (or what size pants I have to buy) for quite a long time. Finally, I've decided to do something about it, and I wish I'd made the decision--or rather, the commitment--earlier. So I've looked up some decent science-based nutrition sites, followed &lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2010/03/fatpositive-feminist-skeptical-diet-3-1.html"&gt;Greta Christina's advice&lt;/a&gt;, and downloaded a couple of calorie-counting apps. I also walked close to three miles today on a whim (it's shocking how short a trip that actually is), even though the exercise plan I developed on &lt;a href="http://dailyburn.com/"&gt;DailyBurn&lt;/a&gt; doesn't have me exercising on Mondays. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've thrown myself into this pretty wholeheartedly, and I'm fairly confident that I'll be successful. I owe that confidence to my skeptical, scientific mindset. First, I'm going to be seeking out solutions and practices supported by evidence. That's going to require the second thing: lots of research. I've already been hitting the websites of some of my favorite restaurants for nutrition information, and I've gotten calorie recommendations from three or four different sources (haven't talked to a doctor yet, but that's on my agenda). Finally, I'll be collecting and recording data regularly and diligently, so I have some objective idea of how well I'm doing. I've set reasonable goals and I have a reasonable attitude about what I can (and am likely to) achieve, and I'm not starting on a crash diet that I know won't work in the long term. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, I have already hit a couple of stumbling blocks. First, the estimates for my healthy weight are all over the damn map (I can't imagine what I'd look like at 6' and &lt;i&gt;138&lt;/i&gt; lbs, but I suspect I wouldn't have all my limbs), which means the numbers I've gotten for a daily calorie intake are similarly widespread. I've settled on the DailyBurn recommendation of 2458-2708, though I think I'd like to keep it closer to 2200, which was the ballpark of another program's estimate. So far it seems more than doable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other big problem I've hit is a lack of data. Sure, I can find nutrition information for a huge number of things, but the milkshake I got tonight to round out my calorie count (and in hopes of increasing my protein intake)? Not a nutrition pamphlet in sight. I used a reasonable facsimile in my count, but I think the solution is going to have to be avoiding some of those little mom-and-pop places with food of unknown value. I hate this whole dearth of information thing, and I really hate guessing--it goes against my instincts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't have any kind of conclusion (talk to me in a few months). I'm just sharing one more way that a healthy skeptical, rational attitude can help you out, and hoping that anyone with more/better information, estimates, and so forth can share their findings as well. Yay science!&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20494433-7890660113475411344?l=dubitoergo.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Foss</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Dubito Ergo Sum</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270004717254"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/03/tonight_hathor_tomorrow_my_muf.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4c3803d6138f5935</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Tonight Hathor, Tomorrow My Muffins</title><published>2010-03-31T03:51:47Z</published><updated>2010-03-31T03:51:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/ZfQ5v461pTI/tonight_hathor_tomorrow_my_muf.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/03/tonight_hathor_tomorrow_my_muf.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight Hathor beckoned me.  &lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s too bad Michio Kaku had to muck it up with a lot of nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a huge step toward unraveling Genesis Chapter 1, Verse 1 - what happened in the beginning," physicist Michio Kaku told The Associated Press.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"This is a Genesis machine. It'll help to recreate the most glorious event in the history of the universe." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, no. Genesis has &lt;i&gt;zero&lt;/i&gt; correspondence to reality. We are not going to drill back through Biblical events to find the truth of Genesis 1:1, which reads, by the way, &lt;span&gt;"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."&lt;/span&gt; Is Kaku suggesting that the LHC will test that proposition? That is a genuinely tone-deaf thing for a scientist to say in fundie-infested America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2010/03/30/beams-collide-today-hadron-collider"&gt;Answers in Genesis stands ready to appropriate the LHC for its purposes&lt;/a&gt;. It's a rather bizarre support they offer to the LHC, though. You see, AiG does not accept the Big Bang, or any early event in the history of the universe that precedes 4004BC. So they have to tip-toe around it: nothing the LHC will discover can possibly confirm modern cosmology, but, they say, it can &lt;span&gt;"give us some interesting insight into how God upholds His universe today"&lt;/span&gt;. Science works only because God makes it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author, Jason Lisle, is quite possibly the most boring creationist I've ever read, so his essay here is scarcely worth reading unless you are really in need of a nap, but it does conclude with a useful revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever scientists discover about the universe from the LHC, it will show that the universe is upheld by God in a consistent way. This will therefore confirm that the Bible is true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get that? No matter what evidence is unearthed, no matter what science learns, no matter what history tells us, everything will be interpreted to confirm their freakish interpretation of the history of the universe. This is not science. There's nothing you can say that is more contrary to the ideal of science than to claim that your ideas are completely impervious to the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are hard of reading: I KNOW THAT KAKU'S WORDS WERE A METAPHOR. I DO NOT THINK HE IS A BELIEVER, LET ALONE A CREATIONIST NUTJOB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do think he said something stupid and thoughtless. And please learn something: saying something is a metaphor does not automatically make it good or even excusable. For some reason, the word 'metaphor' has become a kind of catch-all excuse whenever someone says something stupid and unjustifiable. It isn't. This is almost as bad as rationalizing gobbledygook and nonsense by calling it art or poetry, which is so insulting to the muses of poetry that I expect Calliope and Erato and Polyhymnia to materialize and start thwacking everyone upside the head with a cithara or stuffing scrolls up their nostrils or strangling them with a veil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, for those having trouble following along: METAPHOR IS NOT A MAGIC GET-OUT-OF-STUPID CARD.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/the_large_hadron_collider_will.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/BSRklFpR1Jg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270000276335"><id gr:original-id="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/?p=920">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c84fcf596faa61f5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Books"/><title type="html">Outliers — strike two.</title><published>2010-03-31T01:51:06Z</published><updated>2010-03-31T01:51:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/HjMY5PjbJkY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/2010/03/outliers-strike-two/"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok, this claim in &lt;em&gt;Outliers&lt;/em&gt; can’t pass without comment.  On p.40, Gladwell implies that even Mozart was not really so special.  Yeah, he started composing at age six, but lots of that was just rearrangements of others’ works and he didn’t produce anything that could be considered a masterwork until he was 21.  Right.  How many six year olds do you know who can compose &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminded me of a paper in the &lt;a href="http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/60/54"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that I came across many years ago.  It was published in 1770, and provides an account of the talents of the young Mozart (he was 8 at the time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/wp-content/uploads/30-03-2010-9-33-54-PM.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="30-03-2010 9-33-54 PM" src="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/wp-content/uploads/30-03-2010-9-33-54-PM.jpg" alt="" width="647" height="578"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper is one of the classics highlighted by the Royal Society in their &lt;a href="http://trailblazing.royalsociety.org/"&gt;Trailblazing&lt;/a&gt; series.  Here is &lt;a href="http://trailblazing.royalsociety.org/commentary.aspx?action=printCommentary&amp;amp;eventId=e95"&gt;the summary&lt;/a&gt; they give:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 8 years old Wolfgang Mozart was a sensation in London, but Barrington  was a sceptical observer. Was Wolfgang as young as he claimed to be?  Was he really that talented? At the Mozarts’ lodgings Barrington set the  most difficult tests. Wolfgang played a five-part duet scored in  different keys by sight ‘in a masterly manner’. He even corrected his  father, who accompanied him. On request he extemporized songs embodying  love or rage. Barrington also noted that little Wolfgang was as playful  and distractible as any ordinary child. A favourite cat was given  preference over playing the harpsichord. Barrington was convinced and  wrote that the young boy’s musical gifts were ‘amazing and incredible  almost as it may appear’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the argument in Outliers seems to be that early opportunity combined with lots of practice (10,000 hours) are the major ingredients in exceptional achievement.  Innate abilities are not so important.  My take on this is as follows.  Sure, those who excel are often a) encouraged/pressured/supported in such a way that they can devote a lot of time and effort to a particular skill and b) actually spend the time needed in developing the skill.  But why are some people encouraged/pressured/supported and why are they willing to put in the effort?  I suggest it’s because they show remarkable early promise and are able to learn quickly enough that they can remain dedicated without losing interest.  Moreover, those who have exceptional innate talent may seek out any opportunity to express and nurture it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s Tiger Woods at 2 years old:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/0zI8smcZW4c%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think Earl Woods would have encouraged him to golf so much if he didn’t show this remarkable early potential?  I suspect the same goes for most great athletes, musicians, singers, and so on.  Do you think a toddler would have been interested in golfing so much if he didn’t have a natural talent for it?  I would argue that Gladwell may have it exactly backwards — innate ability is what causes some parents/teachers/whoever to create opportunities for a child and also is what motivates the child to work so hard at improving his or her talents.  Opportunities, 10,000 hours, and all that may be crucial, but they may never happen without innate abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

Evolved biology is big on feedback loops and promiscuous reuse of existing components in new mechanisms. So the core controls of metabolism in most species are a rat's nest of connections - proteins and genes with only a single function are a rare breed indeed: Cancer, diabetes, and aging are related by their use of the PI3K-PTEN-Akt-TOR signaling pathway. This pathway controls how cells grow when nutrients are available and plays a role in how caloric restriction is able to extend lifespan. If parts of the pathway malfunction due to somatic or genetic mutations, cancer or diabetes can result. Thus, the pathway presents an exciting new frontier in medicine as researchers discover how to treat diseases by stopping the propagation of harmful signals and promoting the transmission of beneficial ones. Research in past years has shown benefits to health and longevity in some species as a result of suppressing forms of PI3K. It's a little early to say why this is the case, but it all looks very similar to many more recently discovered ways of recreating......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

It probably depends on how you define empathy. Empathy, by any definition, implies emotional sensitivity to the affective state of another. Sometimes the empathy response is automatic or reflexive, like when babies start to cry upon hearing another baby crying. Sometimes a strong cognitive component is required, such as for [...]...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Some are gossips, others are slackers. And a few are just plain bitches. But getting along in the workplace is essential to your productivity and happiness. If you’re pissed off in your cube, you won’t just be bummed out from 9 to 5, you’ll likely carry that stress and negativity home with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;img title="Business handshake" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/jobinterview1-300x227.jpg" alt="Business Greeting" width="300" height="227"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself repeatedly having problems with a specific co-worker, do what you can to resolve the issues in an adult manner. If the person is just being annoying, learn to tune them out and let their behavior roll off your back. If it’s something more serious that’s affecting your work, take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hours, politely address your co-worker and let them know what’s on your mind. Have they been offending you? Maybe they don’t realize it. Do you think they aren’t pulling their weight? Perhaps you can find ways to work together more efficiently. Don’t be aggressive or rude, but don’t be a wimp about it either. State your case without attacking; offer solutions; and wait to see if things improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, after a period of time, you’re still having problems with them, talk to your immediate supervisor or the HR department; they’ll be able to document your concerns and help plan a course of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can’t play well with others at the office? Maybe it’s not them – it’s you. (Horrors!) Do some hard-core self-evaluation to see if there’s some habit or behavior you could change in order to become a better collaborator. Remember: There’s no “I” in team.&lt;/p&gt;

Though most kids stop taking formula around the one-year mark, others are still attached to the bottle as they head toward the Terrible Twos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;img title="baby-bottle" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/baby-bottle-300x197.jpg" alt="Baby Bottle" width="300" height="197"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prolonged bottle feeding may seem harmless at first, but there are ramifications: Crooked or rotten teeth, a bloated stomach, and being teased by older children. Parents try everything to wean their baby bottle junkies – from hiding bottles to bribing with cookies, toys, games, and other sneaky incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most efficient method to get your baby off the bottle seems the harshest – go cold turkey and stop all bottle feedings immediately. Get rid of all the baby bottles in your home and let your kid cry it out. Then, no matter how big of a tantrum she throws, you won’t have another bottle to offer her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tactic works for many moms and dads, but other parents try the seemingly compassionate route. After introducing a sippy cup by day, they allow their child to have just one bottle at bedtime. Though this seems like a terrific solution, losing that last nighttime bottle may be the hardest part. To ditch their comforting crutch, try this technique:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t make a big production out of the whole thing. The less important you make it seem, the easier it’ll be for your little one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start using small four-ounce bottles instead of big ones. After a week, fill the bedtime bottle with water instead of milk. Offer milk in a sippy cup on the nightstand near the bed. (Babies and toddlers prefer milk to water, so soon they’ll forgo the bottle and start drinking milk from the sippy cup at bedtime.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How old was your baby when he or she quit the bottle completely? Let us know below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on his 20 years of field work throughout the Tibetan language area and on the existing literature, Tournadre estimates that there are 220 "Tibetan dialects" derived from Old Tibetan and currently distributed across five countries:  China, India, Bhutan, Nepal, and Pakistan.  In a forthcoming work, Tournadre states that these "dialects" may be classed within 25 "dialect groups," i.e., groups that do not permit mutual intelligibility.  According to Tournadre, the notion of "dialect group" is equivalent to the notion of "language," but does not entail standardization.  Consequently, says Tournadre, if the concept of standardization is set aside, it would be more appropriate to speak of 25 &lt;strong&gt;languages&lt;/strong&gt; derived from Old Tibetan rather than 25 "dialect groups."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tournadre maintains that this is "not only a terminological issue but it gives an entirely different perception of the range of variation.  When we refer to 25 languages, we make clear that we are dealing with a family comparable in size to the Romance family which has 19 groups of dialects."  (These Romance "groups" are named in footnote 2:  Portuguese, Spanish, Asturian-Leonese, Aragonese, Catalan, Gascon, Provençal, Gallo-wallon, French, Nones-Cadorino, Friulian, Venetan, Lombardo, Corsican, Italian, Napolitan-Sicilian, Sardinian, Aromanian, and Daco-Romance.)  I would prefer to call Romance a "branch," reserving "family" for Indo-European.  The main thing to keep in mind, though, is that, when we refer to 25 "languages," we make clear that we are dealing with a collective entity ("branch" in my terminology) that is comparable in size to Romance which has 19 "groups."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote Tournadre directly, "This perspective is quite different from dealing with several dialects of a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; language.  So I propose to adapt the terminology to reflect the linguistic diversity of the area and speak of &lt;em&gt;Tibetic languages&lt;/em&gt; (or groups of dialects) derived from Old Tibetan."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tournadre goes on to list the twelve major Tibetic languages and the thirteen minor Tibetic languages.  Some of the latter consist of only a single dialect and between a few hundred and a few thousand speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These views are by no means idiosyncratic with Tournadre, but reflect the thinking of a &lt;a href="http://www.isw2.unibe.ch/tibet/"&gt;major research team headed by Roland Bielmeier at the University of Bern&lt;/a&gt; that works on Tibetan dialects.  The position of the dozen or so scholars who have been working at The Tibetan Dialects Project of the Institute of Linguistics at Bern is that "Tibetic is a very useful term to designate a very precise group of languages all directly derived from Old Tibetan."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that it is time for Sinologists to take a cue from the Tibetologists.  Out of a total population of more than 1.3 billion in the People&amp;#39;s Republic of China, there are supposedly almost 1.2 billion speakers of &amp;quot;Chinese.&amp;quot;  This is held to be a single &amp;quot;language,&amp;quot; not a &amp;quot;family,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;branch,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;group&amp;quot; of languages, but a monumental, monolithic LANGUAGE consisting of multitudinous &amp;quot;dialects.&amp;quot;  Since many of these so-called &amp;quot;dialects&amp;quot; are mutually unintelligible, language taxonomists fudge a bit by calling some of them &amp;quot;major dialects,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;sub-dialects,&amp;quot; and so forth.  However, several of the &amp;quot;major dialects&amp;quot; — all of which are mutually unintelligible — have upwards of 20 million speakers:  Mandarin (c. 850 million), Wu (nearly 100 million), Cantonese or Yue (around 90 million), Min (over 50 million), Xiang and Hakka (approximately 35 million each), Gan (roughly 20 million), and Jin ([a disputed subdivision of Mandarin] about 45 million).  Moreover, many of these huge &amp;quot;major dialects&amp;quot; comprise scores of &amp;quot;dialects&amp;quot; that have a very low degree of mutual intelligibility (or none at all) and a highly complex set of internal relationships.  For example, Min is divided into Eastern Min, Southern Min, Central Min, and so forth, and these branches are further subdivided into varieties that are quite different among themselves.  For instance, Southern Min is made up of Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, Amoy (Xiamen), Teochew (Chaozhou), Leizhou, and Hainanese, all of which are significantly dissimilar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not Sinitic and Tibetic are genetically related, how can it be that there is only a single Sinitic &amp;quot;language&amp;quot; with 1.2 billion speakers of innumerable &amp;quot;dialects,&amp;quot; while Tibetic — with somewhere around two million speakers worldwide — is divided into 25 &amp;quot;languages&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the usual arguments in favor of Sinitic or "Chinese" being a single language (common culture, common script, common history, common ethnicity, common polity, and so forth) do not hold water.  For instance, Chinese characters have been used to write Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese, but that certainly does not make Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese Sinitic languages.  Conversely, there are Sinitic languages written in other scripts (e.g., Dungan, which is written in Cyrillic), yet they are Sinitic nonetheless.  Comparable arguments may be brought forward against all of the other "common" features that are frequently adduced in favor of there being only a single "Chinese" language consisting of a myriad "dialects."  In any event, when making a case against the indivisibility of Sinitic, it is not necessary to rebut each of these "common" features individually, since they are largely or wholly extralinguistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to apply the same principles of classification to Sinitic that have been applied to Indo-European, Semitic, Austronesian, Austroasiatic, and so forth, we would soon enough find that — like them — Sinitic is a family of languages that may be organized into branches and groups.  Adopting such an approach to Sinitic would help not only to illuminate many problems in the historical development of Sinitic itself, but would contribute to enhanced comparison with other language families.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269987043489"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=172217">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a1daeca67882cc92</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="ADD/ADHD"/><category term="ADHD"/><category term="boob tube"/><category term="children and tv"/><category term="Disney Channel"/><category term="idiot box"/><category term="kids-and-TV"/><category term="telly"/><category term="Too Much TV"/><category term="tv and adhd"/><category term="tv watching"/><title type="html">Is Your TV Also Your Babysitter?</title><published>2010-03-30T22:02:04Z</published><updated>2010-03-30T22:02:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/is-your-tv-also-your-babysitter/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Even the best parents use their idiot box as a sitter from time to time. When you have crap to do, it’s oh-so tempting to prop your kids in front of the boob tube and turn on the Disney Channel or pop in a DVD. But how much telly is way too much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sxc.hu/profile/Annalog85"&gt;&lt;img title="kids-tv" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/kids-tv.jpg" alt="TV Addict" width="199" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.aap.org/"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; (AAP) recommends that kids younger than two years old not watch any TV at all, and that those older than two watch no more than one to two hours a day of educational programs. So how much are our kids watching? A hell of a lot more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a recent &lt;a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/media_entertainment/tv-viewing-among-kids-at-an-eight-year-high/"&gt;Nielsen report&lt;/a&gt;, American kids are staring at the small screen more than they have since 2001. The study reveals that kids ages two to five spend more than 32 hours a week in front of the TV, and that older kids (ages six to eleven) spend about 28 hours a week there. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, the tube can provide entertainment and education, but it can be as addictive as crack – so keep the habit to a minimum. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They Will Get Fat:&lt;/strong&gt; Children who watch more than four hours of TV a day are more likely to be overweight. And with childhood obesity numbers on the rise, this is a serious concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They Will Become Terrible People: &lt;/strong&gt;TV shows and commercials often depict activities that reinforce poor behavior, outdated gender roles, and even racial stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Their Minds Will Turn to Mush:&lt;/strong&gt; Kids who watch too much TV may be more likely to find school boring or difficult because they’re used to the fast-paced action of TV and video games. There’s also a connection between &lt;a href="http://health.msn.com/health-topics/adhd/articlepage.aspx?cp-documentid=100161248"&gt;too much TV and ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our advice? Turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;

The doctor had prescribed several powerful mental health drugs to Myers – some of which aren’t approved for use by kids, and had been linked to suicide among children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:230px"&gt;&lt;img title="overmedicated" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/overmedicated.jpg" alt="Antidepressants" width="220" height="307"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, more and more youngsters around the country are being diagnosed with ADHD, depression, anxiety, autism, and other emotional disorders. Some parents and doctors jump to the conclusion that every hyper kid has ADHD, or that every sad child suffers from depression and needs medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat surprising is the fact that the &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; has officially approved only one antidepressant drug for the treatment of depression in children – fluoxetine (Prozac).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We just don’t have enough information to draw the conclusion that they’re safe and effective for children,” says Thomas Laughren, who directs the &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; team that approves psychiatric medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet antidepressants including Paxil and Zoloft are prescribed to kids every day across the U.S. How? Doctors can prescribe these drugs as “off label” if they haven’t yet been approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we really a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393320251/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_2?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=0393046850&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=0MYNT0PCDTPAS0BBR3T5"&gt;Ritalin Nation&lt;/a&gt;? Some evidence exists that children are actually under-diagnosed. Author Judith Warner set out to write a book about overmedicated kids, and instead found out that many experts believe &lt;a href="http://jezebel.com/5493574/these-parents-were-trying-to-keep-their-kids-alive-medication-psychiatry-and-kids-with-issues"&gt;children are under-diagnosed and under-treated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

We’re not talking about love or marriage – we’re talking trash. Garbage is usually easier to dismiss than your last husband, boyfriend, or lover, but what happens to your crap after you’re done with it is actually a much stickier situation. So before you buy your next cup of coffee, choose your next set of wheels, or drink your next beer, learn how to navigate the debris field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are three of the&lt;em&gt; least &lt;/em&gt;biodegradable things you can toss, and what you can do instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/87576499.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="1001753400" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/87576499.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="284"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Wheels&lt;/strong&gt; – If you cringe at the thought of ponying up for a whole new set of tires, you should shudder at the thought of scrap tire stockpiles. Experts agree that tires pretty much never go away – they’ll last thousands of years, if not forever, in landfills. Trouble is, tires trap methane gas, causing the actual rubber to rise and disturb landfill covers. So discarded tires often end up in open-air stockpiles that attract disease-carrying pests; these tires can also catch fire, releasing air, ground, and water pollutants. Tire recycling programs do exist, but it’s an expensive, energy-intensive process that hasn’t been adopted on a large enough scale to handle the 260 million tires left in the dust by consumers every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/tires/faq.htm#ques13"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; suggests reducing your tire usage by doing the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purchase tires with longer tread life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rotate your tires every 4,000 miles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balance your tires when you rotate them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check for/inflate tires to recommended air pressure levels  once a            month or before every long trip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use public transportation and carpool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/wenn1282640.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="wenn1282640" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/wenn1282640-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Styrofoam Cup&lt;/strong&gt; – Styrofoam is a great lightweight insulator, but it hangs around landfills a lot longer than it keeps your coffee hot. Like tires, styrofoam will last thousands of years before decomposing. But unlike tires, we don’t really have to use it. Styrofoam is most commonly used for coffee cups and take-out trays, but paper cups and even biodegradable paper or cardboard food trays are widely available; even Starbucks uses those, so it is possible to avoid styrofoam. And if your absolute favorite Chinese take-out place uses styrofoam food trays? Ask them to use your own reusable containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/98025914.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="broken glass bottle on road" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/98025914-300x292.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="292"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Glass Bottle&lt;/strong&gt; – Glass is recyclable in most places, but if you stick it in a trash can? It. Never. Dies. Just like tires and styrofoam, it will live for thousands of years. So if you can’t be bothered to sort your garbage, or don’t spot a recycling bin after you finish your Fizzy Lizzy, think twice – you lazy bastard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surely we can all assent to the notion that a Christian militia of the type now accused of planning domestic terrorism is not Christian. This is why I call them Christianist. Anyone planning to murder innocents by way of IEDs cannot plausibly call himself or herself a follower of Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good thing he threw in that specific bit about IEDs, or I'd have to mention all the innocents slaughtered in Christ's name since, oh, the &lt;i&gt;Dark Ages&lt;/i&gt;. They are spared by a technological technicality!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But OK, if we're going to redefine Christians, let's go all the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone denying the evidence of the world around them, like, say, a creationist, is a Christianist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who denies the joys of sex and abstains because they think God likes them celibate is a Christianist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who uses their religious affiliation as a tool to acquire temporal power is a Christianist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who prays in public is a Christianist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who uses their faith as an excuse to peep into their neighbors' bedrooms and tell them that they're doing it wrong is a Christianist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who begs for money so they can convert other people to their Christian faith is a Christianist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who thinks women should be a subservient sex is a Christianist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who threatens others with the wrath of God is a Christianist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who believes that Jesus manifests himself in this world via magic tricks, like turning crackers into flesh, is a Christianist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who believes that all they have to do is have faith in Jesus, never mind what they do in life, in order to get into heaven is a Christianist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who uses the phrase "God and Country" non-ironically is a Christianist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who hides behind their religion to rape anyone else is a Christianist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who shelters a religious rapist is a Christianist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who complains about those lazy poor people getting health care and food stamps is a Christianist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on, listing lots of things that I think are foolish and reprehensible, and declaring that those who hold those views are not True Christians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I think that it all means that there aren't any Christians anywhere, and they're &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; damned dirty Christianists. I can't tell them apart from the Christians!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid the Hutarees &lt;b&gt;were&lt;/b&gt; Christian, real-live testifyin' preachifyin' Jebus-lovin' Bible-readin' Christians. They weren't Andrew Sullivan's preferred version of Christian, but then, a weird gay Catholic has about as much authority to define who gets to be Christian as an obnoxious and flamingly anti-religious atheist.&lt;/p&gt;

The contributors did an excellent job on their chapters. It's sure to debunk Christianity and cause Christian apologists to scramble in defense of their faith.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are full length chapters in response to the following authors: Paul Copan, Dinesh D'Souza, Richard Weikart, Rodney Stark, Stanley Jaki, Paul Rhodes Eddy and Gregory Boyd. There are others who are responded to in more than just a cursory way: William Lane Craig, Victor Reppert, Michael Murray, Timothy Keller, N.T. Wright, John Hick, Christopher Southgate, C.S. Lewis, J.W. Rogerson, James A. Keller, and C. Michael Patton for starters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's sure to help change the religious landscape. Get it now. See what you think.

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Ratzinger &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/29/world/europe/29pope.html?scp=3&amp;amp;sq=Pope&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;dismissed his critics&lt;/a&gt;, saying that his faith in God helped him “toward the courage of not allowing oneself to be intimidated by the petty gossip of dominant opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petty gossip?  What world is Ratzinger living in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;, Christoper Hitchens continues his &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2249130/"&gt;exposé of Ratzinger’s sleaziness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what makes the scandal an institutional one and not a matter  of delinquency here and there. The church needs and wants control of the  very young and asks their parents to entrust their children to certain  “confessors,” who until recently enjoyed enormous prestige and immunity.  It cannot afford to admit that many of these confessors, and their  superiors, are calcified sadists who cannot believe their luck. Nor can  it afford to admit that the church regularly abandoned the children and  did its best to protect and sometimes even promote their tormentors. So  instead it is whiningly and falsely asserting that all charges against  the pope—none of them surfacing except from within the Catholic  community—are part of a plan to embarrass him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hasn’t been  true so far, but it ought to be true from now on. This grisly little man  is not above or outside the law. He is the titular head of a small  state. We know more and more of the names of the children who were  victims and of the pederasts who were his pets. This is a crime under  any law (as well as a sin), and crime demands not sickly private  ceremonies of “repentance,” or faux compensation by means of  church-financed payoffs, but justice and punishment. The secular  authorities have been feeble for too long but now some lawyers and  prosecutors are starting to bestir themselves. I know some serious men  of law who are discussing what to do if Benedict tries to make his &lt;a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/03/16/pope.uk.visit/"&gt;proposed visit to Britain&lt;/a&gt; in the fall. It’s enough.  There has to be a reckoning, and it should start now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Pope were a Japanese businessman, and running a firm that was corrupt, he’d be forced to step down in humiliation. But Ratzinger is infinitely worse: he presided over an institution that bills itself as a paragon of moral guidance, and yet systematically and institutionally raped its charges and covered up its crimes. And, more and more, we see that Ratzinger was not ignorant but complicit.  In a just world, he  would resign.  Do Catholics have the moral backbone to force him out?&lt;/p&gt;

Humans and animals alike have based their livelihood on the abundance of marine life that results from the deep, nutrient-rich waters of this coastal upwelling. Seabirds, which gather in massive groups off the coast to prey on schools of fish, have been completely sustained, until recently: Anchovy decline from overfishing and El Nino’s warmer waters have led to a major drop in seabird populations. One resilient bird, however, has held steady due to its solitary hunting style....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Despite the superiority of longitudinal vs cross-sectional studies, the dynamics of drug action are poorly explored in pre-clinical studies. Little is known about how drugs affect the activity of their intended target over time. Here, we used a longitudinal imaging approach to accurately follow the state of transcriptional activity of one drug target (the estrogen receptor) in 8 anatomical areas of living ERE-luc reporter mice over 21 consecutive days of hormone replacement therapy with 10 different Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs).

This is a 2006: I checked the accuracy of the algorithm measuring the area under the curve by weighing small pieces of paper. My bench-mates are still laughing...We found that each SERM caused tissue-specific oscillations on ER transcriptional activity which were predictive of the drug structure (after rational extraction of meaningful molecular descriptors).

For more than one century, the measure of drug structure-activity relationships has been based on mathematical equations describing the interaction of the drug with its biological receptor. This is now obsolete, as &amp;#39;binding&amp;#39; does not necessarily spell &amp;#39;function&amp;#39;. Here, a systematic study of spatio-temporal effects is proposed as a measure of drug efficacy for the classification of pharmacologically active compounds.We conclude that the use of reporter mouse facilitates the identification of SERMs able to mimic the physiological estrous cycle and anticipates the possibility of a reverse approach in medicinal chemistry where the space-temporal plot of target activity drives the identification of subtle structure-activity relationships.

With this so-called "theory of mind", we can meaningfully interpret their behaviour, and decide whether it is right or wrong. The legal system also places great emphasis on one's intentions: a "guilty act" only produces criminal liability when it is proven to have been performed in combination with a "guilty mind", and this, too, depends on the ability to make reasoned moral judgements.

MIT researchers now show that this moral compass can be very easily skewed. In a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they report that magnetic pulses which disrupt activity in a specific region of the brain's right hemisphere can interfere with the ability to make certain types of moral judgements, so that hypothetical situations involving attempted harm are perceived to be less morally forbidden and more permissable.

&lt;p&gt;The premise of this work is a small dilemma in sexual selection theory. The theory predicts that females are generally the choosy, limiting sex, so they should invest less in courtship — they can simply lie back, look alluring, and let the males fight it out over them before picking a winner. Males are expected to invest the most in courtship, because after all, winning gets them the big payoff with little expense, while females get the big expense of egg laying/pregnancy. That boys are traditionally expected to ask girls out on dates, not vice versa, makes a lot of sense in the context of this theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A possible contradiction to the theory, though, is the production of female pheromones to invite courtship. Many arthropods in particular — consider moths that produce olfactory signals that males have evolved enormous antennae to detect — use female-initiated signals to initiate courtship behavior in males, as if every day were &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadie_Hawkins_Day"&gt;Sadie Hawkins Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to resolve the contradiction, though, is to discover that the signal evolved for some other purpose than triggering courtship. Perhaps ancestral female moths were flying about smelling generically mothy, and male moths are simply homing in on something the females can't help but produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the crayfish, &lt;i&gt;Pacifastacus leniusculus&lt;/i&gt;. Females in this species initiate courtship with a grand aromatic puff of urine, a kind of crustacean invitation to dance that I am quite glad our species does not emulate.  In the photo above, it's been visualized by injecting the crayfish with a dye, fluorescein, that can be seen against a black background with the proper illumination. The crayfish have been blindfolded so that their behaviors aren't triggered by visual cues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the answer they discovered is that the copious urination is an &lt;i&gt;aggression&lt;/i&gt;, not courting, signal. Males spew it out when they're fighting with other males, females do it at the start of courtship, and males actually reduce the amount of urine produced during courtship. So they're not saying, "I love you, come get me," they're saying "Grrr, fight, fight, fight" when they spray the tank with urine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's the advantage to the ladies here? It's the incitement. The crayfish live in high population densities, and stirring up a little trouble and getting the males to fight provides an opportunity to select a winner. It may also produce a local population of desirable contenders: a whiff of urine may encourage wimpy males to run away and avoid potential trouble, while the more aggressive males may home in on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;em&gt;john hawks weblog&lt;/em&gt;, Hawks shows that there was &lt;a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/brain/paleo/blakemore-brain-evolution-2010.html#"&gt;no sudden increase in human brain size&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s the chart that Hawks provides which plots brain volume over time (the data appear to come from Lee and Wolpoff, 2003, but I haven’t checked):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="brain size volume" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/brain-size-volume.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;Fig. 1. Change in hominin brain size over time.  Time (thousands of years before present) on x axis, brain volume (cc) on y axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Now none of us have done any statistics on the supposed 30% “leap” 200,000 years ago, and I haven’t fitted a line to this to see if the increase has accelerated over time.  Hawks says that this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;As you can see, there’s no sudden jump 200,000 years ago, or at any  other time. The data, such as they are, are consistent with a single  pattern of increase over time, as pointed out by Sang-Hee Lee and  Milford Wolpoff (2003).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Well, yes, there is certainly a “single” pattern of increase (whatever that means), but perhaps a hint that the rate of change became a bit &lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt; 200,000 years ago. But it certainly wasn’t an instantaneous increase, as one would expect with the rapid fixation of a macromutation that increased brain size by 30%.  There seem to be a fair few intermediates!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Michael is the ideal mix of science educator and grassroots skeptics  organizer.  We are all excited to have him join the JREF team, and to  get to work developing our new JREF in the Classroom initiative, as well  as free educational resources for the grassroots and online skeptical  movement,&amp;quot; says D.J. Grothe, President of the JREF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an academic background in zoology, Blanford began his career as a  field biologist, studying amphibians and reptiles in the United States  and Costa Rica.  While he enjoys doing research, he has spent much of  the last 15 years promoting science literacy and appreciation.  He has  developed science curricula, programs, and informal content for a number  of institutions, including schools, community centers, and museums.   Most recently, he was coordinator for the Saint Louis Science Center’s  Life Science Lab, an innovative space with the mission of exposing the  public to the tools and methods of scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael lives with his family in Saint Louis, Missouri , where he spends  much of his spare-time promoting grassroots skepticism through a number  of organizations.  Michael is founder of the Saint Louis Skeptics  Meetup, founder and President of the Skeptical Society of Saint Louis,  co-founder of Saint Louis Skeptics in the Pub, and has served as Vice  President of the Rationalist Society of Saint Louis, America’s oldest  continuously meeting free thought organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Says James Randi:  &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re a rapidly growing educational foundation, and  as such, it&amp;#39;s fitting that we devote even more of our attention to  original educational initiatives. With Michael Blanford joining the  JREF, we&amp;#39;ll be able to do just that. This is a new direction for the  JREF, and I am excited to see where the next few years will take us.   Welcome aboard, Michael!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Part Four opens with Chapter Twelve, “Black Holes:  The Ends of Time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike boxes full of atoms, we can’t make black holes with the same size but different masses. The size of a black hole is characterized by the “Schwarzschild radius,” which is precisely proportional to its mass.  If you know the mass, you know the size; contrariwise, if you have a box of fixed size, there is a maximum mass black hole you can possibly fit into it. But if the entropy of the black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon, that means there is a maximum amount of entropy you can possibly fit into a region of some fixed size, which is achieved by a black hole of that size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a remarkable fact. It represents a dramatic difference in the behavior of entropy once gravity becomes important. In a hypothetical world in which there was no such thing as gravity, we could squeeze as much entropy as we wanted into any given region; but gravity stops us from doing that.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not surprising to find a chapter about black holes in a book that talks about relativity and cosmology and all that.  But the point here is obviously a slightly different one than usual:  we care about the entropy of the black hole, not the gruesome story of what happens if you fall into the singularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black holes are important to our story for a couple of reasons.  One is that &lt;em&gt;gravity&lt;/em&gt; is certainly important to our story, because we care about the entropy of the universe and gravity plays a crucial role in how the universe evolves.  But that raises a problem that people love to bring up:  because we don’t understand quantum gravity (and in particular we don’t have a complete understanding of the space of microstates), we’re not really able to calculate the entropy of a system when gravity is important.  The one shining counterexample to this is when the system is a black hole; Bekenstein and Hawking gave us a formula that allows us to calculate the entropy with confidence.  It’s a slightly weird situation — we know how to calculate the entropy of a system when gravity is completely irrelevant, and we also know how to calculate the entropy when gravity is completely dominant and you have a black hole.  It’s only the messy in-between situations that give us trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other reason black holes are important, of course, is that the &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt; that Bekenstein and Hawking derive is somewhat surprising, and ultimately game-changing.  The entropy is not proportional to the volume inside the black hole (whatever that might have meant, anyway) — it’s proportional to the area of the event horizon.  That’s the origin of the holographic principle, which is perhaps the most intriguing result yet to come out of the thought-experiment-driven world of quantum gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holographic principle is undoubtedly going to have important consequences for our ultimate understanding of spacetime and entropy, but how it will all play out is somewhat unclear right now.  I felt it was important to cover this stuff in the book, although it doesn’t really lead to any neat resolutions of the problems we are tackling.  Still, hopefully it was somewhat comprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;

A recent study with rats has shown that the dopamine receptors in the brains of these rats were affected by high fat food in the same way their brains were affected by cocaine and heroin. Apparently foods like cheesecake and french-fries would cause these junk-food-junkie rats to walk over an electrified cage just to stuff their little rat faces full of pie. Of course then my mind wandered off to how these rats would behave if set free. Surely &lt;img src="http://img62.imageshack.us/img62/2155/mousec.jpg" alt="mouse with machine gun" width="320" height="291"&gt;they would go get tiny semi-automatic guns, hold up liquor stores and then alienate their rat friends and families in order to score some delicious chocolate cake or a McDonald’s happy meal. Then they would get busted and locked up in rat-prison or if they were lucky, rat-rehab. A tiny, fuzzy, high-fat dopamine induced tragedy just waiting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I got a little sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then remembered that I promised I would lighten up a little this week with my AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to make some cookies and score a little dopamine rush of my own. And then I thought I would fill you in on a little known fact: Skepchick Jill hasn’t been seen much around Skepchick headquarters because she is busy blissfully baking cookies and has started a &lt;a href="http://cookieclubhouse.blogspot.com/"&gt;super-sweet cookie club complete with a blog&lt;/a&gt;! I recommend you check it out! And Jill, I recommend &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; get some tiny security cams because it’s just a matter of time before some tiny paws will be knocking on your cookie jars!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your favorite cookie or sweet treat? Recipes get bonus points!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afternoon Inquisition (or AI) is a question posed to you, the Skepchick community.

It has long been known that when exposed to ultraviolent light, fossilized bones and shells -- and even tissues -- will fluoresce, thus rendering undetectable details visible. But inexplicably, this technique has been used mostly to visualize fossilized invertebrates, and has rarely been used to investigate hidden structures in most vertebrate fossils. But a team of paleontologists recently studied the Microraptor gui holotype using UV light.

As the sky darkens, Venus will be obvious and easy to spot above the horizon, a brilliant beacon hovering in the sky. But for a few days, the elusive Mercury will also be popping in for a visit! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercury orbits much closer to the Sun than Earth does, and so from our vantage point never seems to stray far from our nearest star. It’s always lurking in the twilight, and most people can go their whole lives without seeing it. It’s rumored (though &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1892Obs....15..321L"&gt;by no means established fact&lt;/a&gt;) that Copernicus himself never saw Mercury. But this week will provide you with an excellent chance to spot it. It will stay near Venus for several days, and with no other bright stars nearby it will be fairly easy to pick out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Mercury and Venus move faster in their orbits than Earth does, so if you go out every night you’ll see them change positions slightly in the sky. From our perspective, Venus is on the far side of the Sun, and Mercury to the side. After about April 10, Mercury will start to fade rapidly, so get out there and take a look! More info and diagrams to help you spot the planetary duo can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/about/pressreleases/89145892.html"&gt;the Sky and Telescope website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’ll add that if you have a digital camera, try to get some photos! The planets are bright enough to show up in images easily, and if you get an interesting foreground object (a tree, a bridge, etc.) you can get some very nice shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LHC is the world’s largest physics experiment, and is attempting to recreate conditions in the Universe when it was only a fraction of a second old. At that point, pressures and temperatures were so high that the laws of physics were somewhat different than we’re used to. These conditions are extremely difficult to duplicate, which is why it’s taken so long to get the LHC running. The collider uses extremely powerful magnets to guide and accelerate two beams of protons to nearly the speed of light. They go around the collider in opposite directions, then are tweaked to smack into each other. The huge energies of the collision create particles and conditions that can be detected and used to test theories of how the Universe behaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some minor glitches before the protons could be injected into the main collider last night, but once things got going, the beams were sent at each other at full power. The energies were ramped up to 3 TeV, or three trillion electron volts (a unit of energy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, 3 TeV is not much energy in human terms. It’s roughly the amount of energy of a single mosquito in flight. But for a single proton, 3 TeV is huge, vast, incredible, brobdingnagian, ginormous! When the two proton beams are at full power, they contain the same kinetic energy as a battleship moving at several kph! So we’re talking about powerful events, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I visited CERN and the LHC a couple of years ago, and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/04/22/europe-day-3-cern-the-lhc/"&gt;wrote up my thoughts&lt;/a&gt;. I was of the opinion then, and still am now, that this will be a revolution in physics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a video of that tour, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/RXjR-Jkrsvg%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My congratulations to the hordes of people who made this moment possible. It has been a long, difficult journey indeed, but now the real voyage is underway. May the wild physics rumpus begin!&lt;/p&gt;

As temperatures fall, lizards sprint slower, fish swim slower, and frogs jump shorter distances. Life-sustaining skills such as outrunning predators and foraging for food become insurmountable challenges. So it&amp;#39;s not surprising that most cold-blooded animals, also known as ectotherms, remain inactive during the cooler parts of the day or avoid frosty habitats altogether. Most cold-blooded animals that is, except for chameleons....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

How about you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, apparently an "insider" disagrees, says CNN: &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/03/30/michigan.militia.arrests/index.html?hpt=T2"&gt;Group arrested not Christian or militia, says insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Reading that headline, I figured they had found a wife or friend or relative or something of one of the apprehended Christian terrorists and he/she/it had said something like "They're actually Zoroastrians and the whole 'militia' thing was an elaborate prank with high-quality replica guns." You know, that an actual insider had given actual inside information that disconfirmed the ostensible mission of the Hutaree group and the reports that have been all over the news the last day or so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, that's not what I got. Instead, the "insider" is a guy named Michael Lackomar, a member of another Michigan militia, and he says&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a group that I would classify as neither a militia or a Christian group. They're really a fringe group outside of anything we do. They're more of a private army or a terrorist organization or really just a criminal organization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;No true militia does things differently from my militia! My militia is the only militia that does militia things in a way that qualifies them as a militia! Also, despite the fact that they professed earnest belief in Jesus Christ and wanted to fight for him in the end times, they're not Christian!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Way to go, Mike! You managed to kill two birds with one fallacy, and in a single sound byte, no less. You're a talented moran.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's just forget, for the moment, that the Hutaree group meets all the criteria for both the label "Christian" and the label "miltia:" they are a civilian paramilitary organization that believes in Jesus Christ as the messiah. They don't do things the way Mike Lackwit does them, therefore they are neither.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And thanks, CNN, for reporting on what this dipshit says about the other dipshits. Why you bothered to write about him I can't understand; it's not like it's a slow news day. I don't know if you heard, but the FBI just raided some insane extremist Christian militia group and took nine assorted nutbags into custody. Pretty big stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it's bad enough that they bothered to quote Lackomar in the first place. It's worse that they put his fallacious assertions front and center as the ostensible subject of the article. It's even &lt;i&gt;worse&lt;/i&gt; that &lt;i&gt;after the quote I gave, the rest of the article ignored Lackomar and talks exclusively about the arrests and the details of the indictment&lt;/i&gt;. The actual main focus of the article, a good two thirds at least, has absolutely nothing to do with Lackomar or cutesy rhetorical tricks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it was a good headline, right? I clicked, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, and so did thousands of others who wouldn't know a No True Scotsman if it poured a bowl of sugared porridge on their heads. CNN pulled a bait-and-switch in order to have a flashy title instead of "Details of the Hutaree indictment," and now the impression that will be left in so many readers' heads is "Huh. I guess they weren't actually a Christian militia."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks, CNN!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-3026688666147237041?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Don)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269970775718"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2010/03/problems_in_the_scientific_lit.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/91353c893c2484af</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Communication"/><title type="html">Problems in the scientific literature: vigilance and victim-blaming.</title><published>2010-03-30T18:33:15Z</published><updated>2010-03-30T18:33:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/y8FHSPMIQNM/problems_in_the_scientific_lit.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2010/03/problems_in_the_scientific_lit.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;That &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2010/03/how_hard_is_it_to_clean_up_the.php"&gt;post about how hard it is to clean up the scientific literature&lt;/a&gt; has spawned an &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2010/03/how_hard_is_it_to_clean_up_the.php#comments"&gt;interesting conversation in the comments&lt;/a&gt;.  Perhaps predictably, the big points of contention seem to be how big a problem a few fraudulent papers in the literature &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; are (given the self-correcting nature of science and all that), and whether there larger (and mistaken) conclusions people might be drawing about science on the basis of a small fraction of the literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will note just in passing that we do not have reliable numbers on what percentage of the papers published in the scientific literature are fraudulent.  We may be able to come up with reliable measures of the number of published papers that have been &lt;em&gt;discovered&lt;/em&gt; to be fraudulent, but there's not a good procedure to accurately count the ones that succeed in fooling us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set that worry aside, and the legitimate worry that "little frauds" that might not do too much to deform the shape of the scientific literature might end up having significant effects on the scientific career scorekeeping.  Let's take on the big question:  &lt;/p&gt;

By Richard E. Cytowic and David Eagleman. X + 309 pp. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. 2009. For people with synesthesia, particular stimuli automatically and involuntarily elicit a characteristic secondary percept or feeling.  Thus, hearing particular sounds may stimulate the very real perception of colored shapes in the visual field, tasting flavors may induce the tactile sensation of specific objects, and different textures may induce specific emotions.  Curiously, in addition to basic sensory stimuli, many learned categories such as numbers, letters, words, calendar units, musical notes or chords can act as inducers.  Indeed, colored letters and numbers (grapheme-to-color synesthesia) and the association of numbers with specific positions in space (numbers forms) are by far the most common types of synesthesia.  The particular pairings, between inducing stimuli and concurrent, secondary percepts are quite idiosyncratic, though very consistent and stable over time in each individual.  As such, they form an enduring and essential component of the qualitative experience of perception in synesthetes.   Cytowic can rightly claim some of the credit for bringing synesthesia – a once popular subject that languished while the strict doctrine of behaviorism held sway in psychology – back to the attention of the scientific community and the general public.  Here he parlays his extensive personal research and experience with synesthetes into a wonderfully detailed description of the phenomenology of this condition. The personal accounts of synesthetes, teased out by probing questioning, richly convey a sense of what the experience of synesthesia feels like, in as much as that is possible to convey to people who are not synesthetes.  One synesthete who perceives shapes in response to sounds says: “The shapes are not distinct from hearing them – they are part of what hearing is”.  These accounts, including descriptions of various synesthetes’ efforts to convey the nature of the experience through art, graphically illustrate the diversity and idiosyncrasy of synesthetic experiences.  They are counterbalanced by data derived from the extensive and systematic characterization of large numbers of synesthetes by Eagleman and colleagues, and other researchers, which provide an informative and detailed overview of the condition across the population.  One of the amazing findings of recent years is just how common this condition is – exact figures vary but are on the order of one to four percent of the population.The condition often runs in families and most synesthetes report that it “has always been there”.  Synesthesia has therefore attracted a great deal of recent interest as a possible case where mutation of a gene or genes results in altered organization or function of circuits mediating perception.  The use of clever psychophysical experiments has verified objectively the existence of an extra percept as part of the experience of people with synesthesia.  More recently, neuroimaging studies of synesthetes with sound-to-color or grapheme-to-color synesthesia have directly demonstrated activation of visual areas subserving color perception in response to aurally presented words or visually presented, achromatic graphemes.  The hypothesis has thus emerged that the condition results from cross-activation of one specialized cortical area by another, normally separate one. There are two major mechanistic explanations: the first, that there are extra axonal connections between the relevant cortical areas in synesthetes; the second is that such connections exist in all people, but are disinhibited in synesthetes.  The authors consider both models as plausible explanations but advance several arguments in favor of the latter.  These are based mainly on the premise that synesthetic experiences represent an extension of normal processes of multisensory integration.  This resemblance seems quite superficial.  In particular, while multisensory effects are ubiquitous in normal perception, they tend to be modulatory rather than driving; that is, stimulation in one sensory modality can alter the perceived timing or spatial location of sensory information in another modality (as in the ventriloquist effect) but does not generally trigger a totally new percept.  In addition, recent studies have found that synesthetes do not generally show greater multisensory integration of this sort. More pertinent evidence in favor of the disinhibition model is the fact that even non-synesthetes have a tendency to map stimuli from one sense to another (e.g., matching higher pitched sounds with brighter colors) and also that some hallucinogens can induce a pseudo-synesthetic state.  The authors suggest that such mechanisms obviate the need for any extra connections in synesthetes, though why they think this would be a difficult situation to engender is not clear.  There is substantial phenotypic variation in brain circuitry in the normal population, which is highly heritable, and now many examples of genetic lesions in humans that alter nervous system circuitry with behavioral consequences.  A model of innate structural differences thus seems equally plausible, and even parsimonious (see review by Bargary and Mitchell).The subtitle of the book promises to “discover the brain of synesthesia”.  Exploration of this topic is largely postponed to chapter nine, but is foreshadowed so frequently in the rest of the book that I admit I skipped ahead to read it....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I was wondering whether you were ever given, or able to find, a citation for "Anything you can do, I can do meta" earlier than the reported use by Samuel Hahn in 1991.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Let me explain my interest.  Each year the Department of Philosophy at Princeton makes a t-shirt for the graduating class with a quotation of their choice on it.  This year they've chosen "Anything you can do, I can do meta", but of course they have no idea who said it.  I'd quite like to be able to tell them when it first appeared in print, if that's known.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Smith followed up with this post scriptum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;After a little further searching on Google I came up with the attached article from 1979 (see p.1230, footnote 2).  However, if you know of an earlier citation, or of a credit to someone other than Lipson, I'd be grateful if you would let me know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attached article is Arthur Allen Leff, "&lt;a href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&amp;amp;handle=hein.journals/duklr1979&amp;amp;id=1248&amp;amp;type=image#1248"&gt;Unspeakable ethics, unnatural law&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Duke Law Journal&lt;/em&gt;, December 1979. The passage in question reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I shall first try to prove to your satisfaction that there cannot be any normative system ultimately based on anything except human will. I shall then try to trace some fo the scars left on recent jurisprudential writings by this growing, and apparently terrifying, realization. Finally, I shall say a few things about — of all things — law and the way in which the impossibility of normative grounding hecessarily shapes attitudes toward constitutional interpretation.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;2. My colleague, Leon Lipson, once described a certain species of legal writing as, "Anything you can do, I can do meta." What follows is a pure instantiation of his category.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Allen_Leff"&gt;Arthur Allen Leff&lt;/a&gt; (1935-1981) was at Yale Law School, and so was Leon Lipson, who &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/26/nyregion/prof-leon-lipson-75-authority-on-soviet-law.html?pagewanted=1"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; in 1996. I don't know enough about the language of law professors in the 1970s to understand the background of their use of &lt;em&gt;meta&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure that I heard this phrase used around the MIT AI Lab, Xerox PARC, etc., no later than 1978 and probably during the 1972-1975 period, in the context of language/meta-language issues coming out of logic and philosophy of language, and imported into discussion of programming language semantics as well as general theories of meaning. Note also that &lt;a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/voy/museum/pictures/display/1-6-RAIL-keybd.jpg"&gt;keyboards at SAIL&lt;/a&gt; as well as at &lt;a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/Q/quadruple-bucky.html"&gt;MIT &lt;/a&gt;had meta keys (I think) in the late 1960s, but certainly by the mid-70s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can anyone document a more specific source for the quotation? (The discussion in &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004073.html"&gt;my 2007 post&lt;/a&gt;, though inconclusive, is a place to start.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limiting time would be 1946, the date of Irving Berlin's musical Annie Get Your Gun, in which "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anything_You_Can_Do_%28song%29"&gt;Anything you can do, I can do better&lt;/a&gt;" is the climactic song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Here&amp;#39;s a maddeningly open-textured memory — time and place uncertain, validity also uncertain. I think this was around 1978, maybe at MIT, maybe somewhere else, and &lt;a href="http://www.ageofsignificance.org/people/bcsmith/bio.html"&gt;Brian Smith&lt;/a&gt; was giving a talk about the ideas on computational "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_science%29"&gt;reflection&lt;/a&gt;" (a way for "a computational system to 'reason' effectively and consquentially about its own inference processes") that were eventually laid out in his &lt;a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/15961"&gt;1982 MIT PhD thesis&lt;/a&gt;.  Afterwards, someone in the audience raised his hand and said "So what you're saying is, 'anything you can do, I can do meta'". Or maybe not, and someone made the joke about Brian's work in some other context. In either case, I don't think it was the first time that I heard the phrase.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269968579066"><id gr:original-id="http://spacecityskeptics.wordpress.com/?p=516">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/998187f82eb4a2f8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">The essence of empiricism</title><published>2010-03-30T17:02:57Z</published><updated>2010-03-30T17:02:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://spacecityskeptics.wordpress.com/2010/03/30/the-essence-of-empiricism/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://spacecityskeptics.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://spacecityskeptics.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dtstrain-article-pic7.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="dtstrain-article-pic" src="http://spacecityskeptics.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dtstrain-article-pic7.jpg?w=700" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reality, Self, Knowledge, Self Knowledge.

&lt;p&gt;Empiricism may seem contradictory to many spiritual practices, but some  of them manage to fit more comfortably alongside empirical approaches to  knowledge. An empirical approach is one that says that all knowledge  ultimately comes to us in experiences through one of our five senses.  This is opposed to the claim that knowledge of things can come to us  through revelation, intuition, or other means beyond our physical  senses. Even mere reasoning, without some basis in experience in  physical evidence is not enough to generate true knowledge on its own.  Knowledge, then, is when we hold concepts about the world which are both  true (they match reality), and justified (they are based on some  physical evidence verifiable by the senses, and not merely true by  chance or coincidence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can such an approach to knowledge be compatible with a spiritual  practice? As a Humanist, the above describes my own position on  knowledge. I look at it as a matter of humility. When asked what I think  about invisible or unproved things, or the possibility of life after  death, or the ultimate secrets of the universe, I am content to say “I  don’t know”. Many of these things certainly aren’t &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt;.  In fact, it’s actually &lt;em&gt;likely&lt;/em&gt; their are many things that are  true about reality that we have not yet experienced, and may not even be  capable of experiencing. But we must be humble in accepting that as  limited human beings, we are imperfect in our ability to know all  things. This practice of humility when it comes to ‘what we say is true’  not only applies to the supernatural, but to all things. It is a  spiritual practice important to good character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at another philosophy: Buddhism. One can certainly find  Buddhists who believe in all manner of unproved things. The various  branches and ways of practicing Buddhism are many, and infused with the  cultural heritage of their geographically related manifestations. But  the Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama), when asked about whether the world is  eternal or finite, whether the soul and body are identical, whether we  exist after death said that those kinds of things were not beneficial  and did not lead to wisdom. He said that no matter how long you live you  won’t be able to answer all of the metaphysical questions, and that  these had nothing to do with the fundamentals of religion anyway[1].  Instead, what he offered was a way to address suffering in the here and  now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is perhaps even more central to this issue in Buddhism is the  Kalama Sutra. This teaching says that one should not trust reports,  tradition, or hearsay. One should not be lead by the authority of  religious texts, by mere logic or inference, by mere appearances, by  seeming possibilities, by delight in speculative opinions, or merely on  the authority of a teacher – including even the Buddha himself. Rather,  one should find out for oneself, through &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt;, whether  something is true or effective, or if it is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the West, several ancient Greek philosophies also valued reason and  observation in seeking knowledge and understanding – as such, they were  rationalists. The Stoics and the Epicureans believed that a person was  born a blank slate, and that knowledge came to him through the senses.  However, the Stoics believed there were some “common notions” or innate  ideas in all people’s minds that did not come through the senses. These  were very rudimentary things like, how we know to categorize and  question things, a basic sense of longing for fairness or the good, and  so on. These were likely struggles to understand the underlying  responses shared by all newborn human beings due to the makeup and  natural behavior of the human brain and our evolved instincts.  Nevertheless, when looked at on the overall spectrum regarding  knowledge, the Stoic model more closely aligns with empiricism rather  than mysticism or other means[2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So both of these Eastern and Western branches of what we today would  call ‘spiritual’ or contemplative paths have some kinship to empiricism.  The reason it seems so contrary today is because, often in  contemplative practice, the goal is to delve into the subjective, and  empiricism is thought to deal with the objective. Generally, we conceive  of the scientific approach as one where we examine some external  phenomenon from the third-person perspective. But what if the thing  being studied is, by nature, a first-person phenomenon? In contemplative  practice, we are attempting to uncover practices that result in the  experience of happiness in life. In building and propagating these  contemplative lessons we are trying, not to understand the function of  the brain as an organ from the objective point of view, but rather to  understand the nature of the experiential mind from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we must not look solely at empiricism as it has been practiced in  Western science traditionally, but must consider the &lt;em&gt;essence&lt;/em&gt; of  empiricism…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of empiricism is that we do not rely on authority,  revelation, or other unproved means of gathering information, but  instead rely on our direct observation and experience. Certainly, this  includes various means to extend our senses, as well as  cross-correlation with the experiences of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all cases of empirical observation, even on the study of external  things such as planets and stars, and no matter how objective we try to  be in our methods, the matter will ultimately boil down to a subjective,  first-person experience. The most tested instrument will, in the end,  show a reading that will enter my eyes and become my own personal  experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contemplative practices where we try to learn about practices that  effect our own minds from the experiential perspective, the only way to  test those practices is to perform them and experience the results  directly. Because all third-person empirical observation ultimately ends  in a subjective first-person experience, the only difference between  these cases, and cases of the first-person empirical approach is in the  number of steps removed the observer is from the observed. In  traditional empiricism, there may be dozens of steps between the outer  reality, and the final subjective experience of the data. In  first-person empirical study of the mind, there is only one step.  Therefore, not only is a first-person empirical experience the only  possible way to measure the efficacy of contemplative practices on the  mind, but it is actually far less prone to error than traditional  empirical methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I would be remiss not to point out an important distinction.  The reason first-person direct experience is the valid way to study  contemplative practices, is because the alleged phenomenon being studied  is a first-person phenomenon (that being, the experience of a contented  life, greater long-term peace, greater concentration/focus, better  handling of emotional responses, more compassion, etc resulting from  said practices). Where we are prone to disaster is if we take a  first-person approach to third-person phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, were we to think that we can ‘directly and internally  experience’ the nature of the surface of Mars or the cause of a disease  by meditating on it, there would be a disconnect between the reality and  our final stage of data. There would be no confirmed and reliably  proved method by which the external facts made their way into our heads.  Indeed, some people claim these sorts of perceptions, but alas no one  has ever been able to reliably and repeatedly confirm them under  controlled testable conditions. Again, that doesn’t mean the truth of  such claims isn’t possible, it just means that the humble person will  acknowledge them as yet unverified and unknown, allowing for the  possibility – even likelihood – of mistaken perception, self delusion,  or fraud.&lt;br&gt;
By the way, the symbol presented above is one I thought of today – a  stylized venn diagram of sorts. It represents knowledge and self  knowledge. The large one is the main symbol, but I’ve shown two other  styles it could be presented as to the right. With such a simple form, I  was surprised not to see it listed at &lt;a href="http://www.symbols.com/"&gt;symbols.com&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps meaning something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outer circle represents reality. The square inside that represents  us (or more specifically our minds). The circle inside that square  represents our internal model of reality – a reflection, we hope, of the  true external reality, or &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, our minds are a  part of reality as a whole, which is why the square is inside the  circle. Therefore another smaller square is inside the smaller circle as  well. This smallest square represents self knowledge. It is our  internal model of ourselves – a subset of our internal model of reality  as a whole. Thus, we cannot have true understanding without also having  understanding of ourselves. This touches on the possible pitfalls we  face in our efforts to learn, if we are not cognizant of our own  limitations on knowing and humble in our assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

First Haiti, then Chile. And we’re not talking about little hiccups. The sheer devastation in those countries is now raising alarms in the rest of the world – cities that sit on fault lines in California and the Northwest are especially vulnerable, and likely due for their share of seismic wrath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Op-Ed piece, “&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/28/opinion/28yanev.html"&gt;Shake, Rattle, Seattle&lt;/a&gt;“, discusses the vulnerability of those cities and their structural weaknesses. Its author, Peter Yanev, heads up a structural engineering and earthquake consulting firm. He warns that Seattle and parts of California are due to experience quakes on par with this year’s shocks, but that their buildings aren’t designed to stand up against the kind of tremors that jolted Haiti and Chile. (Surprisingly, most buildings in Chile &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; hold up reasonably well, which is amazing considering the immense damage inflicted there.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yanev alludes to adjusting the construction codes in Seattle to help protect against destruction. But his (slightly discouraging) conclusion seems to be that if the fabled Northwest quake hits anytime soon, to put it indelicately – we’re fucked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you lived in an area with a high risk of natural disasters (or maybe you do), what would your master plan be? Stick around and hope your house isn’t leveled, or pack up and flee to the prairie where you’re sure to avoid the Year of the Tectonic Plate? (Of course, then you’d have to worry about tornadoes.)&lt;/p&gt;

The effect of this would mean that as long as there is no malice, the publisher of the statement will have a defence to a libel action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Court of Appeal may also provide guidance on what the High Court should do in cases such as Simon's when the judge determines meaning rather than, as is traditional with defamation, the jury.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The judgment is therefore likely to become a "leading case" for science writing and perhaps even libel generally even if, for some unwelcome reason, the Court of Appeal finds against Simon in this particular case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whichever party loses, there will be the possibility of applying for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, though such applications are rarely successful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, unless there is such an application, the case will return to the High Court, though it may be that the BCA will seek to settle if the judgment goes against them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I plan to go to hear whether Simon has won or lost.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are in London then do come along to console or celebrate, depending on the result.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if you cannot come along, I will also tweet the result &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jackofkent"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt; as soon as it is appropriate for me to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published; always use a name for ease of reference by other commenters.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-6041211280174620937?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269967238817"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=22919">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/29eb0ea47aaba20f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Advice"/><category term="Books"/><category term="General"/><category term="Richard Wade"/><title type="html">Ask Richard: What Books Can Help My Catholic Siblings Become More Rational?</title><published>2010-03-30T16:17:08Z</published><updated>2010-03-30T16:17:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/30/ask-richard-what-books-can-help-my-catholic-siblings-become-more-rational/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Richard, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read your column with interest, as many of the issues pertain to my family situation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immersed in Catholicism until age 19 when I quit the seminary and joined the US Navy, I left behind a thoroughly delusional extended family of Catholics, none of whom have ever doubted the world view they were indoctrinated into, and therefore never tested the waters of more worldly philosophic alternatives.  That was 50 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, to this day they are all still firmly in the camp of the holy see (except possibly for the rhythm method); and their political proclivities are completely predictable.  They would be overjoyed that our supreme court now has a plurality “on their side,” if indeed they were aware of such esoteric details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried to avoid provoking, insulting, or disparaging their unsubstantiated beliefs; but have made it clear that I had long ago been deconverted to a rational, humanistic, and progressive &lt;em&gt;Weltanshauung,&lt;/em&gt; shortly after leaving the h&lt;b&gt;o&lt;/b&gt;llowed halls of the seminary and the family nest.  Of course, “leaving” was my moment of lucidity that enabled deconversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you suggest one or more starter books which I could send to siblings who might have a hidden spark of curiosity about the natural world, if only they could get over their damned fear of eternal damnation?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years I have expounded with several of my siblings, including the monk, on the absurdity of this malevolent doctrine central to two of the three Abrahamic cults; but I was met only with rolling of the eyes and shaking of the head, no doubt gestures of pity for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they clearly are not ready for Dawkins, Dennett, Harris, or Hitchens (all of whom I highly esteem).  But maybe there is an author I have not yet read, who could worm her way past this monumental hurdle, and allay their fears.&lt;br&gt;
It really is an insidious trump card that Christianity and Islam have played on humanity.  I suspect Daniel Dennet is on target…  &lt;em&gt;Let the old folks live out their lives in the comfort of their illusions…&lt;/em&gt;  or words to that effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;god free in Seattle
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear god free,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you’re not fully god free until you are also free of the importance of getting others to be god free, at least so that the mere fact that they still have god beliefs does not disturb your personal serenity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re about 69 years old, and so I assume your siblings are roughly the same age.  By your description, they are not just deeply indoctrinated in Catholicism, they’re deeply entrenched in it, and they have shown no interest in matters that would distract them from that focus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re hoping that something they read will get them past their “damned fear of eternal damnation.”  I doubt that they &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to get past it. In many years as a counselor, I have worked with thousands of people and their fears.  Telling me about their fear didn’t necessarily mean they wanted to be free of it, and if they didn’t want to let it go, I couldn’t take it away.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some people, lifelong, deeply engrained fears are familiar, orienting, and reassuring walls of containment. Think of the difference between claustrophobia and agoraphobia.  You felt in a sense claustrophobic, stifled and imprisoned by the Catholic dogma, and so you went out into the wide world, (and in the Navy, you’re as out in the open as you can get.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your siblings are in a sense agoraphobic, feeling exposed in the wide world, intimidated by the countless possibilities and risks radiating out from them in all directions.  Boundless freedom means boundless responsibility and boundless jeopardy. It’s too large, too cold, and too chaotic for them. They want a smaller, warmer, more predictable habitat, hemmed in by fearful fantasies on one side and reassuring fantasies on the other. With fewer options, they know exactly what is expected of them, and they feel confident that they can deliver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God free, some of the commenters here may have some excellent books to suggest, but there are no magic books. The reader must be already open to change for any book to facilitate change. Just as reading the Bible now would not likely reconvert you back into its boundaries, so any book that even suggests looking outside those boundaries will not likely be accepted by your siblings, unless they have as you say, a hidden spark of curiosity, and they are already peeking outside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheism is a hard sell.  One basically has to say, &lt;em&gt;“Hey, all you nice folks huddled inside that cozy little dogma yurt!  Come outside! Sure, it’s cold and windy, but there’s lots of room! Alright, we have to accept that we’re orphans in a hostile, dangerous universe that not only doesn’t care about us, it isn’t even aware of our existence. But the complex, deadly, mindless immensity of it all is breathtakingly beautiful! Okay, yes, we have to use our own judgment to make every decision, and make them based on incomplete information, and we have to accept responsibility for the consequences. But by golly, we’re free to think our own thoughts and be true adults!  You’ll like it once you get used to it! …Hello?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a person is going through an adjustment of belief or even a deconversion, I’ll do what I can to inform and comfort them, but it has to be their decision, their ordeal, their emancipation.  I will not interfere with their leaving their beliefs or returning to them.  I will accept their development as it unfolds.  I’ll agree or disagree with them honestly, but I only manage my own mind. That’s hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your peace of mind must not depend on what’s inside someone else’s mind.  Try to  accept your brothers and sisters just as they are, living within the accustomed confines of their fears and hopes.  Their thoughts are their own, but their actions are a different matter. If they try to pull us in, to force that confinement upon us, yes, we must resist and even fight. But if they simply want to stay inside, then leave them be.  We have our work to do out here. We have to keep vigil on the wide, dangerous, beautiful world. &lt;/p&gt;

Instead, we are just going to review an odd story about our intellectual history.  &lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Mutationism Story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;    While "myth" has the connotation of falsehood, the story that a myth tells isn't necessarily a false one. The mutationism myth, at least, is anchored in historical events.&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/#_note1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The mutationism myth tells the story of how, just over a century ago, the scientific community responded to the discovery of Mendelian genetics by discarding Darwinism, and how Darwinism subsequently was restored.  The villains of the story are the influential early geneticists or "Mendelians" who saw genetics as a refutation of Darwinism; the heroes are first, the founders of population genetics, theoreticians who sorted everything out in favor of Darwinism by about 1930, and second, the architects of the Modern Synthesis, activists who popularized and institutionalized what we're calling "Darwinism 2.0".   &lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This story has been re-told in secondary sources for nearly 50 years, though I sense that the frequency is decreasing as this episode passes into ancient history.  To find examples, try looking up "mutationism" (sometimes "Mendelism" or even "saltationism") in the index of a book about evolution.    &lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I encourage you to consult whatever sources you have and to share the stories that you find.  Note that you won't always be successful.  A quick survey of several dozen contemporary books on my shelf reveals that &lt;strong&gt;most &lt;/strong&gt;don't address this episode specifically (a notable absence, in some cases &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/#_note2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;); &lt;strong&gt;some &lt;/strong&gt;tell the mutationism myth with varying degrees of panache; and a &lt;strong&gt;few &lt;/strong&gt;provide a historical account rather than a myth.  The few historical accounts that I found were in Gould's 2002 &lt;u&gt;The Structure of Evolutionary Theory&lt;/u&gt;, Strickberger's 1990 textbook &lt;u&gt;Evolution&lt;/u&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutationism"&gt;the Wikipedia entry on "Mutationism"&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;br&gt;    &lt;h3&gt;Sample stories &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Lets look at a few examples of the mutationism story. Readers who want to check out a freely available online source from the scholarly literature may refer to &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9223250"&gt;Ayala and Fitch, 1997&lt;/a&gt; (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9223250?dopt=Citation).  One example that really caught my eye is not from scientific literature, but from the 2005 obituary for Ernst Mayr in &lt;u&gt;The Economist&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;br&gt;    &lt;blockquote&gt;It was not that biologists had given up on evolution by the 1940s-quite the contrary. But they had got very confused about its mechanism. . . . The geneticists of the early 20th century did not help. They rediscovered the laws of inheritance first developed 40 years earlier by Gregor Mendel, an unsung Moravian monk. They also discovered the idea of genetic mutation. But instead of linking these things to natural selection, they came up with the idea of "saltation"-in other words, sudden mutational shifts from one well-adapted species to another. Nor, the geneticists complained, had there been enough time for natural selection to do its work, given what they had discovered about the rate at which mutations occur, and the fact that most mutations are deleterious. It was all a bit of a mess. . .Mr Mayr's advantage over the laboratory-bound biologists who had hijacked and diluted Darwin's legacy was that, like Darwin, he was a naturalist-and a good one. (anonymous, 2005)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Of course, this is a magazine article, written by anonymous staff writers-- typically one doesn't see such florid language in the scholarly literature.  But did the staff writers of the &lt;u&gt;Economist&lt;/u&gt; (representing elite opinion) really originate this story, based on their own personal recollections of the 1930's?   Of course not.   Mayr himself popularized the image of geneticists as laboratory-bound geeks lacking the organic insight of "naturalists".  This disdain for the geneticists who "hijacked" Darwin's legacy is readily apparent when evolutionary writers depict geneticists as fools holding "beliefs" that have "obvious inadequacies", unable to understand or "grasp" their own scientific findings:&lt;br&gt;    &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is hard for us to comprehend but, in the early years of this century when the phenomenon of mutation was first named, it was regarded not as a necessary part of Darwinian theory but as an alternative theory of evolution! There was a school of geneticists called the mutationists, which included such famous names as Hugo de Vries and William Bateson among the early rediscoverers of Mendel's principles of heredity, Wilhelm Johannsen the inventor of the word gene, and Thomas Hunt Morgan the father of the chromosome theory of heredity. . . Mendelian genetics was thought of, not as the central plank of Darwinism that it is today, but as antithetical to Darwinism. . . It is extremely hard for the modern mind to respond to this idea with anything but mirth" (Dawkins, 1987, p. 305)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;blockquote&gt;"According to mutationism, random changes in the hereditary material are sufficient for adaptation without much, or any, selection at all. Mutations just somehow happen to be adaptive, the right changes simply manage to occur. The inadequacies of this view are obvious" (Cronin, 1991, p. 47).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;blockquote&gt;"Darwin knew nothing of this [i.e., genetics] but as it turned out, his ignorance was sublimely irrelevant to the problem he was really interested in tackling: evolution. This point was not fully grasped by biologists. Many early geneticists at the dawn of the 20th century, thought their discoveries of the fundamental principles of genetics somehow cast doubt [on], or rendered obsolete, the concept of natural selection. It took several decades of experimentation and theoretical (including mathematical) analysis to show not only that there was no conflict inherent between the emerging results of genetics and the older Darwinian notion of natural selection, but that the two operate in different domains." (Eldredge, 2001, p. 67)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;blockquote&gt;"Mendelian particulate inheritance (today, we call the "particles" genes) was originally identified with De Vries's "mutation theory", according to which new variations or species originated in large jumps, or macromutations, and evolution was exclusively explained by mutation pressure. Darwinian naturalists, believing that Mendelism was synonymous with mutation theory, held on to theories of soft inheritance, while they considered selection a weak force at best. They did not know of the new findings in genetics that would have supported Darwinism. (SegerstrŒle, 2002)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Notice how, in every version of the story above, the position taken by early geneticists just doesn't make sense.  This isn't a story of theory versus theory, its a story of confusion ultimately yielding to reason.   &lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;If de Vries and the other geneticists are playing the role of the pied piper in this story, the "naturalists" are like the children lured away from their Darwinian home.  Ultimately the innocents are returned, and order restored, by (oddly enough) mathematicians:  &lt;br&gt;    &lt;blockquote&gt;"Between 1918 and 1932 Fisher, Haldane, and Wright showed that Mendelian genetics is consistent with natural selection. Only then, more than 60 years after the publication of &lt;u&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/u&gt;, was the genetic objection to natural selection finally removed. Modern molecular and developmental genetics have confirmed in exquisite chemical detail the key aspects of genetics necessary for Darwin's ideas to work: that the genetic material is DNA, that DNA has a sequence, . . . mutates . . . contains information . . " (p. 16 of Stearns and Hoekstra, 2005)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Anatomy of a Myth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a subsequent post, we will look at original sources to see what the "mutationists" actually believed, and why.  And eventually we will integrate this into the bigger picture of how evolutionary theory developed.  But for now, lets just summarize the pattern that is apparent in the literature.  &lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the mutationism story is clearly &lt;strong&gt;a story or myth&lt;/strong&gt;, and not an ordinary scientific truth claim.  We can see this because the story-tellers are not using ordinary scientific conventions to convince us that the story is true.  If you or I were making an ordinary scientific argument (for instance) for an effect of &amp;quot;translational selection&amp;quot; on codon usage, we would mention a correlation between codon frequencies and the abundance of corresponding tRNAs, citing the classic work of Ikemura (1981), and we might even repeat a figure showing this correlation, to impress this point upon the minds of readers (e.g., just as in Ch. 7 of Freeman &amp;amp; Herron, 1998).  &lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;When I see instances of the mutationism story, typically I don&amp;#39;t find quotations illustrating what the mutationists believed, nor facts &amp;amp; figures to refute their views, but only vague attributions and generalized claims.  Apropos, the following quotation from Ernst Mayr never fails to make me laugh: &lt;br&gt;    &lt;blockquote&gt;The genetic work of the last four decades has refuted mutationism (saltationism) so thoroughly that it is not necessary to repeat once more all the genetic evidence against it. (Mayr, 1960)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;And the puissant Dr. Mayr proceeds on, not boring the reader with any tiresome "genetic evidence", nor citing sources that might allow the reader to evaluate the truth of his statement.  Its a story, after all. &lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;By contrast, the 3 sources that I mentioned above as providing scientific history, rather than myth, all make reference to specific experimental and theoretical results, and reveal knowledge of specific historically important scientific works.  For instance, Strickberger's reference list includes Johannsen, 1903, as well as the 1902 paper by Yule that reconciled Mendelian genetics with quantitative variation (in neo-Darwinian mythology, credit for Yule's work is given to little Ronny Fisher, who was 11 at the time).&lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Second, every story has a plot or "action", and the main action of the mutationism story is a turn of fate in which power is temporarily in the hands of the wrong people or ideas.  In archetypal terms, its a story of usurpation and restoration: the throne is usurped, and the kingdom falls into darkness and confusion until the throne is restored to the king's rightful heirs.  The mutationism episode didn't have to be told that way: it might have been presented as a period of reform (in which old ideas were abandoned) or discovery (when new territory was mapped out).  Instead, its presented as a mistake, an interlude of confusion, a collective delusion.   &lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, another way to look at the mythic action is that the Mendelians are wizards or false prophets who place the kingdom under a spell, leading folks astray and causing them to believe things that they just shouldn't have believed.  &lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;What delusional spell did the Mendelians cast?  In the story by Eldredge, or by Stearns &amp;amp; Hoekstra above, the spell is that &lt;strong&gt;Mendelian genetics is inconsistent with "the concept of natural selection"&lt;/strong&gt; (Eldredge).  In the story told by SegerstrŒle, Cronin, Mayr and &lt;u&gt;The Economist&lt;/u&gt;, the delusional spell is a bit different: the &lt;strong&gt;principle of selection is irrelevant because mutational jumps alone explain evolution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Third, the key to restoring Darwin's kingdom was to &lt;strong&gt;add the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;missing piece of genetics.&lt;/strong&gt;  Ultimately, after the period of darkness ended, the discovery of genetics &amp;quot;provided the missing link in Darwin&amp;#39;s theory&amp;quot; (SegerstrŒle, 2002), or &amp;quot;The missing link in Darwin&amp;#39;s argument was provided by Mendelian genetics&amp;quot; (Ayala &amp;amp; Fitch, 1997).  Darwinism was restored, not by taking away the power of genetics, but by redirecting it to support Darwinism.  Clearly, genetics is the key to ruling the kingdom, like the &lt;em&gt;One Ring that Rules them All&lt;/em&gt; in Tolkien's world.  The ones who have the ring have the power.  &lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The story is made more fascinating by the fact that the key to power is literally &lt;i&gt;a code of rules developed by a monk that remained lost for nearly half a century&lt;/i&gt;.  The usurpers who discover The Monk's Code misinterpret it, and use it to overthrow the true king, establishing a reign of error.  But when The Founders decipher the true meaning of the Monk's Code, The Architects campaign throughout the kingdom, spreading the news: the Monk's Code proves that Darwin is the true king.  Darwin's rule is re-established, all opposition ceases, and the kingdom is unified.  &lt;br&gt;    &lt;h3&gt;Homework&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;    If you would like to contribute a mutationism story, I would be happy to start a collection &lt;i&gt;if you make it easy for me by providing a complete and well formed text item&lt;/i&gt;.  Be sure to provide a quoted passage with a source, citing exact page numbers.  If we get enough stories, lets try to recruit a sociologist or historian to study this further. &lt;br&gt;    &lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;To summarize, the mutationism story is a myth that is retold in secondary sources.  The basic story is simple: the discoverers of genetics misinterpreted their discovery, thinking it incompatible with Darwinism; Darwinism went into disfavor; population geneticists came along and showed that genetics was the missing key to Darwinism; Darwinism was restored and once again reigned supreme.&lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Next time on the &lt;a href="http://www.molevol.org/cdblog"&gt;The Curious Disconnect&lt;/a&gt;, we'll start pulling on some of the loose threads of this story.  &lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;For now, note how the writers quoted above are genuinely baffled by our scientific history.  It just doesn't make sense to them.  A century ago, most of an entire generation of scientists thought of genetics as a contradiction of Darwinism.  This is a historical fact, and presumably it has an explanation that rational folks can understand by examining what scientists of the time wrote.  But this historical fact mystifies Dawkins, Eldredge, Cronin, and others.  &lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;    &lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Anonymous. 2005.

The connection between myths and untruths, then, has to do with discoverability: when we find a pattern P = { X people are repeating story Y }, where X is a large number, this pattern by itself does not prove that Y is a myth &lt;i&gt;because X people might have all discovered or verified Y independently&lt;/i&gt;; but if Y has diverse elements that are untrue (or unverifiable), then we can conclude that its repetition does not signify independent verification, suggesting that its a myth.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;a name="_note2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Oxford Encyclopedia of Evolution does not have an article on mutationism; the article on Morgan says nothing of his views on evolution; there is no article on Bateson; mutationism is only addressed peripherally in Hull's article on the history of evolutionary theory; it is mainly addressed in SegerstrŒle's article on neo-Darwinism.  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-6453531027071704519?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269965592823"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_26.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ca1e41e4421f8f17</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Scio10 Interviews"/><title type="html">ScienceOnline2010 - interview with Misha Angrist</title><published>2010-03-30T17:06:10Z</published><updated>2010-03-30T17:06:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/EYh8qAqPeS0/scienceonline2010_-_interview_26.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_26.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Continuing with the tradition from last two years, I will occasionally post interviews with some of the participants of the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline2010&lt;/a&gt; conference that was held in the Research Triangle Park, NC back in January. See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Misha Angrist from Duke (and the blog &lt;a href="http://genomeboy.com/" title=""&gt;GenomeBoy&lt;/a&gt;), the fourth person in the Personal Genome Project whose entire genome was sequenced (thus one of the first 20 humans with a sequenced genome), to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Misha Angrist pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Misha%20Angrist%20pic.jpg" width="298" height="196" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA. I bleed black and gold (though I wish the Steelers' current quarterback weren't such an asshat). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point after undergrad in the 1980s I decided I should be a genetic counselor. By the time I had the master's degree and was getting ready to take my boards I realized I was not the guy who should be telling distraught people that their babies had serious problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fortuitous thing was that my master's thesis research took me to Duke and I had a wonderful few months working in a lab doing human genetics. In fact, I had so much fun I decided to get a PhD, which I finished in 1996. I hung around for a postdoc and overstayed my welcome. I realized that to succeed as a human geneticist (or genomicist) I would have to become a computational biologist, a statistical geneticist or a biochemist. I was not up to any of those tasks. (Are you sensing a pattern here?) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wandered in the desert for a while. I dabbled in market research and biotech finance, where I succeeded in losing a small fortune in a short period of time. While I was bouncing from one epic fail to another, I managed to get an MFA from the Bennington Writing Seminars, which was wonderful on many levels.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This led me back to Duke where I took a job as a science editor. Eventually, when it became clear I was doing the work of a faculty member, I became an Assistant Professor. I can say without a single iota of snarkiness or insincerity that I feel extremely blessed to be where I am today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My book, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Here-Human-Being-Personal-Genomics/dp/0061628336/" title=""&gt;Here is a Human Being: At the Dawn of Personal Genomics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, will be published in November by Smithsonian Books/HarperCollins. I am in the middle of editing it and trying to figure out how I can help make it successful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I am teaching science writing, genome policy stuff, and developing and writing grants and papers related to personal genomics, i.e., living the life of an academic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know that I can offer a single answer. Certainly, at or near the top of the list is the kind of health-related stuff Thomas Goetz discusses in his terrific book, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Decision-Tree-Control-Personalized-Medicine/dp/1605297291" title=""&gt;The Decision Tree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. But what we're living through is much bigger than science. I think the fact that citizens are now able to cut out the middleman, for better or worse (I tend to think it's more often for the better), is really what fascinates me the most. This applies to all kinds of things. So, for example, I can buy a car on eBay and have it delivered to my house. I can text money to Haiti instantaneously. I can listen to &lt;a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/" title=""&gt;On The Media&lt;/a&gt; while I walk my dog, I can send my parents pictures of their grandkids &lt;i&gt;during&lt;/i&gt; their piano recital. I can order a genome scan online and see what it might mean for free at &lt;a href="http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/SNPedia" title=""&gt;SNPedia&lt;/a&gt;. If I get really bummed out, I can watch &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J---aiyznGQ" title=""&gt;Keyboard Cat&lt;/a&gt; for a few minutes. And thanks to people like you, I can read &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/home.action" title=""&gt;PLoS One&lt;/a&gt; and other journals for free and see what folks are saying about the latest and greatest (or not) in science. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I knew. I think I can safely say that I will never be among the hallowed SEED science bloggers. The only way that would happen would be if they started handing out awards for infrequent and irrelevant posts. Sometimes I feel guilty about my desultory approach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;a href="http://www.lizzieskurnick.com/" title=""&gt;Lizzie Skurnick&lt;/a&gt;, a fantastic writer who introduced me to blogging lo these many years ago, gave me simple advice that has served me well: blog about what interests you, about whatever your passions. For me, an ADHD kinda guy, this might mean discussing whether pharmacogenetic testing for anticoagulant response is ready for primetime, or posting a YouTube of Prince playing the bejeezus out of While My Guitar Gently Weeps.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for frequency, it's kind of a do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do thing. I am a beneficiary of people like you, who compulsively update their blogs. My life would be poorer if not for regular updates from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/" title=""&gt;Genetic Future&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.genomicslawreport.com/" title=""&gt;Genomics Law Report&lt;/a&gt;, and a dozen others. But &lt;a href="http://genomeboy.com/" title=""&gt;GenomeBoy.com&lt;/a&gt; will never compete with those folks. For me, blogging often feels like a luxury I can't afford or homework I can't finish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've only &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/MishaAngrist" title=""&gt;been tweeting&lt;/a&gt; for a month and I have to say, it makes me crazy sometimes and I'm already crazy. I expect to be on Facebook soon, though I'm kind of dreading it. FriendFeed? I don't even know what that is.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't remember how I discovered them - it might have been via Jason Bobe and &lt;a href="http://thepersonalgenome.com/" title=""&gt;The Personal Genome&lt;/a&gt; (which he rarely updates anymore, sadly). It didn't happen overnight, but at some point it became clear to me that whatever one was interested in, there were blogs out there catering to those interests. I've spent much of my adult life doing and thinking about genetics and genomics and their implications, so I gravitate toward blogs that engage with those subjects: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/" title=""&gt;Genetic Future&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.genomicslawreport.com/" title=""&gt;Genomics Law Report&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.thegenesherpa.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Gene Sherpas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.eyeondna.com/" title=""&gt;Eye on DNA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.thegeneticgenealogist.com/" title=""&gt;The Genetic Genealogist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://spittoon.23andme.com/" title=""&gt;The Spittoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://talk.dnadirect.com/" title=""&gt;DNA Direct Talk&lt;/a&gt; etc. But of course there are other great ones: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/culturedish/" title=""&gt;Culture Dish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/" title=""&gt;Terra Sigillata&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/" title=""&gt;John Hawks&lt;/a&gt;. I'm forgetting a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two blogs I discovered specifically via ScienceOnline were &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" title=""&gt;Adventures in Ethics and Science&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neuronculture/" title=""&gt;Neuron Culture&lt;/a&gt;. Janet Stemwedel and David Dobbs are two of the more thoughtful and compelling writers in the blogosphere.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought 2010 was the best year yet! I think part of it is the natural evolution of the medium. Only a few years ago, to say you were a blogger, let alone that you were going to hang out with 150 other bloggers for the weekend, was to invite a blank stare, suspicion or ridicule. And I admit that I was skeptical about that first conference. I didn't realize that so many people cared so much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year was extraordinary. The sessions on blog-to-book, fact-checking and rebooting science journalism were outstanding. Partly because they were applicable to my professional life, partly because they transcended blogging and got to the heart of perennial issues in science communication, and partly because the people involved - David Dobbs, Rebecca Skloot, Ed Yong, Carl Zimmer, John Timmer, Tom Levenson, Brian Switek, Sheril Kirshenbaum - were so bright, charming and wise.  I wish every meeting I went to was so fulfilling and I only spent two abbreviated days there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had the pleasure of meeting &lt;a href="http://blogs.nature.com/henrygee/" title=""&gt;Henry Gee&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Editor at &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, whose book, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jacobs-Ladder-History-Human-Genome/dp/B000FUO04W" title=""&gt;Jacob's Ladder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, is that rare combination of history, science and culture, and was ahead of its time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only suggestion: is there any way the conference could be pushed back to February? I always want my Duke students to attend, but this year ScienceOnline took place before the end of drop and add, so logistically it was a bit more difficult. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was great to see you again and thank you for the interview. I hope you will be able to attend again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_26.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/EYh8qAqPeS0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269965304958"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/obesitypanacea/2010/03/are_probiotics_the_cure_for_ab.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d36d196340c1f66d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Are Probiotics the Cure for Abdominal Obesity?</title><published>2010-03-30T11:50:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-30T11:50:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/hJjbh-3L-yg/are_probiotics_the_cure_for_ab.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/obesitypanacea/2010/03/are_probiotics_the_cure_for_ab.php"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Nope, not even close, although I doubt it will stop big food from marketing Activia yogurt and others as a solution for expanded waistlines....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Courtesy BMC Ecology.

For spotted hyenas, a laugh can speak volumes about an individual. 

Despite being portrayed as stupid scavengers who rely on the leftovers of lion prides, hyenas are highly intelligent and social predators. They communicate with each other through an array of whoops, yowls, grunts, screams, and giggles, and by using these calls an individual can call in help to run lions off a carcass or signal that it's time to beat a hasty retreat if the odds don't look as favorable. Yet there is more to a hyena call than just its message, and in a new study published in BMC Ecology a team of scientists have begun to parse what giggles say about the hyena making the call.

The research results showed that children who were spanked had lower IQ by 2.8 to 5 points. Though the study was small (806 children ages two to four, and 704 children ages five to nine), Straus insists that spanking does have a major impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/grey-matter.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="grey-matter" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/grey-matter-300x225.jpg" alt="Brain" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The more spanking, the slower the development of the child’s mental ability,” said Straus. “But even small amounts of spanking made a difference.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stress and fear related to spanking can explain why corporal punishment slows cognitive development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more alarming than the drop in IQ is how often children are getting spanked. The study showed that 93 percent of mothers had spanked their two- to four-year-olds once or more per week. Nearly half of toddlers’ moms had spanked them three or more times per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And IQ isn’t the only thing spanking can damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.aap.org"&gt;American Academy for Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, “When compared with children who are not spanked, children who are spanked are more likely to become adults who are depressed, use alcohol, have more anger, hit their own children, hit their spouses, and engage in crime and violence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Con:&lt;/strong&gt; Buy your own office supplies and pay for high-speed Internet. Plus, self-employment taxes can be frightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pro: &lt;/strong&gt;You don’t have to show up at an office everyday at 9 a.m., and no one complains when you take two-hour lunches. Bonus: No busybody co-workers stopping by your desk to gossip.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Con:&lt;/strong&gt; Temptations from things around the house (cluttered closets, &lt;em&gt;The Young and the Restless&lt;/em&gt;, getting laundry done), may be too much for you. It’s all about discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

With the massive popularity of Stephenie Meyer’s &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt; series and all things vampire-related, it’s little wonder that coffin furniture is springing to life. Turns out, lying in a coffin isn’t just for Halloween anymore. (Does anyone actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; that?) Finally, now you can buy pine-box-like bookcases, and couches and beds on which to sleep – and we don’t mean that as a metaphor for death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Blisstree usually concentrates on healthy living as opposed to eternal resting places, let’s take a macabre peek inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dornob.com offers &lt;a href="http://dornob.com/10-coffin-furniture-ideas-caskets-couches-to-death-desks/"&gt;10 Coffin Furniture Ideas: Caskets Couches to Death Desks&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s an entire website dedicated to custom-made &lt;a href="http://www.coffincouches.com/"&gt;coffin couches&lt;/a&gt;. This Red Baron coffin couch will set you back just $3,500 – shipping not included. (Bloody hell!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryan’s &lt;a href="http://www.coffinitup.com/gallery.htm"&gt;Coffin It Up&lt;/a&gt; website features everything from coffin jewelry to a entire coffin kitchen. Cozy, convenient, and creepy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Casketfurniture.com offers everything from pool tables and poker tables to cigar humidors and wine racks – all with a six-feet-under theme. They even carry &lt;a href="http://www.casketfurniture.com/casket_kits.php"&gt;DIY casket kits&lt;/a&gt;. So, when your number is up, you can lower the cost of your funeral expenses by assembling your own coffin. (Just make sure you do it well in advance.) According to the site, it’s “like buying a casket from Ikea.”&lt;/p&gt;

But, while most everyone would agree that it’s great to allow older or infertile women the opportunity to get pregnant, how old is just way too old?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:250px"&gt;&lt;img title="baby2" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/baby2.jpg" alt="Baby" width="240" height="228"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1257014/Twins-54-mother-didnt-think-enough.html"&gt;Karen Johnston became pregnant at 54&lt;/a&gt;. The British mother of eight had already gone through menopause and was told that her age was too advanced to have IVF in the U.K. So, she went to a clinic in the Czech Republic and is now six months pregnant with twins. Johnston is a self-confessed “baby addict,” and her current pregnancy is 33 years after she gave birth to her first child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it fair to the twins that their mom will be 73 when they graduate from high school?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnston isn’t the only mature woman in this controversial situation. Frieda Birnbaum of New Jersey gave birth to twin boys at the age of 60. A Romanian woman gave birth in 2005 at age 66; then a year later, Carmela Bousada of Spain took over the title of “Oldest Mom” at 67 years young. And these are just some of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_over_age_50"&gt;women over 50 who have given birth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who’s the oldest new mother to date? When Omkari Panwar of India wanted a male heir, she became pregnant through IVF at the ripe old age of 70. She gave birth to twins – a boy and a girl – in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some critics argue against getting knocked up late in life because of the serious potential health risks to mother and baby. Other skeptics say the main concern is that an older mom won’t be around all that long to care for her children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does a post-menopausal woman have the right to get pregnant? Or should she just accept that her time has past? Should countries outlaw IVF treatments in women over the age of 50?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us know what you think below.&lt;/p&gt;

So if your little one is really that adorable, why not do some modeling on the side (your kid, not you) to bring in some extra cash? Of course, babies and toddlers can’t exactly walk the runway in their footed jammies (especially if they haven’t started walking yet), but they have plenty of opportunities to break into the modeling biz. Just make sure you don’t turn into an overbearing stage mother, okay, Mama Rose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;img title="toddler" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/toddler-300x198.jpg" alt="Toddler " width="300" height="198"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Ready for Their Close-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your toddler doesn’t need a full portfolio, but a few good snapshots are essential. If you’re going to pitch your baby to modeling agencies, splurge on a professional photographer to shoot a couple close-ups, a full-length shot, and maybe a few character poses with props. Cheesy, yes. Lucrative, very possibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mail It In&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Send your child’s photos along with a brief introductory letter via snail mail to every reputable modeling agency in your area. Most agencies don’t accept unsolicited phone calls, and many don’t open uninvited emails. So invest in some manila envelopes and postage. And don’t submit to agencies outside your area, unless you’re willing to pay for travel expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can the Con&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an agency asks you for a large amount of money upfront to get your toddler into the industry, it’s probably a scam. Remember – your &lt;em&gt;kid&lt;/em&gt; is the one who should be getting paid. If an agency offers you a contract, read all the fine print and understand what kind of cut the agency will take. Consider getting a lawyer to help you wade through all the legal mumbo-jumbo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scout Them Out&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://kids2fame.com/"&gt;Kids2Fame&lt;/a&gt;. They’re a bonded scouting agency that can refer you to legit and reputable modeling agencies around the country; they also scout and develop talent from infants to teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/57278450.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="57278450" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/57278450-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="256"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power down the tap while you brush your teeth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the average American faucet gushes two gallons of water per minute. Turning it off for four minutes a day while you brush your teeth saves around 240 gallons of water per month. Or, think of it like this – the EPA claims that letting your faucet run for five minutes is the equivalent of leaving a 60-watt light bulb on for 14 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you’re not rinsing, turn off the tap. Not only are you giving mother earth a hand by saving all that water, but you’re also doing your utility bill a favor. If you have a spouse or kids or roommates, post a kind reminder on the bathroom mirror – all that H2O really adds up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a parent, I screw up all the time. And I’ve pretty much made it my mission at Blisstree to shore up other mothers. But it’s been tough not to judge this whole &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/03/11/2010-03-11_demi_moore_teaches_daughter_rumer_willis_how_to_pole_dance__while_hubby_ashton_k.html"&gt;Demi-Rumer-pole-dancing debacle&lt;/a&gt;. In case you aren’t a Hollywood gossip hound, reportedly, 47-year-old Demi Moore recently performed an impromptu pole dance at a party at the Chateau Marmont in L.A. (Wait…Demi actually &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; people to remember &lt;em&gt;Striptease&lt;/em&gt;?) She then pulled her 21-year-old daughter up and taught her some on-the-fly exotic moves while the crowd (mostly fellow A-listers, including Jennifer Aniston) cheered. Two words: Indecent. Proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, erotic dancing is just another form of exercise these days: Crunches and Equinoxes across the country offer pole-dancing classes, and there are at least a dozen how-to-act-super-slutty-at-home DVDs available on Amazon.com. Perhaps Demi was feeling nostalgic for the old days. (Sorry to bring up &lt;em&gt;Striptease &lt;/em&gt;again.) But, &lt;em&gt;hello&lt;/em&gt;, if you dress up for a party in a public place and then twirl upside down on a stripper pole in front of a bunch of boisterous drunk people, it’s pretty porn-y – even if you’re not getting paid. And hey, I’m all for porn-y, but porn-y with your kid? To quote my six-year-old girl: “That’s just icky.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets even ickier if one of the hooting audience members (Leonardo DiCaprio) reportedly high-fives your mom’s much younger husband (Ashton Kutcher, 32). From an anonymous source who talked to the press (see &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/03/11/2010-03-11_demi_moore_teaches_daughter_rumer_willis_how_to_pole_dance__while_hubby_ashton_k.html"&gt;New York Daily News)&lt;/a&gt;: “Ashton put his arms around both Demi and Rumer and looked like the proudest man in the room.” No matter how innocent the situation may have been, it doesn’t take a shrink to know that no 21-year-old is going to benefit from the father-daughter-mother-threesome sexual scenarios this little scene might cultivate in the minds of party-goers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while this particular situation is obviously extreme, Demi is hardly alone. We are a generation of parents who constantly cross boundaries in the name of looking cool to our kids. And how can we not? We don’t want to recreate our own childhoods, when parenting skills pretty much consisted of scaring the crap out of us in order to get us to behave. So we talk. We share. We explain. We wheedle. And then when nothing works, we lose our cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade into my own momhood, I’ve realized that my favorite “cool” parents are actually the ones who have no trouble saying no, who sometimes get mad, but are almost always kind, who set some fairly strict boundaries – and whose kids seem sane and happy as a result. Some of them do it instinctively, others turn to a helpful parenting book or two (&lt;em&gt;Blessing of a Skinned Knee&lt;/em&gt; is an especially good one) to validate an inkling that it’s time to toughen up. And so, in our house, we now operate with the belief that the kids need someone to fight and define themselves against – how else can we ensure that we end up being a safe haven when their own so-called “cool” behavior backfires? It’s a tough job, and we have to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I still can’t let go of my notion that Demi had to have her own good (if misguided) reasons for allegedly channeling Bada-Bing club dancers with her first-born. So, here goes: There’s no getting around the fact that Rumer, who looks a lot like dad Bruce Willis, is not Demi-level striking. Not a comfortable reality for either daughter or mom. So is Demi done with parenting now that Rumer has hit legal drinking age? Or is it possible that maybe – just maybe – Demi felt badly about upstaging her daughter, and wanted to share some of the spotlight with her? Was Demi just trying, in her own messed-up-celebrity-mama-bear way, to be a good mom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, that’s how most of us screw up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2010/03/hannitys_soldier_support_scam.php"&gt;Sean Hannity claims to support our troops&lt;/a&gt;, endorsing a charity called &lt;a href="http://www.debbieschlussel.com/6938/sean-hannitys-freedom-concert-scam-only-7-of-charitys-money-went-to-injured-troops-kids-of-fallen-troops-g5s-g6s-for-vannity/"&gt;Freedom Alliance&lt;/a&gt; that supposedly pays tuition for the children of fallen soldiers. What they don&amp;#39;t tell you is that &amp;#39;overhead&amp;#39; sucks up at least 80-90% of the donations. Hannity will be riding a nice limousine to accept a community service award…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scenarhealth.com/"&gt;Scenar Health&lt;/a&gt; is one of those companies that markets a Radio Shack gadget called a &lt;a href="http://lifebreakthroughs.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=72&amp;amp;Itemid=104"&gt;Self Controlled Energo Neuro Adaptive Regulator&lt;/a&gt;. Just the name gives it away: it looks like quackery to me. Would you believe they are planning to &lt;a href="http://haitivolunteer.blogspot.com/2010/03/preparations-for-april-volunteer-work.html"&gt;go to Haiti to "help"&lt;/a&gt;, and they are &lt;a href="http://pledgie.com/campaigns/9753"&gt;asking for donations&lt;/a&gt;? Don't. They are at $0 so far, let's keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

This milestone clearly marks the beginning, at long last, of the first major physics run of the new accelerator.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been waiting a very long time for this.  In the 1980s the field had its eyes fixed firmly on the SSC, the Superconducting Supercollider to be constructed in Waxahachie, Texas.  After years of design, the go-ahead was given by President Bush in 1988 shortly after his election to construct the huge machine, which was to collide protons with 40 TeV energy.  Alas, changes to the design sent costs rising, and, after spending over 2 billion dollars on tunnel boring and lab construction in Texas, the project was canceled by Congress in October 1993.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those were dark days for particle physics.   Any hope of pushing to higher energies seemed to lie in pushing ahead with the design of the LHC at CERN, which had been simmering along but was looking like it would be too little too late if the SSC came on line first.  Nevertheless, the Tevatron was just starting to gather significant physics data, and the CDF and D0 experiments would soon discover the top quark, completing the picture of the standard model quarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the SSC out of the picture work on the LHC really began in earnest.  The magnet design was finalized and plans for constructing the machine began to gel.   It would take many years to complete the engineering, prototyping, and industrialization of the magnet production, and a lot of money.  In 1997 the US and CERN reached an agreement (brokered in part by Rep. Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin) whereby the US would contribute about $50 million per year over ten years to the machine itself.  This was precedent-setting: never before had the cost of machine construction at CERN, or Fermilab, or SLAC been borne in such large part by a foreign entity. It was essentially the price of admission for the US community to participate in the large experiments ATLAS and CMS, to which the US has committed about half a billion dollars.  So though the LHC and the experiments are in Europe, the US has a billion dollar investment in the projects.  And now it is time to begin to reap the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997 it was foreseen to have circulating beams in the LHC by 2005.  Construction of the detectors was steady, and it is arguably the case that the experiments were ready before the accelerator.  But the completion date of both sets of projects slipped, to 2006, then 2007, and then finally in 2008 all was ready.  And, as we all know, in September 2008, after one week of beam commissioning, the LHC suffered a major magnet quench accident which damaged over a kilometer of the machine, necessitating a year-long repair campaign, and a reassessment of the path to the full design energy of 14 TeV.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large portion if the machine has yet to be retrofit to prevent the type of accident experienced in 2008, but it was decided to operate the collider at 7 TeV and gather physics data in the next year.  The energy will open up  a new regime to explore for physics beyond the standard model, and we are ready and eager to do just that!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on the physics in the next post…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Custom boots are not cheap: a basic calf or kangaroo boot with simple stitching from a custom maker begins at about $1200.  Fancy stitching, inlay, or tooling can take prices to the stratosphere.  Tres Outlaws, an outfit in El Paso, has made some boots selling for upwards of $25,000!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in Texas I sought out a few bootmakers and boot collectors, for fellow fanatics are thin on the ground in the chilly Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, in Austin, I found Lee Miller, Vermont expatriate and bootmaker extraordinaire.  Lee and his wife Carrlyn run a small shop in Austin, Texas Traditions, where they turn out some of the country’s prettiest boots.  Here’s Lee with his latest project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Lee Miller" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/lee-miller.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=666" alt="" width="500" height="666"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee isn’t taking new customers, because he has a huge backlog.  Even if you were to order a pair today, you wouldn’t get it for three and a half years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of Lee’s boots.  The inlay and stitching are lovely, and take a ton of skill and work, but what makes Lee’s boots stand out is their purity of line.  Even without fancy decoration on the shafts (the tube-like tops; the foot part is called the “vamp”), they’re eye-catchingly graceful.  Have a look at the boot that Lee is holding above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Mller boots" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/mller-boots1.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee took over the shop from the famous Charlie Dunn, who worked as a bootmaker in Austin’s Capitol Saddlery for many years and then, after retirement, started his own shop in South Austin.  Lee moved there to apprentice with Charlie, and took over the business when Charlie passed away.  (Lee makes the boots, Carrlyn does the business side and helps design).  Here’s a lovely “pinched rose” design—the yellow rose of Texas, of course—made famous by Dunn and produced by Miller (note the initials, which most custom makers will add to your boot for a small fee):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Miller pinched roses" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/miller-pinched-roses.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=666" alt="" width="500" height="666"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here’s Charlie Dunn in his later years, an elfin man with a hot temper and a fierce passion for making good boots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Charlie Dunnjpg" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/charlie-dunnjpg.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=727" alt="" width="500" height="727"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie was the subject of a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fg3y_PvUxM"&gt;song by Jerry Jeff Walker&lt;/a&gt;, probably the only bootmaker to be so immortalized.  Here’s a pair that he made for himself, incorporating a unique mirror-signature design.  Charlie had a bunion on his right foot, and you can see where it’s worn through the ostrich vamp:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Dunn Signature boots" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dunn-signature-boots.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee has saved all of Charlie’s designs.  Here’s Charlie’s famous “marijuana pattern”, used on the shafts when the counterculture took up cowboy boots in the 60s.  Apparently Charlie had no idea what marijuana looked like, and so a customer brought him a sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Dunn Marijuana pattern" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dunn-marijuana-pattern.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=666" alt="" width="500" height="666"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the ingredients of a good cowboy boot: leather, a steel shank  to support the arch, lemonwood pegs to peg the sole, and thread to  stitch the tops and soles.  That’s it.  No glue, no paper, no plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the “hide room,” where they keep all the different leathers on hand to make the latest batch of orders.  Some of the hides commonly used in boots are calf, kangaroo, ostrich, lizard, alligator, crocodile, shark, water buffalo, and snakeskin.  I even have a pair of camel boots (camel is a very rare hide because they don’t kill the beasts to make leather: hides are taken from camels who die of old age).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Hide room" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/hide-room.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The making of a custom boot begins with a complicated process of measuring your foot.  This can take up to an hour, and can involve all kinds of tape measures, calipers, and even inkpads (Lee has people step on one and then make a foot impression).  From those measurements a wood or (more commonly) fiberglass model of the foot—the “last” is made.  Around this is built the bottom of the boot. Here are some of Lee’s lasts with the names of celebrity customers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Miller lastsJPG" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/miller-lastsjpg.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a boot that Lee made for Lauren Bacall (note the “LB” initials inside the pull).  They didn’t fit at first so they were replaced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Bacall" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/bacall.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also visited John Tongate, retired librarian at the University of Texas and famous boot collector.  John’s specialty is tracking down vintage boot designs and having them reproduced by custom bootmakers.  Here’s John with a small part of his collection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="John Tongate boots" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/john-tongate-boots.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=666" alt="" width="500" height="666"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This map shows where the smallish moon is warmer than in other places, and can reveal a lot about its surface. The scientists expected to see it being warmest pretty much in the middle of the map, since the Sun was shining down on that spot at the time the map was made. As you go progressively farther from that spot, it would get cooler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they got, though, &lt;a href="http://www.ciclops.org/view/6297/Bizarre_Temperatures_on_Mimas"&gt;was this&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ciclops.org/view_media/31411/Bizarre_Temperatures_on_Mimas"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/03/cassini_titan_pacman.jpg" alt="cassini_titan_pacman" title="cassini_titan_pacman" width="610" height="309"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um. That looks familiar. If the warm part eats that dot in the middle, will the other moons of Saturn turn into ghosts so Mimas can eat them and get points?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on the left is the visible light view of Mimas, and on the right is the temperature map. Yellow is warm (well, 92 Kelvin or -290 F) and blue is cooler (77 K or -320 F). That’s not at all what was expected! The parts that should be warmest are actually cool, and the cold spots are too warm! Worse, perhaps, is the shape of the boundary. You’d expect a smooth transition from warm to cold, and it would be circular in pattern. Instead, we get this sharp, V-shaped thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not known why things are so messed up on Mimas. Maybe the distribution of materials on the surface is uneven, causing an odd heating pattern. The warm spots might be covered in a material that is slow to lose heat (so it stays warm long after the Sun sets), and the cooler spots are covered in a material that is very slow to heat up (so they remain cool when the Sun is high in the sky). Maybe the cooler stuff is just coated with something that reflects a lot of heat from the Sun, so it never warms up. I imagine more temperature maps like this one, taken at different parts of the Mimas day, may help sort that out. &lt;a href="http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00002413/"&gt;Emily Lakdawalla at The Planetary Society&lt;/a&gt; has a far more in-depth description of this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This map makes me very happy. Not because a gigantic PacMan hundreds of kilometers across is wocka-wocka-ing across a moon of Saturn (though that helps). It’s because this is a complete surprise. No one expected this! Now we have scientists scrambling to figure it out, and that makes scientists happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, folks, if we had all the answers, and no surprises were left, we wouldn’t call it &lt;em&gt;exploration&lt;/em&gt;, would we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I’m going to be very busy for the next few days and probably out of reach – so here’s something to keep you entertained in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1262206/Now-Jessica-Simpson-pours-salt-water-nose-tries-bizarre-beauty-therapy.html"&gt;Now Jessica Simpson pours salt water up her nose as she tries yet another bizarre beauty therapy&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“She’s eaten fried worms in a bid to boost her metabolism and put lit candles in her ears to remove excess wax. But Jessica Simpson hasn’t yet finished her mission to try the world’s most bizarre beauty therapies. On a trip to Mumbai, she poured salt water up her nose, oil over her hair and drank a special ‘digestive’ drink – which simply made her burp.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no words. Or worms. Yeesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Rachael Dunlop has some words about this though – &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2010/03/30/homeopathy-awareness-week-april-10-16th-2010/"&gt;World Homeopathy Awareness week&lt;/a&gt; is approaching!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also plan to get the word out about homeopathy during WHAW. &lt;strong&gt;And the word is bollocks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best books I’ve read this year already is ‘&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/tag/the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks/"&gt;The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks&lt;/a&gt;‘. That’s what came to mind when I read the following: &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/business/30gene.html"&gt;Judge Invalidates Human Gene Patent&lt;/a&gt; in the NY Times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A federal judge on Monday struck down patents on two genes linked to breast and &lt;a title="In-depth reference and news articles about Ovarian Cancer." href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/ovarian-cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier"&gt;ovarian cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The decision, if upheld, could throw into doubt the patents covering thousands of human genes and reshape the law of intellectual property… Myriad sells a test costing more than $3,000 that looks for mutations in the two genes to determine if a woman is at a high risk of getting &lt;a title="In-depth reference and news articles about Breast cancer." href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/breast-cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; and ovarian cancer. Plaintiffs in the case had said Myriad’s monopoly on the test, conferred by the gene patents, kept prices high and prevented women from getting a confirmatory test from another laboratory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In the meantime, &lt;a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/03/29/apartment-building-e.html"&gt;exorcisms for apartments at Boing Boing&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘…limit your expelling demons to Friday or Saturday night’.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I mention how much I appreciate the &lt;a href="http://www.digitalcuttlefish.blogspot.com"&gt;Digital Cuttlefish&lt;/a&gt;? Over at &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/david_gallo_shows_underwater_astonishments.html"&gt;TED, you can check out &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/david_gallo_shows_underwater_astonishments.html"&gt;how ‘David Gallo shows underwater astonishments&lt;/a&gt;‘ but I think you’ll get more of a laugh at Save Your Breath For Running Ponies with ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a title="Permanent Link to Seahorse Would Like You To Keep Your Shit To Yourself, Thanks, Cuttlefish." rel="bookmark" href="http://runningponies.com/2010/03/29/seahorse-would-like-you-to-keep-your-shit-to-yourself-thanks-cuttlefish/"&gt;Seahorse Would Like You To Keep Your Shit To Yourself, Thanks, Cuttlefish’.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You see, Cuttlefish, it’s about common courtesy. Like, what if everyone else started attaching stuff they didn’t want or couldn’t be bothered carrying around to everyone else?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read it. It made my day so much nicer and I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; needed it today!&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Wednesday I had a debate with Peter Stanford, former editor of the Catholic Herald about faith schools, at the CFI event “What sort of faith schools are acceptable, if any?” in the Great Hall at Christ Church. A.C. Grayling was Chair and Richard Dawkins showed up too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the wonderful Dr Petra has some interesting experiences with teaching about faith too, as evidenced by her Tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

I treat all new books this way to keep their spines from cracking. And they just can't have enough of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Put book on table, spine down. Fold down left cover, smoothen inner edge, fold down right cover, smoothen inner edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Fold down 15-20 pages to the left, flatten firmly with finger along inner edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Fold down 15-20 pages to the right, flatten firmly with finger along inner edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the book is spread out flat in front of you and open at the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. If it's a hardback: close the book and knock the front edge, opposite from the spine, firmly against the table a few times.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s interesting so far, and he makes some thought-provoking arguments about the role of opportunities in youth and hard work (“the 10,000 hour rule” — how much it takes to master anything) as opposed to innate ability as drivers of achievement.  In the opening chapter, he uses the example of Canadian hockey players to illustrate how a subtle bias in opportunity could have major consequences for who succeeds and who doesn’t.  Specifically, he notes that at various junior and professional levels, players born between January and March are greatly overrepresented.  The explanation he offers is that these players are up to almost a year older than other players in each division because the cutoff in Canadian minor hockey is January 1.  So, if you’re born on January 1 you will be the oldest in your division, and if you’re born on December 31st you will be the youngest. This difference in age translates into a difference in size, coordination, and other features associated with early athletic development.  Thus, the older/larger boys are chosen for the “rep” teams while the younger/smaller boys remain in “house” leagues.  This leads to differences in coaching, practice time, number of games, quality of teammates and opponents, and encouragement.  Therefore, being born in the first few months of the year is, according to this argument, one of the major predictors of how far a player will go in the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is an interesting observation, and the interpretation seems reasonable enough.  However, something just didn’t sit right and my inclination as a scientist was to test the robustness of the reported pattern.  So I spent about 10 minutes looking up some of the best Canadian players in the NHL in recent times. Specifically, the gold medal Olympic teams from 2002 and 2010.  Here are the birth dates of the world champion players:&lt;/p&gt;

For one thing, his website, NaturalNews.com, is a font of pseudoscience and quackery rivaling the infamous Whale.to, which makes it powerfully seductive to go back to that well again and again for blogging material. Although taking on an Adams screed is almost always a lot of fun for me, it's also too easy. Mike's craziness is so strong that, while it almost guarantees an entertaining piece for my blog, going back to that well too often risks making me fat and lazy as a skeptic and potentially boring you. On the other hand, sometimes Mike just drops a couple of bombs so entertaining in close proximity to each other that I'm willing to take this chance. This is one of those times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, Adams launched a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/mike_adams_takes_on_obama_care_with_hila.php"&gt;hilariously paranoid attack&lt;/a&gt; on Obamacare (i.e., the health insurance reform bill that President Obama signed into law last week). As you probably know, though, Adams is nothing if not all about massive crank overkill, and this issue is no exception. In fact, this time around, he paints his vision of what he would like to see politically in the U.S. in an article entitled &lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/028464_health_freedom_America.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;The real health reform solution: A Health Freedom Zone in America&lt;/a&gt;. I'll give him credit. This time around, he's completely honest. A complete and utter loon, but an honest complete and utter loon. In his previous post, Adams envisions Obamacare as being due to the "medical mafia" and a "pharma-funded betrayal." In his most recent post, he continues on that theme and proposes his woo-tastic solution. What is this woo-tastic solution, you ask? It's something called a "health freedom zone."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's as bad as you think it is:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/quackery_promotion_zones.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/quackery_promotion_zones.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/UcKHgLostcQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269950931334"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=22932">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/64f2834837f89343</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="College Atheists"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Profile of Project Reason Video Contest’s Winner</title><published>2010-03-30T11:00:13Z</published><updated>2010-03-30T11:00:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/30/profile-of-project-reason-video-contests-winner/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The winner of the &lt;a href="http://www.project-reason.org/contests/video_contest/"&gt;Project Reason video contest&lt;/a&gt; (and $10,000) was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Evid3nc3"&gt;Chris Redford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who made this video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/xwBqGpQ1RDU%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redford is a member of the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=info&amp;amp;gid=143955866281"&gt;Society of Open Minded Atheists and Agnostics&lt;/a&gt; (SOMA) at the University of Kansas, an affiliate of the Secular Student Alliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a &lt;a href="http://www.kansan.com/news/2010/mar/30/student-atheists-mini-documentary-wins-award/?news"&gt;nice article about him&lt;/a&gt; and his deconversion today in the campus newspaper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The biggest shift in Redford’s religious transformation came in March of 2004, when he read a New Mexico professor’s controversial review of the Bible on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I found it kind of offensive, but I thought I would try to reach out to him,” Redford said. “It turned out that he had more to teach me than I had to teach him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redford communicated with the professor over e-mail for a week and the logic of the professor’s arguments began a dramatic change in his religious ideals. Redford began to see holes in the religion he had been committed to for his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was the most important thing in my life,” he said. “Basically any kind of higher criticism of the Bible, until then, I was completely unaware of as a Christian.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Chris for the win and for showing that even a hard-core Christian can change his mind.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to forget how often that actually happens.&lt;br&gt;

I promise – no real spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let me say I really enjoyed the movie. It was much better than I thought it was going to be. My favorite aspect of the movie is the fact that the nerd is the hero. Basically this is the story of a nerd who feels out of place in a town of jocks – a town that celebrates jocks and completely rejects his quirky nerditude. Eventually the protagonist finds a way to use his smarts and curiosity to beat the jocks at their own game – and even to change the very nature of the game, making it one that celebrates smarts over brawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have nothing against jocks or athletic prowess, in fact I think excellence in the physical realm is worth celebrating and I have enthusiastically engaged in sports my entire life. This is not really a “revenge of the nerds” type plot line, but rather seeing the value in recognizing a diversity of talents, rather than narrowly defining success. Nothing new, really, but nicely done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have complained that the other main theme – meeting strangeness with understanding rather than violence – was preachy, but I disagree. This is a fine theme for a family movie, and was not overdone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was another small aspect of this movie I found very curious. The movie takes place in a viking town. And sure, it was not surprising to find a cliche of vikings in a kid’s cartoon – complete with horned helmets. However, these vikings had Scottish accents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not complaining about realism – after all, this is a movie in a fictitious world inhabited by a multiplicity of dragons. Rather, I was just hit by how solidified the Hollywood cliche of the Scottish accent had become. Part of my reaction was born of the fact that emotionally the Scottish accents “felt” right in the movie, even though they simultaneously felt out of place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure exactly when this cliche became solidified, but this movie certainly proves that it has been. I think Braveheart likely is  a major cause – audiences fell in love with heroes speaking in a Scottish brogue. The accent itself came to signify the characteristics of William Wallace – brave, brutal, barbaric, but honorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the mental connection between the Scottish accent and these characteristics was then further entrenched by Shrek. Shrek was a noble ogre, and Mike Myers chose to portray him with a Scottish accent. It seemed to fit, and it strongly reinforced the stereotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now credit card commercials featuring barbarian hordes ask you in a Scottish accent, “What’s in your wallet?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until How to Train Your Dragon I would have considered this just a preference – the popularity of the Scottish hero. But the makers of this movie felt it necessary to portray vikings with a Scottish accent – because they are barbaric, fight with swords and axes, and are honorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made me further ponder the nature of Hollywood stereotypes themselves. They exist because of the tendency for association – we look for patterns and associations and make the connections in our minds. Such connections can be strong, and tied to emotional reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These become hooks for movie writers and directors – a way to instantly communicate something to the audience. So every bag of groceries in a TV show or movie has celery or carrot sprigs coming out the top – that way the audience knows they are groceries. When was the last time you bought a bunch of carrots with the leafy stems still attached, and then did not put them in a plastic produce bag?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the movies when a young couple is in love, they must shop together in an open-air market, take a rowboat ride on a pond, and wash a car together and then playfully spray each other with water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, apparently, all honorable barbarians have Scottish accents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not denigrating all such practices. As I said, humans are good at making associations, and these become convenient tools for quickly communicating something to an audience. But there is a spectrum from a useful cinematic convention to a tired cliche. Conventions (like the carrot stems) are often benign, almost subconscious, and serve their purpose. I don’t need the director wasting screen time getting across that those are bags of groceries – just put the stupid carrot stems out the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some cliches are so tired they now grate on me every time I see them. I really don’t need to see another playful water fight among lovers, or the beam-on-beam energy battle between good and evil, or a nerd with tape on their glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also realized, by the end of the movie I was already a little tired of the Scottish accent thing. While it made an immediate emotional connection, it was rapidly slipping into the realm of cliche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with these Hollywood conventions/cliches is that they are an excuse for lazy writing and directing. They also demonstrate a certain lack of respect for the audience. You know – I think we could have handled vikings with Scandinavian accents and still connected to the vibe of the movie. Or forget the accents – they wouldn’t be speaking accented English anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do something new, and challenge the audience a bit – even in a family-oriented cartoon. We can take it. But that requires work and creativity. My bias is that directors should be striving to create their own new conventions, not rest on established and overused ones. Dreamworks is certainly no stranger to creativity, and as I said, the movie was otherwise excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

And clean up a bit of this huge drafts pile that has accumulated lately. Because I&amp;#39;m lazy, let&amp;#39;s do Spironucleus first, from MM17. It goes well with laziness as not very much is known about it, which means there isn&amp;#39;t too much to write about it. Shit, now you know why I blog about obscure organisms like those various protists...my secret is out!SEMs of diplomonad fish parasite Spironucleus vortens. cr - compound lateral ridge.lpr + rpr - left and right peripheral ridge, respectively. Note their rope-like form. pp - posterior papillum. Note flagellar pockets in (4). r - recurrent flagellum. 5 - an atypical specimen with transposed posterior structures. 6 - laterla view of posterior end. A fairly complicated flagellate! (Sterud &amp;amp; Poynton 2002 JEM)To clarify the complicated morphology:Drawings of the &amp;#39;double-celled&amp;#39; Spironucleus vortens. The two recurrent flagella pass inside the cell and emerge at the posterior end. (Poynton et al. 1995 JEM)Spironucleus may strike you as being particularly symmetrical. In fact, it very well is a &amp;#39;double cell&amp;#39;, containing two nuclei (slightly wrapping around each other helically, hence Spironucleus), and two sets of flagella. The path of the recurrent flagella makes sense when considering that the single cells of the group have three flagella pointing one way, and the fourth pointing another. These double cells are case of the two cells being &amp;#39;stuck together&amp;#39; at the side of the recurrent flagellum. Here&amp;#39;s a TEM to show the elongate nuclei and the flagella passing between them:Top: longitudinal section at the anterior end of the flagellate. n - nuclei; k - kinetosomes. Bottom: cross-section of the anterior end. Note the recurrent flagella (r; circled in red) passing between the nuclei. (Poynton et al. 1995 JEM)Here&amp;#39;s another species of Spironucleus, S.berkhanaus, in arctic char blood:Parasitic Spironucleus barkhanus in the blood of arctic char, as well as in isolation.  Note that it&amp;#39;s a different species from the one above, which may explain the lack of lateral ridges.(Sterud et al. 2003 Dis Aquatic Organisms)Note how the two species seem a bit different from each other. This shows the morphological diversity in the group. In fact, Spironucleus seems to be a bit polyphyletic or paraphyletic at best (Jørgensen &amp;amp; Sterud 2007 Protist; Kolisko et al. 2008 BMC Evol Biol).Phylogeny of Spironucleus. This poor genus seem to be ruthlessly strewn all over Diplomonadida. Note position of S.vortens and S.berkhanus. (Jørgensen &amp;amp; Sterud 2007 Protist)Diplomonads have an interesting tale involving cell cycle defects and duplications of the nucleus and flagella, but I&amp;#39;ll leave you in suspense for a while. That&amp;#39;s a bigger topic, and I should probably introduce our cute friend Giardia first (cute friend in SEM, and horrible foe in the intestine...). Giardia is a independent case of cell &amp;#39;doubling&amp;#39;, and is organised quite differently. Further discussion of diplomonads should happen...eventually.

I know I have! Here&amp;#39;s an example of what I&amp;#39;m talking about.Try to remember this visual paired associate (AB):Now recall pair AB:Next, I&amp;#39;m going to have you remember another visual paired associate (AC):Now recall pair AC:Do you still remember the first visual paired associate (AB)?What if I were to pay you ten cents to remember? How about a hundred bucks? Would your memory performance increase? Stay the same? Most of your would probably infer the former. More money = more motivation to memorize.That&amp;#39;s what Kuhl and colleagues found in their study published in the latest issue of Nature Neuroscience. However, the study didn&amp;#39;t just stop there. That&amp;#39;s just the tip of the iceberg!They had all participants complete a task similar to the one just demonstrated, but used more novel pairings such as a watch and a pipe (yawn). 2/3 of AB pairs were followed by AC pairs in the subsequent encoding rounds while the remaining 1/3 of AB pairs were followed by nothing. Trials began either with a high or a low reward tagged to an AB pair and a high, low, or no reward tagged to an AC pair. There were 8 encoding and immediate test rounds and 1 critical post-test round conducted outside of the scanner where participants were asked to recall AB pairs only. As expected, retroactive interference negatively affected memory retrieval of AB pairs.     Using fMRI, the authors found that left hippocampal activation during the learning of a latter visual paired associate predicted how well the first paired associate would be remembered. Basically, if your left memory cortex didn&amp;#39;t light up while encoding new information then the relatively older information would be forgotten. More specifically, for those of you who couldn&amp;#39;t remember the first pair (horse and no-name comic book) it&amp;#39;s likely that your left posterior hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex weren&amp;#39;t activated during the learning of the latter pair (horse and Sarah Jessica Parker).Furthermore, the researchers found that when successful recall for AB pairs were achieved, reward centers in the brain (fronstriatal regions) also lit up on fMRI scan.So how can all of this be explained? According to the authors, hippocampal reactivation is protecting the stored episodic memories from being forgotten in the face of interfering information. The authors chalk it up to pattern completion which &amp;quot;allows previously encoded memories to be reinstated from a partial input, thereby allowing past episodes to be reactivated, interleaved with current experience, and consolidated over time&amp;quot;. The horse not only serves as a retrieval cue for the memory of Sarah Jessica Parker, but the no-name comic book as well. Additionally, the findings underscore the importance of past reward-associated (motivated) learning and its incorporation into new learning experiences.This study leads me to wonder what key factors contribute to individual differences in memory encoding after performing an interference task. Is it just hippocampal functioning and level of motivation that sets each and every one of us apart? What about working memory capacity (prefrontal and parietal areas)? Intelligence? Age? Level of alertness? Amount of sleep prior to and/or after learning? All the above? Anyway, it&amp;#39;s time to end this pointless musing. Back to more important matters like tending to Ninja Garden issue 1.     References:Kuhl, B., Shah, A., DuBrow, S., &amp;amp; Wagner, A. (2010).

The problem is that as one Skepchick pointed out, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/03/ai-im-skeptical-that-youre-funny/"&gt;their suggestions suck&lt;/a&gt;. The author, Josh Noel’s advice is poor. I hate to be the one to tell him this but  they’re not funny and if people are laughing at what Josh Noel is saying,  they’re just being polite or are laughing at him for trying too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I figured I’d try to construct a short list of my own tips on not just faking funny but really being funny:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The three most important rules of comedy: delivery, delivery,  delivery. Good delivery can make anything funny and poor delivery can  make anything unfunny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Misdirection. Any punchline you can see  coming a mile away is not funny. The key is to cleverly surprise or trick your  audience. This can be accomplished in numerous ways, one of the more  unique of which is the famous Aristocrats joke where everything is  thrown into the set-up, preparing the audience for a huge pay-off only to deliberately deliver a completely underwhelming  punchline. The real joke is on the audience whose expectations were  deceptively built up for the very purpose of ultimately tricking them by going the other way. The key  is in misdirection and subverting expectations. Another brilliant example of misdirection is “The Battle of Wits” scene in &lt;em&gt;The Princess Bride&lt;/em&gt;. While the set-up in the scene is very funny what puts it over the top as one of the funniest scenes in film history, if not the funniest scene, is the surprising end, which completely turns the expectations created in the set-up on its head. It’s like a well designed magic trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The Rule of 3 – Going along with the misdirection idea, set up a   pattern with two items in succession and then make the third item   comically out of step w/ the first 2. The classic example is the guy   standing on a fragile frozen lake where objects keep falling on the ice, First   maybe it’s a bowling ball. Then a grand piano. Still the ice doesn’t   break. Then a feather falls onto the ice and it breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Don’t go big with  your humor. Big is cheap and might get a quick  chuckle, but it’s  definitely not funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Rule 4 can be broken if  you’ve laid in the groundwork of establishing a  funny character who can get away with it. (See: Austin Powers, Ace  Ventura, Zoolander, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Putting either larger than life characters in ordinary settings or  ordinary characters in larger than life settings. For example, imagine  almost any Star Wars character at the laundry mat or imagine that annoying guy  at the office working on the Death Star (See: Robot Chicken Star Wars parodies). Dr. Horrible is also a great  example of the former, being an evil mad scientist in a very mundane setting, as is Dr. Evil in group therapy, or Darth Vader’s less successful and identical relative  Chad Vader working as the night manager of a supermarket. And in the internet shorts &lt;em&gt;God Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, heaven is depicted as a giant corporation where all important decisions in the universe are decided by middle management. Historical characters can also work. For instance, imagining Hitler in almost any mundane situation is funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Random weirdness can be very funny. While &lt;em&gt;South Park &lt;/em&gt;did a great job of spoofing&lt;em&gt; Family Guy&lt;/em&gt;’s common device of cut-to jokes involving completely random allusions, one of the reasons &lt;em&gt;Family Guy&lt;/em&gt; is successful is random humor works. And let’s face it, lately &lt;em&gt;Family Guy&lt;/em&gt; has been much funnier and more spot-on in his satire than &lt;em&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. PANTS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, that was just an extension of #7. But almost any sentence with the word “pants” in it is funny. It just is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Callback humor is very funny. That is when you establish a funny idea and then keep calling it back at different, even sometimes random times as to turn it into a running joke. This is also very effective in creating rapport with people as it allows you to build inside jokes that are only funny to those in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Committing to a joke for a long time is funny. The Simpsons used to do this all the time such as the bit when Sideshow Bob keeps stepping on the rakes or when Homer’s brain tries to recall the significance of having a dental plan, or when Bart wastes several minutes of real time dialing Australia on the phone. Family Guy does this all the time too such as the various times in which Peter fights with the giant chicken. These sequences go on needlessly long, taking up three or four minutes of the 21-minute-long show on a single joke. What’s particularly interesting about these jokes is that they tend to create a roller coaster of emotions. At first it’s funny. Then it goes on so long you start to get tired of it and are just waiting to get back to the story. Then you start to think it’s got to end any second now and anticipation builds. Then you realize that it’s a whole minute later and they’re still playing out the same joke,. You start getting annoyed. Then after another thirty seconds or so it becomes funny again because they’ve really committed to it and have tricked you into watching one stupid joke for that long. And then it finally ends and the joke becomes so popular that they bring it back and some people regard it as genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Kaufman was also a master of this sort of thing:  simulating the look of a broken television, committing to reading The Great Gatsby in its entirety instead of performing jokes, the long-running wrestling stunt. In fact, Kaufman was so good at this sort of thing that the Tony Clifton joke is STILL being continued decades after Kaufman’s death as people continue to inhabit the role. Kaufman’s dream was to have a Tony Clifton in at least every U.S. state. It’s literally a joke that never ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. Jokes involving stupid people will always be funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that’s ten right there. I’d love to hear comments about them or other people’s additions to the list.&lt;/p&gt;

Over 30 million prescriptions are written every year in the US for the anticoagulant warfarin, best known under the brand name Coumadin. Originally developed as a rat poison, warfarin has proved very effective in preventing blood clots and saving lives; but too much anticoagulation leads to the opposite problem: bleeding. A high level of Coumadin might prevent a stroke from a blood clot only to cause a stroke from an intracranial bleed. The effect varies from person to person and from day to day depending on things like the amount of vitamin K in the diet and interactions with other medications. It requires careful monitoring with blood tests, and it is tricky because there is a delay between changing the dose and seeing the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book &lt;em&gt;The Language of Life&lt;/em&gt;, Francis Collins predicts that Coumadin will be the first drug for which the so-called Dx-Rx paradigm — a genetic test (Dx) followed by a prescription (Rx) — will enter mainstream medical practice. &lt;a href="http://www.phgfoundation.org/news/3636/"&gt;FDA economists have estimated&lt;/a&gt; that by formally integrating genetic testing into routine warfarin therapy, the US alone would avoid 85,000 serious bleeding events and 17,000 strokes annually.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.hon.ch/News/HSN/637031.html"&gt;A recent news release&lt;/a&gt; from the American College of Cardiology described a paper at their annual meeting reporting a study of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;896 people who, shortly after beginning warfarin therapy, gave a blood sample or cheek swab that was analyzed for expression of two genes — CYP2C9 and VKORC1 — that revealed sensitivity to warfarin. People with high sensitivity were put on a reduced dose of warfarin and had frequent blood tests. People with low sensitivity were given a higher dose of warfarin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first six months that they took warfarin, those who underwent genetic testing were 31 percent less likely to be hospitalized for any reason and 29 percent less likely to be hospitalized for bleeding or thromboembolism than were a group that did not have genetic testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epstein said that the cost of the genetic testing — $250 to $400 — would be justified by reduced hospitalization costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I don’t believe this study. I’ll explain why I’m skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It seems to me something is wrong with the whole idea of using genetic testing to adjust Coumadin dosage. It doesn’t matter whether a patient has low sensitivity or high sensitivity to warfarin, since the same trial-and-error process of monitoring and dose adjustment will result in a safe dose for either.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the typical scenario for a patient who is given warfarin, he is in the hospital where he is first given heparin by injection, usually in the form of low molecular weight heparins like Lovenox. Heparin works by binding to antithrombin and does not require monitoring with blood tests. Warfarin works by an entirely different mechanism. It reduces the amount of vitamin K dependent clotting factors. The heparin provides immediate protection while the warfarin gradually takes effect, a process that lasts for several days and lags behind the blood test used to monitor it: prothrombin time with calculation of the International Normalized Ratio (INR). After the INR reaches the target levels (usually 2-3 times normal), the injectable drug is stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently some providers are in a hurry to get the patient stabilized on Coumadin, so they start with a high “loading” dose and then back off as needed. This may have made sense when patients had to be off the heparin before they could be discharged from the hospital; but today they are commonly taught to give themselves subcutaneous injections and they are sent home, continuing the Lovenox until the Coumadin kicks in. There’s no reason they couldn’t start everyone on a low dose of Coumadin and adjust upwards as needed. Blood tests are done very frequently at first (as often as every day or two) and then can be cut back to as infrequently as once a month if the INR remains stable on a constant dose of warfarin. In the medical facility where I get my care, a Coumadin Clinic directed by a clinical pharmacologist monitors all patients on Coumadin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A start low/adjust upwards protocol will result in a safe dose for all patients regardless of their DNA. I don’t see how that management plan would be improved by knowing the gene expressions. It takes time to get the genetic test results, and the provider has to start the patient on Coumadin before the test results are even available. Genetics is only estimated to contribute about 70% to dose requirements, and variations in the other 30% could outweigh simplistic dose estimates based on DNA. And testing costs money that I see no need to spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to read the actual study when it is published. I will be looking closely for confounding factors that might have influenced results. Could the tested patients have been treated differently in some way because of expectations raised by the DNA test? Did the non-tested patients have optimal management by someone experienced in adjusting Coumadin dosage? Was the study population somehow different from the population the average doctor sees in his practice? How exactly was the Coumadin dose adjusted differently because of the DNA findings? What was the target INR level? Did any of the complications occur in patients who were in the target range? Was compliance assessed? Could alcohol and drug use have affected the INR? The reported 29% reduction of re-hospitalization for bleeding or clotting complications is a relative risk. What was the absolute risk? According to &lt;a href="http://www.aafp.org/afp/990201ap/635.html"&gt;a review article in &lt;em&gt;American Family Physician&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the median annual rate of major bleeding in patients on Coumadin ranges from 0.9 to 2.7 percent, and in &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC384377/"&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; the rate of complications in the highest risk group was only 6.3%. Complications were more likely in elderly patients, patients with co-existing illnesses, and patients with INRs outside the target range. How many of these complications could have been avoided by optimal management?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My common sense tells me patients on Coumadin can be managed just as well without knowing genetic test results. Genetic testing and pharmacogenetics hold great promise for improving individualized patient care decisions, but I don’t think Coumadin is a good example of such benefits. The DNA only confirms what our patient’s response to therapy has already told us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in art school, I thought seriously of doing paintings for a show I called, “The Art I Wanted to Make.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept would have been to build an ambitious gallery show around fantasy and sci-fi sketches from, y’know, my elementary school duotangs and high school sketchbooks. Alongside these sketches would be re-makes of those pieces, each executed as a full-blown, heroic scale fantasy painting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never got around to that show, but having heard about it you’ll be able to guess what fun I have doing art for &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; magazine — especially the covers. What comic art nerd would not give his &lt;em&gt;New Mutants Special Edition&lt;/em&gt; for a chance to &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/archives/vol15n02.html"&gt;blow up the Earth&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/archives/vol10n01.html"&gt;crash a saucer at Roswell&lt;/a&gt; for a major magazine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if those were fabulous opportunities, what about the chance to have another run at the fairy art to which I devoted so much watercolor work in junior high school? Fun stuff indeed!&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:272px"&gt;&lt;img title="Fairy_making_of_3_S" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Fairy_making_of_3_S.jpg" alt="Making of Junior Skeptic cover #36" width="262" height="355"&gt;&lt;p&gt;3D digital model created by Jim W. W. Smith&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the cover for what would become &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/junior_skeptic/issue36/"&gt;Junior Skeptic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/junior_skeptic/issue36/"&gt; #36&lt;/a&gt; (bound inside the Volume 15, Number 3 issue of &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; magazine — sold out) quite a bit in advance: model photography took place in Australia, back in January of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Here in the &lt;em&gt;Junior Skeptic &lt;/em&gt;studio, we create hundreds of quite glossy book and magazine illustrations with only the &lt;a href="https://www.skeptic.com/donate/"&gt;resources of an educational nonprofit&lt;/a&gt; to work with. Pulling that off means planning ahead!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we neared production with the Cottingley Fairies issue (with guest writers Jason Loxton and Jillian Baker) I extracted the model from her makeshift background and corrected the lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then,&lt;em&gt; Junior Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; regular art contributor Jim W. W. Smith created a custom 3D model for the wings and dress. This might seem like overkill, but we tend to get a lot of re-use out of CG work. And, I think the CG wings speak for themselves in the final composite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:272px"&gt;&lt;img title="Fairy_making_of_8_S" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Fairy_making_of_8_S.jpg" alt="Making of the Fairy Cover" width="262" height="355"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handcrafted leaf dress by Daniel Loxton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought at first that we would settle on this CG solution for the dress as well, but I was unsatisfied with early tests of the digital dress. So, I spent an afternoon outside on a casting call for leaves, picking through roadside autumn leaf litter to some rather odd looks from passerby. From these, I created a physical leaf dress around a small wooden artists’ dummy. This had less flexibility than the CG version (literally — even keeping the leaves hydrated as best I could, the physical dress was very stiff), but it made up for it in dimensionally we couldn’t afford to model in CG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was out to the countryside for location photography with the physical leaf dress. This was shot crouched beside a stream in Metchosin, British Columbia — in the rain. I lost the light faster than I’d planned on (on account of the stormy weather) so this was a bit of a hectic process (involving a lot of hiding the camera in my coat to keep the rain off the lens).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:272px"&gt;&lt;img title="Fairy_making_of_9_S" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Fairy_making_of_9_S.jpg" alt="Making of the Fairy Cover" width="262" height="355"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location photography by Daniel Loxton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the pieces finally in place, it was back to the studio for compositing (which all happens in Photoshop, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compositing is painstaking work, but I find it tremendously satisfying. In the roughest strokes, the process works like this: first, I build up as photo-real a scene as I’m able, matching even the grain when I can. (That last was impossible in this case: the high ISO model shoot was a bit of stretch here, though I think it did what I needed it to do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, having achieved something fairly real-looking, I next destroy it. The goal isn’t to create a hoax, after all, but an illustration. That’s where my own background in painting comes into play, as well as the lessons I’ve learned working under &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; Art Director &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/junior_skeptic/meet_the_creators.html#Linse"&gt;Pat Linse&lt;/a&gt;. A long-time veteran of film and advertising, she always asks, “What’s the first read?” — that is to say, where does your eye go first? With attention to contrast and line and color, it’s possible to guide the viewer’s eye exactly where you want it. That usually involves blowing the crap out of realism (and inevitably out of your favorite little background details), but if it’s done well our eyes tend to accept even very blatant and theatrical tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:272px"&gt;&lt;img title="Fairy_making_of_11_S" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Fairy_making_of_11_S.jpg" alt="Making of the Fairy Cover" width="262" height="355"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing the pieces together…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scene, the tricks are very blatant indeed — both to control the way the image reads, and to control the scene’s mood. What started as a cold and rainy location shoot becomes a dreamy and warm scene (and one that refers right back to those junior high school fairy watercolors I mentioned).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the final composite, below. Now that you’re looking for them, you’ll see a lot of irrational highlights and shadows behind the figure, which are painterly cheats to emphasize the fairy. Similarly, note the irrational gloom that pushes her foot back. (My favorite bits, though, are the rim light on her foot and shoulder.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you’ve enjoyed this little behind the scenes peek. If you’d like to see a few &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=148288&amp;amp;id=12198178283"&gt;more shots from the fairy cover&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve posted some at the&lt;em&gt; Junior Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; Page on Facebook. As well, the &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; magazine Page has in depth “making of” albums for &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=113758&amp;amp;id=23479859352"&gt;“2012″ cover&lt;/a&gt;, and for a favorite of mine: &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=21646&amp;amp;id=23479859352&amp;amp;op=6"&gt;the robot cover&lt;/a&gt; we did as a tribute to Isaac Asimov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More soon. In the meantime, clap your hands if you believe in fantasy art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week will also reflect on the memory of the 255th anniversary of the Birth of Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, the creator of homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeopaths and homeopathy supporters from around the globe will join forces in April during World Homeopathy Awareness Week (WHAW). The website lists many suggested activities and events, such as handing out fliers, promoting homeopathy through television and radio, organising musical concerts/stage concerts/skits/plays, etc with a homeopathic theme. Which all seem pretty harmless and twee, until you get to this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Contact other homeopaths in your area and organize free clinics for the poor.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Are the poor thirsty? Or need a bath? Why else would they be wanting expensive water?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also plan to get the word out about homeopathy during WHAW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the word is bollocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seriously, as sceptics we should make an effort to publicise homeopathy during this time to let people know it does nothing and it contains nothing. It’s water, or whatever else was used to dissolve the active ingredient, which has long disappeared by the time it appears on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to dig up some of the position statements from organisations concerned with the harm that homeopathy can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us are familiar with the one released by the &lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/392/"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt; in response to an open letter from Sense About Science imploring them to take a position on homeopathy. Their response was;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The WHO DOES NOT recommend the use of homeopathy for treating HIV, TB, malaria, influenza and infant diarrhoea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr Mario Raviglione, Director, Stop TB Department, WHO&lt;/strong&gt;:  “Our evidence-based WHO TB treatment/management guidelines, as well as the International Standards of Tuberculosis Care (ISTC) do not recommend use of homeopathy.”&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr Mukund Uplekar, TB Strategy and Health Systems, WHO&lt;/strong&gt;: “WHO’s evidence-based guidelines on treatment of tuberculosis…have no place for homeopathic medicines.”&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr Teguest Guerma, Director Ad Interim, HIV/AIDS Department, WHO&lt;/strong&gt;: “The WHO Dept. of HIV/AIDS invests considerable human and financial resources [...] to ensure access to evidence-based medical information and to clinically proven, efficacious, and safe treatment for HIV… Let me end by congratulating the young clinicians and researchers of Sense About Science for their efforts to ensure evidence-based approaches to treating and caring for people living with HIV.”&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr Sergio Spinaci, Associate Director, Global Malaria Programme, WHO&lt;/strong&gt;: “Thanks for the amazing documentation and for whistle blowing on this issue… The Global Malaria programme recommends that malaria is treated following the WHO Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria.”&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joe Martines, on behalf of Dr Elizabeth Mason, Director, Department of Child and Adolescent Health and Development, WHO&lt;/strong&gt;: “We have found no evidence to date that homeopathy would bring any benefit to the treatment of diarrhoea in children…Homeopathy does not focus on the treatment and prevention of dehydration – in total contradiction with the scientific basis and our recommendations for the management of diarrhoea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it might also be time to remind people about the &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/news/uk-government-recommends-public-funds-pulled-from-homeopathy/"&gt;recent findings&lt;/a&gt; by The House of Commons Science and Technology Committee in the UK on homeopathy. In a 273 page report, they concluded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The UK National Health Service should cease funding homeopathy&lt;br&gt;
* No further clinical trials of homeopathy should occur.&lt;br&gt;
* Evidence shows homeopathy doesn’t work.&lt;br&gt;
* Explanations for why homeopathy works are “scientifically implausible.”&lt;br&gt;
* Committee viewed homeopathy as placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.hpa.nhs.uk/webw/HPAweb&amp;amp;HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1195733802399?p=1191942128258"&gt;UK Health Protection Agency &lt;/a&gt;also published a statement saying they do  not recommend homeopathy for malaria prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“There is no scientific proof that homeopathic remedies are effective in either preventing or treating malaria. In addition, the Faculty of Homeopathy does not promote the use of homeopathic remedies for disease prevention and note that their use in malaria prevention is unlikely to be acceptable to insurance providers.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in an undercover investigation by Simon Singh and Sense About Science, a researcher pretending to be travelling to malarial affected areas was advised that homeopathy was effective, by homeopaths and pharmacy assistants. At Nelsons Pharmacy in London, which claims to be Britain’s biggest manufacturer of homeopathic remedies she was advised of the remedies;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“They make it so your energy doesn’t have a malaria-shaped hole in it so the malarial mosquitos won’t come along and fill that in.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you serious? You have to be making that up. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if homeopathy is just water then it won’t hurt you right? Well no, as long as you are also receiving evidence based, effective treatments. Otherwise, it can be &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/09/28/homeopath-convicted-of-manslaughter-for-death-of-daughter/"&gt;lethal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to make as many people as possible aware of WHAW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aware that it’s complete bollocks.&lt;/p&gt;

She's had a TON of food already today, and is still entirely ravenous.  Maybe it was looking at this paper too long.

(Cereal break)

Anyway.

As I'm sure most of y'all out there are aware, obesity is a problem in the US.  No one is sure whether it's due to increased portion size, increased availability, decreased physical activity, changes in gut bacteria, issues with our behavioral approaches to food, or all of the above.  But scientists have been working for a while not only to look at the effects of overeating and obesity, but also to look at what CAUSES these things in the brain and body.  And today we present a paper on an interesting piece of this puzzle, one that Sci has had a good deal of interest in: the idea of overeating as an addiction-like phenomenon.

 Johnson and Kenney. "Dopamine D2 receptors in addiction-like reward dysfunction and compulsive eating in obese rats." Nature Neuroscience, 2010.

Last year saw a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/my_playlists?p=EBFA4F83341BB381"&gt;series of exposes on the cult from the local California news on KESQ-TV&lt;/a&gt; but those were only about 10 minutes each night. And of course the St. Petersburg Times in Florida has been running a long series of reports for the last several months. But now we’re talking about CNN! And not only that but each installment of Cooper’s series will be hours long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Cooper’s savvy enough to put the focus in the right place, less on all the Xenu stuff and more on the actual reported abuses. The reason this is important is that many people have already heard at least a little bit about the Xenu stuff and a lot of religious moderates and liberals have started to be turned off by the mockery of $cientologists’ “beliefs,” naively thinking the issue is just about a weird, goofy religion. It’s not. $cientology is not a religion and bares virtually no resemblance to one. Alleged $cientology churches look remarkably like office buildings inside and out and no actual prayer or meditation takes place in their “churches. ” $cientology is more of a multi-level marketing scheme that figured out long ago that they can get away with a lot more by wearing the costume of religion. But whenever being a religion is inconvenient such as when religious people accuse them of being anti-Christian or whatever, then they conveniently switch their tactics and insist that it’s all just a self-help program and that members are free to be both $cientologists AND Christians, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real story about $cientology is not a religion gone wild (I know. It’s redundant). No, the real story is the slave labor and child labor that goes on in the Sea Org, the psychology denialism, the bogus medical treatments, the disconnection policies, the mind control tactics, the nearly forced abortions, the cruel and unusual punishments to enforce discipline, the whole Orwellian nature of the cult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not only will all this including interviews with former members be seen in living rooms across the country (and by tomorrow around the world via the internet) but as I’ve reported before an anti-$cientologist film is getting big press in Germany, where the cult is officially regarded as a criminal organization. In response, $cientology has rather amusingly announced their plans to make &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1974924,00.html"&gt;a rival film&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But something tells me they won’t be hiring J.D. Shapiro to write the script. Shapiro was the unfortunate individual responsible for writing the origin screenplay for &lt;em&gt;Battlefield Earth&lt;/em&gt;. Shapiro, possibly the only non-$cientologist involved in the film, &lt;a href="http://www.deadline.com/2010/03/battlefield-earth-scripter-pens-apology/"&gt;now apologizes for the film and humorously recounts&lt;/a&gt; how he got involved in the project, his weird experiences with members of the cult, how he got fired from the project, and how he had little to do with the most objectionable parts of the film. Also included is the transcript of the speech he gave when he bravely accepted the Razzie award for the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, and &lt;a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SCIENTOLOGY_LAWSUITS?SITE=AZTUS&amp;amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT"&gt;the AP has picked up the story about Marc and Claire Headley’s lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against against $cientology over the treatment they received in the Sea Org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this pretty much guarantees that this will be in the hall of fame of worst weeks in the cult’s history.&lt;/p&gt;

And, while I don't think we will be able to hire him in our department for a couple of reasons, one of you left &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/03/tales_of_wasted_time_-_how_dr.php#comment-2386925"&gt;a comment that interested me&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What were his other qualifications?

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgive me, but I'm knee-deep in the lab search as an undergrad, have a solid GPA, and am feeling a little desperate to get a position where I am.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To tell the truth, I'm at the point where I'm willing to work for nothing. No credit, no pay, just a mention of my lab experience and a reference and maybe a source of a recommendation letter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured, as I am sitting here being generally amazing and drinking wine, that I would take a few lines to point out what made this kid stand out. Still, I have to tell you, it was just about as obvious &lt;a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/Rete/dont-shit-your-pants"&gt;as this&lt;/a&gt;.  The difference between this applicant and the others was that he obviously wanted a job.  I mean, sure, the others probably wanted a job too.  But, this guy did things that showed us that he really wanted it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the others, he showed up with a folder and extra copies of his resume.  He stood up and shook hands with everyone that he met.  Rather than simply wanting to learn what the job involved, he highlighted skills that he had that would benefit our work.  He spoke knowledgeably and enthusiastically about the limited research experiences he had as an undergraduate, and that enthusiasm was apparent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, I largely sat bored through most of his interview, dejected by the process and not paying close attention, until the woman next to me asked him if he had any additional questions.  Then, he turned to the back of his folder and pulled out the paper that I have based all of my subsequent work on.  He said that he had been reading it and noticed that the phenomenon that we study causes a percent change in a particular system on the order of 2-5%.  He asked me, &amp;quot;Even though it is statistically significant, do you really think its important?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What he noticed was subtle, and although the changes that we have documented are incredibly physiologically important, he showed me that he was thinking and scrutinizing.  How could I help but be impressed?  Besides, it took real moxie for that kid to pull out a paper and tell me he thought I might be full of crap. There&amp;#39;s nothing I love more than a scrappy kid with moxie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, even though he had a good GPA and decent lab experiences, the thing he had that the others didn&amp;#39;t was enthusiasm and maturity.  That&amp;#39;s the kind of stuff I just haven&amp;#39;t learned how to teach to a student.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/03/what_was_it_about_the_one.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/0UbiaXv26qk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269919684554"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/?p=4425">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/58c08d9eb64d4fbd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Philosophy"/><title type="html">Sam Harris Responds</title><published>2010-03-29T23:13:10Z</published><updated>2010-03-29T23:13:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CosmicVarianceBlog/~3/lJh7FjoQg-Y/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/03/29/sam-harris-responds/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update and reboot&lt;/strong&gt;:  Sam Harris has &lt;a href="http://www.project-reason.org/newsfeed/item/moral_confusion_in_the_name_of_science3/"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt; to my &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/03/24/the-moral-equivalent-of-the-parallel-postulate/"&gt;blog post reacting to his TED talk&lt;/a&gt;.

There are a number of posts out there by people who know what they are talking about and surely articulate it better than I do, including &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2010/03/moral-by-definition-some-slightly.html"&gt;Russell Blackford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.juliansanchez.com/2010/03/29/grasping-reality-with-our-gelatinous-meatsacks/"&gt;Julian Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; (who, one must admit, has a flair for titles), and I should add &lt;a href="http://underverse.blogspot.com/2010/03/summum-bonum-medicinae-sanitas.html"&gt;Chris Schoen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I wanted to try to clarify my own view on two particular points, so I put them below the fold.  I went on longer than I intended to (funny how that happens).  The whole thing was written in a matter of minutes — have to get back to real work — so grains of salt are prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt;, the role of consensus.  In formal reasoning, we all recognize the difference between axioms and deductions.  We start by assuming some axioms, and the laws of logic allow us to draw certain conclusions from them.  It’s not helpful to argue that the axioms are “wrong” — all we are saying is that &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; these assumptions hold, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; we can safely draw certain conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar (although not precisely analogous) situation holds in other areas of human reason, including both science and morality.  Within a certain community of like-minded reasoners, a set of assumptions is taken for granted, from which we can draw conclusions.  When we do natural science, we assume that our sense data is more or less reliable, that we are not being misled by an evil demon, that simpler theories are preferable to complicated theories when all else is equal, and so forth.  Given those assumptions, we can go ahead and do science, and when we disagree — which scientists certainly do — we can usually assume that the disagreements will ultimately be overcome by appeal to phenomena in the natural world, since as like-minded reasoners we share common criteria for adjudicating disputes.  Of course there might be some people who refuse to accept those assumptions, and become believers in astrology or creationism or radical epistemological skepticism or what have you.  We can’t persuade those people that they’re wrong by using the standards of conventional science, because they don’t accept those standards (even when they say they do).  Nevertheless, we science-lovers can get on with our lives, pleased that we have a system that works by our lights, and in particular one that is pragmatically successful at helping us deal with the world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to morality, we indeed have a very similar situation.  &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; we all agree on a set of starting moral assumptions, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; we constitute a functioning community that can set about figuring out how to pass moral judgments.  And, as I emphasized in the original post, the methods and results of science can be extremely helpful in that project, which is the important and interesting thing that we all agree on, which is why it’s a shame to muddy the waters by denying the fact/value distinction or stooping to insults.  But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, obviously, is that we don’t all agree on the assumptions, as far as morality is concerned.  Saying that everyone, or at least all right-thinking people, really want to increase human well-being seems pretty reasonable, but when you take the real world seriously it falls to pieces.  And to see that, we don’t have to contrast the values of fine upstanding bourgeois Americans with those of Hitler or Jeffrey Dahmer.  There are plenty of fine upstanding people — you can easily find them on the internet! — who think that human well-being is maximized by an absolute respect for individual autonomy, where people have equal access to primary goods but are given the chance to succeed or fail in life on their own.  Other people think that a more collective approach is called for, and it is appropriate for some people to cede part of their personal autonomy — for example, by paying higher taxes — in the name of the greater good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we might choose to marshall arguments in favor of one or another of these viewpoints.  But those arguments would not reduce to simple facts about the world that we could in principle point to; they would be appeals to the underlying moral sentiments of the individuals, which may very well end up being radically incompatible.  Let’s say that killing a seventy-year-old person (against their will) and transplanting their heart into the body of a twenty-year old patient might add more years to the young person’s life than the older person might be expected to have left.  Despite the fact that a naive utility-counting would argue in favor of the operation, most people (not all) would judge that not to be moral.  But what if a deadly virus threatened to wipe out all of humanity, and (somehow) the cure required killing an unwilling victim?  Most people (not all) would argue that we should reluctantly take that step.  (Think of how many people are in favor of involuntary conscription.)  Does anyone think that empirical research, in neuroscience or anywhere else, is going to produce a quantitative answer to the question of exactly how much harm would need to be averted to justify sacrificing someone’s life?  “I have scientifically proven that if we can save the life of 1,634 people, it’s morally right to sacrifice this one victim; but if it’s only 1,633, we shouldn’t do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At bottom, the issue is this:  &lt;em&gt;there exist real moral questions that no amount of empirical research alone will help us solve&lt;/em&gt;.  If you think that it’s immoral to eat meat, and I think it’s perfectly okay, neither one of us is making a &lt;em&gt;mistake&lt;/em&gt;, in the sense that Fred Hoyle was making a mistake when he believed that conditions in the universe have been essentially unchanging over time.  We’re just starting from different premises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucial point is that the difference between sets of incompatible moral assumptions is not analogous to the difference between believing in the Big Bang vs. believing in the Steady State model; but it is analogous to believing in science vs. being a radical epistemological skeptic who claims not to trust their sense data.  In the cosmological-models case, we trust that we agree on the underlying norms of science and together we form a functioning community; in the epistemological case, we don’t agree on the underlying assumptions, and we have to hope to agree to disagree and work out social structures that let us live together in peace.  None of which means that those of us who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; share common moral assumptions shouldn’t set about the hard work of articulating those assumptions and figuring out how to maximize their realization, a project of which science is undoubtedly going to be an important part.  Which is what we should be talking about all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;second&lt;/strong&gt; point I wanted to mention was the justification we might have for passing moral judgments over others.  Not to be uncharitable, but it seems that the biggest motivation most people have for insisting that morals can be grounded in facts is that they &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; it to be true — because if it’s not true, how can we say the Taliban are bad people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s easy:  the same way I can say radical epistemological skepticism is wrong.  Even if there is no metaphysically certain grounding from which I can rationally argue with a hard-core skeptic or a Taliban supporter, nothing stops me from using the fundamental assumptions that I do accept, and acting accordingly.  There is a weird sort of backwards-logic that gets deployed at this juncture:  “if you don’t believe that morals are objectively true, you can’t condemn the morality of the Taliban.”  Why not?  Watch me:  “the morality of the Taliban is loathsome and should be resisted.”  See?  I did it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only difference is that I can only present logical reasons to support that conclusion to other members of my morality community who proceed from similar assumptions.  For people who don’t, I can’t &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; that the Taliban is immoral.  But so what?  What exactly is the advantage of being in possession of a rigorous empirical argument that the Taliban is immoral?  Does anyone think they will be persuaded?  How we actually act in the world in the face of things we perceive to be immoral seems to depend in absolutely no way on whether I pretend that morality is grounded in facts about Nature.  (Of course there exist people who will argue that the Taliban should be left alone because we shouldn’t pass our parochial Western judgment on their way of life — and I disagree with those people, because we clearly do not share underlying moral assumptions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, it doesn’t matter what the advantage of a hypothetical objective morality would be — even if the world would be a better place if morals were objective, that doesn’t make it true.  That’s the most disappointing part of the whole discussion, to see people purportedly devoted to reason try to concoct arguments in favor of a state of affairs because they &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; it to be true, rather than because it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republican chairman, Michael Steele, promised on taking office that he would bring the party to corners of America it had not reached before. It is a fair bet that most Republicans did not expect these corners to include the Voyeur West Hollywood, a bondage and S&amp;amp;M club in Los Angeles.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It emerged today that the Republicans spent almost $2,000 last month on a visit to the club where topless women hang from nets on the ceiling and simulate sex in a glass case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Steele himself was not at the club—his cupidity is reserved for his desire to purchase a private jet. It&amp;#39;s still got to hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steele inherited a surplus of $22m when he took over chairmanship of the national committee in January last year, but that dropped to $13m, well short of the kind of money needed to fight an election. With the congressional midterm elections due in November, Steele has been appealing for donations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it would be great if the Republicans blew their warchest on strip clubs. I just hope they tipped the women well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/maybe_it_will_loosen_them_up_a.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/kMJjKcxwZrI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269915920696"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=4996">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8c0c5074ba7614dc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">White House Remains Steadfast In Support Of Disability Council Nominee</title><published>2010-03-30T01:00:52Z</published><updated>2010-03-30T01:00:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/CAKWyg8Kfps/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Left Brain/Right Brain</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269910843327"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/how_to_drive_a_mathematician_c.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9b0694dd0f219c6d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Math"/><title type="html">How to Drive a Mathematician Crazy.

You just get used to them. &lt;i&gt;-Johann von Neumann&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sometimes, I have to deal with series: lots of numbers all added together.  Some series clearly approach a limit, like the following:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + ...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can visualize this in terms of pies.  (What do you want?  I'm hungry!)  One = one whole pie.  So that first number starts me out with one whole pie.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/how_to_drive_a_mathematician_c/Pie-Straw.jpeg" width="500" height="503" alt="Pie-Straw.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I add the second number in my series, I'm clearly adding half a pie to that, for a total of a pie and a half.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/how_to_drive_a_mathematician_c/459865991_20297be637.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="459865991_20297be637.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I add the third term, I've now got one-and-three-quarters pies, and by adding the fourth term, I've got one-and-seven-eighths pies.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/how_to_drive_a_mathematician_c/Pumpkin_Pie_lg.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/how_to_drive_a_mathematician_c/Pumpkin_Pie_lg-thumb-500x375-43815.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="Pumpkin_Pie_lg.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I add more and more terms in this series, I'm going to get closer and closer to &lt;i&gt;two whole pies&lt;/i&gt;, but I'll never quite reach it, always being just a tiny sliver away.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's okay!  It means that the sum of this series is &lt;b&gt;two&lt;/b&gt;.  The series has a limit, or -- in math-speak -- the series &lt;i&gt;converges&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all series converge!  Take a look at this one:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first term starts me out with a pie.  Fine, so did the last series.  But when I add the second term in, I realize I now have &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; pies!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/how_to_drive_a_mathematician_c/6a00e398a76bc0000301240b634286860e-500pi.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="6a00e398a76bc0000301240b634286860e-500pi.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, if I add the third one in I have three pies, if I add the fourth in I get four pies, and so on!  The more terms I add, the more pies I get.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/how_to_drive_a_mathematician_c/305999999_8ea364de75.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="305999999_8ea364de75.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last part -- that the series doesn't approach a limit -- is really important.  It means that I can keep adding more terms, but when I do, the value of the series keeps changing; it doesn't &lt;i&gt;approach&lt;/i&gt; one single value.  Therefore, this series does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; converge, and the word we give to this is that the series &lt;i&gt;diverges&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, to quote Lindsay Lohan (correctly) from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_Girls"&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;b&gt;The Limit Does Not Exist!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if I were a tease about it?  What if I gave you this series:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one term, there is a pie, but after two terms, there aren't any pies; the second term takes the first pie away!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/how_to_drive_a_mathematician_c/2532003853_48c7099bdc.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="2532003853_48c7099bdc.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it looks like the third term adds a pie, and the fourth one takes it away, and this continues.  You're adding pies (one-by-one) and taking them away (one-by-one) as you keep on adding terms.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/how_to_drive_a_mathematician_c/pie%20plates.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="pie plates.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you might ask yourself, &lt;b&gt;does the series converge&lt;/b&gt;, and if it does, &lt;b&gt;what is its limit&lt;/b&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mathematician is likely to tell you that the limit does not exist.  &lt;a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_BmCaAsIYriI/SLVuQkkCbFI/AAAAAAAAAQM/Knv-yTaXLt8/Dr.+Weird+of+Aqua+Teen+Hunger+Force.JPG"&gt;Why not&lt;/a&gt;?  Because for &lt;i&gt;half&lt;/i&gt; of the terms, the sum is one full pie.  But for the other half of the terms, the sum is zero pies.  I could group these terms together to show you.  For example, if I put my parentheses like so:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;( 1 - 1 ) + ( 1 - 1 ) + ( 1 - 1 ) + ( 1 - 1 ) + ( 1 - 1 ) + ...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;it's clear that this series sums up to zero.  But what if I'm clever, and I organize my terms like this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 + ( -1 + 1 ) + ( -1 + 1 ) + ( -1 + 1) + ( -1 + 1) + ...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can see that my series sums up to one whole pie!  So who's right: is it zero pies, one pie, or does the solution simply not exist?  To get it right, you have to ask yourself what happens &lt;i&gt;on average&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/how_to_drive_a_mathematician_c/l.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/how_to_drive_a_mathematician_c/l-thumb-500x375-43825.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="l.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for half of the terms you have a pie, and for the other half of the terms you have &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; pies.  On average?  &lt;b&gt;You have half a pie.&lt;/b&gt;  Even though &lt;i&gt;at no point do you actually have half-a-pie&lt;/i&gt;, this series sums to one-half.  (For more rigor, you might want to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ces%C3%A0ro_summation"&gt;read this&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ... = 1/2.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a hard one to wrap your head around, and many mathematicians and physicists that I knew in graduate school were unable to do it.  Want to try something more ambitious?  Have a go at this one:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 - 8 + ...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%E2%88%92_2_%2B_3_%E2%88%92_4_%2B_%C2%B7%C2%B7%C2%B7"&gt;(Answer here.)&lt;/a&gt;  And if this isn't up your alley, don't worry.  We'll go back to the astrophysics on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/how_to_drive_a_mathematician_c.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269907573316"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/zU5mBPRmmJ8/what_causes_scientifc_miscondu.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ea2aa4e66d98297b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">What causes scientifc misconduct?</title><published>2010-03-29T19:39:14Z</published><updated>2010-03-29T19:39:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/InH3X4H5Okc/what_causes_scientifc_miscondu.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/zU5mBPRmmJ8/what_causes_scientifc_miscondu.php"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">In the last post, we looked at a piece of research on how easy it is to clean up the scientific literature in the wake of retractions or corrections prompted by researcher misconduct in published articles.  Not surprisingly, in the comments on that post there was some speculation about what prompts researchers to commit scientific misconduct in the first place.

As it happens, I've been reading a paper by Mark S. Davis, Michelle Riske-Morris, and Sebastian R. Diaz, titled "Causal Factors Implicated in Research Misconduct: Evidence from ORI Case Files", that tries to get a handle on that very question.

The authors open by making a pitch for serious empirical work on the subject of misconduct:

[P]olicies intended to prevent and control research misconduct would be more effective if informed by a more thorough understanding of the problem's etiology. (396)

If you know what causes X, you ought to have a better chance of being able to create conditions that block X from being caused.  This seems pretty sensible to me.

Yet, the authors note, scientists, policy makers, and others seem perfectly comfortable speculating on the causes of scientific misconduct despite the lack of a well-characterized body of relevant empirical evidence about these causes.  We have plenty of anecdata, but that's not quite what we'd like to have to ground our knowledge claims.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve written now and again about the popular-in-education notion of &amp;quot;learning styles&amp;quot;, which has two parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; that individuals have a preferred modality for taking in new information (auditory, visual and kinaesthetic -- listening, by reading and through pictures, or by moving, touching and doing).  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That students&amp;#39; performance will be improved if the teacher matches the delivery of instruction to the students&amp;#39; preferred modality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both halves of the notion have  been questionable for years, despite extreme popularity with teachers at all levels of education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2009 the journal &lt;a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/index.cfm?journal=pspi&amp;amp;content=pspi/home"&gt;Psychological Science in the Public Interest&lt;/a&gt; published an article reviewing evidence for the second half of the learning styles notion.  Pashler et al. found no evidence that matching teaching modality to an individual&amp;#39;s learning style increased the learner&amp;#39;s educational performance, and recommended that in general the nature of the content to be learned should determine how the material is presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On Feb. 17, 2010, &lt;em&gt;Teacher Journal&lt;/em&gt; published Heather Wolpert-Gawron&amp;#39;s article, &lt;a href="http://www.edweek.org/tm/articles/2010/02/17/tln_wolpertgawron_learningstyles.html"&gt;The Bunk of Debunking Learning Styles&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="http://teacheffectively.com/2010/03/28/response-to-the-de-debunkers/"&gt;Teach Effectively&lt;/a&gt;! showed me the way to this and the rebuttal at &lt;a href="http://cedarsdigest.blogspot.com/2010/02/learning-styles-whats-being-debunked.html"&gt;Cedar&amp;#39;s Digest&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I read her article, and thought she had really misunderstood the Pashler article on several levels: The first was how she illustrated &amp;quot;learning styles&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
• Neil learns better if I’m teaching with the interactive board and totally phases out when we’re reading. &lt;em&gt;I’d really want to know about Neil’s reading level — this may have to do with his difficulty with reading, rather than a “learning style”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Desiree phases out when we’re reading, but as long as someone’s talking about the material, she’s in. &lt;em&gt;Ditto for Desiree&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Tien thrives in the computer lab.&lt;em&gt;Whiskey Tango Foxtrot? What does this mean about Tien’s alleged learning style?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• The entire class wakes up if they stand up.&lt;em&gt;Well, d’oh! It’s well-known that frequent breaks from just sitting and listening increase engagement. It doesn’t have a danged thing to do with the learning styles stuff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Seth has to be doing three things at once or he can’t pay attention at all.&lt;em&gt; Again — what does this have to do with the claims for learning styles?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Armando needs everything to relate to him or he goes over to the Dark Side.&lt;em&gt; That would be middle school, wouldn’t it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Jenny will do anything academic I ask of her as long as I allow her to use a pink pen. &lt;em&gt;Whiskey Tango Foxtrot? What does this mean about Jenny’s alleged learning style?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Brandon will never be given the time of day, and nobody will love his writing like I do, unless he learns to type.&lt;em&gt;Sounds more like Brandon hasn’t learned, or is otherwise unable, to handwrite accurately and legibly. Don’t get me started on handwriting, either in elementary school or in middle school &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Every student loves coming in to find the room looking different.&lt;em&gt; And this is relevant to learning styles…how?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Sarah will only work with Angy, but Fabiola can’t work with Sarah.&lt;em&gt; Welcome to middle school, part deux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Tin will function in a small group, but only one consisting of young ladies.&lt;em&gt; Welcome to middle school, part trois&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is a comment she wrote later, in the response section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I want to continue to reiterate that true, accurate research can be found in many sources. It is dangerous to take scientific research to heart as 100% accurate because there are always studies that maintain with as much vehemence and research the flip side to any study. .... And it is reckless of a study to be published with no flip side acknowledged.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

What? There are &lt;em&gt;always &lt;/em&gt;studies maintaining the opposite position?  Unfortunately,  Wolpert-Gawron doesn&amp;#39;t provide citations or examples to back up this astonishing claim, even limited to the field of education and educational methodologies.  Essentially, what she&amp;#39;s saying is that anybody can and should ignore even impressive research in the field of education, because sooner or later someone will prove the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what? Did Wolpert-Gawron not read the article?  Here&amp;#39;s the passage from Points of Clarification, to which I&amp;#39;ve added emphasis:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although we have argued that the extant data do not provide support for the learning-styles hypothesis, &lt;span style="background-color:#ffff80"&gt;it should be emphasized that we do not claim that the same kind of instruction is most useful in all contexts and with all learners.&lt;/span&gt; An obvious point is that the optimal instructional method is likely to vary across disciplines. For instance, the optimal curriculum for a writing course probably includes a heavy verbal emphasis, whereas the most efﬁcient and effective method of teaching geometry obviously requires visual–spatial materials. Of course, identifying the optimal approach for each discipline is an empirical question, and we espouse research using strong research methods to identify the optimal approach for each kind of sub- ject matter.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Furthermore, it is &lt;span style="background-color:#ffff80"&gt;undoubtedly the case that a particular student will sometimes beneﬁt from having a particular kind of course content presented in one way versus another.&lt;/span&gt; One suspects that educators’ attraction to the idea of learning styles partly reﬂects their (correctly) noticing how often one student may achieve enlightenment from an approach that seems useless for another student. There is, however, a great gap from such heterogeneous responses to instructional manipulations— --whose reality we do not dispute—- to the notion that presently available taxonomies of student types offer any valid help in deciding what kind of instruction to offer each individual. Perhaps future research may demonstrate such linkages, but at present, we ﬁnd no evidence for it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 
Fortunately, the person who blogs at Cedars Digest, who identified himself as a cognitive scientist and a person with many teachers in his immediate family, came to the rescue with an informative post, accessible to lay readers: &lt;a href="http://cedarsdigest.blogspot.com/2010/02/learning-styles-whats-being-debunked.html"&gt;Learning Styles: What&amp;#39;s Being Debunked&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;blockquote&gt;

First, it is necessary to clarify the definition of learning styles and the predictions of learning styles theory. Second, I want to pinpoint what the “debunkers” in question are claiming, which I think is more specific than Ms. Gawron-Wolpert describes. Finally, since she seems to believe that basic science is useless when it comes to the practice of teaching, I want to describe how basic cognitive science can apply to teaching. Although the scientific search for evidence of learning styles has yielded no evidence of their existence, basic psychological science can help teachers, even as it steers clear of dictating exactly what works in any individual classroom. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I recommend Cedar&amp;#39;s post highly.


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
Previously here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2007/08/matching-teachi.html"&gt;Matching Teaching Style to Content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	The idea that people may differ in their ability to learn new material depending on its modality—that is, whether the child hears it, sees it, or touches it—has been tested for over 100 years. And the idea that these differences might prove useful in the classroom has been around for at least 40 years.
	
	
	&lt;p&gt;
	
	What cognitive science has taught us is that children do differ in their abilities with different modalities, but teaching the child in his best modality doesn’t affect his educational achievement. &lt;strong&gt;What does matter is whether the child is taught in the content’s best modality.&lt;/strong&gt; All students learn more when content drives the choice of modality. In this column, I will describe some of the research on matching modality strength to the modality of instruction. I will also address why the idea of tailoring instruction to a student’s best modality is so enduring—despite substantial evidence that it is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="20militia-cnd-popup" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/20militia-cnd-popup.jpg?w=481&amp;amp;h=309" alt="" width="481" height="309"&gt;Fig 1.  The militia.  Check out &lt;a href="http://hutaree.com/"&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.hutaree.com/forum/"&gt;Discussion groups&lt;/a&gt; include “Chaplain’s Corner” and “Evil Jew Forum”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Web site, which describes the group as “preparing for the end  times,” featured video clips of people running through woods in  camouflage gear and firing assault rifles, along with links to gun  stores and far-right media. It also features an elaborate system of  military ranks for its members. The site says it coined the term  Hutaree, intended to mean Christian warrior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jesus wanted us to be ready to defend ourselves using the sword and  stay alive using equipment,” the Web site says, adding, “The Hutaree  will one day see its enemy and meet him on the battlefield if so God  wills it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are &lt;a href="http://www.hutaree.com/rank.html"&gt;the ranks in their militia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;RADOK [RD]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BORAMANDER [BM]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZULIF [ZL]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARKON [AK]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOLD RIFLEMAN [GR]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SILVER RIFLEMAN [SR]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRONZE RIFLEMAN [BR]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LUKORE [LK]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MASTER GUNNER [MG]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SENIOR GUNNER [SG]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GUNNER [GN]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PARABLES OF THE SOLDIER Ranking officers and commanders; serve your men for you lead them; humble before your team. Cause you may be a leader of flesh but in heaven leaders are of spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOW RANKING SOLDIERS AND GRUNTS Respect the officer above you and obey your commander with dignity. Each man holds his place in flesh and spirit, heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t blame this one on religion; to do that, you’d have to assume that if there were no faith, these people would be law-abiding citizens.  I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds wonderful, yes?!  It was fun.  No doubt about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the weather did not want to cooperate…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus must hate us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the upside, we visited a place at Epcot Center called Club Cool, which offers free tastes of Coca-Cola products around the world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a nasty little beverage called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_(drink)"&gt;Beverly&lt;/a&gt; from Italy in the mix.  No one should ever drink it.  Unless your friends tell you to try it, in which case, you have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it, a few high school students were there and they decided to take two shots each of that garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just egged them on and got out my camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because that’s what good teachers do when students are about to do something really dumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as any clinician knows, it’s much easier to get someone to take something than to eliminate something.  Lifestyle modification is difficult, but achievable to a degree as experience has shown with cholesterol, smoking, and other modifiable risk factors.  A recent study in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; evaluated what the possible effect would be of lowering U.S. sodium consumption to 3g/day.  The authors found that, “Modest reductions in dietary salt could substantially&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;reduce cardiovascular events and medical costs and should be&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;a public health target.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really could be that simple: a combination of education and regulation could save lives and money.  And you would think the altmed folks could get behind something like this.  But taking simple, cheap recommendations and turning them into something “alternative” (and profitable) is a specialty of modern shamans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example of this is a “holistic family practice” in the Midwest U.S. From the FAQs on their website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q:Should I eliminate salt in my diet?&lt;br&gt;
A:The correct form of salt is an extremely important substance for our body. There is a big difference between refined salt and unrefined salt. As I discuss in &lt;a href="https://www.drbrownstein.com/bookstore_Salt.php"&gt;Salt: Your Way To Health&lt;/a&gt;, refined salt is a toxic substance that needs to be avoided. Refined salt has no minerals and is contaminated with substances such as ferrocyanide. Unrefined salt has over 80 minerals in it. I have found unrefined salt a wonderful addition to a healthy holistic regimen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And, to make your life easier, he sells just the right salt.  One of his special salts is called “&lt;a href="http://storesense.paradata.dxstorm.com/centerforholisticmedicine/Detail.bok?no=60"&gt;Celtic Sea Salt”,&lt;/a&gt; which, at $6.00/lb, “balances the body and can help with adrenal exhuastion, low blood pressure, and mineral deficiencies.”  Links to evidence?  None.  Price of typical American table salt? Less than a dollar per pound (not that you should be using added salt in any significant quantity anyway).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From Goffredi et al., 2004.

In the deep sea, no carcass goes to waste. Platoons of crabs, fish, and other scavengers make short work of most of the bodies which come to rest on the sea bottom, but every now and then the carrion-eaters are presented with a rotting bonanza; a whale fall. Muscle, viscera, blubber, and bone; it all gets broken down, but it takes so long that the whale carcass actually provides a temporary home for a variety of organisms which utilize the whale body in different ways. One, a worm called Osedax, actually makes it home within whale bones, and a new study published in the journal Palaios reveals that worms have been doing so for millions of years.

&lt;p&gt;It's strange, but over the weekend we've had several threads top out over the magical 666 comment mark that I use as a signal to kill threads. There's the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/episode_xliii_fierce_predators.php"&gt;ever-expanding endless thread&lt;/a&gt;, of course, but also the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/sins_of_omission.php"&gt;Sins of omission&lt;/a&gt; thread, which is now being closed, and the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/these_guys_are_dangerous_nuts.php"&gt;These guys are dangerous nuts&lt;/a&gt; thread, which bloomed into chaos thanks to the wild and wacky Graeme Bird, who now, temporarily, has his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/the_graeme_bird_memorial_threa.php"&gt;own thread&lt;/a&gt; (I anticipate an imminent flameout and permanent eviction).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that one thread no longer has the capacity to contain the raging ebullience of Pharyngulistas?

There are nuts like this scattered all over the place; they collect guns, dress up in military gear, and play war games in the woods. They have no chance of succeeding in their aims, but are so delusional the believe they are the vanguard of a coming revolution. Why? &lt;i&gt;Because God tells them so&lt;/i&gt;. These fanatics are typically deeply immersed in Christian End Times mythology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hutaree.com/About%20Us.html"&gt;Read their statement about their aims&lt;/a&gt;. They are &lt;span&gt;"Preparing for the end time battles to keep the testimony of Jesus Christ alive"&lt;/span&gt; — by making pipe bombs and planning acts of terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's wonderful that the &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/3/29/852032/-Breaking-Militia-raids-were-over-plot-to-levy-war-against-the-US-Government"&gt;government is finally treating these kooks as what they are&lt;/a&gt;: dangerous, seditious criminals. But one thing you have to recognize is that there are a lot of Americans who think losers like them are simply heroic. If you look at the &lt;a href="http://www.freep.com/comments/article/20100328/NEWS06/100328017/Fed-raids-in-Michigan-may-be-tied-to-Hutaree-a-Christian-militia-group"&gt;comments on the Freep article&lt;/a&gt;, there are lots of critics — I think it&amp;#39;s a good sign that more and more people are getting vocal in ridiculing the militia hate groups — but there are also lots of crazies. Here&amp;#39;s a sample:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just once I wish the Michigan Militia would bring out the multiple 50 clibe3r machine guns they own and teach Obama's Gestapos they phucked with the wrong group of sheep. My weapon gets confiscated only from my cold dead fingers. Would someone please read article two of our US constitution to these looney toon Democrats? before we start the revolution again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Feds--Concentate your investigations on the Politicians of The city of Detroit.You guys start fooling with the Militia,your going to get another Oklahoma City&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These raids are likely trying to "stave off" an announcement due Mon, Mar 29, regarding the total dissolution of the U.S. Corporation which has been ignoring the constitution, and reverting our country back to the original REPUBLIC in which it was founded. We become "sovereign citizens" who control our govt, and not vice versa. All 50 states were served papers, plus the military and Supreme Court on Friday. The military is onboard. This means freedom FINALLY for all Americans from the IRS and many other wonderful changes. It appears "the powers that be" and the Rockefellers don't want to lose their vice grip, thus the raidsprior to Monday's announcement of the changes. Each person in office must take an oath to the common law and the constitution, or be fired immediately. Many brave citizens behind the scenes have helped in this effort to free us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More gun-waving psychos, more terrorist threats, and more delusional nonsense. This is what we get for keeping the citizenry stupid and ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, it is Monday, 29 March. I await the announcement of the dissolution of the US.&lt;/p&gt;

Alas, it’s been quiet since November, so we’re left to our own devices.  For some reason or another I was reading about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism"&gt;Scholasticism&lt;/a&gt;, the dominant approach to teaching and learning in medieval Europe.  Its early days came to pass during the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Renaissance"&gt;Carolingian Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; in the late 700’s under Charlemagne.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides uniting Central Europe, Charlemagne was also a patron of learning, and used his influence to bring scholars from across the continent to his court.  Most importantly, he recognized that the decline of literacy and the splintering of Latin into mutually incomprehensible regional dialects caused difficulties for the administration of an empire, so he ordered that every abbey in his domain should start a school.  The idea of widespread schooling was a novel one at the time, and the long-term impact of this decision is probably incalculable.  Sure, most of the scholarship may have been devoted to the interpretation of classic texts rather than the production of new knowledge, but you have to think that all that learning helped lay the groundwork for the eventual climb out of the Dark Ages.  Start people thinking, and you never know where they will go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Raban-Maur_Alcuin_Otgar.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/03/220px-Raban-Maur_Alcuin_Otgar.jpg" alt="Alcuin" title="Alcuin" width="220" height="226"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  So I was especially fascinated to read about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin"&gt;Alcuin of York&lt;/a&gt;, one of Charlemagne’s greatest scholars.  He was a respected teacher in Northumbria before being brought to court, where he had an enormous effect on the scholarship — establishing the liberal arts (the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivium_%28education%29"&gt;trivium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrivium"&gt;quadrivium&lt;/a&gt;) as the basis for the curriculum, and convincing Charlemagne not to put pagans to death if they refused to convert.  He also produced a textbook of math problems with solutions, from which we learn that medieval word problems were more colorful than those we have today — these include &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_three_jealous_husbands"&gt;the problem of the three jealous husbands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox,_goose_and_bag_of_beans_puzzle"&gt;the problem of the wolf, goat and cabbage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s clear to me what Alcuin’s greatest achievement really was: he’s the guy who invented &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule"&gt;lower case letters&lt;/a&gt;.  Can you imagine a world in which everything was written in ALL CAPS?  Every time we read a crazy person ranting on the internet, we should give thanks to Alcuin that not everybody sounds like that.  &lt;/p&gt;

I still haven't had time to read it, but I &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2208"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; to look up the business about the &lt;em&gt;dorsal premammillary nucleus&lt;/em&gt;, so here goes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You'll recall that Dr. Brizendine's opinion piece at cnn.com  ("&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/03/23/brizendine.male.brain/index.html"&gt;Love, sex, and the male brain&lt;/a&gt;", 3/24/2010) asserted that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Our brains are mostly alike. We are the same species, after all. But the differences can sometimes make it seem like we are worlds apart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The "defend your turf" area — dorsal premammillary nucleus — is larger in the male brain and contains special circuits to detect territorial challenges by other males. And his amygdala, the alarm system for threats, fear and danger is also larger in men. These brain differences make men more alert than women to potential turf threats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Vaughan Bell at Mind Hacks &lt;a href="http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/2010/03/brizendine_true_to_.html"&gt;countered&lt;/a&gt; that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Male and female humans are indeed the same species, but we are not a species which has a dorsal premammillary nucleus because it's only been &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&amp;amp;orig_db=PubMed&amp;amp;term=%22dorsal%20premammillary%20nucleus%22&amp;amp;cmd=search"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; in the rat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Furthermore, there is no reliable evidence that amygdala size differs between the sexes in humans and a recent &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20227858"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that looked specifically at this issue found no difference.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His link with respect to amygdala size was specific (J. Brabec et al., "Volumetry of the human amygdala - An anatomical study", &lt;em&gt;Psychiatry Res&lt;/em&gt; 2010), and completely contradicted Brizendine's assertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the case of the dorsal premammillary nucleus, Vaughan could give only a link to a PubMed search, which might perhaps have missed something; so I wondered what specific support Brizendine might have cited in the book for this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, &lt;em&gt;The Male Brain&lt;/em&gt; displays the same impressive flourish of endnotes and references as &lt;em&gt;The Female Brain&lt;/em&gt; did. It has 135 pages of text, 41 pages of endnotes, and 83 pages of references.  I'll be interested to see whether the notes and references are related to the claims in the text in the same way. In several tedious posts (e.g. &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003530.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003565.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003541.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), I followed up the notes and references behind specific claims in &lt;em&gt;The Female Brain&lt;/em&gt;, and found a surprising lack of relevant connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how much more of such sleuthing I've got the energy for, but I promised to check out that dorsal premammillary nucleus, so here goes. (Regular readers won't be surprised to learn that this turns out to be another beautiful example of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1378"&gt;Explanatory Neurophilia&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Male Brain&lt;/em&gt;'s index gives us these page references for &lt;em&gt;dorsal premammillary nucleus&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;emotional lives of men and, 110, 111, 170-71&lt;br&gt;
function of, xv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;Pages xv-xvi are a picture of "The Male Brain" with ten areas singled out for attention. The header says that
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Scientists think of brain areas like the ACC, TPJ, and RCZ ad being "hubs" of brain activation, sending electrical signals to other areas of the brain, causing behaviors to occur or not occur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third of the ten key areas (maybe more later on the nine others) is listed this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;3. DORSAL PREMAMMILLARY NUCLEUS (DPN): The defend-your-turf area, it lies deep inside the hypothalamus and contains the circuitry for a male's instinctive one-upmanship, territorial defense, fear, and aggression. It's larger in males than in females and  contains special circuits to detect territorial challenges by other males, making men more sensitive to potential turf threats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no endnotes for this section. A quick check of the literature reveals that the DPN in rats is involved in a number of things that have nothing to do with intra-species turf defense, e.g. as described in D. Caroline Blanchard et al., "&lt;a href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~blanchar/downloads/pdf_files/2000/pmd_differentially.pdf"&gt;Dorsal premammillary nucleus differentially modulates defensive behaviors induced by different threat stimuli in rats&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Neuroscience Letters&lt;/em&gt; 345:145-148, 2003:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Lesions of the dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd) have been reported to produce dramatic reductions in responsivity of rats to a live cat. Such lesions provide a means of analyzing the potentially differential neural systems involved in different defensive behaviors, and the relationship between these systems and concepts such as anxiety. Rats with bilateral electrolytic lesions of the PMd were run in an elevated plus maze (EPM), exposed first to cat odor and then to a live cat, and assessed for postshock freezing and locomotion. PMd lesions produced a dramatic reduction in freezing, avoidance, and stretch attend to the cat odor stimulus, and reduction in freezing, with greater activity, and enhanced stretch approach to cat exposure. However, PMd lesions had minimal effects in the EPM, and postshock freezing scores were unchanged. These results confirm earlier findings of reduced defensiveness of PMd-lesioned rats to a cat, extending the pattern of reduced defensiveness to cat odor stimuli as well, but also suggest that such lesions have few effects on nonolfactory threat stimuli.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the DPN is involved in rats&amp;#39; (passive) defensive responses to the presence of a cat, or even just to cat odor, but not to other sorts of threats such as the open arms of a maze, or an electric shock to the foot,  where odor is not involved. Thus the DPN is more (and also less) than &amp;quot;the defend-your-turf area&amp;quot; in rats — it responds to predator threats as well as threats from dominant conspecifics, but it&amp;#39;s apparently not involved in more active or aggressive forms of defense. Who knows what its homologue&amp;#39;s functions are in humans –  but presumably the mediation of instinctive &amp;quot;freezing, avoidance, and stretch&amp;quot; responses to cat odor are not among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;Page 110 of &lt;em&gt;The Male Brain&lt;/em&gt; tells us:
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Evolutionary biologists suggest that behaviors like bluffing, posturing, and fighting have evolved to protect males, especially from opponents within their own species. Instinctive male-male competition and hierarchical fighting is driven by both hormones and brain circuits. A special area in the male brain's hypothalamus, the dorsal premammillary nucleus, or DPN, has been discovered, in rats, to contain circuitry for this instinctive one-upmanship. In humans, this one-upmanship and drive for status-seeking is found in men worldwide; it's not just a habit or a cultural tradition but more like a design feature of the male brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here (unlike in the earlier passage) the DPN size business is explicitly linked to research on rat brains, and the connection to human males is made only by implication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The endnotes (p. 170) give us this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;110 &lt;em&gt;circuitry for this instinctive one-upmanship&lt;/em&gt;: Motta 2009 found an area in the male brain's hypothalamus, called the DPN, is activated for instinctive one-upmanship in male rats for territory protection against higher-ranking males.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's S.C. Motta and M. Goto, "&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2660765/"&gt;Dissecting the brain's fear system reveals the hypothalamus is critical for responding in subordinate conspecific intruders&lt;/a&gt;", PNAS 106(12):4870-75, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this study notes, lesion studies had previously established that (in rats) "the site most responsive to predatory threats" (specifically, cats) is "the tiny dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMD)", though other parts of the hypothalamus are also involved. Motta and Goto's contribution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The experiments reported here were designed to test the hypothesis that the hypothalamus also plays a critical role in the processing and expression of fear responses to another natural danger—a dominant conspecific. For this, hypothalamic activation in response to a predator or a dominant conspecific was compared and it was shown that the PMD is critical for fear expression in both situations, supporting a critical role for the hypothalamus in both responses. Furthermore, despite similar behavior patterns displayed in both threatening situations, predator and dominant conspecific threats are processed by differentiable components of the fear system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dependent variable that they looked at was not "activation" in the sense of direct measures of electrical activity, but rather upregulation of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Fos"&gt;protein product Fos&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, the PMD (their acronym for the dorsal premammillary nucleus) is the part of the hypothalamus most similarly affected by the threats posed by predators and by dominant conspecifics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Hypothalamic patterns of neuronal activation are thus strikingly different in animals exposed to a natural predator or a dominant conspecific, although they are not entirely separate. In particular, the PMD was clearly activated in both experimental groups. Careful anatomical inspection indicates, however, that PMD activation patterns are not identical in the 2 groups. Cell count analysis confirms that exposure to a predator or a dominant conspecific massively induces Fos upregulation in the PMD (F3,21 = 129.9, P &amp;lt; 0.0001) and that, whereas predator exposure upregulation is centered in ventrolateral regions of the PMD (PMDvl), upregulation following exposure to a conspecific resident is centered in dorsomedial regions of the nucleus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what we have — in male rats — is that the DPN is activated by threats from cats and from dominant conspecifics; and that the (overlapping) effects of these two threats are centered in slightly different parts of the (&amp;quot;tiny&amp;quot;) DPN, with the effect of the alpha rats being centered in dorsomedial (as opposed to ventrolateral) regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a long ways from identifying the DPN, even in rats, as "&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;the defend-your-turf area&lt;/span&gt;" that "&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;contains the circuitry for a male's instinctive one-upmanship, territorial defense, fear, and aggression&lt;/span&gt;", especially because the rat-response involved (to both predators and dominant conspecifics) is "freezing" or other passive defense reactions, not "boxing" or other aggressive or active defense behaviors, much less the general pattern of "bluffing, posturing, and fighting" that Brizendine attributes to this brain region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(By the way, I'm also somewhat taken aback by the unsupported assertion that "drive for status-seeking" is "a design feature of the &lt;strong&gt;male&lt;/strong&gt; brain&amp;quot;, given years of science and fiction suggesting — if anything — the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becky_Sharp"&gt;opposite sexual stereotype&lt;/a&gt;. For a survey of one set of issues in the linguistic area, see Elizabeth Gordon, "&lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4168749"&gt;Sex, speech and stereotypes: Why women use prestige speech forms more than men&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Language in Society&lt;/em&gt; 26:47-63, 1997. As a crude check on the validity of the cross-cultural concept here, a search on Google Scholar for &lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;q=male+status-seeking&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;as_sdt=800000000000&amp;amp;as_ylo=&amp;amp;as_vis=0"&gt;male status-seeking&lt;/a&gt; returns 2,220 items, while a search for &lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;q=female+status-seeking&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;as_sdt=800000000000&amp;amp;as_ylo=&amp;amp;as_vis=0"&gt;female status-seeking&lt;/a&gt; returns 2,050 — a random example being &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;q=female+status-seeking&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;as_sdt=800000000000&amp;amp;as_ylo=&amp;amp;as_vis=0"&gt;Empirical Tests of Status Consumption: Evidence from Women's Cosmetics&lt;/a&gt;".)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;Page 111 tells us the story of "Neil", a patient who is anxious about the fact that the president of his firm has decided to retire:
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;If we could peek back into Neil's brain in this atmosphere of unstable hierarchy, we'd see what was causing his emotional roller-coaster ride. When he thought his prospects for VP looked promising, we'd see his brain area for anticipating rewards activating, and he'd feel good. But when he thought George might get the promotion, we'd see his territoriality circuits in the DPN activating, and he'd feel haunted by the threat of losing face and forfeiting his place in the hierarchy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that he&amp;#39;s a rat, that is, and that he&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;freezing&amp;quot; because a dominant rat has entered his cage. (In fact, Neil&amp;#39;s turmoil is caused by the fact that the dominant male is leaving the cage, thus putting the status hierarchy in doubt — Brizendine doesn&amp;#39;t cite any studies that show DPN activation in rats as a result of status uncertainty.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no new footnotes for this passage — Brizendine has simply transferred some partly-analogous research from rats, where her interpretation is oversimplified and over-interpreted, to men, where we have no idea whatsoever whether Neil&amp;#39;s DPN is playing any special role at all in his turmoil, and certainly no idea whether it&amp;#39;s playing a sex-specific role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;Pages 170-171: Page 170 contains the note relevant to page 110, discussed above. Page 171 contains notes to pages 112-113 of the text, none of which say anything whatever about the DPN.
&lt;hr&gt;So I&amp;#39;m afraid that Vaughan Bell was right — Louann Brizendine&amp;#39;s assertions in her CNN piece about the DPN are based entirely on rat research. I think he might have gone too far in asserting that this structure &amp;quot;[has] only been identified in the rat&amp;quot;. At least, if I understand Clifford B. Saper, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-012547626-3/50018-1"&gt;Hypothalamus&lt;/a&gt;", chapter 17 (pp. 513-550) in &lt;em&gt;The Human Nervous System&lt;/em&gt;, 2004, there's a homologous region in the human brain (though I can't figure out for sure whether the same name is used). But there seems to be no evidence as to whether its size is sexually differentiated, and what functions it might have.
&lt;p&gt;In another respect, Vaughan didn't go far enough in calling her claims into question, since even if men and women were exactly like male and female rats in the relevant respects, she'd be elevating to the status of "the defend-your-turf area" a brain region that mediates freezing reactions to cat odor (but not non-smell-related threats) and similar passive reactions to (the smell of?) dominant conspecifics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In thinking about these things, I recommend taking a look at Geert de Vries &amp;amp; Per Södersten, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2009.03.012"&gt;Sex differences in the brain: The relation between structure and function&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Hormones and Behavior&lt;/em&gt; 55(5):589-596, 2009. Their abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In the fifty years since the organizational hypothesis was proposed, many sex differences have been found in behavior as well as structure of the brain that depend on the organizational effects of gonadal hormones early in development. Remarkably, in most cases we do not understand how the two are related. This paper makes the case that overstating the magnitude or constancy of sex differences in behavior and too narrowly interpreting the functional consequences of structural differences are significant roadblocks in resolving this issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They close with this observation on "The dual function hypothesis":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In prairie voles, the presence of a sex difference in the brain clearly does not correlate with the size of a sex difference in behavior. The species with the largest sex difference in VP [vasopressin] innervation reported to date shows some of the least conspicuous sex differences in social behavior. Apparently, the sex difference in VP can cause as well as prevent sex difference in social behavior. Because there is no reason that this dual function is VP's prerogative, we suggested that in general sex differences in brain structure may cause as well as prevent sex differences in specific behaviors or centrally regulated functions. This dual function hypothesis is perfectly testable. To take the VP system as an example, one would predict in the former case, that blocking VP neurotransmission would blunt or eliminate sex differences and in the latter case that the same treatment would cause a sex difference that wasn't there before. In fact, such tests have already been done; treatment with a VP antagonist blocked social recognition memory in male but not in female rats, thereby creating a new sex difference.

&lt;p&gt;Observant reader Chris Helzer saw an albino squirrel outside the National Museum of Natural History a few days &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/26/polymorphism-in-vertebrates/#comments"&gt;after I did&lt;/a&gt;, and got a much better picture of it, which he has kindly allowed me to post here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;img title="Albino gray squirrel outside the USNM, Washington, DC, 28 March 2010." src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/albino-squirrel-dc-mall.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albino gray squirrel outside the USNM, Washington, DC, 28 March 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the same squirrel I saw, and it seems to be on the same tree. In Chris’s much better picture you can see the pink eye, showing that it is a true albino, not merely albinistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE.&lt;/strong&gt; I came across &lt;a href="http://chickenoreggblog.wordpress.com/2009/07/30/white-squirrels/"&gt;this posting&lt;/a&gt; at The Chicken or the Egg blog about white squirrels at the &lt;a href="http://www.mcz.harvard.edu/"&gt;Museum of Comparative Zoology&lt;/a&gt;, my (and Jerry’s) alma mater. It seems that white squirrels have an affinity for natural history museums. Note that the MCZ white squirrel is albinistic, not true albino (it has a dark eye). Chicken also links to this wonderful site, the &lt;a href="http://www.whitesquirrelinstitute.whitesquirrelfestival.com/"&gt;White Squirrel Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, devoted to the white squirrels of Brevard, North Carolina. The Brevard squirrels, like the MCZ ones, are also albinistic rather than albino.&lt;/p&gt;

No matter how much evidence is arrayed against it, its spokespeople always finds a way to spin, distort, or misrepresent the evidence to combat it and not have to give up the concept that vaccines cause autism. Not that this is any news to readers of this blog, but it bears repeating often. It also bears repeating and emphasizing examples of just the sort of disingenuous and even outright deceptive techniques used by promoters of anti-vaccine pseudoscience to sow fear and doubt about vaccines among parents. These arguments may seem persuasive to those who have little knowledge about science or epidemiology. Sometimes they even seemed somewhat persuasive to me; that is, at least until I actually took the time to look into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of such a myth is the claim that “vaccines didn’t save us,” also sometimes going under the claim that “vaccines don’t work.” The anti-vaccine website Vaccine Liberation has a large set of &lt;a href="http://www.vaclib.org/sites/debate/web1.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;graphs&lt;/a&gt; purporting to show that the death rates of several vaccine-preventable diseases, including whooping cough, diptheria, measles, and polio were falling before the vaccines for each disease were introduced. The the article quotes Andrew Weil:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific medicine has taken credit it does not deserve for some advances in health. Most people believe that victory over the infectious diseases of the last century came with the invention of immunisations. In fact, cholera, typhoid, tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough, etc, were in decline before vaccines for them became available – the result of better methods of sanitation, sewage disposal, and distribution of food and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Maher has &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1251"&gt;said similar things&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines, and the “vaccines didn’t save us” gambit has become a staple of anti-vaccine websites. For example, one particularly &lt;a href="http://www.harvestdream.org/index.php?/archives/431-GRAPHICAL-EVIDENCE-SHOWS-VACCINES-DIDNT-SAVE-US.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;ignorant blogger&lt;/a&gt; wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mythology surrounding vaccines is still pervasive, the majority of the population still believes, in faith like fashion, that vaccines are the first line of defense against disease. The true story is that nutrition and psychological/emotional health are the first line of defense against disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are a concoction of chemical adjuvants and preservatives coupled with virus fragments and have clearly been implicated in the astounding rise in neurological disorders around the world, yet the ‘popular’ media has embedded itself as a spokesperson for the pharmaceutical cartel and simply does not report in any responsible way the real situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, yes, the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9"&gt;“toxins” gambit&lt;/a&gt;! Of course, it is true that better sanitation is a good thing and has decreased the rate of transmission of some diseases for which sanitation can do so, many infectious diseases are transmitted person-to-person through the air from aerosolized drops of saliva from coughs and sneezes or from being deposited on objects that people touch frequently, like doorknobs and other &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomite"&gt;fomites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “vaccines didn’t save us” strategy is a distortion, as I will show. The best way to demonstrate this is to go on to the very first website that currently shows up on a Google search for “&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=vaccines+didn&amp;#39;t+save+us&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8"&gt;vaccines didn’t save us&lt;/a&gt;.” Although the post is from November, it’s the main post that’s been spreading this lie since then. Entitled &lt;a href="http://genesgreenbook.com/content/proof-vaccines-didnt-save-us" rel="nofollow"&gt;Proof That Vaccines Didn’t Save Us&lt;/a&gt;, it’s one of the most breathtakingly spectacularly intellectually dishonest bits of anti-vaccine propaganda that I’ve ever seen. I say that not because it uses a common anti-vaccine distortion, but rather because it ups the ante by adding a new one clearly designed to address the criticism of the old one. That new distortion hides it in plain sight, too, which is why I have to give the blogger props for sheer &lt;em&gt;chutzpah&lt;/em&gt;. Actually, I have to give some backhanded kudos to the person who devised the graphs used in this post, Raymond Obomsawin, PhD. They represent the classic anti-vaccine lie, combined with some very clever cherry picking. I won’t take them all on in this post. Maybe I’ll take some of them on in a future post. In the meantime, what I will do is to take on the first several, because they represent a common anti-vaccine theme that is very similar to the one &lt;a href="http://www.vaclib.org/sites/debate/web1.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;sounded by the this disingenuous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, let’s look at the &lt;a href="http://www.vaclib.org/sites/debate/web1.html"&gt;Vaccination Library claims &lt;/a&gt;first. Notice that there are six graphs, four of which are for vaccine-preventable diseases for which widespread vaccination was undertaken, two for which it was not. All of them show decreasing death rates from various diseases. Wow! It seems like slam dunk evidence, doesn’t it? Vaccines didn’t save us! After all, death rates were declining years before the vaccine, and they were declining for the diseases that didn’t even need a vaccine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death rates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the problem. It’s not surprising that &lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt; rates were declining before introduction of the vaccines. Medicine was improving. More importantly, supportive care was improving. For example, take the case of polio. Before the introduction of the iron lung and its widespread use, for example, if a polio patient developed paralysis of the respiratory muscles, he would almost certainly die. The iron lung allowed such patients to live. Some even survived in an iron lung for decades. No doubt improved nutrition also played a role as well. However, if you want to get an idea of the impact of vaccines on infectious disease, take a look at this &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/6mishome.htm#Diseaseshadalready"&gt;graph&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC of measles incidence, not death rates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/6mishome.htm#Diseaseshadalready"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Measles_incidence-cdc.gif" alt="CDC Measles Incidence Graph" title="Measles_incidence-cdc" width="380" height="230"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar results were seen most recently from several other vaccines, including  the Haemophilus influenza type B vaccine, as the &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/6mishome.htm#Diseaseshadalready"&gt;CDC points out&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hib vaccine is another good example, because Hib disease was prevalent until just a few years ago, when conjugate vaccines that can be used for infants were finally developed. (The polysaccharide vaccine previously available could not be used for infants, in whom most cases of the disease were occurring.) Since sanitation is not better now than it was in 1990, it is hard to attribute the virtual disappearance of Haemophilus influenzae disease in children in recent years (from an estimated 20,000 cases a year to 1,419 cases in 1993, and dropping) to anything other than the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the post to which I referred, the most &lt;a href="http://genesgreenbook.com/content/proof-vaccines-didnt-save-us"&gt;intellectually dishonest graph&lt;/a&gt; is this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FakeMeaslesGraph.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FakeMeaslesGraph-226x300.jpg" alt="Fake Measles Graph" title="FakeMeaslesGraph" width="226" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(Click to see full size figure.)
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how this graph, unlike all the other graphs used to make the claim that “vaccines didn’t save us” actually uses &lt;em&gt;incidence&lt;/em&gt; data, in this case from Canada from 1935 to 1983. I was immediately suspicious of this graph, though. The reason should be obvious; the decline in measles incidence is far too smooth. Measles incidence typically varies greatly from year to year. Fortunately, in his &lt;em&gt;chutzpah&lt;/em&gt;, Obomsawin included a link to the actual source of the graph. Naturally, I couldn’t resist checking it out, and I found that the link leads to the &lt;a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/cig-gci/p04-meas-roug-eng.php"&gt;Canadian Immunization Guide section on the measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. And this is the actual graph from which Obomsawin allegedly extracted his data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/MeaslesCanada.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/MeaslesCanada-300x197.gif" alt="MeaslesCanada" title="MeaslesCanada" width="300" height="197"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(Click for full-sized version.)
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how Obomsawin left out a section of ten years when measles was not nationally reportable. Also note how he has, to be charitable, cherry picked the years to produce the impression of a smoothly declining measles incidence from 1935 to 1959. As I said, it doesn’t get much more intellectually dishonest than that. But it’s even worse than that. The graph above still gives the impression that measles incidence was falling before the ten years for which there is no data. Steve Novella points out that there is a &lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/30075860"&gt;better version of the graph in this reference&lt;/a&gt;, and he was kind enough to send it to me, given that, for whatever reason, my university doesn’t have a subscription to the relevant journal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/measles-canada.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/measles-canada-300x208.jpg" alt="measles canada" title="measles canada" width="300" height="208"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(Click for full-sized version.)
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how this graph looks at raw case numbers and shows 40,000 cases of measles in Canada the year before the ten year interruption in the data. All in all, it’s a much clearer representation of the data than the first graph, showing a clear drop that occurred during the ten year period, in the middle of which the measles vaccine was introduced. It also shows another obvious drop in measles incidence later on in the 1990s, when the two-dose measles vaccine program was started. As for why it appears that there is a steep dip in the first graph before the ten year gap, that actually appears to be an artifact. There is no data for 1959, the first year that measles was not nationally reportable in Canada, but the line appears to go to a datapoint at 1959 or 1960. My guess is that whoever made the graph decided to set the value for  the beginning of the ten year gap to equal the first datapoint at the end of the ten year gap. In other words, the graph a rather poor representation of the data, and the Canadian government would do well to replace it on its website with something more like the second graph, which makes the point much more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As intellectually dishonest as Obomsawin’s graph is, this description of Obomsawin matches it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has produced academically and/or professionally over eighty-five (85) articles, reports, policy documents, presentations, and publications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%22Obomsawin%20R%22%5BAuthor%5D"&gt;search of Pubmed&lt;/a&gt; reveals only one peer-reviewed publication from 1978, and it’s only a commentary. In any case, apparently served as Director National Office of Health Development of the National Indian Brotherhood (AFN); Founding Chairman of NIB’s National Commission Inquiry on Indian Health; Executive Director in the California Rural Indian Health Board; Supervisor of Native Curriculum, Government of the Yukon Territory; and Evaluation Manager – Department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada. None of these are scientific positions. More tellingly, he is “currently engaged with government funding as Senior Researcher relative to establishing a Public Sector Policy on Traditional Medicine in Canada.” My translation? He’s somehow managed to get a government grant to try to promote “traditional medicine” in Canada. Apparently, the Canadian government has its own problems with government money going to promote unscientific and pseudoscientific nonsense of the type that NCCAM promotes. In any case, besides Obomsawin’s disingenuous and intellectually bankrupt distortions of incidence data used to serve his apparently anti-vaccine agenda, he has no qualifications to speak of with regard to science or epidemiology that I can find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also turns out that Dr. Obomsawin has some other–shall we say?–unconventional beliefs as well. For instance, he is &lt;a href="http://www.whale.to/a/obomsawin2.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;approvingly featured&lt;/a&gt; on that aggregator of all things quackery and pseudoscience, Whale.to, where he expresses anti-vaccine views, HIV/AIDS denialism, and admiration for &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/News/rife.html"&gt;Royal Rife&lt;/a&gt;. So what we have here is a woo-meister using cherry picked points on a graph to give a false impression that the measles vaccine was not responsible for the dramatic decline in measles incidence in Canada in the 1960s. Shocking, I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another rebuttal to the idea that vaccines didn’t reduce the incidence of the diseases against which they were designed comes from the simple observation that, as vaccine uptake falls, the disease vaccinated against returns. Always. This is &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/6mishome.htm#Diseaseshadalready"&gt;described by the CDC&lt;/a&gt; quite well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can look at the experiences of several developed countries after they let their immunization levels drop. Three countries – Great Britain, Sweden, and Japan – cut back the use of pertussis vaccine because of fear about the vaccine. The effect was dramatic and immediate. In Great Britain, a drop in pertussis vaccination in 1974 was followed by an epidemic of more than 100,000 cases of pertussis and 36 deaths by 1978. In Japan, around the same time, a drop in vaccination rates from 70% to 20%-40% led to a jump in pertussis from 393 cases and no deaths in 1974 to 13,000 cases and 41 deaths in 1979. In Sweden, the annual incidence rate of pertussis per 100,000 children 0-6 years of age increased from 700 cases in 1981 to 3,200 in 1985. It seems clear from these experiences that not only would diseases not be disappearing without vaccines, but if we were to stop vaccinating, they would come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom is an excellent illustration of this trend. Back in the mid-1990s, it declared measles as under control, thanks to the MMR vaccine. Then came Andrew Wakefield in 1998 with his trial lawyer-funded, incompetent, and possibly even fraudulent study claiming to link the MMR vaccine to “autistic enterocolitis,’ and a credulous, sensationalistic British press to spread his message that the MMR vaccine causes autism. The result was that measles came roaring back in the U.K. to the point that two years ago measles was &lt;a href="http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=18919"&gt;declared endemic again&lt;/a&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vaccine Liberation graphs and the even more deceptive graphs produced by “Dr.” Obomsawin to claim that vaccine-preventable diseases were already plummeting before the introduction of the relevant vaccines are typical of anti-vaccine arguments. First, they contain enough of a grain of truth to them to sound plausible. After all, better nutrition and better sanitation have in general contributed to better health and contributed to a decreasing toll from various infectious diseases. But they were not enough. Indeed, part of the reason we vaccinated against some diseases is because sanitation wasn’t enough. Was sanitation so much worse in the late 1980s before the Hib vaccine was introduced than it is now? No. Was it probably even that much worse in the 1960s, when the measles vaccine was introduced? Probably not. Yet, such is the myth that the anti-vaccine movement would have parents believe. Such is the intellectually dishonest nonsense they promote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do they do this? J.B. Handley himself has &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4259"&gt;told us why&lt;/a&gt;: To bring the U.S. vaccine program to its knees. Or the U.K. program. Or whatever program where the anti-vaccine program has taken hold. The reason is that, no matter how much science says it isn’t, to the anti-vaccine activist, it’s first and foremost always all about the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Ed Yong from &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/" title=""&gt;Not Exactly Rocket Science&lt;/a&gt; to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ed Yong pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Ed%20Yong%20pic.jpg" width="250" height="333" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;I'm Ed, I talk to people about science and I do it in three main ways. I write a science blog called &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/" title=""&gt;Not Exactly Rocket Science&lt;/a&gt;, I do a fair bit of freelance journalism for British press, and I work in a science communications role for a big UK cancer charity.  Round about the time that swine flu was saturating the headlines, I started calling myself a triple-reassortant science writer, which is a seriously geeky affectation but worth it for the occasional person who gets it and sniggers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of my background, I did a degree in Natural Sciences at Cambridge, covering all sorts of fields from animal behaviour to experimental psychology. I assumed that research was going to be my calling and I spent a year or so as a PhD student before realising that I was apocalyptically bad at it. Mythically bad. People composed ballads about how much I sucked. If I didn't destroy the world during my time in the lab, it's only because that would probably have counted as a publishable result. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the insight that I sucked at doing science coincided nicely with the revelation that I wasn't too bad at talking about it. Essentially, I can't narrow my attentional spotlight on a single subject; I need broad vistas. I can't derive motivation from rare but transcendental moments of success amid a long drought of failure; I need a more regular fix. And my hands are clumsy and inept when handling a Gilson; they're much better at dancing on a keyboard. And thus concludes my origin story. Maybe I should have just lied and said something about being bitten by a radioactive David Attenborough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on to here and now, I'm constantly excited by the new discoveries that I read about and I'm keen to infect other people with the same enthusiasm. I just think that people will be better off if they have a deeper understanding of the world around them and if they're motivated to sceptically seek out that knowledge in the first place. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/03/16/the-value-of-this-is-cool-science-stories/" title=""&gt;Telling awe-inspiring stories&lt;/a&gt; about science is one way of achieving both those ends. My own love for science was fuelled by masterful communicators and I want to carry on that tradition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I live in London, a great, beautiful, cosmopolitan, culturally vibrant city that has the god-awful problem of being full of Londoners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I'm essentially juggling two careers, one during the day and one at night. Like Batman but with more repetitive strain injury. During the day, I work at Cancer Research UK and carry the marvellously high-falutin' job title of Head of Health Evidence and Information. My job is to ensure that our information on cancer prevention and early detection is evidence-based and to use that evidence to guide the rest of the charity. It's a great mix of leading a small team, media interviews, reviewing literature, acting as a sort of consultant to other teams, and a fair bit of writing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At night, I put on my journalist and blogger hats (they're figurative hats, although if they were real, the journalist one would be one of those old fedoras with a Press pass sticking out of it, and the blogger one would be something silly but combative, like a conquistador helmet). I started blogging because I wanted to flex my writing muscles on different topics and in a style that's more naturally mine. I also had visions of being a 'proper' science writer but wasn't getting any traction sending pitches into mainstream media. So, I started doing it myself. I started on Wordpress and was recruited to ScienceBlogs just over two years ago. The blog has gone from strength to strength and the last couple of months have been record-breakers in terms of traffic. This week has been the most rewarding yet. I won the top prize at the &lt;a href="http://researchblogging.org/static/index/page/awards" title=""&gt;Research Blogging Awards&lt;/a&gt; as well as prizes for best post and best lay-level blog. And I've just begun Phase Three of the NERS life cycle by jumping into a new &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2008/05/17/aphids-get-superpowers-through-sex/" title=""&gt;host body at Discover Blogs&lt;/a&gt;, where I'm tremendously excited to be joining a small but elite group of bloggers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also do a fair bit of freelancing - some news pieces in the past but mostly features at the moment. I've written for New Scientist, the Times, the Guardian, Nature and a number of other publications. And I've won a couple of writing awards too, including the &lt;a href="http://science-writer.co.uk/" title=""&gt;Daily Telegraph Science Writer Award&lt;/a&gt; that really kick-started all of this off, and the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2009/07/01/i-just-won-the-association-of-british-science-writers-best-newcomer-award/" title=""&gt;Association of British Science Writers' Best Newcomer award&lt;/a&gt; last year. Actually, the certificate for that says Ed Young, but I distinctly remember collecting it and shaking someone's hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big goals are these: constantly learn new things and better myself. Be good at what I choose to do but never become arrogant. Be an excellent husband, a good writer and not an idiot, in that order. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To elaborate, the lofty goal is to get as many people interested in science as possible. Make the complicated seem simple, the obscure seem fun and the unknown seem tangible. My writing career is still in its infancy and I have no illusions about how far I have to learn. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/" title=""&gt;NERS&lt;/a&gt; is still the single piece of work that I am proudest of and I want to build it into a widely respected source of science news. It's starting to get some mainstream recognition. That's obviously personally fulfilling but I think that as part of a general trend, it would be prudent for both blogs and mainstream media to starting collaborating more. I want to continue to work for a good cause during my day job, keep on doing longer features for mainstream media and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/02/02/rebooting-science-journalism-on-blurring-boundaries-money-audiences-and-duck-sex/" title=""&gt;speak at&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/03/10/science-in-the-media-rude-or-ailing-health/" title=""&gt;more events&lt;/a&gt;. And at some point in the next 5 years, I would love to start writing popular science books. The problem is that I can't think of a plan that involves me achieving all of these things without violating at least a few laws of physics. For the moment, I appear to have achieved time saturation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also keen to carry on absorbing ideas. The worlds of journalism, the Internet and, indeed, science itself are changing at a dizzying pace and it can feel like a massive treadmill, where we're all running faster to stay in the same place like Caroll's Red Queen. In the last year alone, my &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/category/journalism/" title=""&gt;thoughts on journalism&lt;/a&gt; have changed significantly just through thinking about the field, reading commentaries from others and chatting to my peers. And all the while, I see people who have dug their heels in, stagnated in their opinions, and are slowly drifting back down the treadmill towards some extinction horizon. I would very much like to not be those people. The minute I think I've got this all figured out is the minute I really haven't. So... more reading, mulling and discussing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I don't really believe in detailed life plans. The most exciting things I've done over the past few years have come about through unpredictable openings and I think that successful people are the ones with the nous to capitalise on the right opportunities as they come along. With the gift of hindsight, even chaotic bumbling can look like some sort of structured plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As far as science communication goes, there are two things that I love above all else. The first is finding a way of successfully explaining something complicated. Getting the right angle, metaphor or play on words is just magical. It's like scoring a winning goal or finally getting an experiment to work or reaching the peak of a mountain, except I get to do it... every... single... day. The second is related - finding a narrative that links an entire field, or several different fields. This is why I write features. It's an entirely different skill to writing posts based on single papers. It often involves drawing out massive spider diagrams and finding an easy route between all the nodes. And again, that moment when everything clicks into place, when you know how every paragraph will flow into every other, and when you can see the story beats... it's just transcendental. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the internet goes, I've written about this extensively on my own blog. I'm fascinated by the way that the internet is &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/01/11/adapting-to-the-new-ecosystem-of-science-journalism/" title=""&gt;changing the face of science journalism&lt;/a&gt;, how it's altering the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/01/01/who-are-the-science-journalists" title=""&gt;very definition of a science journalist&lt;/a&gt;, how it can be used to &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/02/02/rebooting-science-journalism-on-blurring-boundaries-money-audiences-and-duck-sex/" title=""&gt;reach mass audiences&lt;/a&gt; while simultaneously failing to do so, and the massive, incalculable implications of opening the tools of production to everyone. Simply put, I would not have this career without the Internet. I absolutely love the fact that a complete nobody like me can waltz in and start writing, and a couple of years later, I've spoken at an international conference, I've been published in most of the British press that I love and I've &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2008/12/29/an-interview-with-david-attenborough/" title=""&gt;interviewed David Attenborough&lt;/a&gt;, my childhood hero, in his living room. I could kiss the Internet, but I know where it's been. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I've already spoken about the blogging. My &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/edyong209" title=""&gt;Twitter experience&lt;/a&gt; is about a year old and it has been an unexpected joy. There are obvious benefits - it's great for publicity, getting more traffic, building a brand, chatting to like-minded people and so on. It also allows me to do things that I try to limit on my blog, like promoting other people's stuff, linking heavily, being a bit sillier, chatting to friends, pointing out stupid stuff in the popular press, linking to geekery, and so on. I want to keep the signal-to-noise ratio high on the blog but it's a different sort of signal on Twitter. For better or worse, my Twitter stream is probably closer to my actual personality than my blog is.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is also an absolutely amazing source of information. Tweetdeck is essentially my own personal newspaper that's edited by the people I follow - a cadre of excellent journalists, scientists and friends who I trust to feed me interesting content. The thing that critics of the internet don't get is that you can filter your way out of the noise with relative ease. It's much like flesh-and-blood life - you get the most out of your conversations if you choose interesting people to hang around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a science writer, it's invaluable too. I've used Twitter to source contacts for articles, clarify complex terms, get papers I don't have access to and even &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/02/18/how-to-avoid-he-said-she-said-science-journalism/" title=""&gt;commission a guest post on my blog&lt;/a&gt;. One of my followers even helped me to kill a pesky virus on my computer! I even think that Twitter makes quite good practice for a writer. People slate the 140-character format but I think it's actually fairly demanding as a discipline. You have to work harder to be understood in a limited space, especially if you're debating with someone. On the downside, there are the obvious negatives - it's a massive time-suck and I personally find it very addictive. But there's no question in my mind that it's a net-positive thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any cool &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Participants_Blogroll/" title=""&gt;science blogs by the participants&lt;/a&gt; at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I probably started writing a science blog before I started reading them. I devote most of my free time to writing and I get far too little time to read what everyone else is doing than I would like. I use Twitter to find stuff that interests me and there are only a few blogs that I follow religiously. To be honest, I'm far more interested in individuals as writers rather than in blogs as entities. Given that there's so much cross-pollination between blogs, mainstream media and other formats, it makes little sense to me to focus on blogs just because I write one. I love good science writing, regardless of the format. And one of the interesting things about social media is that a person's entire (I shudder to say it) brand affects how I view them - it's about writing skill, but also whether they're fun to chat to, whether they voice interesting opinions and whether they point towards interesting stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of people I rate, a list of science writojournobloggocommunicators would have to include &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/" title=""&gt;Carl Zimmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://mindhacks.net/" title=""&gt;Vaughan Bell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/" title=""&gt;Brian Switek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/" title=""&gt;SciCurious&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/" title=""&gt;Jonah Lehrer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/9brandon" title=""&gt;Brandon Keim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/alexismadrigal" title=""&gt;Alexis Madrigal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/matthewherper" title=""&gt;Matthew Herper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/markgfh" title=""&gt;Mark Henderson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://embargowatch.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Ivan Oransky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/culturedish" title=""&gt;Rebecca Skloot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neuronculture/" title=""&gt;David Dobbs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/" title=""&gt;John Timmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/adamrutherford" title=""&gt;Adam Rutherford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/" title=""&gt;Sheril Kirshenbaum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/brendanmaher" title=""&gt;Brendan Maher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/observations/" title=""&gt;Christie Wilcox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/author/Daniel+Cressey/index.html" title=""&gt;Daniel Cressey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twistedphysics.typepad.com/" title=""&gt;Jennifer Ouellette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/" title=""&gt;Frank Swain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/simon_frantz" title=""&gt;Simon Frantz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/" title=""&gt;Martin Robbins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/" title=""&gt;PalMD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/" title=""&gt;Daniel Macarthur&lt;/a&gt;, etc. I'm also loving the opportunity to chat to loads of great up-and-coming science journalists on Twitter, like &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ferrisjabr" title=""&gt;Ferris Jabr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/christineottery" title=""&gt;Christine Ottery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/_ColinS_" title=""&gt;Colin Schultz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mikeorcutt" title=""&gt;Mike Orcutt&lt;/a&gt;, you obviously,... Look, I'm just scratching the surface here and I'm sure I've missed out people who I'll feel awful about later. Have a look at my blogroll or the people I follow on Twitter. I do those for a reason. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The social side of the conference was unquestionably the best aspect for me. There is something fascinating and unique about meeting old friends for the first time. I've known people like SciCurious, Brian Switek and others for years. They've done favours for me and I for them and after all this history builds up, you finally get to see someone's face and give them a hug - it's bizarre, but a little part of me wonders how people ever met other people in a different way. It's a dream scenario for an introvert. There is also something quite remarkable about seeing all these people, who know each other through online social networks, cementing their relationships in flesh and blood. It simultaneously shows that social media can be a glorious conduit for meeting people, but it can't substitute for a good, old-fashioned handshake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the conference itself, without being too self-promotional, I was very pleased with &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Rebooting_Science_Journalism/" title=""&gt;the session that I ran&lt;/a&gt; with Carl, David and John. I absolutely loved &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Science_and_Entertainment/" title=""&gt;the entertainment session&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://sciencelush.typepad.com/about.html" title=""&gt;Tamara Krinsky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twistedphysics.typepad.com/" title=""&gt;Jennifer Ouellette&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Proposals_and_Pitches_that_Pay/" title=""&gt;the pitching session&lt;/a&gt; with Rebecca Skloot, Clifton Wiens, David Dobbs and Ivan Oransky, a session I wish I'd come to several years ago. In general, I was inspired by how humble and down-to-earth everyone I met was. To some extent, this was probably confirmation bias but none of the journalists or scientists I spoke to had any airs, regardless of their experience or existing kudos. From experience, this is an outlier as far as such meetings go, but one I'm grateful for.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that inspired me most in terms of my career was seeing how many people are immersed in a multitude of different roles and activities. They blog, write for mainstream media, make podcasts, shoot videos, teach... the list goes on. It's an intriguing model and one that I will be paying close attention to. And the conference was largely about the opportunity for inspiring myself too. Agreeing to chair a panel gave me a chance to think hard about science journalism, its future and my place in it. It led to a couple of op/eds on my blog and a chance to test and develop my views on the field. More practically, it made me start thinking more carefully about interviewing other sources for the posts I write, and it led to the new &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/category/not-exactly-pocket-science/" title=""&gt;Not Exactly Pocket Science&lt;/a&gt; feature on the blog. It has galvanised me into trying to make NERS the best possible home of science journalism that it can be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to next year, I think everyone should agree beforehand that if anyone gets ill, they immediately give their snotty tissues to Jonathan Eisen for phylogenetic comparison. That way, we can easily establish who Patient Zero was and we can dispel the scandalous rumours that it was me. Also given the number of sessions she ran this year, you might consider renaming the conference to SklootOnline 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to see you again and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can grow up to about six inches, and eat invertebrates.  You can see a nice film of them &lt;a href="http://www.edwardsaquifer.net/species.html#Texas%20Blind%20Salamander%20%28Typhlomolge%20rathbuni%29"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (note that they give the species name of &lt;em&gt;Typhlomolge rathbuni&lt;/em&gt;; the genus name has been updated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a picture of one I took at the San Marcos National Fish Hatchery and Technology Center, where I was kindly given a tour.  You can see the vestigial eyes, nearly completely covered with skin. Only the left eye is visible: variable and asymmetric expression of vestigial traits is common.  The eyes are much more visible in young salamanders, and then gradually disappear as the skin grows over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need hardly point out that the presence of nonfunctional, vestigial eyes in an animal descended from ancestors that had functioning eyes is pretty good evidence for evolution (see chapter 3 of &lt;em&gt;Why Evolution is True&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Salamander 1" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/salamander-1.jpg?w=474&amp;amp;h=354" alt="" width="474" height="354"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a close-up of the head and gills.  This individual has no visible eyes (variable expression among individuals!).   I was told that the large swellings at the base of the head contain neurons for processing olfactory information: this beast lives by smelling rather than seeing. This guy also has a bit more pigment than the one above. (I say “guy,” but I don’t know the sex.  The only way to sex these things is to hold them up against a strong light and look for either eggs or sperm ducts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Salamander 2" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/salamander-2.jpg?w=498&amp;amp;h=372" alt="" width="498" height="372"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phylogenies show that, like all cave animals, the blind salamander descended from a sighted species that lived aboveground.  Why do cave animals lose their eyes? There are several explanations.  One is that, since they’re not useful in the dark, mutations that make them degenerate are not selected against.  The other two explanations involve positive selection.  Eyes are easily damaged and infected, and if you don’t need them, individuals with mutations reducing the eyes are less likely to risk injury/infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, eyes take metabolic energy and bodily substance to build; if you don’t need them, you may have higher fitness if you divert that energy away from eyes and toward other structures or functions that enhance reproduction.  And of course all three factors could operate together.   I don’t think we know in any case the precise evolutionary forces that led loss of eyes (or pigmentation) in a cave species. The hypotheses are reasonable, though I don’t know of any experimental test (one would be to look at the genes for eye or pigment loss and see if the DNA sequence shows a signature of positive selection, though that test can be misleading).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the eggs photographed in water (and slightly out of focus). You can see the tiny newts developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Salamander eggs" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/salamander-eggs.jpg?w=516&amp;amp;h=386" alt="" width="516" height="386"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, my friend Jim Bull, a UT Austin professor, built a birdhouse in his backyard. It was taken over by a screech owl, who, at twilight, would poke his head out of the hole for an hour or so. Really cute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="DSCN3989" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dscn3989.jpg?w=525&amp;amp;h=696" alt="" width="525" height="696"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably an eastern screech owl (&lt;em&gt;Megascops asio&lt;/em&gt;), but I can’t tell from the photo.  Both eastern and western screech owls are sympatric in some parts of Texas.  This one, like most owls, hunts at night, and probably poked his head out each evening to scope out the surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

Now it’s time to open up the jars and have a look-see. Your job, should you choose to accept it: examine each of the apples in the photos that follow, and indicate via poll which you think looks best and which looks worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order of the photos was decided by coin flips, and the photos are unaltered except to black out the writing on the slips of paper behind them, which indicate which is which. I’ll post the original pics when voting is over tomorrow night. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll close the polls at 23:59pm GMT tomorrow (30 March) and we’ll see if the results are statistically significant. We have &lt;a href="http://www.standupmaths.com/"&gt;Matt “Actually A Professional Mathematician” Parker&lt;/a&gt; on hand to crunch the numbers and explain how stats like this work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I’ll make appropriate adjustments to the experiment, institute better controls, and give it another go. Some of the suggestions from you all and from Nikki Owens’ fans have been great, including: sterilizing the knife and cutting board, replacing mustaches with “love” and “hate” labels, and using halves instead of quarters as Owens did originally. This last one is tricky as it makes it more difficult to have a control apple, but I think I’ve figured out a good way to do it: there will be two full apples sliced in half. One apple will be control with no “love” or “hate” directed at it, and the other will get half love and half hate. In the end, if Owens is correct, the love/hate apple should have drastically different halves and the control apple’s halves should look identical. Thoughts on this?&lt;/p&gt;

As a measure of the field&amp;#39;s independence and importance, consider that at least five journals primarily dedicated to it have emerged in the last couple of years, and 15000 articles on it have been published since 2003.But how useful is it in drug discovery? The answer, just like for other approaches and technologies, is that it depends. For calculating and analyzing some properties it is more useful than for others. A group at Abbott summarizes the current knowledge of cheminformatics approaches as applied to various parameters.To do this the group utilizes a useful classification made (in)famous by ex-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld (Rumsfeld et al., J. Improb. Res. 2002). This is the classification of knowledge and facts into &amp;#39;known knowns&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;unknown knowns&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;known unknowns&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;unknown unknowns&amp;#39;.The &amp;#39;known known&amp;#39; category of properties calculated by cheminformatics consists of those that we think we have a very accurate handle on and that are easy to calculate. These include molecular weight, substructure (SS) searches, and ligand efficiency. Molecular weight can be easily calculated, and a variety of studies have indicated that high MW generally impacts drug discovery negatively. Thus the general thrust is on keeping your compounds small. Ligand efficiency is calculated as the free energy of binding per heavy atom. Medicinal chemists are more familiar with IC50 than free energy. Since IC50s are usually easy to measure and the number of heavy atoms are of course known, ligand efficiency would be a &amp;#39;known known&amp;#39;. However the caveat is that IC50 is not the same as in vivo activity, so biochemical potency in terms of ligand efficiency might be a very different kettle of fish. Lastly, substructure searches can be carried out easily by many computer programs. Such searches are usually used when a compound having a substructure similar to one that is known is sought. The problem with SS searches arises when the decision on which SS to search becomes subjective. SS is also valuably used when certain SSs are to be avoided. In general SS searching belongs with the &amp;#39;known known&amp;#39; category because of its ease, but subjective interpretations can render this more fuzzy.In the &amp;#39;unknown knowns&amp;#39; category lie an interesting set of properties; those which we think we know how to calculate but which sometimes look deceptively simple and are often subject to overconfidence in calculation. The first property in this category is one of the most important ones in drug design; logP, which is regarded to be a measure of the lipophilicity of the compound, a key parameter dictating absorption, bioavailability, and partitioning of drugs between membranes and body fluids. Several programs can calculate logP. However, as the article notes, a recent study of no less than 30 such programs located a mean error in logP calculation of 1 log unit, which means that some programs would do much worse. Thus calculation of logP, just like other computational techniques, crucially depends on the method used to calculate it. The caveat is that absolute cutoffs for logP values in library design of compounds searches might mislead, but many programs seem to do a fairly good job in producing trends. Solubility is another parameter that is notoriously difficult to calculate, especially since its calculation hinges on calculation of pKa values. pKa values in turn again are very method-dependent, and trouble arises especially for charged compounds, which include most drugs. Medicinal chemists are understandably suspicious of theoretical solubility prediction, but as for logP, such calculations may at least be used for quick estimation of qualitative trends. Another parameter in this category is plasma protein binding. Although we know a fair amount about the effect of this parameter on drug ADME, good luck trying to calculate this. Lastly, in vivo ADME is a minefield of complications. I personally would not have placed this in the &amp;#39;unknown knowns&amp;#39; category, but at least some of the properties in this category can be calculated on the basis of specialized fragment-based models.What about &amp;#39;known unknowns&amp;#39;? This includes polar surface area (PSA)&amp;#39;. PSA is a known unknown because we know that is not exactly a real, measurable quantity. However it is still a useful parameter since PSA has been shown to relate to membrane permeability and hence is especially useful for guessing blood-brain barrier penetration for CNS drugs. A set of rules similar to the Lipinski rules says that compounds with a PSA of less than 120 A^2 are more likely to penetrate membranes. As for other properties though, calculation of PSA depends on method and usually involves calculating the 3D structure of a molecule and then calculating the PSA by assigning some kind of a &amp;#39;surface area&amp;#39; associated with polar atoms. As the article notes, one can get wildly different results depending on which atoms are assigned as &amp;#39;polar&amp;#39;. Plus compounds containing sulfur or phosphorus can result in big discrepancies. Clearly PSA is a useful parameter, but we have to go some way in calculating it reliably. Finally, similarity searching is all the rage these days and promises a windfall of potential discoveries. In its simplest incarnation, similarity searching aims to discover compounds similar in some structural metric to a given compound, with the assumption that similarity in structure would correspond to similarity in function. But similarity, just like beauty, is notoriously in the eye of the beholder. As the authors quip from a quaint piece of literature-related controversy:Deciding whether two molecules are similar is much like trying to decide whether something is beautiful. There are no concrete definitions, and most chemists take an “I know it when I see it” attitude (attributed to United States Justice Potter Stewart, concurring opinion in Jacobellis v. Ohio 378 U.S. 184 (1964), regarding possible obscenity in The Lovers).&amp;quot; As again illustrated, different similarity searching methods give very different hits. One of the most successful metrics for measuring similarities has turned out to be the &amp;#39;Tanimoto coefficient&amp;#39;, but other metrics are also rampant. Thus it is quite remarkable that similarity is already being used widely in every endeavor from virtual screening to finding new protein targets for old drugs based on drug similarity. One of the most valuable application of similarity is in finding bioisosteres (chemically similar fragments), something which medicinal chemists strive for all the time. A recent review of similarity-based methods in JMC summarizes the utility of such techniques. Nonetheless, similarity based methods are still in the &amp;#39;known unknowns&amp;#39; because we don&amp;#39;t have an objective handle on what constitutes similarity, and we may never have such a handle even if such methods are widely and successfully adopted.Finally we come to the dreaded &amp;#39;unknown unknowns&amp;#39;. As the authors, can we even list properties which we have no idea about? We can take a shot. This category includes flight of fancy which may never be achieved but which are worth striving for. One such holy grail is the large-scale, high-throughput computation of binding free energies. The binding free energy for a protein ligand complex includes contributions from an enormous numbers of complicated factors, but the mere attempt to calculate all these factors have valuably increased our understanding of biological systems. Thus we should continue in this endeavor. Another fancy endeavor which is the talk of the town these days is systems biology, where construction of biological networks and applications of graph theory are supposed to shed valuable light on molecular interactions. Such approaches may well be successful, but they always run the risk of becoming too abstract and divorced from reality to be truly understandable. QSAR models can suffer from the same shortcomings.In the end, only a robust collaboration between informaticians, computer scientists, medicinal chemists and biologists can make sense of the jungle of data uncovered by cheminformatics approaches. It is key for one group of scientists to keep reality checks on others. In the end it&amp;#39;s all about reality checks. And it is necessary if we are to successfully rescue the &amp;#39;unknown unknowns&amp;#39; into other territory, and if we are to avoid the fiasco that the previous classification of these categories led to.Muchmore, S., Edmunds, J., Stewart, K., &amp;amp; Hajduk, P.

Wall Street, massive industry opposition, and political polarization were among the leading factors that killed the bill by Waxman and Markey. Now what?

Senators Cantwell and Collins have proposed a 39-page plan called "cap and dividend." It's very similar to what Obama discussed during his campaign and would auction 100 percent of pollution permits to producers and fossil fuel wholesalers and return three-quarters of revenue to consumers for high energy costs. Not bad.

Additionally, Senators Kerry and Graham are working on a new bill. According to The New York Times, it would:
include a cap on greenhouse gas emissions only for utilities, at least at first, with other industries phased in perhaps years later. It is also said to include a modest tax on gasoline, diesel fuel and aviation fuel, accompanied by new incentives for oil and gas drilling, nuclear power plant construction, carbon capture and storage, and renewable energy sources like wind and solar.
I'll be following the energy policy discussion as it continues with great interest.

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I cleaned up the submission form, made the necessary edits, and opened it up - please go to the &lt;a href="https://openlab.wufoo.com/forms/submission-form/" title=""&gt;new Submission Form&lt;/a&gt; and start entering the posts you consider worthy of publishing in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each entry needs to be originally published as a blog post between December 1st 2009 and December 1st 2010 to be eligible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can nominate as many entries as you wish, written by you or by others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, about half of the submissions are nominated by readers and the other half by authors - there is no shame in self-promotion. Nobody knows your archives as well as you do, so dig through them, back to December 1st of last year, and pick a post or two to submit right now. Then, as the year progresses and you post more good stuff, come back and submit more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History also shows that the number of entries you submit has no relation to your chances of getting picked. If your writing is good, a single submitted post has a chance. If it sucks, submitting 50 entries will not help (may actually bore the judges to death until they actively hate you for making them work so hard in an unlikely chance of picking something from that avalanche of posts). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that this is going to be a book - printed on paper derived from dead trees, with black&amp;amp;white or grayscale images only. Until eReaders get really good at that and totally ubiqutous, audio and video files just don&amp;#39;t work on paper, so posts that rely heavily on those will not make it. Hyperlinks also do not work well on paper, so if your post relies on a number of external links, chances of that post getting printed are miniscule to zero (unless you can show how it can be edited and still be good). Can your post still be good if you eliminate pictures you don&amp;#39;t have copyright on? Or if you turn color images into grayscale? Go ahead, otherwise don&amp;#39;&amp;#39;t bother - can&amp;#39;t be done. When judges sift through several hundreds of submissions in order to pick 52, posts that require lots of editing to make them fit for print are easy to cut out of the running. There is no reason not to edit a non-print-friendly post and repost it in a more print-friendly format before submitting it. In the end, if your entry gets into the final 52, you will be asked to do some editing anyway, and we may do some editing for you on top of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that one of the 52 posts that makes it into the book will be an original cartoon or comic strip. Also bear in mind that another one of the 52 posts that makes it into the book will be an original poem. And you are also encouraged to submit original art - if we are floored by it, we may decide to put it on the cover. The other 50 posts will be essays of different lengths, forms, formats, styles and voices, on 50 different topics, displaying the diversity, creativity and quality of writing in the science blogosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you also write for a magazine or newspaper as well as on a blog (independent blog or a blog hosted by a magazine/newspaper), please submit your blog posts and not your magazine/newspaper pieces. It does not matter if you are paid or not, but use this rule of thumb: if you posted out of your volition, on a topic you wanted to write about, it's fine. If you wrote something because an editor asked you to, and this was subsequently edited and showed up on the main magazine/newspaper site online (and perhaps even in print), then it should not be submitted for this collection of (essentially amateur) work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to see entries that discuss all areas of science, nature, environment, technology, health and medicine, as well as "meta" topics ranging from the Life in Academia, to women/minorities in science, to the intersection between science and policy (and politics) or religion, to skepticism, to history, philosophy and sociology of science, to the analysis of the science publishing world or science communication/journalism, to personal stories by scientists, to patient stories by physicians/nurses (or patients). Check out the &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/631016" title=""&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1869828" title=""&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/6110823" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/8290971" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt; editions to see what kinds of posts made it in the past years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a great diversity of writers in the science blogosphere. Some bloggers consciously target their peers as their main audience. While wonderfully written, such posts tend to have a little bit too much technical jargon (and even formulae) for the lay audience. The target audience of the anthology is lay audience. Actually, the target audience for the book is even more lay than the usual readers of science blogs. These books are supposed to be given as presents to your Mom, or your non-science friends, to show them both that science is cool and that there is great writing on blogs. So, when choosing which posts to enter, look for those that are gripping and exciting and also easy to understand by just about everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, &lt;a href="https://openlab.wufoo.com/forms/submission-form/" title=""&gt;here is the Submission form&lt;/a&gt; so you can get started. The badges/buttons that make it easy to submit will be available soon (check this blog in a few days). The year's editor will also be announced on this blog soon. You can also join our Facebook fan page &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Open-Laboratory/109667279052527" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the fold are entries so far (I tweeted the link yesterday, so the cat is out of the bag) and, as always, I will keep reposting the growing list regularly throughout the year so you can keep checking here to see what's already been submitted (no need to submit duplicates - we just delete those extras - once is sufficient):&lt;/p&gt;

To know the breeding system is to know the genetic architecture of a species.

To know the evolution of a breeding system is to know how evolution works .. 

~ Lewis &amp;amp; Crowe, Evolution (1955)

Genetic tests have revealed the secret sex life of a tiny poison dart frog species that lives in the Peruvian rain forests: remarkably, it turns out that these frogs are monogamous. But the reason this species is monogamous is surprising: it&amp;#39;s all about the size of the pools that their tadpoles mature in. This is the best evidence yet that just a single cause can affect evolution of a major life history trait, such as a species&amp;#39; mating system.

These crickets’ forms are correlated with their interests in reproduction: short-wingers court females much more than fliers do. In this new paper, Guerra and Pollack predict the different interest of males in reproduction would be reflected in their willingness, and ability, to fight with other males.

Doesn’t that sound like a simple thing to test? You might think all you gotta get some crickets, put them together, watch them fight, and you’re ready to write up the paper! Not so fast, speedy. Watch the factors pile up, and you’ll get a sense of how performing a behavioural test of even a simple hypothesis can be trickier than you think.

Unfortunately, what appears to be a simple test is complicated by the flying males losing their ability to fly. So instead of a simple face-off between the mobile “colonists” and the flightless “desperados,” you have a more complex set of nine match-ups: each morph against the other two, and a control set of fights against the same morph. 

There’s also the chance that the act of flight itself would affect the males’ aggression, because that had been shown to influence courtship.

To make things even more complicated, tn most studies of animal aggression, the number one factor in determining who wins and loses is not morph, but size. So the authors also have to track body size and account for it.

Ooooh, and hormones affect aggression, so testes size better be a variable to consider, too.

The results are tricky to summarize, since not only are there a lot of  different match-ups, but fights are measured in different ways: Who  starts the fight? Who wins the fight? How intense was the fight?

The trends, however, were that the short-winged males tended to be the most aggressive ones in terms of the initiation of aggression and the level of aggression, as predicted.

As to the question they might ask in the movies, “Are you going to bet on the man with the big muscles or the man with the big cajones?” I’m not sure about men, but in crickets, it was the case that both mattered. Indeed, those factors mattered more than the type of wings and flight capability the animals had.

Flying changed aggression levels of the long-winged males, but, surprisingly, not the probability of winning. This paper suggests that fighting can affect mating success, although there are no direct tests in this paper. There’s still a lot to work out in this system, not least of which is how all these variations are going to result in greater or lesser reproductive success. Is this a stable system? Or ar their conditions under which the colonists might out compete the desperadoes, and vice versa?

This meeting is hosted in collaboration with the Danish Atheist Society and the Atheist Alliance International. Now, JREFers know that though I'm firmly an atheist, my stance is not quite in accord with the one commonly adopted by so many of the atheist groups, who say that there is no God. I can't accept that definition, because I cannot prove that contention; proving such a negative claim is, essentially, impossible. My stance is that I find no good evidence to support a belief in any deity, which is, to me, much more reasonable... I trust that I'll be able to make that point in my talk, and continue to enlist the support of rationalists both here in the USA and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conference already has a list of great speakers such as Dan Barker, P.Z. Myers, A.C. Grayling, Victor Stenger, Rebecca Watson, Richard Wiseman, and others. The full list can be seen &lt;a href="http://atheistconvention.eu/speakers/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; As part of this trip, I'm hoping to interest other groups abroad to employ my talents as a lecturer while I'm in their area of the world this June. I'm now fully back in lecture mode, healthwise, and rarin' to get into action, folks. I've lots of new material, some selected from my forthcoming book, &lt;em&gt;A Magician in the Laboratory&lt;/em&gt;, and other interesting discussion matters that have come my way in the two years I've been "out of action."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I'll be available for press conferences, interviews, and even actual examination of paranormal claims for the JREF million-dollar prize — still unclaimed! — if and when time permits. Inquiries about my availability as a lecturer can be made to my assistant, &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/contact-the-jref.html"&gt;Brandon K. Thorp&lt;/a&gt;, at the JREF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/uploads/M109420042LE_thumb.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/03/LRO_apolloimpact.jpg" alt="LRO_apolloimpact" title="LRO_apolloimpact" width="610" height="610"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we know it’s new? &lt;em&gt;Because we made it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/203-Rocket-impacts-recorded-by-the-Apollo-seismic-network.html"&gt;That’s the impact scar&lt;/a&gt; of the third stage of the Saturn V rocket (technically designated S-IVB) that carried Apollo 13 to — but sadly, not on — the Moon. Earlier missions had placed seismic instruments on the lunar surface to measure if the Moon had any activity. &lt;a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/15mar_moonquakes.htm"&gt;They found it did&lt;/a&gt;, and in fact several moonquakes were big enough that had you been standing there, you would have felt them quite strongly (and probably been knocked on your spacesuit’s backside).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~5~5~21688~126448:Saturn-V-Third-Stage-LM-Adapter"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/03/apollo7_sivb.jpg" alt="apollo7_sivb" title="apollo7_sivb" width="300" height="216"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The S-IVB upper stage accelerated the astronauts to the Moon from Earth orbit. Once that was done, they had one final mission: in Apollos 13 – 17 the stages were aimed at the Moon itself, and impacted a few days later. The impacts were detected by the seismometers and could be used to determine how seismic waves travel through the lunar surface, a trick that’s been used on Earth for a long time. This information can be used to figure out what the lunar subsurface structure is like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crater image above is from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, and shows the Apollo 13 booster impact. The crater itself is a few dozen meters across, and the material ejected forms a blanket around it for many meters more. The bright material indicates this is a fresh crater; note how gray the more distant undisturbed material around the crater is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact site looks obvious in that picture, doesn’t it? But try finding it in &lt;a href="http://wms.lroc.asu.edu/lroc_browse/view/M109420042LE"&gt;the original full-resolution image returned from LRO&lt;/a&gt; and see if you can locate it, then! I found it relatively quickly starting at the top, and was shocked at how far I could trace the rays — the linear ejected debris features around the crater — from the impact site. One of them is clearly about a kilometer long… that’s over half a mile! Those rays are from plumes of material ejected from the impact site, a common feature. They also indicate the crater’s youth: over time, cosmic rays, the solar wind, and even thermal stress from the Moon’s day/night cycle slowly erase the rays. Any crater with such extensive rays has to be young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the other S-IVB impact sites have been identified; the LRO blog has an image of &lt;a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/124-Apollo-14-S-IVB-Impact-Crater.html"&gt;the Apollo 14 S-IVB crater&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Knowing where these impact sites are helps scientists understand the Moon better, since it a more precise location means the data from the old Apollo missions can be interpreted more clearly. I wonder if future colonists may visit those sites the way we do Plymouth Rock, or Jamestown, or other early exploration and colony sites on Earth?&lt;/p&gt;

Well, I honestly can’t say that she’s responsible, but I’m head-desking all the same. &lt;a href="http://www.healthday.com/Article.asp?AID=637218"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Measles Outbreak Triggered by Unvaccinated Child&lt;/span&gt; – from Health Day:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What began as a family trip to Switzerland in 2008 ended up as a public health nightmare in California.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The family’s 7-year-old boy, who was intentionally unvaccinated against measles, was exposed to the virus while traveling in Europe. When he returned home to San Diego, he unknowingly exposed a total of 839 people, and an additional 11 unvaccinated children contracted the disease.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three of those infected were babies, too young to have yet received the measles vaccines, and one of the babies was hospitalized for three days with a 106-degree fever, &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/current.dtl"&gt;according to a report to be published in the April issue of &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/current.dtl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pediatrics…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;…Parents who intentionally under-vaccinate tended to be white, college-educated and have an upper or middle-income level, the study found. Many believe that living a “natural lifestyle” will protect their children against vaccine-preventable illness, according to the study.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt; “There’s definitely a lack of appreciation of measles and what it can do,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and chief of infectious diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But it soon became apparent to biologists that all  people of the earth are one species. Darwin raised the possibility that  we evolved from other species, and this was apparently confirmed with  the discovery of Neanderthal man. It turns out Neanderthals are our  cousins, not our ancestors, but with them there have been at least two  species that can be called “human” on this planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was  the status of things for a while. Homo erectus and Homo habilis extended  the number of species in our genus (it’s debatable whether habilis  should really be an Australopithecus), but they are not close enough to  us to be considered human cousins. More recently several species have  been identified at the root of humans and neanderthals. Homo  heidelbergensis is probably our direct ancestor from about 650,000 years  ago. But there is also Homo antecessor, which (along with  heidelbergensis) likely evolved from Homo ergaster in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a third recent close human cousin was discovered – Homo  floresiensis, or the Hobbit. This is still controversial, but the data  is leaning in the direction of concluding that a diminutive species of  human lived until about 12,000 years ago on the island of Flores. We  missed by a geological hair’s breath there being as many as three  distinct human species occupying the earth. Given the problems we have  had with race relations, I have often wondered how our society would  deal with an actual distinct species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="More..." src="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Now, as &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8583254.stm"&gt;announced in Nature  magazine&lt;/a&gt;, there could be a fourth species of human to have occupied  the earth as recently as 30,000 years ago. The specimen is called  Woman-X and it was found in Siberia, at a site which also contains  modern humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new evidence is mitochondrial DNA from the  pinky bone of Woman-X. The analysis shows features in common with modern  humans – the specimen is clearly human – but also differences between  both modern humans and neanderthals. So if Woman-X was human, but not  modern and not neanderthal – what was it? That is the exciting news –  perhaps it was a new species. If so then there were at least three human  species co-mingling around Europe and Asia 40,000 years ago or so  (Homo floresiensis was isolated on the island of Flores.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We  discussed this news item on the SGU this week and have had some  interesting feedback. One listener pointed me to &lt;a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/denisova-krause-2010.html"&gt;John  Hawkes blog&lt;/a&gt; where he discusses the alternate interpretation that  Woman-X may simply be from a branch or clade of neanderthals with a  separate mitochondrial lineage that was uncommon. He makes the point  that genetic lineages are not necessarily the same thing as “species”,  to which I would add that the very notion of “species” is fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of  course this is a preliminary analysis – one specimen and mitochondrial  DNA only. Somatic DNA analysis is apparently underway. This may clarify  the issue, but we may also need more specimens before we can confidently  conclude that Woman-X was a member of a distinct human species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part  of the analysis is about divergence time – when was the last common  ancestor between two species. Humans share a last common ancestor with  neanderthals about 500,000 years ago, but other estimates put  it at 660,000 years. The Woman-X analysis suggests a last common  ancestor with modern humans about 1 million years ago. If true this  would definitely make it a distinct species, and suggest a separate and  earlier migration out of Africa. But, as Hawkes points out, divergence  time conclusions are highly dependent on sampling size – how many  different genes are you looking at among how many individuals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There  are a few take-home messages from this research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of  humans is far more complex than previously imagined, and it is very  likely that our picture of human evolution over the last million years  will get much more complex. There apparently were multiple migrations  out of Africa to Europe and Asia, with multiple early branchings. This  is likely further complicated by various amounts of time in which  different branches continued to interbreed when they overlapped. The  more detailed a picture we get, the more complex and fuzzy it is likely  to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new evidence is very preliminary, and only raises  the possibility of a new distinct species, but other interpretations  are still viable. Clarifying this will have to wait for further analysis  of this specimen, but also likely the discovery of new specimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I  have not mentioned this point yet, but this research also raises the  question of how much we can use culture as a proxy for species. In other  words, when we find certain tools that tend to go along with a certain  human species, can we be confident that that species in fact made and  used them? How much cultural and technological contamination was there  among the overlapping human species?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, when reporting on a  new science item it is almost universally true that when the scientific  community starts to take a close look at the research new  interpretations will emerge, perhaps even errors pointed out. That is  the cycle of science. But this means that early reporting of the new  science publication is likely to be followed by more expert analysis  that calls the original conclusions into question. This is why we often  say that we will “follow this story” – we need to follow the process of  science as it plays out. So take science news items with a grain of salt  – new information is by its very nature tentative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact what I  find most interesting about these stories is watching the process of  science – reading about how different scientists argue their cases tells  us a great deal about the state of the evidence, and also about the  kinds of arguments scientists use and how they interpret the evidence –  how we know what we know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how this particular story  pans out, it is likely to be highly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269865778447"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/03/ancient_kings_on_the_edge_of_h.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ba7029de0b350304</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="History"/><title type="html">Ancient Kings On the Edge of Historicity</title><published>2010-03-29T13:20:52Z</published><updated>2010-03-29T13:20:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/lM7rH7v_3Ic/ancient_kings_on_the_edge_of_h.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/03/ancient_kings_on_the_edge_of_h.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Asked Felicia:&lt;blockquote&gt;"... those Viking saga kings, Ragnar Lodbrok and Björn Järnsida. I'd like to know if there exists any evidence at all that these persons ever existed?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present, the categories "real person" and "fictional character" are pretty distinct. But when we look retrospectively at the first historically documented centuries in any given area, things get fuzzy. And it's even worse if we look at people who are supposed to have lived &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; the introduction of writing to an area, and who are mentioned in early or foreign texts. These centuries to either side of the introduction of writing is known as protohistory, and protohistorical information is strictly speaking not factual knowledge. Not because we &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that it's wrong, but because it is impossible to corroborate. Protohistory is information of indeterminate value, which is extremely frustrating to many amateur historians who Want To Believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beowulf and Arthur are protohistorical figures. And Arthur illustrates another tendency: even if there's is reason to believe that he existed, almost none of his most famous characteristics are likely to be historical truth. He probably wasn't named Arthur, he had no round table, his queen wasn't named Guinevere, his stronghold wasn't named Camelot, none of his "knights" wore plate armour, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then on the other hand there are all the countless real, living individuals of the past of whom we know the name, the approximate date and the region they lived in  - and nothing more. Because when people start writing, they usually start small, and one of the first things they write is &lt;i&gt;names&lt;/i&gt;. We've seen it recently on the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/11/runological_report_on_the_hogg.php"&gt;Hogganvik rune stone&lt;/a&gt;. Skelbathewar and Naudigastir were in all likelihood as real as anybody who reads this, but we hardly know anything about them. They are not protohistorical, just extremely poorly documented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps Felicia's question was specifically about Ragnar Lodbrok and Björn Järnsida, not so much about generalities. Both are protohistorical figures: Ragnar Shaggy-breeches and Björn Ironside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ragnar's case, we're dealing with a documented 9th century Viking leader of that given name onto whom later story-tellers painted thick layers of fiction, including his second name. Or perhaps it is meaningless to make that identification since the historical guy and the Ragnar of later legend have so little in common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Björn is said to have been Ragnar's son and is an even worse candidate for factuality than his dad. There is contemporaneous written evidence for a Ragnar at the right time and in the right area. Not so with Björn. And this is why historians have long since scrapped the idea of a "Munsö royal lineage" springing from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source-critical historians try to avoid believing in anything until good-quality sources force them to. Such a historian needn't spend much time thinking about Ragnar or Björn. Alternatively, you can have the opposite attitude: that you want to avoid &lt;i&gt;disbelieving&lt;/i&gt; any statement in early sources unless contradictions force you. Trouble is, it's possible (and quite easy) to write internally consistent fiction. Thus, in my opinion, only the source-critical attitude deserves the moniker &lt;i&gt;vetenskap&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Wissenschaft&lt;/i&gt;, that the English language unfortunately lacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Reader Peter Olausson points to &lt;a href="http://blogg.svd.se/kungabloggen?id=18829"&gt;a piece&lt;/a&gt; where historian Dick Harrison says pretty much what I said above. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Given the problems we have had with race relations, I have often wondered how our society would deal with an actual distinct species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8583254.stm"&gt;announced in Nature magazine&lt;/a&gt;, there could be a fourth species of human to have occupied the earth as recently as 30,000 years ago. The specimen is called Woman-X and it was found in Siberia, at a site which also contains modern humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new evidence is mitochondrial DNA from the pinky bone of Woman-X. The analysis shows features in common with modern humans – the specimen is clearly human – but also differences between both modern humans and neanderthals. So if Woman-X was human, but not modern and not neanderthal – what was it? That is the exciting news – perhaps it was a new species. If so then there were at least three human species co-mingling around Europe and Asia 40 thousand years ago or so (Homo floresiensis was isolated on the island of Flores.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed this news item on the SGU this week and have had some interesting feedback. One listener pointed me to &lt;a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/denisova-krause-2010.html"&gt;John Hawkes blog&lt;/a&gt; where he discusses the alternate interpretation that Woman-X may simply be from a branch or clade of neanderthals with a separate mitochondrial lineage that was uncommon. He makes the point that genetic lineages are not necessarily the same thing as “species”, to which I would add that the very notion of “species” is fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this is a preliminary analysis – one specimen and mitochondrial DNA only. Somatic DNA analysis is apparently underway. This may clarify the issue, but we may also need more specimens before we can confidently conclude that Woman-X was a member of a distinct human species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the analysis is about divergence time – when was the last common ancestor between two species. Humans share a last common ancestor with neanderthals about 500,000 years ago, but other estimates put it at 660,000 years. The Woman-X analysis suggests a last common ancestor with modern humans about 1 million years ago. If true this would definitely make it a distinct species, and suggest a separate and earlier migration out of Africa. But, as Hawkes points out, divergence time conclusions are highly dependent on sampling size – how many different genes are you looking at among how many individuals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few take-home messages from this research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of humans is far more complex than previously imagined, and it is very likely that our picture of human evolution over the last million years will get much more complex. There apparently were multiple migrations out of Africa to Europe and Asia, with multiple early branchings. This is likely further complicated by various amounts of time in which different branches continued to interbreed when they overlapped. The more detailed a picture we get, the more complex and fuzzy it is likely to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new evidence is very preliminary, and only raises the possibility of a new distinct species, but other interpretations are still viable. Clarifying this will have to wait for further analysis of this specimen, but also likely the discovery of new specimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not mentioned this point yet, but this research also raises the question of how much we can use culture as a proxy for species. In other words, when we find certain tools that tend to go along with a certain human species, can we be confident that that species in fact made and used them? How much cultural and technological contamination was there among the overlapping human species?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, when reporting on a new science item it is almost universally true that when the scientific community starts to take a close look at the research new interpretations will emerge, perhaps even errors will be pointed out. That is the cycle of science. But this means that early reporting of the new science publication is likely to be followed by more expert analysis that calls the original conclusions into question. This is why we often say that we will “follow this story” – we need to follow the process of science as it plays out. So take science news items with a grain of salt – new information is by its very nature tentative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact what I find most interesting about these stories is watching the process of science – reading about how different scientists argue their cases tells us a great deal about the state of the evidence, and also about the kinds of arguments scientists use and how they interpret the evidence – how we know what we know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how this particular story pans out, it is likely to be highly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269864590880"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/the_intellectual_dishonesty_of_the_vacci.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d4c63c6cd25a4a30</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">The intellectual dishonesty of the "vaccines didn't save us" gambit</title><published>2010-03-29T13:00:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-29T13:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/L6YUny3oM54/the_intellectual_dishonesty_of_the_vacci.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/the_intellectual_dishonesty_of_the_vacci.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If there's one thing about the anti-vaccine movement I've learned over the last five or so years, it's that it's virtually completely immune to evidence, science, and reason. No matter how much evidence is arrayed against it, it always finds a way to spin, distort, or misrepresent it to combat the evidence. Not that this is any news to readers of this blog or other skeptical blogs that make combatting anti-vaccine propaganda one of its major themes, but it bears repeating often. It also bears repeating and emphasizing examples of just the sort of disingenuous and even outright deceptive techniques used by promoters of anti-vaccine pseudoscience to sow fear and doubt about vaccines among parents. These arguments may seem persuasive to those who have little knowledge about science or epidemiology. Sometimes they even seemed somewhat persuasive to me; that is, at least until I actually took the time to look into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example of such a myth is the claim that "vaccines didn't save us." The anti-vaccine website Vaccine Liberation has archived a set of &lt;a href="http://www.vaclib.org/sites/debate/web1.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;graphs&lt;/a&gt; purporting to show that the death rates of several vaccine-preventable diseases, including whooping cough, diptheria, measles, and polio were falling before the vaccines for each disease were introduced. The website quotes Andrew Weil:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Scientific medicine has taken credit it does not deserve for some advances in health. Most people believe that victory over the infectious diseases of the last century came with the invention of immunisations. In fact, cholera, typhoid, tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough, etc, were in decline before vaccines for them became available - the result of better methods of sanitation, sewage disposal, and distribution of food and water.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Maher has said similar things about vaccines, and the "vaccines didn't save us" gambit is a staple of anti-vaccine websites, being &lt;a href="http://socioecohistory.wordpress.com/2009/08/31/graphical-evidence-shows-vaccines-didnt-save-us/" rel="nofollow"&gt;spread&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://clipmarks.com/clipmark/199D5278-2A17-4101-91DD-8F3D610A2962/" rel="nofollow"&gt;parroted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/fr/content/proof-vaccines-didnt-save-us" rel="nofollow"&gt;hither and yon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.harvestdream.org/index.php?/archives/431-GRAPHICAL-EVIDENCE-SHOWS-VACCINES-DIDNT-SAVE-US.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;throughout the blogosphere&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://truthiscontagious.com/2010/03/23/proof-that-vaccines-didnt-save-us" rel="nofollow"&gt;credulous anti-vaccinationists&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5468759553"&gt;Pastafarians at the University of South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; counter-protested with &lt;a href="http://www.venganza.org/2010/03/26/usc-pastafarian-counter-protest/"&gt;funny signs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://venganza.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/14.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://venganza.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/14.jpg" title="CounterProtest1" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cute.  Funny.  Attention-getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s an even better way to respond to the hate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m especially excited because this one took place at my alma mater, the University of Illinois at Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UIC student &lt;strong&gt;Jason Connell&lt;/strong&gt; used the protest as &lt;a href="http://gapersblock.com/mechanics/2010/03/09/westboro-baptist-church-embarrass-themselves/"&gt;a way to raise money for the organizations that are subject to the wrath of WBC&lt;/a&gt;.  Groups like the Human Rights Campaign, International AIDS Foundation and the Chicago-based Jerusalem Open House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Donations were named in honor of the Westboro Baptist Church and community thank you cards will be sent from the non-profits to WBC leader Fred Phelps. Connell called it a, “Lemons to Lemonade” situation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thank-you cards are a nice touch &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a great way to capitalize on the publicity that the Phelps clan always brings with them.&lt;/p&gt;

He forgot to take his medicine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

M'friend Charles pointed out (on Facebook) that 'World Homeopathy Awareness Week' is coming up. He wants to raise awareness by saying that homeopathy doesn't work. I'm not sure that's exactly true: homeopathy &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; work.

No, sit down and listen. Homeopathy helps people who have a self-limiting condition (such as a cold) feel like they're doing something to get better, and hey! they get better. So in that sense yes; homeopathy helps hypochondriacs get better. And there's a placebo effect too; people believe they're getting better because they've taken something for their headache (although why homeopathy preparations for headaches say 'for severe headaches take two' is beyond me). The beneficial effect of a good 'bedside' manner is not in dispute, and homeopathic &lt;strike&gt;charlatans&lt;/strike&gt; practitioners have got that down pat. I wish our real physicians would learn from that. 

Homeopathy of course is utterly useless when it comes to things like, oh I don't know, setting a broken leg, breast cancer or preventing malaria. Or &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/05/homeopathy-kills/"&gt;eczema&lt;/a&gt;. In other words where there is actual physical trauma or a causative agent. Where homeopathy is &lt;em&gt;dangerous&lt;/em&gt; is when people use homeopathy instead of proven and effective remedies--medicine, in other words.

&lt;a href="http://www.worldhomeopathy.org/"&gt;Homeopathy kills&lt;/a&gt;. That's an interesting google search, by the way. And if you type 'homeopathy kills breast cancer' you get hits saying that homeopathy kills cancer cells, which hurts my brain so much I think I might have to go and lie down. (The big secret is that just about &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; kills cancer cells sooner or later, especially in culture.)

&lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net/homeopathy.html"&gt;Homeopathy kills&lt;/a&gt; because people will go to a homeopath instead of a real doctor, and get water instead of something that actually works: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Isabella was prescribed medications for her epilepsy. Instead of using them, her parents consulted an iridologist, an applied kinesiologist, a psychic and an osteopath. She was being treated purely with homeopathic medication when she died.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2003/dec/16/health.medicineandhealth"&gt;Isabella&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/11/25/1069522605256.html"&gt;13 months old&lt;/a&gt;.

This week she posts &lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2010/03/an-open-letter-to-concerned-believers.html"&gt;“An open letter to concerned believers”&lt;/a&gt;, addressing, in an oh-so-polite-and-unshrill way, those of the faithful who try to tell atheists how to be more politically effective. Although it’s aimed at believers, it applies equally well to concerned faitheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . It is difficult to avoid the observation that, whenever believers give advice to atheists on how to run our movement, it is always in the direction of telling us to be more quiet, to tone it down, to be less confrontational and less visible. I have yet to see a believer advise the atheist movement to speak up more loudly and more passionately; to make our arguments more compelling and more unanswerable; to get in people’s faces more about delicate and thorny issues that they don’t want to think about; to not be afraid of offending people if we think we’re right. I have received a great deal of advice from believers on how atheists should run our movement… and it is always, always, always in the direction of politely suggesting that we shut up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll have to forgive me if I question the motivation behind this advice, and take it with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll have to forgive me if I think your suggestions on making our movement more effective would, in fact, have the exact opposite effect. What’s more, you’ll have to forgive me for suspecting that this, however unconsciously, is the true intention behind your very kind and no doubt sincerely- meant advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you’ll have to forgive me if I am less than enthusiastic about taking advice on how to run the atheist movement from the very people our movement is trying to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your concern is duly noted. Thank you for sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For instance, Professor &lt;a href="http://forum09.faithfreedom.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;amp;t=2411"&gt;Pallacken Abdul Wahid&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.kau.edu/"&gt;Kerala Agricultural University&lt;/a&gt; has written a fascinating demolition of genetics and genomics for SciTopics ("Research summaries by experts!" Sponsored by Elsevier!) titled &lt;a href="http://www.scitopics.com/Phenomena_of_life_and_death_explained_based_on_a_computer_model_of_organism_in_the_light_of_the_Quran_and_the_Bible.html"&gt;Phenomena of life and death explained based on a computer model of organism in the light of the Quran and the Bible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to bask in the wondrous promise of that title before diving into the link. And have no fear, your every hope of delightful wackaloonery will be fulfilled!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you will discover is that Professor Pallacken Abdul Wahid hasn't the vaguest, foggiest notion of what genetics and genomics are, but that doesn't stop him from making up entirely imaginary problems and even more fanciful solutions. His actual academic specialty is Agricultural Chemistry and Agricultural Botany, which don't seem to involve much actual, you know, &lt;i&gt;biology&lt;/i&gt;…either that, or Kerala Agricultural University has remarkably low standards and allows clowns to teach science. Or both!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He raises two objections to our understanding of genetics. The first is that he notes that all cells have the same genetic constitution, but express different patterns of activity, producing multiple cell and tissue types. Well, OK, this is a real issue, but one that has been long explained by biology: genes are regulated by proteins in the cell, and different cells contain different assortments of proteins because they have different developmental histories. The good professor claims that &lt;span&gt;"the molecular gene concept fails to explain"&lt;/span&gt; this concept. He's wrong. It does so very well. He really needs to read up on some molecular and developmental genetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His second objection is novel. Live cells and dead cells have exactly the same genome, therefore genetics cannot explain death. Novel, all right, but one has to say, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;DUH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Death is not a genetic process. It's a biochemical and physiological one. Death for a multicellular organism is the result of an irreversible breakdown of integrated metabolic events such that the integration of the whole is disrupted; we really have to look at cellular and organismal activity to observe death, it isn't simply an intrinsic property of a certain sequence of nucleotides. This is simply a silly argument he's making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to explain his invented problem, he invents a bizarre and fact-free fairy tale. Since &lt;i&gt;genes&lt;/i&gt; obviously can't be responsible for life, differential gene activity, and death, he claims that there is some non-material property associated with chromosomes that he calls "biomemes" and analogizes to software running on the hardware of the genetic material. Here's his explanation, with his data. (Note: this is exactly as written, except that I had to put it in Comic Sans, simply because Comic Sans is like awesome sauce for crazy.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;The non-particulate biological information stored on the chromosome can be perceived in terms of a biomemetic concept. The term “meme” was originally proposed by Richard Dawkins to mean “replicator”. The term “biomeme” used here is a modified version of “meme”. Biomeme is the smallest unit of biological information that can be transmitted from parent to offspring and that can take part in natural biosoftware engineering processes like cutting and splicing of chromosomal sectors, deletion, replication, translocation, crossing over (recombination), etc. These phenomena lead to alteration of the biosoftware via rearrangement of the biomemetic sectors on the chromosome (Figure 1). All these processes, which biologists treat as ‘errors’, are in fact program-controlled functions to bring about the required alterations in chromosome organization, and hence in the biosoftware. In this way, Johannsen’s non-particulate gene can be conceived and applied to biological systems. A detailed discussion of the computer model of the universe including biocomputer concept may be found elsewhere [15, 16]. In the computer model of the universe, chemical information (abioprogram) exists as coded in the form of chemical structures while the biological information (bioprogram) exists as stored information on chromosomes (biomemory).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/genomics_is_all_wrong/biomeme.jpeg" width="338" height="357" alt="biomeme.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the lovely detailed diagram of a chromosome, which seems to rename chunks of chromatin as "sectors" which somehow correspond not to genes, but to "bioprograms" running on the genome. This is real cargo cult science; the author has no notion of modern biology, but is plopping his own weird interpretations sans any appreciation of the actual data underlying genomics on top of a few cartoon portraits. It's freakishly irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait! There's more! We haven't even struck the Fool's Gold of kook ravings yet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here it is. You know what would complete the lunacy of his ignorant mangling of biology? You guessed it, &lt;i&gt;religion&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Scriptural revelations agree well with Johannsen’s non-particulate gene in conjunction with the computer model of organism. “Breathing of 
&lt;i&gt;rooh&lt;/i&gt;” into a clay model to create man (Adam) mentioned in the Quran (Q. 15:26-29) and “breathing of life” mentioned in the Bible (Genesis 2:7) refer to one and the same event – installation of divine biosoftware in a clay model of man. Upon installation of the 
&lt;i&gt;rooh&lt;/i&gt; (the term 
&lt;i&gt;nafs&lt;/i&gt; is also used in the Quran), the non-living clay model sprang to life much like a lifeless computer springs to “life” when software is installed. Thus the 
&lt;i&gt;rooh &lt;/i&gt;or “breath of life”, which is a non-physical entity, is the divine biosoftware (bioprogram) of human species. It needs a physical medium for storage, which is the chromosome. The Quran further states that it is from the 
&lt;i&gt;nafs&lt;/i&gt; (biosoftware) of Adam, woman (Eve) was created (Q. 7:189). The Bible says that it is from Adam’s rib, Eve was created. The rib mentioned in the Bible corresponds to the X chromosome of Adam [19]. The word ‘rib’ is used in the Bible metaphorically to mean chromosome (for the obvious reason that chromosome was unknown to the people of Prophet Moses&amp;#39;s time). Ribs are the only part of human body that morphologically resembles the chromosome. As two arms of a chromosome are joined on either side of the centromere, two ribs are joined on either side of a vertebra (Figure 2). Of the two sex chromosomes (X and Y), Adam’s rib must be referring to the X chromosome because XX combination determines femaleness. Further, the arms of the X chromosome are more nearly equal in length than those of the Y chromosome. This characteristic of X chromosome makes it more comparable with the ribs on either side of a vertebra. Since the Bible mentions only one rib, the biomeme for femaleness might be located on one of the arms of X chromosome. The Scriptural account of creation of Eve from Adam also reveals the karyotypes of Adam and Eve. If the karyotype of Adam is designated as 22 (autosomes)
&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; + (XY)
&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, where subscript A denotes Adam, the karyotype of Eve will be 22 (autosomes)
&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; + (XX)
&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. The analogy of rib used in the Bible for chromosome also confirms that the biosoftware is stored on the chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/genomics_is_all_wrong/ribs_chroms.jpeg" width="273" height="216" alt="ribs_chroms.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, it's Pallaneck Abdul Wahid's illustration that puts the perfect wacky icing on top of the silly cake of his theory. That's quite a stretch, to claim that chromosomes resemble ribs, therefore that's what the Bible was talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a test. Below are pictures of ribs and of chromosomes. Can you tell them apart? Pallaneck Abdul Wahid can't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/genomics_is_all_wrong/ribs.jpeg" width="200" height="186" alt="ribs.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/genomics_is_all_wrong/chroms.jpeg" width="200" height="186" alt="chroms.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His conclusion also demonstrates that he's a bit lacking in basic logic skills as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a good number of Quranic revelations can be identified as falsifiable through scientific means, the revelation about the non-physical nature of biological information appears quite suitable for the purpose. Studies to synthesize “life” from non-life 
&lt;i&gt;without in any way involving a living cell during experiments&lt;/i&gt; are in full swing in several institutes. These studies are also a test of validity of the Scriptural revelations about life. If we succeed in creating life from chemical molecules, it will mark the end of religion and God. On the other hand if the research fails, it will not only prove the molecular gene wrong but will also confirm that God exists and the Quran is true. Let us wait for the verdict – the scientific answer to the biggest question ever!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if a living cell is created in the lab, God is disproven? Go, Craig Venter, go! Unfortunately, it would shoot down vitalism, but not necessary religion. Well, vitalism is &lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt; shot down — it&amp;#39;s more like walking out to the crater, finding a few scraps of wreckage, and kicking them around for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if the current efforts to synthesize life fail, it does not confirm the existence of God, and it especially does not support the Islamic faith. Creating a complete and functional chromosome is technically difficult, and that a non-trivial task is taking a while is no surprise. But if, somehow, there is some key aspect of the cell that we've been completely missing, even if vitalism reassembles itself and shows that it has some life (hah!) left in it yet, that does not say anything uniquely valid about the Quran. Especially not when its proponents are goofballs scribbling squiggles and claiming ribs look like chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/genomics_is_all_wrong.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/xGOxbU5WRH8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269858422445"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2215">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d288d07eeab560d7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linguistics in the comics"/><title type="html">My hovercraft is full of ham</title><published>2010-03-29T10:23:22Z</published><updated>2010-03-29T10:23:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2215" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today's Doonesbury explores the problem of over-ambitious translation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Federal authorities plan to unseal charges Monday against several people arrested in a series of weekend raids in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, prosecutors in Detroit said Sunday. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Mike Lackomar, a county leader for the Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia, said the target of the raid was a Christian militia group called the Hutaree. The group proclaims on a Web site that it is "preparing for the end time battles to keep the testimony of Jesus Christ alive."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of the group's name, &lt;em&gt;Hutaree,&lt;/em&gt; is not explained on &lt;a href="http://www.hutaree.com"&gt;what seems to be their web site&lt;/a&gt;. And there are other linguistic mysteries to be found there, including their system of paramilitary ranks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hutaree.com/rank.html"&gt;One of their web pages&lt;/a&gt; gives this list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;RANKS:&lt;br&gt;
RADOK [RD]&lt;br&gt;

LUKORE [LK]&lt;br&gt;
MASTER GUNNER [MG]&lt;br&gt;
SENIOR GUNNER [SG]&lt;br&gt;
GUNNER [GN]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't see basis in biblical or military history for &lt;em&gt;Radok, Boramander, Zulif, Arkon, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Lukore&lt;/em&gt;. They sound kind of like Pokémon names (e.g. &lt;em&gt;Arbok, Charmander, Zubat, Rokon&lt;/em&gt;), but there's no precedent &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon"&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update — details of the indictments are discussed &lt;a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/03/feds_release_details_in_hutaree_arrests.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update #2 — Pictures of eight of the nine people indicted are shown &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2010/04/20/us/20militia-cnd.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Their ranks are not indicated, but the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/us/30militia.html"&gt;accompanying article&lt;/a&gt; does say that their leader, David Brian Stone, "also used the name 'Captain Hutaree'".  You'd think that he'd be a (the?) Radok, not just a mere Captain. So I wonder whether the ranks on their web page might be some peculiar sort of joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly someone involved in building the web site has a quirky sense of humor, as shown in the &lt;a href="http://www.hutaree.com/ezrafiles.htm"&gt;"Beast Watch" page&lt;/a&gt;, which mingles apparently serious stuff about implantable chips and RFID bracelets as versions of the "mark of the beast", and a link to an oh-so-serious discussions of "the potential beast government" in Europe (they think Javier Solana may be the antiChrist) and the question of a "pre-trib rapture" (they think not), with the following set of jokes about "The beast's number":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;670 - Approximate number of the Beast&lt;br&gt;
DCLXVI - Roman numeral of the Beast&lt;br&gt;

The driver had been drinking. Using these kind of scare tactics for anti drink-driving and other health issues makes intuitive sense. The campaigners want to grab your attention and demonstrate the seriousness of the consequences if their message is not heeded. However, a new study makes the surprising finding that for a portion of the population, scare tactics can back-fire, actually undermining a message&amp;#39;s efficacy.Steffen Nestler and Boris Egloff had 297 participants, 229 of them female, average age 35, read one of two versions of a fictional news report from a professional medical journal. The report referred to a study showing links between caffeine consumption and a fictional gastro-intestinal disease &amp;#39;Xyelinenteritis&amp;#39;. One version was extra-scary, highlighting a link between Xyelinenteritis and cancer and saying that the participant&amp;#39;s age group was particularly vulnerable. The other version was lower-key and lacked these two details. Both versions of the article concluded by recommending that readers reduce their caffeine consumption. Before gauging the participants&amp;#39; reaction to the article and its advice, the researchers tested them on a measure of &amp;#39;cognitive avoidance&amp;#39;. People who score highly on this personality dimension respond to threats with avoidance tactics such as distracting themselves, denying the threat or persuading themselves that they aren&amp;#39;t vulnerable.The key finding is that participants who scored high on cognitive avoidance actually rated the threat from Xyelinenteritis as less severe after reading the scary version of the report compared with the low-key version. Moreover, after reading the scary version, they were less impressed by the advice to reduce caffeine consumption and less likely to say that they planned to reduce their caffeine intake. On the other hand, highly cognitive avoidant participants were more responsive to the low-key report than were the low cognitive avoidant participants. In other words, for people who are cognitively avoidant, scary health messages can actually back-fire. &amp;#39;Practically, our results suggest that instead of giving all individuals the same threat communications, messages should be given that are concordant with their individual characteristics,&amp;#39; Nestler and Egloff said. &amp;#39;Thus, the present findings are in line with the growing literature on tailoring intentions to individual characteristics, and they highlight the role of individual differences when scary messages are used.&amp;#39;_________________________________Nestler, S., &amp;amp; Egloff, B.

&lt;p&gt;I was, and still am of the belief that reform, whatever form it might take, will be successful as long as we manage to make health care &lt;i&gt;universal&lt;/i&gt;.  Partly because our system already is universal but defective.  No matter if you have insurance or not, if you show up in a hospital with a problem that needs to be addressed, we'll treat it.  We ethically can not turn people away because they lack insurance.  People therefore who lack insurance regularly show up in the ER for primary care, or worse, with a problem that could have been addressed by a primary care doc weeks before but now has become so severe they have no choice but to get treatment whether they are insured or not.  For instance, I had a patient who arrived in the ER with a gaping, necrotic sore on his cheek.  It had started as an abscess, gotten progressively worse, and he tried draining it himself, inadequately, because he was uninsured.  Over the course of a week though the sore had eaten through his face until it actually communicated with the inside of his face.  The result?  Two teams of surgeons later, an ICU stay, and an extensive reconstruction, a 10 dollar problem became who knows?  A 50 thousand dollar problem?  More?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a choice here.  We can have an ethical system that treats people who need care in a thoughtful, sensible fashion, addressing problems through prevention, and appropriate care at the right time.  Or we can have a system where people get their primary care in ERs, often showing up long past time their problem becomes critical and inevitably, more expensive.  Guess which is less expensive?  It's not necessary to have a single-payer system like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/05/what_is_health_care_like_in_th.php"&gt;Great Britain, Canada or New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.  It's not even necessary to have a public option as countries like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/05/what_is_healthcare_like_Neth.php"&gt;the Netherlands demonstrate&lt;/a&gt;.  You can even have a very generous system that is based on highly-regulated private insurance with subsidization for the poor, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/05/what_is_health_care_like_france.php"&gt;as in France&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/05/what_is_healthcare_like_german.php"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;.  All of these systems beat ours with regards to cost &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; performance.  What do all these systems have in common but is lacking in ours?  It's simple, they're universal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2010/03/healthcare_reform.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2010/03/healthcare_reform.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/OP_IeHxA7vQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269853488038"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4762827614191702843.post-7663734253397488860">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/485d71ebac7b030a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Catholicism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="child abuse" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="catholic children" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The Catholic Church And The Criminal Law</title><published>2010-03-29T08:10:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-29T08:10:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2010/03/catholic-church-and-criminal-law.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="html">I am not a particularly militant atheist - I rather like English parish churches and early Renaissance religious art, and so on - but I do have an anti-clerical streak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it is this anti-clerical streak I have been trying to hold in check whilst following the unfolding horrors of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/mar/26/pope-benedict-catholic-church"&gt; the Catholic Church's child sex abuse scandal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would find it very easy to dismiss the whole Catholic Church as a sophisticated child sex abuse ring.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has a set of plausible techniques in getting its members to be close to children, winning the trust of parents, and - afterwards - in keeping the silence of children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It then has an array of means for protecting the perpetrators, ranging from a culture of evasion and deniability, to having safe houses and effective legal immunity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, the Catholic Church has centuries of well-practised defences to those who question what is going on, without anyone ever taking actual responsibility for their actions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, it would be very easy to write about this in an anti-clerical way, and at considerable length;

You may have noticed that I have been posting these geology words of the week on all different days. My original goal was to post them every Friday– that has rarely worked out, but I figure as long as I post a word on average once a week then all is good in the Evelyn Skepchick world. I post when I can in-between meetings, labwork, writing, and other graduate student tasks. One of my thesis advisors calls his students “gradual students.” I think this name is very appropriate. When I think about all that I need to accomplish in order to write my PhD thesis, I become entirely overwhelmed. However, if I take my thesis one task at a time, gradually working my way through, then I am able to keep my sanity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, on to this week’s geology word of the week: &lt;strong&gt;carat&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Def. &lt;strong&gt;Carat&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
1. A unit of weight used for gemstones, equivalent to 0.2 grams.&lt;br&gt;
2. Something Paris Hilton has in abundance.&lt;br&gt;
3. Something bunny rabbits eat… oh wait, that’s carrot. Sorry.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Carat is also one of the “Four Cs” used in the gemstone world to set the price of diamonds and other stones. In general, the bigger the stone (the more carats),  the more a diamond (or any gemstone) is worth. Of course, other considerations are important as well. A gigantic diamond that has a ghastly yellow color and contains ugly inclusions will not sell for a very high price. The three other Cs used in the gemstone (especially the diamond) world are: color, clarity, and cut. In terms of color, clear diamonds are generally worth more than yellowish diamonds. Unless, of course, the diamond has a “fancy” color. Colored diamonds are rare and often worth much more than regular white diamonds. Diamonds can be all colors of the rainbow- blue, green, red, even black! The third C for Clarity refers to the “clearness” of a diamond. Almost all diamonds have some inclusions or small cracks in them. The clearer or more “flawless” the diamond, the more it is worth. The final C is for Cut, which refers to the quality of the manmade cut of the diamond.  The cut of a diamond is often overlooked but is actually very important- a beautiful natural stone can have its beauty (and its price) enhanced or reduced depending on the cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/eGJdezr2p4XfickNKFdNvOCIUjmEKIDM" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have heard a fair amount about “the Four Cs” since I started dating a diamond geologist. As I wrote in  &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2006/12/a-peridot-is-forever/#more-302"&gt;one of my very first skepchick posts&lt;/a&gt;, I am not a big fan of De Beers or of the traditional diamond engagement ring. I wrote this post about six months before I met Mr. Diamond. We met at sea in June 2007. Well, technically we were still in port in Thailand at the time, but we shortly departed land to spend 50 days in the middle of the Indian Ocean in order to study a chain of underwater volcanoes. This cruise was part of a research project I worked on during my first two years of graduate school before switching to my thesis work in Oman. Mr. Diamond was an undergraduate (scandal… I was a first year graduate student) at the University of Cape Town. He was also a bursar with De Beers, meaning that De Beers was paying for four years of college and that he would be required to work for them for four years in order to pay them back. Not a bad deal, I suppose. I guess it’s sort of like a De Beers ROTC except that you don’t have to shoot anyone. Except pirates, maybe, if they attack your diamond-mining vessel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of pirates, after about 49 (okay, maybe 48… it took him about two days to fall head-over-heels for me) days of subtle and not-so-subtle flirtation, Mr. Diamond and I had our first date: pirate watch. That’s right, our first “date” was pirate watch. After spending nearly two months in the Indian Ocean, we cruised past the volcanic island of Krakatoa (the very first land we saw!) and then up the coast of Sumatra. This region is known for piracy, so in addition to the normal watches taken by the crew, the scientists were given watch shifts as well. A day or two before we made it to our end port of Singapore, Mr. Diamond asked somewhat shyly if I’d like to sign up for the same pirate watch shift as him (scientist shifts were in pairs) from 4 am to 6 am. As Mr. Diamond now knows very well, I am &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a morning person. However, because I was gradually (gradual student… get it?) admitting that I liked Mr. Diamond, I agreed and dragged myself out of bed at about 3:59 am for pirate watch. We spent two hours perched on the high back deck of the ship, passing night vision goggles back-and-forth and scanning the water for pirate vessels. We spent the two hours talking, the first time we really had an opportunity to talk alone since on a ship there is little privacy. I never would have expected on that first, rather unusual date that I would still be dating Mr. Diamond. Meeting and falling in love with him was a great surprise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Diamond still works for De Beers, but I suppose I should call him Mr. Gold now since he now is working on finding gold for De Beers, which is (finally) starting to diversify since diamonds are not selling very well because of the poor economy. He actually has a fantastic job- he travels all over the world prospecting for offshore gold, which De Beers eventually hopes to start mining in the same way they currently mine diamonds offshore using the somewhat ironically-named ship &lt;a href="http://www.mineweb.net/mineweb/view/mineweb/en/page37?oid=19899&amp;amp;sn=Detail"&gt;Peace in Africa&lt;/a&gt;. He was hired for this position on a Tuesday and on the following Sunday they send him to New Zealand for two months. Not such a bad deal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little over a year ago, Mr. Diamond/Gold (I guess he was Diamond then) proposed. Well, we sort of proposed to each other– because we were in such a long distance relationship we decided we either needed to break up or get married. So we decided to get married. Whoever proposed to whom, though, the end result was that at the very end of one of my visits to South Africa Mr. Diamond took me to a Cape Town beach with a gorgeous view of Table Mountain, kneeled down, and pulled out a stunning 1 carat peridot ring. I said yes.  I am very excited about my 0.2 grams of olivine, but I’m even more excited about marrying a wonderful, skeptical, handsome, cute (ever heard a South African accent?) geologist. We’re going to have many geological adventures together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, we became engaged on Friday the 13th of March. We only realized that we became engaged on Friday the 13th a couple of days later when a friend asked Mr. Diamond why in the world he decided to propose on that day. As a skepchick, I personally think our Friday the 13th engagement date is auspicious.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Evelyn</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269839230913"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/the_graeme_bird_memorial_threa.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fb17426ac85bb7a3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">The Graeme Bird Memorial Thread</title><published>2010-03-29T04:07:03Z</published><updated>2010-03-29T04:07:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/xEUlyovlFFo/the_graeme_bird_memorial_threa.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/the_graeme_bird_memorial_threa.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/the_graeme_bird_memorial_threa/the-stupid-it-burns.jpeg" width="440" height="500" alt="the-stupid-it-burns.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It happens now and then that some gibbering loon makes a persistent appearance somewhere on the blog, and the ensuing wrangle goes on and on and on. We've had just such an occurrence on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/these_guys_are_dangerous_nuts.php"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;, which is bloating up to almost 700 comments now. &lt;a href="http://graemebird.wordpress.com/"&gt;Graeme Bird&lt;/a&gt; is an Australian wanna-be politician of the crank variety, a &lt;a href="http://graemebird.wordpress.com/2009/12/11/there-is-no-temperature-anomaly-for-the-greenhouse-effect-to-explain/"&gt;global warming denialist&lt;/a&gt;,

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the thread is getting too long and with no end in sight…so I&amp;#39;ve closed it.&lt;/p&gt;

One of our favorite examples is homeopathy, a therapy that is so implausible on a strictly scientific basis that, for it to work, huge swaths of well-established science supported by equally huge amounts of experimental and observational evidence would have to be found to be all in serious error. While such an occurrence is not per se impossible, it is incredibly unlikely. Moreover, for scientists actually to start to doubt our understanding of chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology, and physics to the point of thinking that our understanding of them is in such serious error that homeopathy is a valid description of reality, it would take a lot more than a bunch of low-quality or equivocal studies that show no effect due to homeopathy detectably greater than placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Kim Atwood undertook an &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4238"&gt;excellent discussion of this very issue&lt;/a&gt;. What really caught my attention, though, was how he educated me about a bit of medical history of which I had been completely unaware. Specifically, Kim discussed the strange case of John Lykoudis, a physician in Greece who may have discovered the etiology of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) due to &lt;em&gt;H. pylori&lt;/em&gt; more than a quarter century before Barry Marshall and Robin Warren discovered the bacterial etiology of PUD in 1984. One reason that this story intrigued me is the same reason that it intrigued Kimball. Lykoudis’ story very much resembles that of many quacks, in particular Nicholas Gonzalez, in that he claimed results far better than what medicine could produce at the time, fought relentlessly to try to prove his ideas to the medical authorities in Greece at the time, and ultimately failed to do so. Despite his failure, however, he had a very large and loyal following of patients who fervently believed in his methods. The twist on a familiar story, however, is that Lykoudis may very well have been right and have discovered a real, effective treatment long before his time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimball is right to point out that discoveries require context. Medicine can be prone to dogma. Of that, there is no doubt. Sometimes, physicians resist challenges to prevailing medical dogma. Of that, too, there is no doubt. However, reading the story of John Lykoudis, I couldn’t help but wonder the full context of his activities and efforts to convince the Greek medical authorities of the 1950s and 1960s that he was on to something. It also allows me to indulge myself in a bit of my surgical training, the bulk of which, ironically enough, occurred during the time period when the discoveries of Warren and Marshall were first revolutionizing the treatment of PUD and becoming increasingly accepted in the 1990s. When evaluating a story like that of Dr. Lykoudis and why he was unable to convince the medical profession of 50 years ago that his findings had merit, it’s very important to understand (1) the prevailing notion at the time of PUD etiology and, even more importantly, (2) how PUD was diagnosed and treated in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout most of the 20th century, PUD was thought to be caused by stress and dietary factors. The primary treatment for disease that had not yet developed complications was bed rest and prescription of bland diets. Towards the mid-20th century it became increasingly appreciated that gastric acid is a major factor in the etiology of PUD, and increasingly antacids, then later &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H2-receptor_antagonist"&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonists&lt;/a&gt; like cimetidine and ranitidine, and then still later &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"&gt;proton pump inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; like omeprazole. Cimetidine and ranitidine were the mainstays of PUD treatment when I was a medical student and a resident. For complicated PUD that either was not adequately managed by drugs, sometimes surgery would be necessary. Endless were the discussions and arguments among surgeons fo the time what operation was best for PUD management, a Bilroth I or Bilroth II, vagotomy and pyloroplasty, and, at the time I was finishing my residency, the highly selective vagotomy. Then, of course, there were the discussions of what to do in the case of a bleeding ulcer that couldn’t be stopped using endoscopy or what operation to perform in the case of a perforated ulcer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One must also remember that in the 1950s and 1960s, the diagnosis of PUD was much different than it was even in Marshall and Warren’t time in the 1980s. That’s because in the 1970s and 1980s fiberoptic endoscopy became the dominant method of diagnosing PUD. Not only did it allow for direct visualization of the ulcer, but it also allowed for potential therapy without laparotomy. More relevant for purposes of this discussion, endoscopy allows isolation of the H. pylori that causes PUD. Prior to that, the methods of diagnosis were not as accurate. In general, PUD would be diagnosed by history, physical, and then an upper GI X-ray series, in which the patient would swallow barium-containing slurries, after which fluoroscopy would visualize the stomach and duodenum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, if you imagine yourself back in the 1950s and 1960s, the time when Dr. Lykoudis practiced, the diagnosis of PUD was less certain than it was in the 1980s. Unless it was severe, it might not even show up on upper GI series, given the limitations of the imaging technology of the time. It wasn’t always possible to distinguish between gastritis and true PUD. Consequently, a lot of diagnosis and treatment of PUD in pre-endoscopy times ended up being a lot more empiric than it is now. The diagnosis was arrived at clinically, and it was symptomatic relief that was used as the main measure of treatment success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what would it have taken to demonstrate, given the technology of the time, that Dr. Lykoudis’ treatment was effective? It would have taken pretty much what it would take today, minus the use of endoscopy. Consequently, we could envision a clinical trial in which standard of care at the time (bland diet, antacids, etc.) was tested against the standard of care plus Dr. Lykoudis’ antibiotic regimen. The design would be simple: Two groups, one receiving standard of care plus placebo, one receiving standard of care plus antibiotics. Alternatively, although it probably wouldn’t be considered ethically acceptable now, back in the 1960s, it probably would have been considered ethical to do an alternative study, directly comparing the then standard of care to Dr. Lykoudis’ antibiotic regimen. Whichever design were chosen, before entry in the study, each patient would have to undergo upper GI to document the presence of PUD and measure its severity. They would also have to undergo upper GI at the end of the study to document healing. Throughout the study, pain scores would be measured, and patient outcomes tracked to see what proportion of patients end up requiring surgery for their PUD and which proportion can go back to eating a regular diet. Unfortunately, Dr. Lykoudis didn’t have data anywhere near that level of rigor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, what I’m describing above is the equivalent of what we would call today a phase III clinical trial. In general, phase III trials aren’t started without preliminary data. But what sort of preliminary data are usually needed to provide adequate scientific justification for a phase III trial? Today, we require preclinical evidence in the form of cell culture and animal studies, as well as lesser levels of clinical evidence, such as smaller trials like phase I or phase II trials. The preclinical data provide scientific justification and plausibility, and the human data bolster that. Of course, we can’t apply today’s standards to the science of 50 years ago. Back then, the methodology and ethics of randomized clinical trials were not as advanced and well-worked out as they are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens if we look at Dr. Lykoudis’s story and whether he might have had enough data to justify a large phase III-like clinical trial in the time in which he was practicing? By today’s standards, he probably did not. As Kimball pointed out, although plausibility does not mean understanding the mechanism, it does mean that there should be a potentially plausible mechanism, as there does not exist, for example, for homeopathy. The concept that there might be a bacterial cause of PUD is not, on the surface, incredibly implausible. But was it plausible enough to justify a clinical trial of the sort that Dr. Lykoudis proposed? What would it take? This is &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lK4ATW-lQZQC&amp;amp;dq=helicobacter+pioneers&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=bn&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=PHuqS5ntFIT68Ab_5u2ABw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=4&amp;amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;what Dr. Lykoudis proposed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1967, Lykoudis succeeded in getting the attention of the Prime Minister’s office. His correspondence with the Minister of Health on 21 August, 1967, a sad document indeed, is revealing. He registers his frustration that medications with apparently no effect on PUD were approved, whereas Elgaco was repeatedly rejected. He proposes, in essence, a phase III trial: 100 PUD patients to be treated at a State hospital by the eminent professors, 50 with conventional treatment and 50 with Elgaco. ‘Their refusal to approve it is understandable, but their refusal to test it is not!’ he writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A not unreasonable assertion. Unfortunately, as Kimball pointed out, the technology to isolate and culture &lt;em&gt;H. pylori&lt;/em&gt; didn’t exist at the time. Absent that, providing strong evidence for a bacterial etiology for PUD would require an obvious and strong response to antibiotics in the form of unambiguous symptom relief and healing documented on followup upper GI imaging studies. Even if Lykoudis had had that, he would have been unable to culture the organism responsible for PUD, which would have left scientists in a quandary. Response to antibiotics is storngly suggestive of an infectious etiology, but, absent an organism, one can never determine for sure whether it is in fact a bacteria causing a disease or the antibiotic has an activity other than its ability to kill bugs, an additional activity. For example, erythromycin increases GI motility. Thus, in the context of the time, it’s not surprising that Lykoudis’ ideas were considered highly implausible, and it would have required very strong evidence to make the idea seem plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Novella made a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4238#comment-46245"&gt;cogent observation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But taken at face value, I think the real lesson is that process is more important than whether or not one turn’s out to be correct. Science is about process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with Lykoudis is that his behavior was indistinguishable from the myriad quacks and charlatans that existed then and exist today. That in hind sight one turned out to be on the right track is not all that surprising, and their contemporaries should not be faulted for their inability to predict the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is – what did Lykoudis do to convince the scientific community of his claims. Did he perform carefully controlled double-blind placebo-controlled trials? Did he attempt to enlist the help of a microbiologist to try to isolate the organism? Or did he just expect people to take his word for it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did he do to deserve being taken seriously? Being right in the hindsight of history is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think that this is the key point. Science is a process. It is by its very nature constrained by what is known at any given time in history. In the context of Dr. Lykoudis’s time and given what was known then, it is not surprising that his idea would have encountered heavy resistance from the scientific orthodoxy of the time. Another issue to consider is regional variation in physicians’ attitudes. One example I like to use to illustrate this is the reaction of European physicians to the ideas of Ignaz Semmelweis. Semmelweis, as most readers will recall, first demonstrated that the high rate of puerperal fever in the obstetrics ward run by physicians was due to physicians not washing their hands after doing autopsies, going straight from the morgue to the delivery room. Semmelweis’ findings were far more favorably received in England, for example, than they were on the continent. It is possible, although by no means assured, that Lykoudis’ ideas might have been better received if he had lived in a different part of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s one final consideration. Science is performed by human beings. Although it is a process designed to overcome human biases, communicating the results of scientific research is subject to the same idiosyncracies to which any human communication is subject. Anyone who’s ever been to a scientific conference knows that. It is quite possible to be right and, to put it bluntly, to piss off the very scientists that need to be convinced so much that they harden their positions protecting the scientific consensus. One example is Semmelweis himself. Sherwin Nuland, in his book The Doctors’ Plague: Germs, Childbed Fever and the Strange Story of Ignac Semmelweis, suggested that if Semmelweis had communicated his findings more effectively and managed not to antagonize the medical establishment so thoroughly he might not have been marginalized and dismissed in the manner that he was. At the very least, he may not have been met with as much hostility. Galileo, although apparently not intentionally, alienated the Pope at the time by putting his words in the mouth of a character named Simplicio defending the Aristotelian Geocentric view in &lt;em&gt;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&lt;/em&gt;. Reading between the lines, one can see echoes of this sort of antagonism in Lykoudis’s story. Indeed, Michael Phillips of St. Vincent’s Medical Center wrote in an &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10675202"&gt;letter to &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I propose a less dramatic metaphor: medicine is a marketplace of ideas, with sellers and buyers. Sellers (innovators with new ideas) advertise their intellectual property to potential buyers (other physicians). This buying public is highly sophisticated and sceptical. Quite correctly, physicians will only accept the highest quality new ideas because the lives of their patients are at risk. So physicians buy only when they see the hallmark of quality: publication in a respected peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That in a nutshell explains the tragedy of John Lykoudis. He had a wonderful intellectual product: the insight that peptic ulcer disease is infectious, supported by the evidence that it can be cured with antibiotics. But he lacked the ability (or the training) to sell this insight to his colleagues. He was a retail trader who treated individual patients instead of targeting the wholesale market of other physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is the problem. Most physicians are not scientists, and many physicians are very prone to being swayed by anecdotal evidence. Without well-designed clinical trials based on the best basic and translational science available, way to validate or refute anecdotal data. I find Lykoudis’s story to be a cautionary tale. Whether he was correct and thus the true “Galileo” of &lt;em&gt;H. pylori&lt;/em&gt;, rather than Warren and Marshall or whether he was just another crank, his story demonstrates that we scientists should be very careful to guard against excessive smugness. As has been repeated by many skeptics in many variants over the years, it is not sufficient to claim the mantle of Galileo as a persecuted martyr for science. You must also be right. Even though it is not clear whether, taken in the context of the time, Lykoudis was a crank or a misunderstood physician who was ahead of his time, Warren and Marshall’s vindication of his ideas that PUD is bacterial in etiology reminds us that not all who claim the mantle of Galileo are necessarily cranks. The vast majority usually are, but on very rare occasions we do see a real Galileo.&lt;/p&gt;

I assure you all, and Carl Zimmer, that this duck has a &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/12/22/kinkiness-beyond-kinky/"&gt;corkscrew-shaped penis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is in all of its ducky glory:&lt;br&gt;&lt;img style="TEXT-ALIGN:center;MARGIN:0px auto 20px;DISPLAY:block" alt="duck cake2.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/03/duck%20cake2-thumb-400x533-43742.jpg" width="400" height="533"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: "Duck, yeah!"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s pound cake with buttercream frosting.  I decided at the last minute that he needed to be sitting in a bubble bath and put him in a mixture of champagne gummies and classic white frosting.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For  Nekohime, who asked in the previous duck cake post, I got this pan at a local bake shop.  It&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.wilton.com/shapedpan/3-D-Rubber-Ducky-Pan"&gt;from the Wilton brand &lt;/a&gt; line.  I am not a giant fan of Wilton&amp;#39;s pans because I always manage to get some cake stuck to the pan, no matter how much I grease the pan.  Still, they&amp;#39;re inexpensive and you can find them darn near anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my baking adventures, I got to thinking about how science could benefit the baking world.  That&amp;#39;s when I realized, as I was piping all of those ridiculous stars all over the duck, that what I really needed was an 8 channel decorator&amp;#39;s bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="TEXT-ALIGN:center;MARGIN:0px auto 20px;DISPLAY:block" alt="8 channel decorator bag.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/8%20channel%20decorator%20bag.jpg" width="336" height="253"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Basically, it would look like this.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might be on to something here...&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes all you can think of is having sex. Come on. You know this is true. Sometimes it dominates your thinking. You cannot wait to have it. You fantasize about it. You must have it. It is probably the best natural high we experience. &lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So why is an orgasm such a powerful motivator? It's not like we need it. We just want it. The power of the orgasm is so strong it motivates some married people into infidelity; some men to rape women; some Catholic priests to direct these urges toward molesting children; and it drives the prostitution and the pornography industries, including child pornography.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The orgasm just does not look like something that a divine being would create. It is way too powerful of a motivator. The three masters of suspicion, Nietzsche, Marx and Freud all argued respectively that the three motivators in life are Power, Money, and Sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So why did God make our sex drive so strong? Why didn't he make the the orgasm less pleasurable? The pleasure of the orgasm is just too strong as it is. We all know this. With an evolutionary hypothesis this is what we'd expect to find, for our sex drive is good for the survival of our species. But under a theistic hypothesis it makes no sense. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the pleasure of the orgasm was reduced there would be fewer sex crimes, and less infidelity. Or, the orgasm could've been created so as not to be pleasurable at all. God could've made the sex drive to be something of an instinct where we only want to do it when we want children, and then also created our desire to have children periodically. If this is what God had done instead, then with divine commands to populate the world, heterosexual people would only have sex for the purpose of bearing children in fulfillment of his commands, and that's it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, the urge for sex seems to be too strong for most of us to overcome it. So why would God create us with this powerful urge and then prohibit it except under one set of conditions, a monogamous lifelong heterosexual married life? To masturbate certainly involves lust, does it not? But Jesus is found to prohibit lusting. What about sex before marriage? What's wrong with that? Most people in today's society, even Christians, have sex before marriage. What about people who will never be married? What about people who will spend the rest of their lives in prison? [I taught college classes for a women's correctional facility and many of them said that lesbian sex was the best sex they ever had! What's the aternative for them?] What about the few years between marriages for people who are divorced? And what best explains the fact that there are many homosexuals in our world? Why would God create this strong urge for them and also condemn such an activity? This too makes no sense on a theistic hypothesis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hell, I'll even bet all this talk about sex will cause some readers to do a search right now for a sex site, even Christians. Say it isn't so. Christian, you search for sex sites. Yet you feel guilty about it. The problem is that any prohibitions that make you feel guilty about this do not come from God.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-3469311420601264933?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

When I first heard about it, I was interested, but not hopeful. Streaming video to a computer monitor is one thing. But blowing that up enough for a 30" TV while still having decent resolution is more difficult. And with the challenges from movie companies to limit online content, the selection is bound to be limited.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I went ahead and plopped it in and checked it out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So far, I'm very impressed. I've watched a few movies and the quality has been superb. &lt;a href="http://www.watchtheguild.com/"&gt;The Guild&lt;/a&gt; was nice and shiny. Angles &amp;amp; Demons was perfectly clear. Ghost in the Shell, a bit fuzzy, but then again, it&amp;#39;s an older anime series and they tend to look that way anyway. So we&amp;#39;ll go with it faithfully reproducing the quality of the source material.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In what I've watched so far, there hasn't been even a second of lag once the movie has buffered. Speedy servers on Netflix's end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as the selection, 14/94 items on my original queue have online streaming available. Some of it is anime, which only streams as the dubbed version, so I'll probably get the disks on that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I flipped through the items available from the menu and found several more things I probably wouldn't have added to my DVD queue, but would definitely stream episodes of here and there. For example: The first four seasons of Mythbusters! Epic. Dr. Who? Got it. Carl Sagan's Cosmos? Yeah, it's there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, the streaming to Wii (and other systems) is awesome. Limited, but hopefully it will continue to grow.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-7907880213519310615?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269820530012"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/poll_of_the_martyrs.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e4b71da32ab24d8b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">Poll of the Martyrs</title><published>2010-03-28T23:59:50Z</published><updated>2010-03-28T23:59:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/0pTeYnwhZTA/poll_of_the_martyrs.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/poll_of_the_martyrs.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;They run the country, they surround us, they get cranky if you even question their deity…but they&amp;#39;re so darn &lt;i&gt;persecuted&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TAM (&lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/amazing-meeting.html"&gt;The Amazing Meeting&lt;/a&gt;) is &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/announcements/australian-skeptics-announce-tamaustralia2010/"&gt;coming to Australia&lt;/a&gt; this year, the last weekend in November. The first &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/events/tam_australia_2010/"&gt;official lineup&lt;/a&gt; lineup of speakers has just been officially announced: James Randi, DJ Grothe, SGU, Brian Dunning, George Hrab, Dr Eugenie Scott, Dr Karl Kruszelnicki and MC Dr Paul Willis. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#TAMOz&lt;/strong&gt; appears to be the ‘official’ tag on Twitter. I have noticed that &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/LeslieCannold/status/11186225819"&gt;Dr Leslie Cannold&lt;/a&gt; made an initial observation along the lines of ‘where’s the women?’ and then acknowledged how there’s only two women represented so far (I don’t like the use of the word ‘chick’, but I guess that’s her choice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met &lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org.au/dr-leslie-cannold/"&gt;Leslie Cannold&lt;/a&gt;, in case you don’t know who she is, at the &lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org.au/"&gt;Global Atheist Convention in Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. She was on a panel dedicated to women and atheism, including Jane Caro, Lyn Allison, Tanya Levin and (Maggie Millar was taken ill at the last minute and was replaced by) Meredith Doig. There was also myself as an MC / presenter, and activist Taslima Nasrin amongst the women who you would have seen on the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thoughts? I’m wondering if that indicates how there’s smaller population of people who would identify themselves as ‘&lt;em&gt;skeptic&lt;/em&gt;‘ in comparison to those who would identify themselves as ‘&lt;em&gt;atheist&lt;/em&gt;‘ and thus making the task of including women in the TAMOz lineup more difficult? This was something I pointed out in my presentation – that those who would be categorised as atheist and female in the population of 1243 people is larger than those who would be ‘non-believers’ in horoscopes, psychic healing, lucky charms and the like (let alone, possibly, atheist &lt;em&gt;as well&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assume that every atheist woman in the audience was a skeptic (and from my experiences, I would say that there &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; going to be an obvious correlation!) would make it easier for people to say ’see, there’s a lot of skeptically-minded women!’ – but it would be easier &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; if skeptical women are identified as potential presenters to TAMOz who are also qualified, confident and have relevant things to say… all of this I covered in my earlier blog-posts on having &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2009/08/why-dragoncon/"&gt;inclusive opportunities to speak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?p=329"&gt;women in skepticism who are qualified&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2010/03/presenting-minorities-and-the-token-skeptic-at-atheistcon"&gt;people presenting in general and the issues, and so forth&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one thing to say ‘we need &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;‘ – another to have ‘we need more and &lt;em&gt;we have examples of those who do it well&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;know what they’re doing&lt;/em&gt;‘. But then, we’d expect that no matter who you were – wouldn’t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly the big thing about ‘coming out as atheist’ that was promoted at the Global Atheist Convention might have been a factor in my casual count of a crowd attending the Friday opening, of about 40/60% women to men. No details as of yet as to actual population of gender ratio at the GAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, also present at the Global Atheist Convention was quite a buzz about #TAMOz it being ‘the next event to go to’ (&lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; without my mentioning its existence to anyone in any capacity beyond casual discussion!), so I’d be surprised if there &lt;em&gt;wasn’t &lt;/em&gt;some effort to make it a little more inclusive in future announcements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be quite a few people who do not consider themselves particularly ’skeptically minded’ who would go just to ‘find out what it’s all about’ – certainly Dr Cannold seems interested in finding out more in regards to the gender balance. This may be a great opportunity to find out what interests people in skepticism. If there are new people wanting to learn, be supported, have more interaction – and whether what is being provided by the Australian Skeptics or the JREF is meeting that demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org.au/gallery/?nggpage=2"&gt;&lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Picture-71-1024x608.png" alt="" width="334" height="198"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The question remains unanswered as to whether having women on the stage who are qualified and engaging presenters will then automatically mean more women identifying themselves as ’skeptically-thinking’ – and what do they do next? For all I know, it will be the likes of &lt;em&gt;Dr Karl&lt;/em&gt; who will spark some sense of activism and incite new projects amongst a group of women who attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I guess that would mean that we’ll be seeing skeptical women like Sue-Ann Post, Dr Krissie Wilson, Dr Rachael Dunlop, and the like in the audience at the very least. Naturally, I’d love to be able to talk more about the research that Dr Martin Bridgstock and I did, because there’s some very significant findings that have not been formally announced. I have no idea if I will have that opportunity – at the very least, Dr Martin Bridgstock should. You see? Even I know that Dr Martin will most likely capture your attention with his verve and vibrant character, and he’s most definitely a bearded guy! &lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s early days yet and for all we know, there’ll be additional elements like panels and workshops like they have at the Las Vegas Amazing meetings? Since the ‘Sunday Papers’ no longer feature at the Vegas ones, perhaps the opportunity for offshoot presentations will exist in another format at both of these upcoming events. Certainly Dr Leslie Cannold will be keeping an eye out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh – nearly forgot (heh, a plug again, like I did at GAC!) – if you want to hear examples of female skeptic speakers from Australia, have a listen to the Skeptic Zone podcast! &lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

I can't really remember the last time I actually had a decent online argument with a believer of one form or another. I've had one or two exchanges that looked promising, and some that went around in frustrating circles, but mostly my recent arguments have been with other skeptics. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it's getting tiresome. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It'd be different if there were some other topic, but it's always the same damn point: outspoken atheists are hurting the skeptical cause/making skeptics look bad/tearing the skeptical movement apart/overstepping the bounds of science and skepticism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suffice it to say, I disagree. But in my disagreement, I'm not chastising other skeptics for being too soft on religion. I'm not telling other skeptics that I think the future of skepticism lies in hardcore affirmative atheism. I'm not crafting bizarre strawmen about how accomodationist skeptics want to kick out all the outspoken atheists so they can purify the party. I'm not trying to redefine science to say that it must weigh in negatively on all god hypotheses. I'm not attaching "-gate" to every minor disagreement on message boards or blogs or Twitter. I'm not suggesting that the only way to combat woo is through ridicule and derision. I'm not arrogantly asserting that my way of approaching skepticism and atheism is the right way or the only way--or even that there is some single better way--to do so. And I'm certainly not telling other people in the movement that they're going to tear the movement apart by being insufficiently outspoken about their godlessness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See, I can disagree without thinking that everyone else should share my opinion or methods. Why the hell does this seem to be such a rare position?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look, skeptics come from a bunch of different backgrounds. We have a bunch of different beliefs and personalities and philosophies. We ought to embrace that, not try to shove everyone into one pigeonhole or another. And the &lt;i&gt;last&lt;/i&gt; thing we should do is set aside the beliefs or ideas of one group of people as beyond the reach of critical questioning, whether for reasons of politisse or apparent impossibility. I think we should be as willing to question Hal Bidlack's faith as we are Penn Jillette's climate change "agnosticism" or Bill Maher's anti-medicine stance or Michael Shermer's libertarianism. In fact, I'd say that most aspects of libertarianism (and politics in general) are much farther outside the range of science than, say, religious belief or assertion of a deity's existence, and yet I think we should apply the same skeptical approach to it as we would to any other worldview. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But other people disagree, and that's okay. Just don't tell me I'm doing it &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt; because my priorities and philosophies differ from yours. Don't tell me that science and skepticism have some magical invisible boundaries that you've dreamed up (and that the vast majority of scientists and skeptics would disagree with). Don't tell me that certain methods--such as ridicule, parody, and the occasional angry rant--are counterproductive when those methods are among the most visible and popular (even outside the movement). Don't tell me that I'm tearing apart the movement when my philosophy is "everyone should be able to do their own thing, but nothing should be exempt from questioning." Don't tell me--in any variation of terms or degree of subtlety--that your way is the one right way to do things. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if you want to tell me any of those things, then I've got one demand: &lt;b&gt;present the data, or shut the fuck up&lt;/b&gt;. Because the one thing I haven't seen from any of these self-proclaimed etiquette cops and method masters is &lt;i&gt;evidence&lt;/i&gt;. Strange that people who want to define skepticism and set the stage for the next phases of the movement would omit such a key component of any skeptical argument.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20494433-8884471839324038012?l=dubitoergo.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Foss</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Dubito Ergo Sum</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269815951808"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=22896">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/122b2a8318e8b04b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Flying Spaghetti Monster Toast</title><published>2010-03-28T22:00:49Z</published><updated>2010-03-28T22:00:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/28/flying-spaghetti-monster-toast/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Toast is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve previously treated the immoral atheists/skeptics belief in my post &lt;a href="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/2008/03/03/jesus-hitler-the-moral-atheist/"&gt;Jesus Hitler – the Moral Atheist.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a stereotype, as much as the pedophilic Priest, the church-going serial killer, and the hypocrite who spends time in the confessional to atone for a week of sinning so He can go out and sin all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/faith-hope-charity-11.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:5px" title="faith, hope, charity" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/faith-hope-charity-11.jpg?w=216&amp;amp;h=191" alt="" width="216" height="191"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As Sir Paul and Stevie tell us, there’s good and bad in everyone, so I’m just another saintly sinner. But I also see myself as a caring person. I try to do volunteer work wherever I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to help out at my local St Vincent de Paul dinner hall, preparing and serving meals for homeless and low socio-economic people. But the food was great I’d even see people in business suits lined up for lunch, and everyone was welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to be empathetic towards the plights that affect us; if a loved one dies of cancer, we might donate to a relevant research organization, or buy a daffodil on &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/PAR/PAR_4_Daffodil_Days.asp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daffodil Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as I do for my Uncle Bruce who died of thyroid cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have empathy for blind people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago I used to see a blind man (oh, very funny Karen!). He opened up my eyes (stop it…) to the problems encountered by vision impaired people, such as the fact that most “vision impaired” people aren’t impaired in their vision, they’re &lt;strong&gt;blind&lt;/strong&gt;. I had been blind to these issues before (really, Karen, if you do this once more I’m leaving and reporting you to any and every anti-discrimination board I can find…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this personal interest and new insight (okay, fuck off then…see if I care. Ed.), I became a volunteer for two blindness and low vision organizations. I became a narrator for &lt;a href="http://www.worldcat.org/libraries/99709"&gt;The Australian Listening Library&lt;/a&gt;, where I would read and record entire books, and mostly romance novels at that (no comment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But part of my vision (I bet you’re still reading this, aren’t you? You can’t help yourself) was to help at a local level. I contacted &lt;a href="http://www.rvib.org.au/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vision Australia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (formally the Royal Blind Society) and applied to become a narrator for my local newspaper, the “Talking” Armidale Express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was told, “the testing is tough, a local DJ one applied and wasn’t accepted.” Unfazed, I sat for their tests, and with my engaging reading style and sweet, honeyed tones, I passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two years I recorded the Talking Armidale Express once per month. I had to read and record the main stories, plus any additional articles I might think of interest. I also had to read the obituaries, as my listeners were mostly elderly and immobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked with a few other narrators, including Elizabeth, an incredible lady who was losing her own sight. One day I had to take over her duties as she went completely blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My voice was so popular that I was enlisted to read the newsletter of the local seniors’ organization, and I even won an award for my services to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then came my fall from grace…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, the Director for the Talking Newspapers called me. I was out at the time of her call, so I found the following message on my answering machine when I arrived home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Karen, we’ve had a complaint made against you. Were you aware that there is an offensive message at the end of your latest reading?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a panic I scrounged for the master copy of my recording and listened to the entire reading. After my forty minute recording I suddenly heard the voice of my boyfriend. He had been testing the cheap, old, unreliable cassette recorder I’d been using because it often had problems recording in stereo. But he hasn’t been “testing, testing…1, 2, 3…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My jaw dropped as I heard the recording. My blind, elderly listeners could hear a minute of my boyfriend singing repetitively:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why don’t you go get fucked? Why don’t you go and get fucked? &lt;em&gt;Why don’t you just go and get fucked&lt;/em&gt;…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least it was recorded in stereo…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2010/03/25/scientology-a-history-of-violence/"&gt;&lt;img title="story.scientology.getty" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/story-scientology-getty.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=169" alt="" width="300" height="169"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve made few posts here before about the &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/dianetic.html"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt;, which I consider to be a dangerous &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/cults.html"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m all for having mainstream media outlets challenge them openly.  And I think CNN’s Anderson Cooper is a good person to do the sleuthing on such nonsense (just recall how well he publicly &lt;a href="http://www.stopsylvia.com/articles/ac360_brownesbestevidence.shtml"&gt;debunked psychic Sylvia Browne&lt;/a&gt;).  The biggest problem I personally have with Scientology isn’t their outright goofy beliefs about the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenu"&gt;alien-god Xenu&lt;/a&gt; and space-ghosts called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thetan"&gt;“thetans”&lt;/a&gt;, though that’s some pretty damn weird stuff, but the manner in which they deceive &amp;amp; cheat their followers out of literally hundreds of thousands of dollars by the time they learn the Church truths (which are little more than a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bad sci-fi story).  Not to mention, &lt;a href="http://xenu.net/archive/infopack/1.htm"&gt;the organization actively works to conceal these “truths” from their members&lt;/a&gt; until they’ve paid so much money to the Church that it’s very difficult for them to extract themselves from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, those who dare oppose the Church and publicly criticize them are often subjected to all manner of personal attacks and/or harassment under the Church’s policy called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Game_%28Scientology%29"&gt;“Fair Game”&lt;/a&gt; which declares such critics (using very Orwellian lingo) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressive_Persons"&gt;“suppressive persons”&lt;/a&gt;.  I am also opposed to the Church because they encourage their followers to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disconnection"&gt;“disconnect”&lt;/a&gt; from their families &amp;amp; friends who might otherwise attempt to talk some sense into them.  And then, as the CNN expose is likely to show, there are other things done in the name of the corrupt &amp;amp; power-hungry Church of Scientology which the Church would rather not have you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some details, provided by Anderson Cooper, about what the program is all about.  I wonder if he’ll be listed as an SP anytime soon?…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next week we begin a four-part investigation into allegations made by  a number of former high ranking members of the Church of Scientology.   The allegations are about physical abuse they say took place within the  Sea Organization, the international management branch of the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These former members, many of whom dedicated their lives to  Scientology, allege that the leader of the church, David Miscavige, has  used physical violence against a number of Sea Organization members.   The church adamantly denies these allegations, and back up their denials  with numerous affidavits and testimonials defending Mr. Miscavige and  attacking those who are speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the church spokesman, Tommy Davis, admits there was a  history of violence in the Sea Organization, but the people he blames  for it are those who are making the allegations against David Miscavige.  He says they were demoted by Mr. Miscavige, and are bitter and  disgruntled.  Some of those making the allegations admit they did engage  in violent acts, but say it was at the urging of Mr. Miscavige.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no real proof offered by either side, but viewers can make  their own assessment.   We have spent several months working on this  series, and believe it is a fair look at the allegations and the counter  claims made by the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already received a number of emails from church members  complaining about the series, and accusing me of attacking the church,  its beliefs, its membership, and its activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the emails are all very similar in content, I assume this  is some sort of organized email campaign. None of those writing the  emails have seen the series, but I appreciate hearing from all concerned  viewers, and I certainly understand any church member, of any religion,  being concerned about the portrayal of their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, I just want to point out that this series is not  about the beliefs or activities of the Church of Scientology. It is not  about the religion or the vast majority of Scientologists.  This series  simply has to do with what some former high ranking church officials say  went on within the upper management of the church, and what happened to  them when they left the church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The program is supported in part by the SAG Foundation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sagfoundation.org/childrens-literacy"&gt;
In 2001, the SAG Foundation&lt;/a&gt; was given a generous grant by Verizon to create five digital videos featuring professional actors reading quality children’s books. These imaginatively produced videos fully captured the intricate illustrations, colors and textures of each book. Those initial 5 stories turned into an internationally recognized website that currently streams 19 stories featuring celebrities including Jane Kaczmarek, Bradley Whitford, Sean Astin, Esai Morales, Amber Tamblyn, Eric Close, and Elijah Wood.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Storyline Online also features supplemental activities for each book developed by an early literacy specialist. Together, the videos and related curriculum strengthen comprehension, verbal and written skills of English language learners worldwide. Available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, free of charge, Storyline Online ensures that every child who has access to an Internet connection can be exposed to a story.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I've listened to &lt;i&gt;Stellaluna&lt;/i&gt; (still a favorite of mine), read by &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0715622/"&gt;Pamela Reed&lt;/a&gt; and James Earl Jones reading &lt;i&gt;To Be a Drum&lt;/i&gt;.  To me, this would be a great resource for early childhood education classes and ESL classes up to about 5th grade.</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269808403817"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/should_pope_ratzi_resign.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ec1754f4ffdc0045</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Should Pope Ratzi resign?</title><published>2010-03-28T19:13:05Z</published><updated>2010-03-28T19:13:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/jsUd5WNb7z0/should_pope_ratzi_resign.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/should_pope_ratzi_resign.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've got a &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/richard_dawkins/2010/03/ratzinger_is_the_perfect_pope.html"&gt;good answer from Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, Pope Ratzinger should not resign.

Go check out the rest of the excellent material at both sites.Of the two podcasts I had the opportunity to be on this week, this one is more to my liking, due to my desire to increase the use of research-based treatments. Having the lead author of one of the studies on the show was another positive. Greg Friese hosts Journal Club 3: Episode 53.There is a much more thorough discussion of these papers on the podcast.The papers covered are:Resuscitation on television: realistic or ridiculous? A quantitative observational analysis of the portrayal of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in television medical drama.Harris D, Willoughby H.Resuscitation. 2009 Nov;80(11):1275-9. Epub 2009 Aug 20.PMID: 19699021 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE].Presented by Rob Theriault.This study raises a lot of interesting questions about the way that people learn about making end of life decisions, what they anticipate the outcome of resuscitation will be, and even how medical professionals may respond to skills presented in TV medical dramas.[1]Dismissing TV dramas as trivial ignores the effect that they may have on members of the audience, up to and including doctors.The Canadian prehospital evidence-based protocols project: knowledge translation in emergency medical services care.Jensen JL, Petrie DA, Travers AH; PEP Project Team.Acad Emerg Med. 2009 Jul;16(7):668-73.PMID: 19691810 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE].Presented by Joe Clark.This is a study that deserves several posts to cover, so I will not even start here. As with the other studies, this paper is discussed on the podcast. My impression is that this resource is wonderful. If you know of a relevant paper that they do not cover on the site, send them a link to it. As with all of science, this will always be a work in progress, but that is certainly not a bad thing.Canadian Prehospital Evidence Based Protocols.Effectiveness of paramedic practitioners in attending 999 calls from elderly people in the community: cluster randomised controlled trial.Mason S, Knowles E, Colwell B, Dixon S, Wardrope J, Gorringe R, Snooks H, Perrin J, Nicholl J.BMJ. 2007 Nov 3;335(7626):919. Epub 2007 Oct 4.PMID: 17916813 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE].Presented by Bill Toon. In the US, we have studies that show an inability of the medics (at least the medics in US studies) to be able to safely direct patients to alternative destinations, such as an appointment with a general practitioner. Is the basic EMS education difference, between the US and the UK, the reason? This study does show that specially trained experienced paramedics can identify stable patients and safely direct these patients to more appropriate resources than the Emergency Department (Accident &amp;amp; Emergency in the UK).This is an education program that appears to focus on critical judgment, rather than protocol adherence. If done the right way, this should be good for patients, and therefore good for EMS and hospitals. The full text PDFs of the three papers discussed on the podcast are available for free (until the next EMS EduCast Journal Club) at the Journal Club page of the EMS Educast.Special guests on the show are Joseph F. Clark, PhD of JosephFClark.com and Jan Jensen of the Canadian Prehospital Evidence Based Protocols.Footnotes:^ 1 Positioning prior to endotracheal intubation on a television medical drama: perhaps life mimics art.Brindley PG, Needham C.Resuscitation. 2009 May;80(5):604. Epub 2009 Mar 18. No abstract available. PMID: 19297069 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]Inadequate positioning of the head and neck was especially prevalent prior to intubation attempts, and improving this was seen as a simple but important first step.As part of ongoing nationwide efforts to ensure basic resuscitation skills5 we explored all potential causes for the inadequate positioning, and this included trainees’ prior experiences. Many trainees reported limited supervision or hands-on training. Remarkably, however, when asked how they had therefore learned, after “trial and error”, a surprising number answered that television medical dramas had been an important inﬂuence.Of the remaining 22, none (0/22) achieved more than one, let alone all three, components of optimal airway positioning. In terms of individual components, the lower cervical-spine was ﬂexed in 0/22, the atlanto-occipital joint extended in 1/22, and the ears level with the sternum in only 3/22 cases.While few would suggest that medical dramas can be held responsible for physician performance, it has been previously suggested that they can significantly inﬂuence beliefs.6, 7This does show that ignoring the effect of medical dramas has the potential to be harmful to patients.Harris, D., &amp;amp; Willoughby, H.

I cover them in more detail here, but just in summary they consist of two proteins,a  sensor and a responder. The sensor senses the change, and activates the responder, which binds to the bacterial DNA and leads the production of a protein that will enact a suitable response.Although Two-Component Systems (TCS) are found in all three superkingdoms of life (Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryotes) they are suspiciously absent from the animal kingdom. Plants have them, as do fungi and several protazoa, but they just aren&amp;#39;t present in animals. For this reason they&amp;#39;ve been looked into as potential antibiotic targets as knocking out the Two-Component Systems of most bacteria is fatal.Why don&amp;#39;t animals use TCSs? To answer this you have to start looking at the evolution of the system itself, because despite being nominally present in eukaryotes such as plants and fungi, TCSs are used very differently in bacteria and archaea. Bacteria use TCSs for sensing a wide variety of signals; stress, metabolism, nutrient regulation, chemotaxis, pathogen-host interactions etc. in eukaryotes on the other hand, they are used sparingly, for ethylene responses and photosensitivity in plants and osmoregulation in fungi and slime moulds.Bacteria (especially soil bacteria which have a lot of environment to sense) can contain up to 50 TCSs although many internal parasite bacteria (with a lot less to sense) contain far less. The maximum for Archaea is around 20 TCSs. Eukaryote number drop right down, with only one in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (one sensor kinase and three response regulators). None have yet been found in any animal genomes, or in the few partial protist genomes sequences (although I doubt if anyone&amp;#39;s had a complete scan through the protist genomes for them).Comparing the TCSs of Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryotes leads to the interesting conclusion that the bacterial and eukaryotic systems are far more closely related than the archaeal, and in fact are thought to be monophyletic (all evolved from a single common ancestor). In contrast, the archaeal TCSs appear to be polyphyletic and some archaea lack TCSs entirely. It&amp;#39;s therefore thought that TCSs originated in bacteria and spread by horizontal gene transfer to both archaea and eukaryotes (until the eukaryotes developed a nuclear membrane). In eukaryotes very little further diversification took place, whereas the bacterial TCSs diversified widely, and occasionally passed new systems back to the archaea. I&amp;#39;ve tried to show this in the diagram below:Diagram made by Lab Rat. Red arrows show the movement (straight arrows) and duplication (curved arrows) of TCS genes. No horizontal gene transfer can take place in eukaryotes after the nuclear membrane (well....it *can* do but very, very rare) although gene duplication may still have occurred.The eukaryotic kingdom appears not to have contained very many of these TCS genes to start with, and the animal kingdom may just have lost the very few it possessed. This makes sense from the point of view of cellular control because while TCSs are very useful in the small genomed and non-nuclear membrane containing bacteria, it&amp;#39;s less clear how useful they are in eukaryotes as a whole. Introducing a membrane around the nucleus makes it harder for proteins to get in and bind to the DNA, and introducing systems of membranes inside a far bigger cell makes it harder for a simple two-component system to sense what&amp;#39;s going on. Added to which, cells inside a multicellular organism don&amp;#39;t really need to sense what&amp;#39;s going on, they get told what&amp;#39;s going on by the surrounding cells and circulating hormones.Whatever the reason though (and any other ideas would be welcomed, the above paragraph is mostly  speculation) it is clear that despite this system being vital for bacteria it isn&amp;#39;t used widely, or most likely at all, in animals. Research into this would be particularly useful against opportunistic pathogens which tend to have a large selection of two-component systems to allow them to adapt to different lifestyles depending on the conditions of their immediate environment.---Kristin K.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/met_in_god_we_still_trust.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/met_in_god_we_still_trust.jpg" alt="met_in_god_we_still_trust" title="met_in_god_we_still_trust" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a couple parents filed a lawsuit, their children were not just told they wouldn’t have to sing the song — they were pulled from the whole concert altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a horrible way for the school to handle the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there’s an &lt;a href="http://jacksonville.com/community/st-johns/2010-03-25/story/case-settled-sides-suit-over-song-st-johns-county-school-still"&gt;update on the case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The School Board settled the 2009 lawsuit Tuesday by agreeing to pay $140,000 and not allow the song to be performed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shirley Davis of St. Augustine said her 8-year-old daughter told her last March that singing the song in Webster School made her “feel bad” because “it makes fun of people who don’t believe in God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis also knew a male parent of a first-grader who had complained a month previously about religious songs at Webster to the school’s teachers and principal, then to administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing was done, she said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money they get after lawyers’ fees is a nice (but not life-changing) chunk.  But this wasn’t about the money.  This was about the school pushing religion into an area in which it didn’t belong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone with half a mind should have known what they were doing was wrong.  But they let it slide and they’re paying the price for it.  We can argue the size of the punishment, but no doubt they deserved one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the school’s &lt;a href="http://www.stjohns.k12.fl.us/about/press/2010-03-23"&gt;press release about the settlement here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat related, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/iris-lee/who-indeed-is-afraid-of-t_b_515783.html"&gt;Iris Erlingsdottir's post on Jenny McCarthy at Huffington Post
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
I'll venture that McCarthy has no less a financial stake in the vaccine wars than Big Pharma and the evil "diagnosticians and pediatricians." There is a lot of money to be made in snake oil pitching and crockpottery -- long known lucrative side industries for aging celebrities -- as she knows from personal experience selling books and the false cures on her website where her sponsors peddle hyperbaric chambers and useless supplements -- in the US, a $24 billion industry annually -- to desperate parents of autistic children. When you have a whole industry -- books, TV appearances, supplements, merchandise -- and the adulation of religiously devoted followers riding on your theory, the stakes are high. Having to admit you're wrong is intolerable. (How's McCarthy's "quantum prayer wheel" working for your kid's autism?) It is much easier to simply reject the truth, which as we know, the vaccine denialists don't care about; it is irrelevant to them. Their attitude is that of Lord Molson: "I will look at any additional evidence to confirm the opinion to which I have already come."

His topic: the evolution of the human brain. Although the lecture &lt;em&gt;precis&lt;/em&gt; implies that Blakemore talked about several topics, the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; singled out one: Blakemore’s apparent assertion that a rapid increase in human brain size a few hundred thousand years ago was due to a “macromutation”—a single change in the DNA of large effect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent lecture, the Oxford neurobiologist argued that a mutation in the brain of a single human being 200,000 years ago turned intellectually able apemen into a super-intelligent species that would conquer the world. In short, Homo sapiens is a genetic accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blakemore asks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is: why is [our brain] so big compared to the brains of our predecessors, such as Homo erectus? Until 200,000 years ago, there had been a gradual increase in brain size among hominins, starting three million years ago. Then, abruptly, there was a remarkable increase of about 30% or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blakemore suggests that this big mutation might have occurred in “mitochondrial Eve,” the woman from whom, he says, we all descend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic studies suggest every living human can be traced back to a single woman called “Mitochondrial Eve” who lived about 200,000 years ago. My suggestion is that the sudden expansion of the brain 200,000 years ago was a dramatic spontaneous mutation in the brain of Mitochondrial Eve or a relative which then spread through the species. A change in a single gene would have been enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Blakemore suggests that the spread of this mutation through our ancestors, and its fixation, was not due to natural selection!:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How have scientists explained this jump in brain size?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many have argued that if there was a dramatic increase in brain size, there must have been a fantastic advantage that came with it: improvements in tool construction, more complex language and other cultural changes. In other words, they say simple natural selection explains what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what is your take on this view?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think they’re fooling themselves. There was very little change in human behaviour at this time, as far as we can see from the fossil record – certainly not one that is explained by a sudden jump in the size of the human brain. These hand-waving arguments about tiny changes in culture explaining the emergence of such a huge change in brain structure just doesn’t hold water. It’s like arguing that a reptile suddenly developed fully formed wings and then sat around for 200,000 years before suddenly saying: Oh my God, I’ve discovered I can fly. It’s ridiculous. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What effect did this have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very little at first. The environment of early humans was so clement and rich in resources that this greedy new brain, which would have absorbed even more of the body’s energy, could be sustained without danger. Later, when times got hard, during droughts or climate changes, it helped us deal with these crises, which could otherwise have killed us off, by dreaming up novel ideas to problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, here are just some of the problems with Blakemore’s thesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  First of all—and this has been endlessly repeated by geneticists—it’s misleading to say that “every living human can be traced back to a single woman called ‘Mitochondrial Eve’ who lived about 200,000 years ago.”  What we know is that all the DNA in &lt;em&gt;one of our cell organelles&lt;/em&gt;, the mitochondrion, descends from a female that lived then. But the rest of our DNA, the vast majority of it, descends from &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; ancestors, so that each bit of our genome comes from (to use the technical jargon “coalesces back to”) a different ancestral individual.  Our genome is a mosaic of bits of DNA from different people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial “Eve” was the ancestor of &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; our mitochondrial DNA. It’s extremely improbable (I’d say the chances are zero) of any other gene not in the mitochondrial DNA descending from this same woman. Blakemore does allow that the big-brain mutation could have occurred in a “relative” of Eve, but that’s not necessary either, except in the sense that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; humans living at that time were relatives because they shared a common ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  There’s not the slightest bit of evidence that this large increase in brain size resulted from a single mutation in the DNA.  Yes, the increase in brain size may have been &lt;em&gt;geologically&lt;/em&gt; sudden, but we can get things that would &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; instantaneous in the fossil record through a sudden bout of natural selection that fixes several or many genes over a relatively short period, say thousands of years.  A punctuated &lt;em&gt;pattern&lt;/em&gt; of evolution does not necessarily point to the occurrence of single “macromutations.” Steve Gould sometimes made this mistake when talking about punctuated equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blakemore has every right to theorize about macromutations, but in a public lecture (or interview) it would be seemly if he mentioned the problems with his “macromutation” idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is that a big change in brain size without a corresponding increase in skull size probably would have been maladaptive, if not fatal. It’s much more likely that brain and skull co-evolved gradually due to the accumulation of several to many mutations, which is normally how the evolution of complex traits occurs in nature. Too, the brain is plastic, but is it plastic enough to suddenly accommodate a 30% increase in volume without evolutionary changes in wiring?   Finally, the usual finding when you look at the genetic basis of “complex” adaptations in the wild (and I’m talking about things other than color, or the &lt;em&gt;disappearance&lt;/em&gt; of traits like stickleback spines), it’s almost always due to more than one gene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  Finally, perhaps the biggest problem with Blakemore’s suggestion is this: if the mutation wasn’t favored by selection,&lt;em&gt; how did it get fixed&lt;/em&gt;? He says that the big-brain mutation was initially “neutral”—that in fact it normally would have been &lt;em&gt;disfavored&lt;/em&gt; because a bigger brain eats up too much metabolic energy, but was tolerated because there were lots of foods and resources around.  Then, when the environment became leaner and meaner, that big mutation would show its adaptive effects. To repeat from above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The environment of early humans was so clement and rich in resources that this greedy new brain, which would have absorbed even more of the body’s energy, could be sustained without danger. Later, when times got hard, during droughts or climate changes, it helped us deal with these crises, which could otherwise have killed us off, by dreaming up novel ideas to problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scenario invokes a big brain as a &lt;em&gt;preadaptation&lt;/em&gt;: a trait that just happened to be hanging around but then became useful when the environment changed.  Note that Blakemore is claiming more than just that the macromutation stayed around at low frequencies because it was &lt;em&gt;tolerated&lt;/em&gt; during fat times and then later became fixed through selection when times got tough.  Rather, he’s asserting that the mutation swept to fixation &lt;em&gt;without natural selection&lt;/em&gt;. Again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, they say simple natural selection explains what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what is your take on this view?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think they’re fooling themselves. There was very little change in human behaviour at this time, as far as we can see from the fossil record – certainly not one that is explained by a sudden jump in the size of the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this scenario pretty implausible.  Implausible not just because you need &lt;em&gt;other changes&lt;/em&gt; in the body (like a bigger cranial capacity and perhaps some new wiring) to accommodate a brain that is suddenly 30% larger, but because Blakemore gives no explanation for how a big mutation that has no effect on fitness (or even a slightly negative effect) swept through the population in the first place (i.e. gets “fixed” as we geneticists say). A mutation can be “tolerated” in a species, but that doesn’t explain why it spreads through the population until everybody has it.  It seems much more likely that changes in brain size, since they were sustained over millions of years of evolution, resulted from natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, we don’t know what &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of selection. There are as many theories for the evolution of bigger human brains as there are theorists.  Suggestions have included the advantages of big brains for hunting, for living in social groups, for attracting females, for trying to suss out the intentions of your fellows, for using tools, and so on.  This is one of the questions whose answer we may never know.  All scientists must live with the idea that some answers are simply beyond our ken. (That’s why it’s easier for us to not invoke gods to explain the unknown.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think that Blakemore’s own suggestion is deficient in several ways.  The &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; can’t point them out in an interview, but that’s what websites like this one are for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say that although lots of people concoct evolutionary stories about humans, many of those folks could benefit from a little acquaintance with population and evolutionary genetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;America's first legal gigolo leaves rural brothel&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
LAS VEGAS — America's first legal male prostitute has left a rural Nevada brothel after a two-month stint that generated plenty of attention but fewer than 10 paying customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brothel owner Jim Davis said Friday his Shady Lady Ranch had parted ways with the nation's first "prostitude."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prostitude&lt;/em&gt;? Really? That caught the eye of Amy West, who read the wire story in &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/03/27/first_legal_gigolo_leaves_nev_brothel/"&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt; and posted about it on the American Dialect Society &lt;a href="http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1003D&amp;amp;L=ads-l&amp;amp;P=R9676"&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;. Amy rightly suggested the blend should be &lt;em&gt;prostidude&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily find reporting on the &lt;em&gt;prostidude&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;prosti-dude&lt;/em&gt;, including local coverage from &lt;a href="http://www.lvrj.com/news/first--prostidude--leaves-shady-lady-ranch-89211477.html"&gt;The Las Vegas Review-Journal&lt;/a&gt;. Some news outlets even managed to correct the AP story by using &lt;em&gt;prostidude&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;prostitude&lt;/em&gt;, like &lt;a href="http://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20100326/NEWS/100329670/1070&amp;amp;ParentProfile=1058"&gt;The Nevada Appeal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/no-work-for-americas-first-legal-gigolo/article1513439/"&gt;The Globe and Mail&lt;/a&gt;. Cheers to them. But jeers to syndicators of the wire story who either repeated the error or compounded it, &lt;a href="http://blog.oup.com/2007/11/spellchecker/"&gt;Cupertino-style&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/03/26/business/main6336089.shtml"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/capress/100326/world/us_legal_gigolo"&gt;The Canadian Press&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22nation&amp;#39;s+first+prostitute%22"&gt;several others&lt;/a&gt; must have run the AP's &lt;em&gt;prostitude&lt;/em&gt; through their spellcheckers and miscorrected it to &lt;em&gt;prostitute&lt;/em&gt;, resulting in this surprising sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brothel owner Jim Davis said Friday his Shady Lady Ranch had parted ways with the nation's first prostitute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for the oldest profession!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's another Cupertino error that results in &lt;em&gt;prostitute&lt;/em&gt;, by the way. Here's something I wrote in a &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002591.html"&gt;2005 post&lt;/a&gt; on spellchecker miscorrections (before I knew that this phenomenon had been dubbed the &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002911.html"&gt;Cupertino effect&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 1996, this example was noted by a contributor to the Usenet newsgroup &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.usage.english/msg/6f9c15e7b65312c9"&gt;alt.usage.english&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;This happened a few weeks ago to the menu of a well-to-do restaurant here in San Francisco.  The menu was spell-checked, printed, and a copy displayed in the window of the restaurant (as is the custom here). Nobody noticed that the spell-checker turned "warmed spring salad greens with prosciuto" into "warmed spring salad greens with prostitutes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing that the restaurant menu actually had singular &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;prostitute&lt;/span&gt; in place of the intended &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;prosciutto&lt;/span&gt; (or &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;prosciuto&lt;/span&gt;, if the writer missed the extra &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;) — amazingly enough, the custom dictionary in my copy of MS Word accompanying Office XP still doesn't recognize the spiced Italian ham and suggests &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;prostitute&lt;/span&gt; instead. (There's a &lt;em&gt;Sopranos&lt;/em&gt; joke in  there somewhere.) Others have fallen prey to the same unfortunate replacement, as in this recipe appearing on a &lt;a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/italianfood/message/1281"&gt;message board&lt;/a&gt; for Italian food:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Crumble bread sticks into a mixing bowl. Cover with warm water. Let soak for 2 to 3 minutes or until soft. Drain. Stir in prostitute, provolone, pine nuts, 1/4 cup oil, parsley, salt, and pepper. Set aside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Ben Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269786306113"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2010://2.4577">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/af1cda5fc7dfca15</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Assault on Science" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Slightly Off Topic" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="globalwarming" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="global warming"/><title type="html">Are Conservation Groups Subverting Action on Global Warming?</title><published>2010-03-28T14:00:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-28T22:09:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/03/are-conservatio.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be slightly off task for PT, but the latest issue of &lt;a href="http://www.thenation.com/" rel="external "&gt;The Nation&lt;/a&gt; magazine has a &lt;a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20100322/hari/single" rel="external "&gt;disturbing article&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that US environmental groups have been co-opted by the corporations whose activities they purport to oppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article, by Johann Hari, shows how conservation organizations such as the National Wildlife Fund and The Nature Conservancy have accepted millions of dollars from companies like Shell and British Petroleum in return for touting their supposedly “green” activities and soft-pedaling their not-so-green activities. Thus, the World Wildlife Fund defends IKEA against (accurate) charges that some of its furniture is made from trees harvested from endangered forests, and the Sierra Club endorses supposedly green products from Clorox without serious investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, not mentioned by Hari, the Environmental Defense Fund has gotten into bed with Walmart, repeatedly praising them for marketing organic foods and where possible buying locally. You may read a puff piece, The Great Grocery Smackdown, by Corby Kummer, in The Atlantic &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/03/the-great-grocery-smackdown/7904/" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I am inclined to agree with one or two commenters to the Kummer article: Walmart puts the squeeze on everyone and now is starting in on local farmers. The main effect of its foray into organic foods may be to put even more local businesses out of business. A smallish contributor to EDF for decades, I have been concerned for months about their entanglement with Walmart, and Hari’s article has all but convinced me to drop them in favor of some other similar organization – if I can find one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hari also takes carbon offsets to task. If you have enough money, then you can pay somebody not to cut down trees in South America and continue your usual profligate behavior at home, all the while priding yourself on doing something for global warming. Unfortunately, the person you have paid not to cut down trees can simply take the money and cut down some other trees somewhere else, and Greenpeace has evidently documented precisely such behavior. Carbon offsets at best have negligible value and at worst make us think we are doing something when we are not. Indeed, if the donors do not reduce their consumption of energy and the donees continue to cut down their trees, then in reality we have made absolutely no progress toward reducing global warming. (Hari says that the carbon offset has actually doubled emissions, but I think that is incorrect or poorly worded.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hari’s article should not be surprising in a country that can barely take a baby step toward universal health insurance because its Congress has likewise been co-opted by giant corporations. But, as Hari notes, if we are right about global warming, then a disaster is in the making, and incrementalism will not solve the problem. We may kill a few tens of thousands of our citizens by not moving fast enough on health insurance, but we can cause worldwide disaster by not moving fast enough on global warming. The climate we have today is the climate in which we and our institutions have evolved, and we change it at our peril.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hari sees a ray of hope in the new leadership of the Sierra Club (which elects its own leaders) and in the founding of &lt;a href="http://www.350.org/home" rel="external "&gt;350.org&lt;/a&gt;, an organization about which I intend to learn more. In the meantime, I am very much inclined to take Hari’s advice and “shun” organizations such as The Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;, March 28, 2010, 4:10 p.m., MDT:  Since I get The Nation on paper and rarely read the website, I overlooked an exchange &lt;a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20100322/forum" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; between Hari and some of his critics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is about a phenomenon whose importance in speciation is contested: &lt;em&gt;reinforcement&lt;/em&gt;. Reinforcement describes a form of natural selection that can actually increase the reproductive barriers between a pair of species that descend from a common ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’ve mentioned on this site, most evolutionists define “species” as “groups of populations separated from other such groups by &lt;em&gt;reproductive isolating barriers&lt;/em&gt; (RIBS, an appropriate Chicago acronym).” Those barriers are all the genetically-based traits of organisms that prevent them from exchanging genes where they co-occur in nature.  RIBS include things like mate discrimination, a preference for living in different niches (so that members of different species don’t encounter each other), different mating seasons, or the sterility or lethality of any hybrids that are formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us think that these barriers are simply the byproduct of evolutionary divergence that occurs when geographically isolated populations of a single species begin to evolve in different directions. I give examples of how this works in &lt;em&gt;WEIT&lt;/em&gt;, but the discussion is too long to repeat in this short post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this view of life, species are simply&lt;em&gt; evolutionary accidents&lt;/em&gt;. That is, nature doesn’t somehow favor the production of species, nor does natural selection favor the erection of reproductive barriers between groups &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;.  Rather, physically isolated populations evolve in different directions due to natural selection or random genetic drift, and when that divergence has proceeded to a certain extent, reproductive barriers appear simply as a byproduct. For example, if two species adapt to two different niches, their physiologies may diverge to the point that the combination of both species’ genes in a single hybrid makes it unfit or inviable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is one form of selection that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; favor the evolution of reproductive barriers, and that’s &lt;em&gt;reinforcement&lt;/em&gt;.  Reinforcement begins with two physically isolated populations that have been apart long enough to evolve some barriers to gene flow, but barriers that are not quite complete—so that they can’t qualify as “full” species.  For example, two populations of flies might produce hybrids that are partially (but not completely) sterile, so if they meet there is still the possibility of some gene flow between them through the bridge of semi-fertile hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now assume that these populations expand their ranges and, though previously isolated physically, now encounter each other. (This happens all the time in nature as geographic barriers like rivers, forest, and the like disappear or change their positions.)  Members of the two populations will encounter each other, and some of them will mate.  But if you mate with members of the “wrong” population, some of your offspring will be sterile or partially sterile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is thus an evolutionary disadvantage to mating with the wrong group, and an advantage to mating with the “right” one. Under these conditions, natural selection will favor individuals with genes that favor their mating with the right group, because those genes leave more copies than genes that don’t promote discrimination—”nondiscrimination” genes tend to wind up in sterile hybrids!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, over time, a partially isolated species can become a fully isolated one through natural selection, and that’s how reinforcement works.  It’s a process that directly favors the erection of reproductive barriers, and can, we think, put the finishing touches on speciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that though this sounds nice, and can indeed work if you make mathematical models, it’s hard to demonstrate in nature.  To do so, you’d need to show that, in a pair of species that have some geographical overlap, the degree of mate discrimination, or of other reproductive barriers that prevent the formation of hybrids, is higher between populations in the area of overlap than it is between populations taken from areas where they don’t overlap (these tests are done in the laboratory).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few promising examples of this (one was published in 1995 by my ex-student Mohamed Noor), but the frequency of reinforcement remains unclear. (When I was young, I was taught, for example, that it was &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; the final step in speciation. That of course can’t be true, because speciation can go to completion between groups that &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; contact each other in nature, for example species like the Galápagos tortoise that evolved after an ancient colonization of a remote island.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel noted that the species of &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; on the small African island of São Tomé, where we’ve worked for some years, have a distribution that looks promising for studying reinforcement.  One species, &lt;em&gt;Drosophila yakuba (“yak”)&lt;/em&gt;, lives not only on the island but also on the African mainland.  The other species, &lt;em&gt;D. santomea&lt;/em&gt; (“&lt;em&gt;san&lt;/em&gt;“) is endemic only to the island, and presumably evolved after the island was colonized by the ancestor of &lt;em&gt;yak&lt;/em&gt; (we estimate this happened about 400,000 years ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is propitious for studying reinforcement because, on the island, which is basically a volcanic mountain, the species have overlapping distributions: &lt;em&gt;yak&lt;/em&gt; lives at sea level and up to about 1400 meters on the mountain, while&lt;em&gt; san&lt;/em&gt; is found between 1100 and 1400 meters. There is thus an area of overlap between 1100 and 1400 meters, and in this area you can find a few hybrids (about 5% of the individuals).  These hybrids are at a disadvantage, evolutionarily, because half of them—all the males—are sterile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we have two species with overlapping ranges, some hybridization in the area of overlap, and the possibility of gene flow through the fertile female hybrids.  This is just the situation we need to look for reinforcement.  So, is the mating discrimination between &lt;em&gt;yak&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;san&lt;/em&gt; stronger when they come from the area of overlap than from the areas where they don’t overlap? (Remember, we do these tests in the lab and so can examine any pair of strains.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the answer, which we got eight years ago (Coyne &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. 2002), was no: mating discrimination, though strong, was equally strong no matter where you took your samples from. There didn’t seem to be any reinforcement.  We don’t know why, but there are several explanations (perhaps, for example, there simply weren’t any mutations that sharpened mate discrimination.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel, however, went further, and found that there is indeed a form of reinforcement between these species, but not reinforcement of mate discrimination.  Rather, it’s reinforcement of what we call &lt;em&gt;postmating, prezygotic isolation &lt;/em&gt;or&lt;em&gt; gametic isolation: &lt;/em&gt;barriers to gene flow that act after mating but before fertilization. One example is females of one species not using the sperm of males from the “wrong” species if they are inseminated by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Daniel found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  &lt;em&gt;Yak&lt;/em&gt; females from the area of overlap produce many fewer eggs (and progeny) when mated with &lt;em&gt;san&lt;/em&gt; males than do &lt;em&gt;yak&lt;/em&gt; females derived from outside the area of overlap.  Thus, the reproductive barriers between the species were higher from places where they encountered each other. The effect was very strong and highly statistically significant. (Daniel’s Figure 2 shows this clearly).  Daniel didn’t find this effect, however, when he looked at &lt;em&gt;san&lt;/em&gt; females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  But what is the evolutionary advantage of producing fewer eggs/offspring when you’re inseminated by a male of the “wrong species”? For that would have to be the selective pressure that impelled the evolution of the “fewer-egg” syndrome in &lt;em&gt;yak&lt;/em&gt; females who encounter san &lt;em&gt;males&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possibility is that if you live in the area of overlap, and sometimes mate with the wrong species, you have an evolutionary advantage if you can “recognize” this (I’m speaking of course of physiological recognition), dump those foreign sperm that produce semisterile offspring, and thus get a chance to mate sooner with the right species. (Species in this group tend to mate multiple times over their life.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, Daniel showed that when &lt;em&gt;yak&lt;/em&gt; females were mated in the lab to &lt;em&gt;san&lt;/em&gt; males, those females from the area of overlap lost sperm much faster than did &lt;em&gt;yak&lt;/em&gt; females from outside the area of overlap.  And he also showed that those females remated more quickly to their own males (&lt;em&gt;yak&lt;/em&gt;) than did females who hadn’t used up their “wrong” store of sperm. In other words, there was an evolutionary advantage to dumping sperm when you’re inseminated by the wrong species, because by so doing you will, in the long run, produce more offspring with members of your own species. (We don’t know the mechanism by which females from the area of overlap get rid of the wrong sperm more quickly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  So, we find a pattern suggesting reinforcement and show that this pattern comports with how selection should operate.  But can we mimic this whole process in the lab?  Surprisingly, Daniel did, and it took only a few generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel simply forced strains of the two species (taken from areas where they do not encounter each other) to live together in glass bottles in the lab. There were seven different pairs of strains to serve as evolutionary replicates.  Each generation he removed the hybrids, mimicking complete sterility of the hybrids (of course, they’re not completely sterile in nature, but we wanted to avoid gene flow between the species, which makes it harder to tell them apart).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, in only four generations (about two months), he observed that &lt;em&gt;yak&lt;/em&gt; females had indeed evolved the “reinforcement” trait seen in the lab: when inseminated by &lt;em&gt;san&lt;/em&gt; males, those females laid fewer eggs than did “control” &lt;em&gt;yak&lt;/em&gt; females who were reared at the same density, but without the presence of the other species.  Moreover, the degree of mating discrimination also increased, something that we didn’t observe as a pattern in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/strong&gt;:  Well, the reason the study got published in &lt;em&gt;PLoS Biology&lt;/em&gt;, I think, is because it’s not only a rare, pretty-well-documented case of reinforcement, but also because it’s the first case in which reinforcement in nature strengthened not mating discrimination, but a reproductive barrier acting &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; mating: gametic isolation.  Most people hadn’t realized that postmating barriers could be also strengthened by selection.  But they can be, and cases like this may be common.  The reason why they might have been missed is, of course, because detecting the presence of a gametic barrier is much harder than simply measuring increased mate discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to allow some gene flow between the captive species, and see if we can still observe the evolution of gametic (and sexual) reinforcement under more realistic conditions.  After all, in nature some fertile female hybrids are produced in the area of overlap, and presumably mate back to &lt;em&gt;yak&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;san&lt;/em&gt;. That study is underway.  And we’d like to understand why the evolution of higher &lt;em&gt;mating discrimination&lt;/em&gt; occurs so readily in the lab, but isn’t seen in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a h/t to Daniel here, a terrific student who promises to be a star.&lt;/p&gt;

He believes the Earth is less than 10,000 years old and all modern species were created separately. Nelson is also a Fellow of the Discovery Institute. Given these two facts you might wonder if anything he says is worth listening to. The answer is &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;—lots of his writings are very (unintentionally) amusing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul Nelson's latest posting on &lt;i&gt;Uncommon Dissent&lt;/i&gt; falls into a different category. It ain't particularly funny but it does perpetuate a false impression that's very common among the IDiots, and, unfortunately, some others who should know better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's what he says in &lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/massimo-says-its-become-a-religion/"&gt;Massimo Says It’s Become a Religion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;What has changed within the past couple of years, however, is the rapid growth in the overtly religious (anti-religious, but that anti doesn’t really matter) content of the writings of prominent neo-Darwinian biologists, such as Jerry Coyne and Richard Dawkins. The Accomodationist Wars, which show no signs of slacking, illustrate that for many, the whole point of evolutionary theory is Getting Rid of God. A biologist who nonetheless professes his theism (Ken Miller, Simon Conway Morris, Francis Collins, et al.) — well, those people are, at best, confused. Evolution properly understood is irreligious. Not “irreligious” in the sense of indifferent or neutral. Hostile. Read the traffic at Pharyngula, Why Evolution is True, Dawkins’s site, Sandwalk, or dozens of other blogs and discussion boards. [Just to be clear: I (PN) don't think the theory of evolution is irreligious, in the sense of hostile to theism. Philosophical naturalism, however, is. But evolution and naturalism are typically conflated by their advocates.]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The accommodationist wars are about the conflict between &lt;u&gt;science&lt;/u&gt; and religion and not "evolutionary theory" and religion. People like Paul Nelson would like to change the topic because they want to be seen as anti-evolution but not necessarily anti-science. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it's not just "neo-Darwinians"&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; who declare that science and religion are incompatible. All kinds of scientists share this opinion. For example, there are more than a few astronomers and geologists who think the Earth is slightly more than 10,000 years old. They are firmly convinced that science is totally incompatible with Young Earth Creationism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess Paul Nelson doesn't know that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also doesn't know that the big battle is between rationalism and superstition. In this fight atheists are trying to convince theists that their gods are delusions and they should abandon them. Some of these atheists are scientists but many are not. Don't confuse the two fights. "Science vs. religion" overlaps with "rationalism vs. superstition" but "evolution vs. creationism" is often a very separate battle. People like Ken Miller can be mostly with the good guys in "evolution vs creationism" while being on the wrong side of "rationalism vs superstition."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul Nelson isn't the only one who doesn't get this.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1.

Here's what &lt;a href="http://saltosobrius.blogspot.com/2006/04/spring-here-blackbird-evensong.html"&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt; about them four years ago.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, still my heart -- I just heard the year's first blackbird serenade! I opened the kitchen window a crack and listened to it while having my evening sandwich and cup of rooibos. I love the blackbird. It sings at the most unsettling time of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These spring and early summer evenings, when the light never really fades and the blackbird sings its heart out... They fill me with a nameless urgency, a desperate itch for something I can't put words to. Watching myself dispassionately from outside, I can see that it's just the spring rut. But from the inside of my little mammal brain, oh man, it feels like I'll have to walk to Kamchatka to ever find peace again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Turdus merula&lt;/i&gt;, "solitary thrush". In Swedish it's koltrast, "coal thrush". I hope to hear it on my deathbed one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, here’s something random and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday was my friend &lt;strong&gt;Anne&lt;/strong&gt;’s birthday and her boyfriend &lt;strong&gt;Jaime&lt;/strong&gt; decided to throw her a surprise party.  Our college friends were there, along with her family and his.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I brought along a camera… and I added a few captions to the videos below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/0F7dANNxcMQ%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that wasn’t the only surprise he had for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all knew he was going to propose to her; they’ve been dating for a couple years now.  Somehow, we managed to keep the secret from Anne until the time came…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/y-zgNr5bxI4%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely a fun night for everyone &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Yeah, yeah, I know. “Merry” isn’t the correct spelling.  We all figured we should just let the happy couple enjoy the night and we kept our mouths shut about it.)&lt;br&gt;

Proceed with caution.Gregarines are a group of apicomplexans (=&amp;#39;Sporozoa&amp;#39;, a vastly diverse group famous for the malarial parasite Plasmodium and the behaviour-altering Toxoplasma) characterised by a monoxenous (single host) lifestyle that is quite different from that of other &amp;#39;apis&amp;#39;. Christopher Taylor wrote a nice post about them here.Apicomplexa are alveolates along with ciliates and dinoflagellates; you can find them on the left side of this tree . The apicomplexan phylogeny is a complete mess at the moment; the old coccidian-haematozoan-gregarine divisions aren&amp;#39;t too well-supported and the relationships of stuff within them are even murkier. As an aside, many apis have an &amp;#39;apicoplast&amp;#39;, or a relic plastid of red algal origin -- their ancestors were once photosynthetic! In fact, a paraphyletic group of organisms basal to apicomplexa (Chromera et al.) are currently photosynthetic, further supporting the photosynthetic ancestry of these weird mostly-intracellular parasites, most of whom rarely ever see the light of day!Gregarines are typically invertebrate parasites and unlike other apicomplexans, tend to spend most of their lives extracellularly; in fact, their cellular penetration consists of attaching themselves to a cell via the mucron (holdfast-like structure). You can read more about their biology and life cycle on their ToLWeb page. (also a review in Tr Parasitol: Leander 2007) If you want to see some for yourself, kidnapping and slicing up an earthworm is an easy way to do so: Monocystis is a parasite of earthworm seminal vesicles (feeds on sperm), and a rather abundant one.  It may actually be quite easy to find various apicomplexan parasites in insects -- it is estimated that most of them may have an api specialised in parasitising them, which hints at the total apicomplexan diversity being something outrageously vast! Such a project would also be a good excuse to learn insect anatomy, which I find to be quite complicated.Right, you wanted to see a new genus of guitar-shaped gregarines: Trichotokara from the intestine of an onuphid tubeworm. a-e: trophozoites (feeding forms). M - mucron (&amp;#39;holdfast&amp;#39;), CB - cell body. Arrow - junction between mucron and cell body, which can be seen extending further into the mucron in (e; arrowheads). f: gamonts in syzygy, or gregarine sex. Scalebars: a-e 10um; f 25um.  (Rueckert &amp;amp; Leander 2010 J Invert Pathol)By the way, if anyone asks you for a six-letter word in English &amp;#39;devoid of any vowels&amp;#39;, keep &amp;#39;syzygy&amp;#39; in mind. Technically it does have vowels, as any phonologist would tell you, but most people insist on equating letters with sounds, and y &amp;#39;is not a vowel&amp;#39;. Regardless, it&amp;#39;s still a really awesome word. Syzygy!More gregarine awesomeness. Note how the cell surface seems to strive for increased surface area, especially in the mucron which gets inserted into a cell:SEM of Trichotokara. b - close-up of hair-like projections of the mucron. c - junction between mucron and cell body. d - folds along the cell body. Scalebars: a - 10um; b-d - 1um. (Rueckert &amp;amp; Leander 2010 J Invert Pathol)This gives me an excuse to mention a paper on proximate vs. ultimate convergence by the senior author on the above gregarine paper: Leander 2008 JEM (free access). Among several other examples of ultimate convergence between multicellular and unicellular organisms inhabiting similar environments, gregarines and nematodes are compared in terms of their structural organisation. While nematodes have longitudinal muscles just beneath the elastic epidermis, gregarines have subpellicular bands of longitudinal microtubules running just underneath the elastic cortex (although used differently -- see gliding motility below). Curiously, in both cases the result is a sinusoidal (wiggling) pattern of movement. Additionally, tapeworm and Haplozoon (dinoflagellate) surface morphology are noted to be similar (covered with microvili), for the obvious purpose of increasing surface area. It&amp;#39;s probably not much of a stretch to add gregarine surface structure to that list. (see Leander et al. 2003 J Parasitol for more gregarine surfaces) Interesting case of structural ultimate convergence between nematodes and gregarines. Purple - bands of muscle and microtubules, respectively. Blue - elastic epidermis and tri-layered cortex, respectively. The three cortical layers consist of the plasma membrane at the very surface, with two alveolar membranes immediately below. (Leander 2008 JEM)Before we proceed to a digression on apicomplexan motility, oblicatory phylogeny of Trichotokara and relatives. Note its extremely diverged SSU sequence resulting in a hellishly long branch:ML tree of SSU rDNA sequences. Probably wouldn&amp;#39;t trust its exact placement among the gregarines just yet... (Rueckert &amp;amp; Leander 2010 J Invert Pathol)Apicomplexans are generally aflagellate in their trophic stage (I say &amp;#39;generally&amp;#39; just in c...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/iris-lee/who-indeed-is-afraid-of-t_b_515783.html?ref=fb&amp;amp;src=sp#sb=542607,b=facebook&amp;amp;just_reloaded=1"&gt;An anti-anti-vaccine piece published in the least likely place…the Huff Po&lt;/a&gt; – Yes, that’s right. A few weeks after publishing &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;’s incoherent &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jenny-mccarthy/whos-afraid-of-the-truth_b_490918.html"&gt;rant against her critics&lt;/a&gt; they finally post a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on a related note, this amused me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2010/03/28/news-from-around-the-blogosphere-3-27-10/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/aRZHOhXvtHU/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.girlroster.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/heidi_montag_bikini_bigbreasts.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.girlroster.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/heidi_montag_bikini_bigbreasts.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="335"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://www.accesshollywood.com/heidi-montags-former-psychic-and-manager-responds-to-firing-psychic-or-not-we-can-be-fooled_article_30553"&gt;Heidi Montag fires former “psychic” and manager &lt;/a&gt;- I don’t even really know who Heidi Montag is but this story made me laugh. My favorite part of this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything was perfectly fine until I received  a call from &lt;em&gt;Access Hollywood&lt;/em&gt; telling me I was fired,” Chase  said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Access&lt;/em&gt; on Friday. “She used the media to  tell me I was fired.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe she fired you because you were as shitty a manager as you obviously are a psychic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://api.ning.com/files/uIGqIuBcGiqywXKT2iGj5y0PJmQZvGyRSipP*mQ-PhGATJDue2fKo60bC8mPjA5l18c-iPYKnqJDuL4ugH5Y58mLsZlKq2kS/2008_08_psychic.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://api.ning.com/files/uIGqIuBcGiqywXKT2iGj5y0PJmQZvGyRSipP*mQ-PhGATJDue2fKo60bC8mPjA5l18c-iPYKnqJDuL4ugH5Y58mLsZlKq2kS/2008_08_psychic.jpg" alt="" width="181" height="234"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3. But on a related note, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/turn_off_your_tv.php"&gt;TLC aka the channel formally known as “The Learning Channel” is introducing a new show, Paranormal Court&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Hansen, a psychic medium famous among people who believe in  psychic mediums, will mediate disputes between family members squabbling  over possessions left behind by the deceased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a lovely “fuck you” to all those millions of legal professionals who spent years actually studying and practicing law. Who needs legal credentials when you’ve got imaginary psychic powers and TV producers willing to shoot you on camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. And lastly, another fun video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) show “Marketplace” has just done &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/2010/stretching_the_truth/main.html"&gt;a scathing exposé &lt;/a&gt;of so-called nonsurgical spinal decompression treatment with machines like the DRX 9000 and of some of the unscrupulous practitioners who offer it.  Between the hidden camera footage and the weasel words of the chiropractor they interview, it’s quite entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

After decades of pissing off almost everyone&lt;a href="http://www.thewrap.com/ind-column/anderson-cooper-prepares-feel-wrath-scientology-members-15667"&gt; now they’ll incur the wrath of Anderson Cooper&lt;/a&gt;. CNN has announced Thursday that it will debut the first of Cooper’s four part series – “&lt;a href="http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2010/03/25/scientology-a-history-of-violence/"&gt;Scientology:   A History of Violence&lt;/a&gt;” on Monday. This series will primarily focus on the recent string of accusations from former members of physical abuse that took place during their time in the Sea Org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooper &lt;a href="http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2010/03/25/scientology-a-history-of-violence/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; he’s already fielded e-mails from church members “complaining about the  series, and accusing me of attacking the church, its beliefs, its  membership, and its activities.” (He added: “Given that the emails are  all very similar in content, I assume this is some sort of organized  email campaign.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No shock there. A source at CNN tells me: “We  have heard from their lawyers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And $cientology isn’t the only one who can file lawsuits. &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/03/27/2010-03-27_lawsuits_from_exscientology_members_allege_elite_sea_org_group_are_roundtheclock.html"&gt;Former members Marc and Claire Headley of the Sea Org are suing the cult on charges of slave labor&lt;/a&gt;. And these aren’t lower ranking members but people who literally devoted their life for decades to “the church.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another high-ranking former Sea Org member in New Zealand, &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/919-l-ron-hubbards-dystopia-on-earth-a-scientologist-speaks-out.html"&gt;Aaron Saxton, is continuing to speak out and reveal the truth about this mysterious paramilitary force known as the Sea Org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that $cientology is it’s own worst enemy. It’s an ouroboros swallowing its own tail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. Just wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Donohue contradicts the leading Catholic officials’ story, lies  about the facts…and apparently thinks that Cardinal Ratz had no  responsibility in 1996 to stop a serial child abuser from continuing  work with children.&lt;/p&gt;

Or try to.A new case study in Cortex by neurologist Dr. Fabienne Picard (2010) reports on a patient who experienced unusual phenomena during epileptic seizures. She had the convincing sense that several familiar people (family members) were standing before her. This experience of a "sensed presence" is a classic trope in movies with supernatural themes (e.g., Carnival of Souls [available at Internet Archive], The Haunting [trailer for the 1963 version], Poltergeist, Dark Water), but it's generally attributed to ghosts and not to seizure activity.Here's the case report:A 62-year-old right-handed woman of normal psychiatric history presented  a simple focal epileptic seizure including a complex sensation  characterized by feeling the presence of several members of her family  in the immediate environment, associated with paresthesia of the right  hemibody (excluding the face). The feeling of presences and the  paresthesia (numbness) appeared concomitantly and lasted in total  several minutes. The episode occurred while she was sitting alone on the  sofa of her living room and immediately felt the presence of four  persons in her frontal space. She did not see or hear these persons (no  visual or auditory hallucinations), but felt vividly their presence in  her peripersonal [within reach] and near extrapersonal space [just outside of reach]. She “recognized” them as  close family members. Closest was her grand-daughter who was sitting on  the floor immediately in front of her, without any left or right  lateralization in relation to her body, whereas the three other persons,  her daughter and two other grand-children, were experienced to be  localized at a distance of several meters. ... This highly vivid and  convincing feeling of presences was described by the patient as deeply  pleasant, although she guessed that it was not possible that they were  really there, as she was alone just before. ... She was treated with pregabalin  (300 mg/day) and there was no recurrence of simple or complex partial  seizures and no further feeling of presences.MRIs revealed abnormal findings due to a right hemisphere subcortical stroke 10 months before the episode (Fig. 1A). The patient's stroke affected a portion of the basal ganglia (the putamen  and the globus pallidus) and a large white matter  tract within (the internal capsule). Left hemisphere findings in the insular cortex were also apparent, and this was the likely seizure focus.  Strokes are known to increase the incidence of seizures: in one study 8.6% of those with ischemic stroke [occlusion of blood supply] and 10.6% of those with hemorrhagic stroke [bleed] had one or more seizures within a year (Bladin et al., 2000).Fig. 1 (adapted from Picard, 2010). FLAIR coronal MR images of the  patient. (A) two days after a  right capsulo-lenticular haemorragic stroke.  (B) ten months later, at the time of the episode  of feeling of presence. In addition to  the right capsulo-lenticular sequela extending to the insula, a  hypersignal is visible in the white matter/grey matter border of the  left insular region [already visible in (A)], as well as a diffuse  corticosubcortical atrophy, predominating in the right hemisphere, and a  leukoencephalopathy [white matter disease]. Picard (2010) thinks this particular case is unique and not a more typical disorder of body perception:Most authors consider the feeling of a presence (FP) as a disorder of  own body perception, an illusory reduplicative phenomena involving the  self. Thus FP would be akin to the three main forms of autoscopic  phenomena (seeing a double of oneself) which include a) out-of-body  experience. The subjects appear to see themselves and the world from a  location above their physical body. The self is localized outside one's  physical body (disembodiment); b) autoscopic hallucination, which  consists of seeing one's body in extracorporeal space (as a double)  without disembodiment; and c) heautoscopy, an intermediate form between  out-of-body experience and autoscopic hallucination.Instead, the felt presence was more akin to a "hallucination" for known people going about normal daily activities. Nonetheless, involvement of the insula, important for interoceptive awareness of bodily states (Craig,  2009), is still suggestive of a disruption in the sense of self and its interaction with the external world.To end our story, the patient's experience of a sensed presence did not recur once her seizures were controlled with medication. A short neurological horror film resolved by prescription of an anticonvulsant drug might not be a strong sell in  Hollywood.ReferencesBladin CF, Alexandrov AV, Bellavance A, Bornstein N, Chambers B, Coté R, Lebrun L, Pirisi A, Norris JW.

This means that the researchers contributing to this body of knowledge -- for example, by submitting manuscripts to peer reviewed scientific journals -- are supposed to be honest and accurate in what they report.  They are not supposed to make up their data, or adjust it to fit the conclusion they were hoping the data would support.  Without this commitment, science turns into creative writing with more graphs and less character development.

Because the goal is supposed to be a body of reliable knowledge upon which the whole scientific community can draw to build more knowledge, it's especially problematic when particular pieces of the scientific literature turn out to be dishonest or misleading.

You would hope that one consequence of identifying scientists who have made dishonest contributions to the scientific literature would be that those dishonest contributions would be removed from that literature.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, as is claimed to prospective members, Scientology is the “only major religion to have emerged in the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century,” then it is currently experiencing a growing pain common to all religions entering adolescence: The schism. David Miscavige, the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWUasKX3FZE"&gt;slick little salesman&lt;/a&gt; who took over the Church of Scientology after the death of noted junkie and fugitive L. Ron Hubbard, has lately been accused of abusing his underlings and lying to his flock to obfuscate &lt;a href="http://leavingscientology.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/the-bridge-to-nowhere/"&gt;his own failures&lt;/a&gt; as a spiritual leader. Scientologists around the world are breaking off from the official Church, &lt;a href="http://internationalfreezone.net/"&gt;claiming&lt;/a&gt; that it has “strayed from the original philosophy and purpose of the group which Hubbard first researched and developed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some ex-Scientologists have less regard for the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard. One of them is Aaron Saxton, a New Zealander who spent eight years — from his mid-teens through his early 20s — as part of Scientology’s elite paramilitary corps, Sea Org. Read on to learn his thoughts on Independent Scientologists, Sea Org, violence, coerced abortion, rape, false imprisonment, and the many other delights allegedly awaiting those who take seriously L. Ron Hubbard’s declaration that “your search is over, but the adventure has just begun.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aaron Saxton was born into The Church of Scientology in 1974 and left it in 2006. In the intervening years, he says, he tried coercing female Sea Org members into undergoing abortions, falsely imprisoned his fellows in the Church, both witnessed and engaged in the psychological abuse of children, and was denied even routine medical treatment. (He has alleged that he was once forced to remove his own teeth without anesthesia.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Saxton went public in 2009, the Church of Scientology has apparently initiated a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Saxton#Scientology_response"&gt;smear campaign against his character, and generally set about making his life miserable&lt;/a&gt;. But that hasn’t kept him from being heard. His accusations have brought him considerable renown in both his native country and in Australia, where he has found a sympathetic audience in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Xenophon"&gt;Senator Nick Xenophon&lt;/a&gt;, who paired Saxton’s claims with those of other ex-Scientologists and read them into that country’s parliamentary record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is full of ex-Scientologists, but few claim to have been so highly ranked in the Church, and few have been able to offer glimpses into the weird world of the Sea Org. Perhaps it is telling that lower-ranking Scientologists tend to remember their former church more fondly than Saxton does. It was a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/us/07scientology.html?pagewanted=1"&gt;New York Times &lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; profiling such mild apostates that inspired Saxton to give us the final go-ahead to publish this interview, after many weeks during which Saxton weighed the pros and cons of risking further exposure, publicity, and Scientological wrath by releasing his story to the JREF. The &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;story doesn’t go far enough, says Saxton. It lends credence to the notion that the problems now facing Scientology are organizational rather than doctrinal, and that Scientology can be a vibrant, positive religion if released from the control of David Miscavige and his minions. Saxton maintains that this is not the case: Scientology is rotten from its roots. The schism, though understandable, is doomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientology might be the most jargon-y religion in the world. Its members are conversant with dozens of strange words and acronyms that would be meaningless to those outside the Church, and Aaron Saxton still uses many of them. In transcribing this interview we translated as much of the jargon as possible, and decoded most of the obscure acronyms. (For example: Saxton never said “Religious Technology Center”; he said “RTC.”) Even with the decoding, parts of the interview can be hard-going. Stick with it, and try to pick up the meanings from context. We hope the interview proves illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– BKT, PB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: How do you feel the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; story is biased toward the Scientologists?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Aaron Saxton&lt;/span&gt;: A new Scientology [as discussed in the story] is not really possible, as it was flawed from the beginning and cannot ever withstand the rigorous testing of science. This is why L. Ron Hubbard created a religion after Dianetics — which was called a “modern &lt;em&gt;science &lt;/em&gt;of mental health.” He was asked for proof and could provide no solid evidence to back his claims. Thus, he started a religion, which under the protections of faith could not be questioned. The Scientologists that are currently dissatisfied with the Church are tending to shift the blame towards the current management, when in fact all activities of management are as per L. Ron Hubbard policy. The real issue is that the true nature of Hubbard’s policies is coming to light and it is creating a PR scandal. Therefore, the only scapegoat available, if not Hubbard himself, is the current management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Briefly, what is the Sea Org?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sea Organization is the super-cult of this century. Totally different from being an ordinary Scientologist, this is a paramilitary unit created on the sea by L. Ron Hubbard. Dedicated staff believe that this sector of the universe suffered a terrible tragedy 75 million years ago and believe that Earth must be “cleared” — meaning all persons on the planet must undergo Scientology processing. After which it is their intention to travel to other planets to free other beings. It is their belief that Earth is part of a galactic confederacy that consists of 26 stars with 76 inhabited planets. It is believed that Earth has been zoned as a prison planet where the worst criminals and non-conformists are sent. So the Sea Org now runs Scientology under the founder’s directions. As a paramilitary unit, it evokes a theme of heavy discipline and an array of policies that do not fit in with the Church’s stated goals of serving mankind and allowing human rights to be given to all people. In fact, many policies of the Sea Org strip away these rights. The billion-year contract the Sea Org crew sign is not a religious example of faith, but, as per L. Ron Hubbard, it is estimated the planets in all will take a billion years to run through Scientology processing. While such claims are easily shown to be false, one should heed what a group of people with such beliefs are capable of if they see their beliefs as facts and anyone who opposes them as enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your role in the Sea Org? How long were you a part of it, and what year did you leave?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was involved in the Sea Org from 1989 through to 1996. From 1996 to late 1997 I secretly worked for the Sea Org while appearing to be a member of the public. My role in there was primarily as an enforcer over what is known as The Commodore’s Messengers — the police management which runs Scientology. I policed the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How widespread is the Sea Org across the globe? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to tell. Membership has been as high as 8,000. With the policy in place of having some Sea Org crew not identify themselves as such, the figure is hard to estimate. But I would put it at about 5,000 currently. It does not sound like a lot, but when you consider each of these people put in over 100 working hours per week, the amount of manpower they can throw at projects really boggles the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kinds of projects would they undertake?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, important projects that involve tackling PR-related issues only occur at Office of Special Affairs International, the L Ron Hubbard Personal Relations Office or at Commodore’s Message Organization International, and Religious Technology Center located at International Management level. The type of projects undertaken would be to identify persons and groups behind attacks on Scientology, ascertain their whereabouts, launch private investigations against them or their companies and design press releases or local actions to discredit them. In addition to this, other large projects such as the acquisition of land or property overseas or handling investments and returns from monies kept offshore — [these projects] typically take place on board the &lt;a href="http://www.freewinds.org/"&gt;Freewinds&lt;/a&gt;, and all such projects involve top management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you list the crimes or immoral acts you've been involved in, or witnessed, as a Sea Org member?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the crimes involved other Sea Org members. The most notable crimes were the releasing of private information to the public on people we wanted blacklisted. Rapes of underage Sea Org Children were covered up. There were instances where Scientologists, as part of checking their qualifications, revealed true crimes against other civilians, such as theft, child molestation and even murder. At a price, such crimes were never divulged to the police unless the person went against Scientology. I think my most reprehensible act was requesting abortions and punishing young Sea Org members between the ages of 13 and 17 for petty crimes, making them feel very guilty and issuing severe punishments that should not be given to a human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve said you helped brainwash children. What was the procedure for doing so?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young children are taken into the SO — they are usually the children of SO members. Indoctrination starts at the age of four. Education is concentrated on very little and L. Ron Hubbard’s works are forced as the major reading. By the time the child is eight, they are pretty well convinced the SO is the only real thing that can save man; they believe in past lives and reject psychology and other practices as being false and evil. They see little of their families and do not learn family values. By the time they are 13 they are well prepared to commit to their duty to serve mankind for life. They have no sports, no other tendencies. The only thing they really know is Scientology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You said you would make young Sea Org members feel guilty and issue them punishments. What methods would you use to make the kids feel so guilty? Was there a codified system of psychological torture and intimidation, and if so, what did it entail? Or were officers free to make up their own techniques? If so, what techniques did you employ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Techniques were at the discretion of the executive, but typically they followed a common theme. Hard labor is often used, and can vary from general cleaning to intensive labor — such as handling sewage without protection. To make a person feel guilty all one needs to do is show a person how they could have prevented an infraction from taking place. This is easily done with L. Ron Hubbard’s materials, as at every corner it is made clear you are responsible for anything that happens around you, regardless of whether you are or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other punishments would include being segregated from other SO members, not being allowed to talk to them or contact your family outside of the SO. Yelling is often used to introvert the person, and to show a child how his actions are commonplace in evil societies — and that, in effect, the child is as bad as [the people in those societies]. By introverting such a person, you make them willing do anything to gain acceptance and approval, even if such a punishment were to be to disconnected from their family forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another form of brainwashing and training is to give the children authority to tell adults what to do. Once they feel they can control adults, they feel that they are safe and will often hold onto that state of mind. Such a state of mind can be seen in David Miscavige, who never really stopped being a dictator from an early age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Techniques also included assignment of “lower conditions,” where the person was told they were enemies or traitors to themselves and to Scientology. The threat of losing those who you considered friends was ever-present. Children, once broken with such treatment, clearly see themselves as the source of any trouble and try to avoid receiving any punishment by being compliant to orders, regardless of the recklessness of those orders. Children are reminded that they are as responsible as adults and their failures are the results of failing to recognize that they are adults and spirits that have been around for as long as anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I know several examples of child molestation and sexual assault with Scientology children where the incidents were covered up. In all cases, the child feels they allowed [the molestation] to happen, and their Scientology or Sea Org parents often agree with them. They see themselves as instigators, not victims. Once installed with this as punishment, they will never tell the police or others, as they feel they are revealing their own crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you detail an instance of rape being covered up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1992 or 1993 in Florida a young recruit was in Commodore’s Messenger Org, Clear Water. She was 14 at the time — possibly just turning 14, actually. Two other trainees from Mexico, ages 16 and 18, took her and sexually assaulted her at the same time. Upon discovery the staff were let go, but to cover up the incident and to make sure she did not feel like she could go to the police, we subjected her to eight weeks hard labor and made it clear she had been responsible for it occurring. I deeply regret ordering such a thing to be done. At the time, however, I was of the belief that the image of the Sea Org and Scientology was more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you detail an instance of false arrest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995, on St. Valentine’s Day, 15 staff from the organization that dealt with the Computer Network of Scientology were held captive in Los Angeles against their will. They were not permitted to leave. Doors were bolted. Guards were posted with express orders to refuse anyone wishing to leave. The people involved for a period of between 30-60 days were confined to working quarters with no windows, no outside communication, and no phone calls. Communication amongst themselves was permitted. They were taken by guards for two-minute showers once a day. All food was taken to them within their confined quarters, and some never saw daylight for many weeks at a time. This was thoroughly condoned at multiple levels of the SO, and no one raised alarms. Many of the staff involved suffered mental breakdowns, which was the goal. Most staff were replaced and then sent out of the SO with no money, or placed into the penal colony we had for degraded SO members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why were these personnel locked up in the first place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, 1995, a security breach was detected whereby information relating to Scientology’s future purchases and financial records were removed and sent out via modem. As a result, the entire staff was locked down. We knew already who the perpetrator was, however we pretended not to know in order to source out any others that may have the same idea to sabotage Scientology, and also to allow our computer tracking programs to locate other external sources of potential hacks. Scientologists working at Executive Software International and other freelance computer masterminds worked in association with the Religious Technology Center and the management to coordinate a “honey pot” capture technique and also infect any hackers with viruses, so that not only could we obtain the people attempting to hack, but also the email addresses of everyone they knew. The staff at &lt;a href="http://www.xenu-directory.net/glossary/glossary_i.htm#INCOMM"&gt;INCOMM&lt;/a&gt; were all treated as criminals. Even when proven innocent, they were informed that the reason for the betrayer not being spotted by them was because they were &lt;a href="http://www.xenu-directory.net/glossary/glossary_o.htm#Out-Ethics"&gt;out ethics&lt;/a&gt; and they deserved punishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you explain an instance of forced abortion?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous incidents over the history of the SO. Of all the people I asked to abort, none factually did. One of my seniors, though, was asked by her senior to abort and did so in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the role of violence in Scientology?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violence does not play a part in Scientology and few Scientologists commit acts of violence. In the Sea Org, however, mental torture is the rule of the game. Occasionally physical violence is used. I have been physically attacked by another senior SO member and I have witnessed staff being thrown around on several occasions. It is always by seniors and they are always protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Were there cases of violent abuse?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not aware of violent abuses wherein severe physical harm ever came to an SO member. One has to keep in mind that mental torture can leave more scars than a physical attack. As an example, I have suffered physical injuries, but I have nightmares about the time I was locked up for weeks and interrogated for 12 hours a day. That left and created more damage than anything physical I have experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sea Org is notorious for its penal colonies. Where are they located? Can you list one or two specific locations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pacific Base in Los Angeles, often referred to as Big Blue, is one of the largest. There is another one located in Sydney, and in the UK as well. These penal colonies are just that. I was in one of them myself and can only describe it as cruel and unusual punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is put in them? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SO members that start to have free minds are typically placed in them. Anyone who is rebellious to management. The hope is to bring them back into line before they go fully free in their minds and try to leave the SO. Some people can be in there for up to 5 years. You are only allowed out when you are fully compliant and do whatever it is you are told to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You've referred to the camps as slave colonies. What are conditions like in the camps? To what degree can freedom be restricted for prisoners?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conditions are terrible. Beyond imagination. Labor is carried out every conscious moment, beyond several hours of study every day. You must run, not walk. You cannot initiate a conversation until spoken to first. Punishments are handed out for anything, almost. You cannot see your family but a few hours each week, and you are subjected to cramped living conditions, wearing only black uniforms. Your status is depicted with armbands. It is a most uncomfortable state of living that no one in their right mind would subscribe to unless they felt they had no choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You said you were locked up for weeks and interrogated for 12 hours per day. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I returned from a secret mission to the &lt;a href="http://www.freewinds.org/"&gt;Ship&lt;/a&gt; where my identity as a Sea Org member was hidden, I came into sensitive knowledge. Upon my return I attempted to take a break to allow my body to repair itself from the stress it was undergoing. It was thought I perhaps had gone to see the government, or other groups working against Scientology. To teach me a lesson for [purportedly] trying to leave I was locked up for a week, sleep-deprived, and interrogated by up to four different people a day.  I would sleep with people outside my door to prevent me from leaving again. I also went through a process designed to numb a person into submission and destroy their desires to fight back against things they saw as wrong. It worked for some time, and I was certainly deflated as a human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I love the banner &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/HAO.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/HAO.png" alt="" title="HAO" width="550" height="179"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They now have sections specifically for locals who want to meet other atheists (even if they don’t want to become official HAO members), &lt;a href="http://humanistottawaweb.wordpress.com/"&gt;a blog&lt;/a&gt; that I hope will be updated frequently, and &lt;a href="http://humanistottawa.com/herdingcats/events.php"&gt;an event calendar&lt;/a&gt; bursting with opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s just fun to say HAO (in my head, I’m pronouncing it HEY-oh).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check them out, and if you’re in the Ottawa area, join their group!&lt;/p&gt;

I also thought it was only a matter of time before someone did &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRZHOhXvtHU"&gt;something like this&lt;/a&gt; and wondered why it hadn't been done before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: In case you don't know or remember who Poul Thorsen is, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/thorsen_wakefield_fine_art_of_distraction.php"&gt;read this&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Perhaps that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/generation_rescue_and_fourteen_studies.php"&gt;14 Studies website&lt;/a&gt; was too high brow." Heh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Now I'll have to pay for another &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/fun_with_phone_surveys.php"&gt;stupid telephone survey&lt;/a&gt;." Heh heh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But what's the use? Orac will only make fun of me." Heh heh heh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a bummer when the scientific evidence encircles you like the Red Army encircling Berlin in April 1945. My guess, though, is that the target of the humor in this particular &lt;em&gt;Downfall&lt;/em&gt; parody will misinterpret this mocking parody as calling him a Nazi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/utter_defeat_and_devastation_at_the_hand.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/cBHJN6pUu6Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269726896355"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4762827614191702843.post-8089658362483307579">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/80013d1f45cb4681</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Bad Law" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">What Is "Bad Law"?</title><published>2010-03-27T20:46:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-27T20:46:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2010/03/what-is-bad-law.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/S65wHx_f58I/AAAAAAAAAQk/Vpwy0IuFDOU/s1600/bad_law.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:151px;height:107px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/S65wHx_f58I/AAAAAAAAAQk/Vpwy0IuFDOU/s320/bad_law.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;I now have a weekly internet column at The Lawyer called "&lt;a href="http://www.thelawyer.com/home/blogs/bad-law"&gt;Bad Law&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am writing a book with the title "Bad Law".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I am also giving talks entitled "Bad Law" in &lt;a href="http://nottingham.skepticsinthepub.org/Event.aspx/216/Bad-Law"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://birmingham.skepticsinthepub.org/Event.aspx/208/Bad-Law"&gt; Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://oxford.skepticsinthepub.org/Event.aspx/250/Bad-Law"&gt; Oxford&lt;/a&gt; (and have already done so in &lt;a href="http://cambridge.skepticsinthepub.org/Event.aspx/205/Bad-Law"&gt; Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I suppose I had better set out what I mean by "Bad Law".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By "Bad Law" I mean the actual or reported misuse of law, and the emphasis on approaching that actual or reported misuse in a critical and source-based way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What does that mean in practice?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, I should say what I mean by "good law".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Law is very good in performing certain discrete and narrow functions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I owe you a debt, a court can give judgment, allowing you to enforce it; if I cause you personal injury, a court can determine the extent of my liability and quantify any loss; and if I am a thief, a court can determine my guilt and pass sentence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, in each of these cases, there could be a miscarriage of justice: the court can get it wrong.  However, the underlying substantive and procedural areas of law would appear to be generally sound and uncontroversial: whether it be contract, negligence, or criminal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where I begin to see "Bad Law" is when the law is being used to serve a wider or ulterior purpose. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, in civil law, the use of libel law in "&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;reputation management&lt;/span&gt;" or copyright in "&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;digital rights management&lt;/span&gt;".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Indeed, the use of the word "management" signals that civil law is up to no good.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Libel law, if it should exist at all, should be about defending and vindicating reputations, not "managing" them; similarly, copyright is ultimately about providing permissions for what otherwise would be infringements, not controlling lawful use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(And I have written elsewhere that &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/10/copyright-infringement-is-not-theft.html"&gt;copyright infringement is not theft&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In criminal law, as opposed to civil law, "Bad Law" seems to me to be when either criminal liability is used in an inappropriate way, or when charging and prosecution decisions (which effectively mean whether there will be a conviction in many cases) are made on a misconceived basis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For me, recent examples of such "Bad Law" in a criminal context are the &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/11/paul-clarke-anatomy-of-injustice.html"&gt; Paul Clarke shotgun case&lt;/a&gt; and the Paul Chambers &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2010/03/twitter-bomb-hoax-why-court-vacated.html"&gt; Twitter "Bomb Hoax" case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In both cases, the decisions to charge and prosecute appeared to me to be incorrect and so I set out in blogposts why this was so, publishing or linking to the relevant materials as appropriate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Bad Law" also deals with the media misreporting of legal matters: the "law is an ass" staple, which often turns out to be crap journalism, and not crap law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sadly, coverage of legal stories, including in the broadsheets or on the BBC, is generally no better than with stories that involve medical or science issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is particularly so since many newspapers no longer have the resources to have a reporter sit in court all day, and get to know the law; and consequently the media is often dependent on the police or PR agencies to "explain" what has happened in court cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it is possible for anyone to look critically at actual and perceived examples of the misuse of law; to look at the relevant materials and guidance (now easily available on the internet); and so basically work out for oneself whether some legal example is really "Bad Law" or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In exploring "Bad Law", one should never argue from authority; it should not matter whatsoever what legal qualifications or experience one has, as long as the legal issues are properly set out and, when possible, sourced and linked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At bottom, "Bad Law" is a way of promoting critical thinking and a source-based approach to legal issues as they arise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accordingly, "Bad Law" is auxiliary to "Bad Science", "Bad Astronomy", "Bad Psychics", and so on; it is a project within the wider skeptical endeavour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is sometimes said that "hard cases make bad law".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe; but it often seems to me that it is soft cases - cases where the law really should not be involved at all - where those who implement, enforce, or practice law make "Bad Law" the most evident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published;

&lt;div&gt;There’s just waaaay too much to say about the Amazing Adventure Skeptics of the Carribean Cruise to fit in one blog, so I’m going to divert most of what I would normally have to say to Jeff Wagg’s excellent podcast I was asked to be a part of  during the height of the cruise. It was one of the better sessions I have had the privilege to speak at – and I was even given the last word!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Check it out at &lt;a href="http://rational-alchemy.com/rational-alchemy-podcasts/951-rational-alchemy-03202010"&gt;http://rational-alchemy.com/rational-alchemy-podcasts/951-rational-alchemy-03202010 d&lt;/a&gt;There you can listen to what some of the nicest and most respected names in skepticism had to say about such things as: Atheism the Skeptical movement, rituals and everyday habits, the future of skepticism and how it will relate to JREF’s part in it all. It was exilerating.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;As you can tell by the photo, my sunburned hand was held down when the Atheist question came up. I’m just not that sure about anything. I remain sketical about being skeptical. I’m a magician damn it! When I see something going on in one hand, I want to see what’s going on in the other. I can’t help it. As a confirmed iconoclast, fitting in to any group, club or ritual situation rubs my anti-authoritarian magician whiskers the wrong way. But I’m slowly coming around. Give me time. Beliefs and their pull on society was a major issue that was discussed throughout the cruise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:left"&gt;Randi and I had some great laughs together talking about magic and all the strange people and ideas that are floating around out there. He’s the real deal. If there was ever a real-life super-hero, minus the cape and bulging muscles, it would be Randi.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:left"&gt;One of the great moments for many of us was when Susan Gerbic Forsyth decided to perform The Ball and Vase for Randi after dinner one night. I have been trying to teach her this trick since I gave it to her last Christmas, but as I always tell my students: Practice Makes Perfect. Well, …Susan had everybody in stitches for her performance and if it had been purposely staged as a comedy magic act, it couldn’t have been more hysterical. I thought I saw tears in the eyes of Brian Dunning at one point. You can see many different versions of this classic moment on Utube if you put in “Ball and Vase” or JREF Ball and Vase.  Watch Randi and I buckle with laughter. It was priceless. Thanks Susan. Your magical incantation of “wooo, wooooo!” was dead on.

&lt;p&gt;There are thousands of photos all over Facebook and I invite all readers to re-invigorate their skepticism by searching out the many videos and documentations to be seen of this stellar event. We all got to see Randi doing a card trick with astronaut Ed Lu in outer space. How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who cry “elitism!” …forget that. Everybody I met on board had a day job somewhere and this was a open group that is working hard sowing the seeds of a new combined movement that will shortly link both coasts in a series of lectures, road tours and educational projects through the auspices of JREF and CFI. It’s an exciting time to become involved, no matter what level of rational thinking you may be or whether or not you think you are an outsider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we all agreed to was that for the most part, as skeptical people: we are outsiders. No problem. We can negotiate around the perimeters of society much easier that way. Who wants to conform to the Sylvia Browne school of reality anyway? I doubt if you are reading this, you are one of those people. It’s a time to revel in being on the outside. If that’s elitism, I’m all for it! There is no elite, only people working to get things done by &lt;em&gt;DOING SOMETHING&lt;/em&gt;. If you are not doing something  everyday to promote critical thinking, do us all a favor and switch over to something more passive please. This train aint’ waitin’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GUERILLA SKEPTICISM&lt;/strong&gt; is on the rise and without spilling the beans completely at this point, it appears that another phony baloney police psychic has taken down, hopefully permanently. More on this later. Ha!&lt;/div&gt;

Just reading them makes me think of Vikings and valkyries. One name that I can't get out of my head right now is &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/iris-lee/who-indeed-is-afraid-of-t_b_515783.html"&gt;"Iris Erlingsdottir"&lt;/a&gt;.  She's an Icelandic journalist who put up a pro-vaccine piece on Huffington Post.  Not only is the piece pro-vaccine, but it is quite critical of her fellow HuffPo blogger "Dr." Jenny McCarthy, the actress who, after having a child and doing a lot of googling, decided that vaccines are evil. She is so convinced of the danger of vaccine that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/mccarthy---where_does_the_dang.php"&gt;she explicitly wishes our children to suffer&lt;/a&gt; from vaccine-preventable diseases to try to prove her point.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if Jenny is a liar, or just so damned stupid that&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2010/03/vaccinations_and_autism_were_n.php"&gt; she'll parrot everyone else's lies&lt;/a&gt;.  But Ms Erlingsdottir doesn't seem to be too concerned with Jenny's lies, but the truth about vaccine-preventable illnesses.  Given HuffPo's history, I'd imagine She'll get some pretty unpleasant responses. It couldn't hurt to go over there and give her some support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/Y1mITLx3Qb4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269723862643"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/03/two-public-service-announcements-on-dyslexia.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d85bcdc7b52cb11e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Learning Disabilities"/><title type="html">Two Public Service Announcements on Dyslexia</title><published>2010-03-27T20:23:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-27T20:23:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/03/two-public-service-announcements-on-dyslexia.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">The first is a 60 second PSA from dhfl143, uploaded October 2009&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday and Tuesday I was in Boston. You may remember I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/in_boston_are_you.php" title=""&gt;went to Boston&lt;/a&gt; last &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/back_from_boston.php" title=""&gt;year as well&lt;/a&gt; and for the same reason - spending a day at the &lt;a href="http://www.wgbh.org/" title=""&gt;WGNH studios&lt;/a&gt;, helping with the &lt;a href="http://www.world-science.org/" title=""&gt;World Science project&lt;/a&gt; that combines radio, podcasts and online forums. You have probably noticed I have posted announcements of these throughout the year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short story airs on the radio show &lt;a href="http://www.theworld.org/" title=""&gt;The World&lt;/a&gt;, about some science-related topic with a global angle. The same scientist (or physician, or science journalist) who is interviewed for a couple of minutes on air is also interviewed for 20 minutes for the podcast, and then keeps coming back for another week, responding to the questions on the online forum.  Last year, that was just an idea we helped turn into reality - the website went live about a month or so later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, we had something to look at and analyze - how did it go, where the traffic came from, etc, and could make suggestions for improvements for the next year. I hope that the insights from us, the outside consultants, is useful to the crew there. I personally felt that this year's meeting was better and more productive - perhaps because we had the website and the statistics already in front of us, instead of just visualizing in our minds how this should look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The composition of outside consultants also changed over the year. Only &lt;a href="http://www.rmurthy.com/" title=""&gt;Rekha Murthy&lt;/a&gt; and I were there from the last year's lineup (see the first two links in this post for last year's list). The new folks in the room were &lt;a href="http://www.cc-chapman.com/" title=""&gt;C.C.Chapman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.statehousereport.com/" title=""&gt;Andy Brack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://adnaanwasey.com/" title=""&gt;Adnaan Wasey&lt;/a&gt; and we quickly 'clicked' with each other and with the World/SigmaXi/Nova/PRI people so the business of the day was pleasant and productive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will keep pointing out the new podcasts/forums over the year here (and on Twitter/FriendFeed/Facebook) and I hope you give them a listen/read. And I hope I get invited to Boston again next year. I really like this project and think it can become big and popular over time. You can follow World-Science on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/worldscipod" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/worldscipod" title=""&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/TheWorldScience" title=""&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and download their podcasts on &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=305357713" title=""&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, unlike last year, I was staying in Boston only one night and did not have time for a meetup/dinner with friends, bloggers and twitterers. If only I knew I'd spend six hours at Logan airport waiting for my flight home, I could have organized one. Eh, perhaps next year....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in Boston, I had to miss both &lt;a href="http://www.pknraleigh.com/" title=""&gt;Pecha Kucha Raleigh&lt;/a&gt; and this month's &lt;a href="http://www.themonti.org/" title=""&gt;Monti&lt;/a&gt;. Can't get everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You already know I spent some time &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/update_and_question_about_comp.php" title=""&gt;struggling with my laptop&lt;/a&gt;. I am also in the middle of teaching my BIO101 course, lectures on Wednesday nights, labs on Saturday mornings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yesterday, for the third year in a row, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/" title=""&gt;Abel Pharmboy&lt;/a&gt; and I went to &lt;a href="http://genomeboy.com/" title=""&gt;Misha Angrist's&lt;/a&gt; class to talk about science blogging, social networks and media. Last two years, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/" title=""&gt;Sheril&lt;/a&gt; was the third part of the trio, but as she just moved to Texas, we went without her. We'll need a replacement for her next year, I guess. This is always a fun thing to do - Misha always has interesting, engaged students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And tonight, we are off to the &lt;a href="http://www.cgtheatre.com/events" title=""&gt; Salon of Music, Poetry, and Theater&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.cgtheatre.com/" title=""&gt;Common Ground Theatre&lt;/a&gt; in Durham.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/week_in_review.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/AR3l4JwJ_dM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269722561388"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/my_feelings_are_crushed.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4ab1e6daf98ca085</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">My feelings are crushed</title><published>2010-03-27T20:21:52Z</published><updated>2010-03-27T20:21:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/aquGS1fnsJU/my_feelings_are_crushed.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/my_feelings_are_crushed.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The NCSE has put out a press release &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/news/2010/03/ayala-wins-templeton-prize-005389"&gt;congratulating Ayala for his Templeton Prize&lt;/a&gt;, and thanking him for his support of NCSE. It also parrots his defense of the compatibility of science and religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, I&amp;#39;ve been a long-time supporter of the NCSE, a vocal crusader for better science education and against creationism, and last year I was awarded Humanist of the Year…but no, I didn&amp;#39;t get the tiniest bit of press from NCSE. Was it because I&amp;#39;m not as scientifically reputable as Ayala? Because I didn&amp;#39;t get a £1,000,000? Because putting a paragraph acknowledgment on the web was more than I&amp;#39;m worth? Or was it because if they&amp;#39;d cited my position on the science/religion collision it would have been insufficiently appeasing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excuse me, I have to retire to my fainting couch and weep hot, bitter tears for a while. There are friends of the NCSE's goals, and then there are &lt;i&gt;special&lt;/i&gt; friends of the NCSE, and we can clearly see who&amp;#39;s in the popular clique…and it overlaps more with Templeton cronies than it does the humanist and atheist community. &amp;lt;sniffle&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Young or old, male or female, everyone gets sick at some point in their lives. But only some are susceptible to a specialized disease known as the "Man Flu," which somehow causes men to think they have the flu when, in fact, they have only a little cold. 

Where did the idea of a Man Flu come from? It's origins are uncertain. In general, a lot of people tend to think they're worse off than they really are when they're sick - a poll by Panadol Cold and Flu, for example, found that 61% of people who went to pharmacists claiming to have the flu didn't. Somewhere along the line, anecdotal evidence began to suggest that when men get sick, they whine more, think they are sicker than they are, and generally make more of a fuss than women. How this became a pop-culture norm isn't certain, but in 2006 a non-scientific survey stirred up the controversy by claiming that the Man Flu was real. The web-based survey found that men are more likely to skip work when they think they have the flu, even though they only have a cold. Furthermore, it found that men moan more, spend more on drugs, and stay in bed longer until they feel better. Men reported taking three days to recover on average, while it only took women a day and a half to feel better. 

Of course, a web-based survey of magazine readers is hardly a reputable study. But it fired up the debate none the less, and now attention is focused on the real science behind the Man Flu. Do men really think they're sicker than they are? Do they exaggerate their illnesses? Or, even, do they get sick more often than women?

To be honest, I was a bit overwhelmed by my day.  You see, six hours of my day were spent doing essentially nothing.  Well, nothing but this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bored woman.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/bored%20woman.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="259" width="228"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2006/07/boredwomenREX140706_228x259.jpg"&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/a&gt; An artist's rendition of Dr. Isis, all day yesterday.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months ago we hired a technician to work as a coordinator on a very large project.  In the course of interviewing for her position, we met a young man who had absolutely zero lab experience, but seemed to have a sincere interest in the questions we are asking.  He had read some of our work, came to the interview prepared and motivated, and really impressed me. Although he was applying to medical school, our department allowed us to hire him part time at 15 hours per week, even though we were hiring him for a position that was different than what we had advertised for.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In the last few months he has really blossomed and we decided that we wanted to offer him 25 hours of work per week until he leaves for medical school.  However, MRU&amp;#39;s administration, in all of its wisdom, has dictated that we have to advertise the 25 hour position and interview candidates for it before we can give this guy an extra 10 hours per week because we had technically never advertised the position we hired him for.  So, that&amp;#39;s what I did yesterday.  I interviewed people for a job they have absolutely no chance of getting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was depressing and sucked on about 30 fucktillion levels.   First, it sucked because it delays our ability to give this guy more hours and more money by at least a month as we go through the soliciting, interviewing, and hiring process.  It sucked because it made me even more acutely aware of how bad the economy sucks.  Even though this was advertised as a part time, entry level technician job with a fixed 6 month contract (this guy will be leaving), we had people with MDs and PhDs applying for the job.   It sucked because it made me aware of how many times one woman can use the word &amp;quot;sucked&amp;quot; in a paragraph.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, mostly it sucked because I had to spend the day putting on the guise of interviewing people who really thought that they were competing for a job they had a snowball&amp;#39;s chance in hell of getting. I had to spend the day with people who were actively trying to impress me.  People who had put on their best clothes, polished off their resumes, paid to have it printed on the expensive embossed paper, and who had driven onto the MRU campus for no real purpose.  It sucked to have to sit next to our lab manager and listen to her tell these people how innovative and cutting edge my research is, what a fantastic group we are to work with, how happy everyone in the group is, and how one of our underlying philosophies is &amp;quot;Always spend time with your family and make sure you make time to get exercise in&amp;quot; because she has to report back to the department the questions that she asked and what she told people about the position.  She really didn&amp;#39;t need to sell it so hard.  That was enough to make me feel genuinely and sincerely depressed by the end of the day.  I just came home and went to bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I appreciate that MRU thinks that they have this policy to make the hiring process &amp;quot;fair,&amp;quot; but really it&amp;#39;s just cruel.  Cruel and heartless to make me do this to these people.  Cruel and heartless to make me give them hope that they have a chance of getting this job in our department.  As experts in our field, we should be able to choose the people who will best augment our research without having to go through these charades to please some mid-level administrator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fuck them, I say.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, I did meet a gentleman at the end of the day who really impressed me.  He is a new graduate, eager to get experience and genuinely interested in the question.  He had printed papers from our field and asked intelligent, thought-provoking questions.  He was like a little beacon of hope in the midst of the day&amp;#39;s fuckwittitude.  He made me wonder if we could somehow free up some funds to give him an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except that I have no doubt that MRU will eventually make me go through this process all over again, because we wouldn't be hiring him for the position we advertised for, and I'm just not sure I have the stomach for it.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/03/tales_of_wasted_time_-_how_dr.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/w0qgYrGDGm4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269718022630"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=13068">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e1a3722ed9394dcf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">AI: I’m skeptical that you’re funny</title><published>2010-03-27T19:11:38Z</published><updated>2010-03-27T19:11:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/03/ai-im-skeptical-that-youre-funny/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ed3b633b3ae45bd985c3032e0ea349f0&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, the Chicago Tribune ran and article on &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/sc-home-0315-faker-funny-20100321,0,7865423.story"&gt;how to fake being funny&lt;/a&gt;.  I’ve been described as a humor snob, and maybe I am, but I thought the advice was terrible, at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First they say to laugh when other people laugh. That’s fine. And it’s a good idea if you want to blend in with the crowd. But it doesn’t make you funny. It makes you agreeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next they tell you to memorize a few jokes. Don’t do that. Unless they’re really great jokes that are hysterically funny and no one else has heard, you’re not going to seem funny. You’re going to seem like a guy who heard a couple of jokes. No one thinks that guy who rattles off jokes is actually funny anyway.  And if you don’t have good comic timing, your joke can flop… making you seem even LESS funny. Canned humor is not funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their next advice leaves me conflicted: Limit retelling jokes from sitcoms. Though I’d also add movies, stand-up routines, and SNL (unless it’s a recent meme). No one is impressed that you can work in quotes from Monty Python or Police Academy or the Simpsons or “the early days” of SNL. Those jokes stopped being funny before Pluto stopped being a planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I disagree with their advice that “That’s what she said” is only funny on The Office. This is wrong. “That’s what she said” is almost always funny. It’s a great go-to joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their final advice is to use self-deprecation. Funny when done right. Annoyingly emo and passive-aggressive if you can’t pull it off. If you’re not funny, this is NOT the way to make people think you’re funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even humor needs to be looked at skeptically!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would you add to the rules of humor? What humor delusions do you see people harboring regularly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The reason for this discrepancy, though, remains unknown. Many explanations have been suggested, ranging from the fact that there are simply more boys who fall into the category of disadvantaged&amp;quot; to boys lacking interest, having shorter attention spans, or not being encouraged to take learning seriously by male role-models.But could there be a simpler explanation? It is no secret that a number of educational and mental disorders have a higher incidence in males than in females, usually because the genes which influence them are linked to the X-chromosome. Imagine a couple, of whom one parent has an X-chromosome gene linked to a particular disorder. If this parent passes on the &amp;quot;defective&amp;quot; gene, this is more likely to affect boys, who have only one X-chromosome (and hence no &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; copies of the gene to counterbalance the defective one) than girls, who will have one defective and one, usually dominant, normal copy of the gene. As a result, the couples&amp;#39; male children may display characteristics associated with the disorder, while female ones typically will not (&amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; genes are no always dominant, but this is often the case).What does this have to do with human intelligence more generally? Well, if a genes&amp;#39; malfunction is associated with mental disorder, it&amp;#39;s function is clearly important to mental functioning. The concentration of these genes on the X-chromosome, moreover, suggests that this chromosome might play an important role in the evolution of human intelligence, and warrants further investigation. A paper by Zechner et al. (2001), published in the journal Trends in Genetics, has done just that, and has found that, in fact, the X-chromosome has a concentration of genes associated with cognition that is over three times higher than that for any other chromosome, even when the authors corrected for possible bias in their data collection.And a link between the sex chromosomes and intelligence raises some interesting possibilities for its evolution. Zechner et al. (2001) discuss one of these particularly. They note that a link to the X-chromosome may implicate sexual selection in the evolution of intelligence. Sexual selection occurs when individuals of one sex &amp;quot;select&amp;quot; mates on the basis of particular characteristics and/or there is competition between members of the same sex for mates or resources. Both these types of selection (called intersexual and intrasexual selection respectively) can cause the evolution of traits which are unrelated to fitness in the traditional sense; like the male peacock&amp;#39;s tail, which is a drain on physical resources, but provides its owner with a reproductive advantage.Many sexually selected traits, moreover, differ between the sexes. In intersexually selected traits (where one sex chooses mates on the basis of their characteristics), moreover, the possession of a trait in the selected sex must be linked to a preference for it in the other (selecting) sex. Many such traits are linked to the X-chromosome (Zechner et al. 2001). Sexual selection can also occur much faster than natural selection, providing a potential explanation for the speed with which human intelligence seems to have evolved in Homo sapiens - perhaps there is no adaptive explanation for our brains at all, and they are the result of selection for intelligent mates by women...?ReferencesZechner, U., Wilder, M., Kehrer-Sawatzki, H., Vogel, W., Fundele, R., &amp;amp; Hameister, H.

More mass media lunacy is looming, with a new show on TLC called &lt;a href="http://zenoferox.blogspot.com/2010/03/grave-injustice.html"&gt;Paranormal Court&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Hansen, a psychic medium famous among people who believe in psychic mediums, will mediate disputes between family members squabbling over possessions left behind by the deceased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, if somebody I loved died, and a fraud like Robert Hanson came along to tell me what that person believed, I think I'd be a bit pissed. And no, I wouldn't accept that he had &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; authority or knowledge to determine the state of mind of the deceased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and TLC (it stands for The Lamebrain Channel, I think) descends a few more notches in credibility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/turn_off_your_tv.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/0FhiYDk2dgk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269715608602"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/advice_from_believers_is_demon.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cb8c570e830b6a5e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Advice from believers is demonstrably worthless</title><published>2010-03-27T19:18:26Z</published><updated>2010-03-27T19:18:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/EwMoDBBI9iU/advice_from_believers_is_demon.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/advice_from_believers_is_demon.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/abc_covers_the_global_atheist.php"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;, I revisited their &lt;a href="http://blogs.radionational.net.au/atheistconvention/"&gt;Global Atheist Convention blog&lt;/a&gt;, which I can say without hesitation was absolutely the &lt;i&gt;worst&lt;/i&gt; effort any of the media put out. I think I prefer the blatant stupidity of a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/ablett_couldnt_even_translate.php"&gt;Gary Ablett&lt;/a&gt; to the mawkish blitherings of a gang of pious apologists — at least it&amp;#39;s honest. And that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;ve got — the blog is &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; limping along with a series of tepid guest posts by people making weak excuses for their faith. It was supposedly a blog about the convention, but it never quite rose to the standard of even meeting their own aims — instead, it&amp;#39;s an exercise in breast-beating by sorry-assed theists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's utterly negligible and irrelevant, unless you like the spectacle of Christians going boo-hoo-hoo. I did catch &lt;a href="http://blogs.radionational.net.au/atheistconvention/?p=665"&gt;one gawdawful post by Chris Mulherin&lt;/a&gt;, though, which adds the additional fillip of seeing a Christian getting everything completely wrong. It's embarrassing. I even addressed several of these points in my talk, and said the exact opposite of what Mulherin claims are truisms for atheists. Maybe I put him to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here are 5 things that Mulherin claims are 'unscientific beliefs' that must be held to get science off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five things that atheists (and others) believe that cannot be shown by the evidence of science:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The universe is governed by the law of cause and effect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can normally trust human rationality and the evidence of our senses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The axioms of mathematics and the laws of logic are true.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral language makes sense and cannot be reduced to personal preferences.&lt;/strong&gt; Racism, paedophilia, destroying the planet and chauvinism are wrong in a more binding sense than "I/we don't like those things."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
Humans have freewill and are not totally determined by the laws of science.&lt;/strong&gt; In order to live, converse, decide what I will put on my sandwich, or whether I will attend an atheist convention, I must have the freedom (within limits) to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more to be said, and the debate can be complicated, but the gist of the idea is that &lt;em&gt;science must take some things as given before it can start its work&lt;/em&gt;. Most atheists take the above truths as givens, despite the fact that none of them can be derived scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ugh. See? This is what happens when you gather a band of happy theists to interpret the words of a convention of atheists — it goes plunging off the rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrong. I think chance is a significant factor in the universe. Cause and effect are important but not necessarily assumed; causal relationships are what we test for in scientific experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Completely wrong. Quite the reverse, actually; science is a tool we use to correct for the unreliability of our minds and our senses. I know I don't trust my perceptions at all, and consider independent confirmation a great reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an utterly trivial sense, "truth" is an outcome of logic and math, so yes, this is accurate, by definition. We do believe that there is a real universe, and we attempt to probe it empirically, and in that sense we suspect that there is an actual deeper material truth, but that's about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do wonder, though, if logic is false, how Christians interpret the world. Wouldn't that make everything arbitrary and chaotic? In that context, maybe the Bible is useful after all, since it is an awfully arbitrary book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mulherin needs to read some Hauser. A lot of morality &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; driven by personal revulsion, nothing more. There is a greater binding sense, however: a rational decision that says that discriminating against fellow human beings, abusing the next generation, reducing the carrying capacity of our environment, and treating women as objects has long term consequences to our society that are deleterious to the preservation of culture. We do make an assumption our culture is worth preserving, of course, but then, so do people in all viable cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's very Darwinian reasoning, though. Maybe Mulherin hasn't quite grokked that major insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free will is philosophical bullshit. You can have an entirely natural biology that is subject to investigation by science that is not some kind of clockwork, predestined sequence of events. &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; decide what to put on my sandwich, but "I" is an unpredictable product of very complex neurological activity, colored by history over a baseline of biological predispositions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's extremely annoying to be told by a delusionist precisely what beliefs I &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; hold because I'm an atheist, when I don't. It's a bit like &lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2010/03/an-open-letter-to-concerned-believers.html"&gt;concern trolling&lt;/a&gt;: the helpful faith-head erects a squad of five straw men which he'll then kindly offer to demolish from us to clear the illusions from &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; eyes. No, thank you: you believe in ritual sacrifice, god-men, magical supplications, and supernatural beings. Your advice on science is worthless except for comedy purposes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/advice_from_believers_is_demon.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/EwMoDBBI9iU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269713165747"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/03/27/dormant-viruses-can-hide-in-our-dna-and-be-passed-from-parent-to-child/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4a1c72caa3b097d4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Dormant viruses can hide in our DNA and be passed from parent to child</title><published>2010-03-27T13:00:57Z</published><updated>2010-03-27T13:00:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/IxQGfcKkWKw/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/03/27/dormant-viruses-can-hide-in-our-dna-and-be-passed-from-parent-to-child/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">During our early childhoods, the vast majority of us are boarded by a stowaway that can stay with us for the rest of our lives.

He&amp;#39;s so irate that now he&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://sipseystreetirregulars.blogspot.com/2010/03/to-all-modern-sons-of-liberty-this-is.html"&gt;publicly inciting violence&lt;/a&gt; (which is nothing new, he's been &lt;a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2005/winter/the-nativists?page=0,17"&gt;advocating civil war for years&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

It is, after all, more humane than shooting them in self defense.

And if we do a proper job, if we break the windows of hundreds, thousands, of Democrat party headquarters across this country, we might just wake up enough of them to make defending ourselves at the muzzle of a rifle unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pieces of meat passed high over our heads while others were falling at our feet. The dunes were rapidly evacuated as spectators escaped both the falling debris and the overwhelming smell. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;-&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5010529"&gt;Paul Linnman&lt;/a&gt;, News Reporter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This past week was my spring break, and my family and I went down to the Oregon coast.  And while we were down there, we learned a little bit of local history.  Namely, forty years ago, a huge, deceased whale washed up on one of the beaches, and nobody quite knew how to deal with it.  Somehow, the only song I find appropriate is &lt;i&gt;Sinnerman&lt;/i&gt; by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Simone"&gt;Nina Simone&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.odeo.com/flash/audio_player_standard_gray.swf&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=52&amp;amp;flashVars=valid_sample_rate%3Dtrue%26external_url%3Dhttp://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/weekend_diversion_blowing_up_a/20%2520Sinnerman%25201.mp3" width="300" height="52"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how would you have dealt with this beached, dead whale?  Would you have tried to push it back into the ocean?  Would you have cut it up and disposed of the pieces?  Or, like the state of Oregon, would you have tried to &lt;i&gt;blow it up using about 1,000 lbs. of dynamite?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's go to the videotape.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/2CDH7IaNG6E%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A guy hits on a woman in a bar, she makes it clear she’s not interested. Then a news item comes on the bar TV saying that an asteroid is about to hit earth. The woman is seen to panic, she and the guy make eye contact, and as everyone else in the bar screams and runs away, she jumps on him in a passionate embrace and they (presumably) have sex on the sticky and beer-soaked floor. Then we see the same guy go behind the scenes to where his mates are standing in what turns out to be a fake TV newsroom, they do high fives and he drinks a Pepsi Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not lacking a sense of humour. I am not known for political correctness. But hello? If you make a woman think she is about to die in order to have sex with her, that is a bit rapey. Would she have had sex with you otherwise? No – we clearly see her turn the guy down. Was she under extreme emotional duress? Yes – she thinks she and everyone she loves are about to die horribly. Does this make me want to buy Pepsi Max? No, it makes me want to pretend to kidnap the children of the ad execs who came up with this ad in order to get them to do things they wouldn’t otherwise do (like show some semblance of intelligence). Disclaimer: it makes me &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do it, but I wouldn’t, because I am not a jerk, unlike the Pepsi Max-drinking jerk in the ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they think that any controversy is clever guerilla marketing, and so the ad is win-win. Banned adverts can often help promote a brand, so if this one causes a stink then they get more column inches than they would otherwise have done. Or maybe they’re just clueless. One really really hopes that it’s the former, because if those responsible for this ad think it’s OK to be a bit rapey, I am saddened. I’ll contact Pepsi UK for a comment and let you know what they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETA: @mjrobbins on Twitter just pointed out the dance they do at the end, which we have now dubbed the pack hunt Dance of Rape.&lt;/p&gt;

It is, in my view, an elegant and attractive piece of legal reasoning, and it does great credit to the District Judge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, District Judges are in my opinion the unsung heroes of the criminal justice system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also note in passing that, unless there is the requirement to prove a menacing intention (and so not just strict liability on the basis of the words being themselves menacing), then I am below committing the very same offence as Mr Chambers when I repeat the "joke" in paragraph numbered 1 below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And any Court officer who emailed or faxed the judgment also committed the same offence...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;In the Doncaster Magistrates’ Court&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;R v Paul John Chambers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;1.       On the 19th February 2010 Paul Chambers (the defendant) appeared before the Doncaster Magistrates’ Court when he was legally represented and pleaded guilty to the following offence:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;On Wednesday 6th January 2010 at Doncaster sent by means of a public electronic communications network a message namely “Crap!  Robin Hood Airport is closed.  You’ve got a week and a bit to get your shit together, otherwise I’m blowing the airport sky high!” that was grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character, contrary to &lt;a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts2003/ukpga_20030021_en_13#pt2-ch1-pb20-l1g127"&gt;section 127(1)(A) and (3) of the Communications Act 2003&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The case was adjourned for a pre sentence report to be prepared.  All sentencing options were left open.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.       On the 12th March the defendant appeared but was represented by new solicitors.  They indicated the defendant wished to vacate his guilty plea.  The case was then adjourned to 15th March when the matter came before me for the application to vacate to be considered.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.       A plea may be changed at anytime up to the moment of sentence but a change of plea is always subject to a discretion that must be exercised judicially and in the interests of justice, not just the interests of the defendant.  The procedure for a change of plea in the magistrates’ court is covered by rule 37.9 of the&lt;a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/criminal/procrules_fin/contents/rules/part_37.htm"&gt; Criminal Procedure Rules 2005&lt;/a&gt;.  The application has not been made in writing but I have received full details from the defendant’s new solicitors as to the reasons for this application.  In summary it is submitted that his previous solicitor had little time to consider the charge.  Subsequently that solicitor had some concerns as to whether the correct plea had been entered and referred the case to new solicitors.  Furthermore it is said the defendant has a defence to the charge in that it is suggested he did not have the necessary means rea for the offence.  I have been referred to his lengthy interviews with the police to support this proposition.  I have also been directed to the case of &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/40.html"&gt;DPP v Collins &lt;/a&gt;[2006] UKHL 40.  In that case, which was a case of “grossly offensive” conduct under s.127, Lord Bingham touched upon the mens rea of the offence.  In paragraph 10 he raised the question:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;            “In contrast with section 127(2)(a) and its predecessor subsections, which require proof of an unlawful purpose and a degree of knowledge, section 127(1)(a) provides no explicit guidance on the state of mind which must be proved against a defendant to establish an offence against the subsection.  What, if anything, must be proved beyond an intention to send the message in question?”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;He answered his question in the following paragraph:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;           “11 It is pertinent to recall Lord Reid’s observations in &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1969/1.html"&gt;Sweet v Parsley&lt;/a&gt; [1970] AC 132, 148:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;           “&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;Our first duty is to  consider the words of the Act: if they show a clear intention to create an absolute offence that is an end of the matter.  But such cases are very rare.  Sometimes the words of the section which creates a particular offence make it clear that mens rea is required in one form or another.  Such cases are quite frequent.  But in a very large number of cases there is no clear indication either way.  In such cases there has for centuries been a presumption that Parliament did not intend to make criminals of persons who were in no way blameworthy in what they did.  That means that whenever a section is silent as to mens rea there is a presumption that, in order to give effect to the will of Parliament, we must read in words appropriate to require mens rea.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;"This passage is relevant here, since Parliament cannot have intended to criminalise the conduct of a person using language which is, for reasons unknown to him, grossly offensive to those to whom it relates, or which may even be thought, however wrongly, to represent a polite or acceptable usage.  On the other hand, a culpable state of mind will ordinarily be found where a message is couched in terms showing an intention to insult those to whom the message relates or giving rise to the inference that a risk of doing to must have been recognised by the sender.  The same will be true where facts known to the sender of a message about an intended recipient render the message peculiarly offensive to that recipient, or likely to be so, whether or not the message in fact reaches the recipient.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4.       Since the case was before me on Monday I have had an opportunity to consider the defendant’s interviews that took place with the police on the 13th January 2010.  The essence of his interviews is that he accepts posting the message on the social networking site known as “Twitter” but denies any intention that this should be seen by staff at Robin Hood airport.  He did not think anyone would take it seriously and regarded it as nothing more than “silly humour”.  As Mr Haigh pointed out the police believed the matter would be denied at court as the anticipated plea entered upon the MG 5 prepared by the police was “not guilty”.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5.       Successful applications to vacate pleas in the Magistrates’ court, particularly when a defendant is represented, will be exceptional.  However in this case I exercise my discretion to allow the defendant to vacate his plea in the interest of justice.  In coming to this view I take account of the fact that this is an unusual charge.  The defence had little time to consider the matter and in these days of &lt;a href="http://www.cjsonline.gov.uk/the_cjs/whats_new/news-3512.html"&gt;CJSSS&lt;/a&gt; there is great pressure upon everybody, not least those representing defendants, to enter pleas as quickly as possible.  I further note it was the defendant’s previous solicitors, who upon reflection, began to have doubts about the original plea.  This is not a case of a defendant, having entered a guilty plea, then appreciating the seriousness of the case and consequently having a change of heart.  I also note there are valid legal issues raised, particularly those arising out of the of DPP v Collins, which may afford a valid defence.  I have paid particular attention to the stance of the defendant in his interviews.  In couching my remarks in these terms I express no view one way or the other as to the likely outcome of such legal argument that may follow in any subsequent trial. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6.       In allowing the defendant to vacate his plea he will, I have no doubt, been advised that, if convicted, he will get no credit for entering a plea in accordance with &lt;a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030044_en_14#pt12-ch1-pb1-l1g144"&gt;s144 Criminal Justice Act 2003&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonathan Bennett&lt;br&gt;District Judge (Magistrates’ Court)&lt;br&gt;18th March 2010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published; always use a name for ease of reference by other commenters.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-113715982417717443?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269700941174"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=10058">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7aec37e095df5a60</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="cats"/><category term="cheetah"/><category term="coloration"/><category term="cryptozoology"/><category term="felids"/><category term="polymorphism"/><title type="html">Caturday felid: the King Cheetah</title><published>2010-03-27T14:42:02Z</published><updated>2010-03-27T14:42:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/caturday-felid-the-king-cheetah/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;by Greg Mayer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of interest to both ecological geneticists studying &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/26/polymorphism-in-vertebrates/"&gt;vertebrate polymorphisms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/02/05/cryptozoology/"&gt;cryptozoologists&lt;/a&gt; is the king cheetah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:341px"&gt;&lt;img title="King Cheetah" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/king-cheetah-flickr-jurvetson.jpg?w=331&amp;amp;h=500" alt="" width="331" height="500"&gt;&lt;p&gt;King Cheetah, by Jurvetson.

&lt;p&gt;The king cheetah, known only from southern Africa, is a striking pattern variation of the common cheetah (&lt;em&gt;Acinonyx jubatus&lt;/em&gt;). Instead of being spotted, the dark markings of the king cheetah coalesce into stripes and vermiculations, especially along the dorsal midline. King cheetahs are to common cheetahs as blotched tabbies are to spotted tabbies, not just in the similarity of the patterns, but in their genetic relationship: the king pattern is a variation within populations of the same species, and both patterns can occur in the same litter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;img title="common cheetah flickr" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/common-cheetah-flickr1.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common cheetahs, by Picture Taker 2, source http://www.flickr.com/photos/80835774@N00/4360426464/in/photostream/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1927, R.I. Pocock of the British Museum named the king cheetah as a new species, &lt;em&gt;Acinonyx rex&lt;/em&gt;, the holotype being a specimen at the Queen Victoria Memorial Library and Museum in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). In 1932 the zoologist Angel Cabrera suggested that the king cheetah was merely a coat pattern variant of the common cheetah. For many decades after that the question of the status of the king cheetah was unresolved, as few specimens were known, and genetic experiments on cheetahs not possible. Cryptozoologists became interested in the king cheetah as a ’semi-cryptid’– a not quite undiscovered species of large mammal, but at least a mysterious one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s more king cheetahs turned up, and methods of captive breeding of cheetahs, developed for conservation purposes, had advanced to the point where it was possible to investigate the question. In 1986, &lt;a href="http://www.ceru.up.ac.za/downloads/Inheritance_king_coat_colour_pattern_cheetahs.pdf"&gt;R.J. van Arde and Ann van Dyk&lt;/a&gt; of Pretoria University and the National Zoo in Pretoria, South Africa, showed that the king coat pattern was due to a recessive mutation at a single autosomal locus, thus vindicating Cabrera’s hypothesis from 50 years earlier. King cheetahs are now found in several animal parks in South Africa, and can be easily seen and photographed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of the king cheetah shows that even when a new species is described and named according to the best practices, including insuring a publicly available holotype, it doesn’t guarantee that the species so named is new. It might be a new species, but it might also be a geographic or within-population variation of a known species (the latter in the case of the king cheetah), or in some cases nothing new at all (as when the describer is unaware that a description had been published previously).&lt;/p&gt;

But one recent hotel was a bit special: while perambulating to my room down an outside corridor, I spotted this on the floor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/03/pareidolia_angelwings.jpg" alt="pareidolia_angelwings" title="pareidolia_angelwings" width="610" height="620"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, the town I am in — forgive me for not revealing the location!  — is very religious, and in a way that shapes like this would easily be revered as some sort of icon of God’s presence. The resemblance to an angel is obvious. &lt;/p&gt;

Had I instead been walking &lt;strong&gt;to&lt;/strong&gt; lunch when I spotted it, I would’ve seen this view on the left. I suppose angels have to breathe, too, so this could be interpreted as a divine pulmonary system, but somehow I doubt it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it look like to you?&lt;/p&gt;

(Actually, how could you avoid them?) I'm talking about those annoying Omnaris commercials with the crappy computer animation in which a bunch of military-looking men in helmets ram an Omnaris sprayer into the woman's nose to fix her nasal allergies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/pJ9fHwEBjws%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something's always bugged me about that commercial, more than the amateurish computer animation and the cheesy, "Omnaris, to the nose!" battle cry of the mini-white troops. Yes, I see the obvious (and lame) homage to &lt;em&gt;Woody Allen's Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask)&lt;/em&gt;. Even so, something bugged me about the commercial. Now I think I know what it is, and revere (actually, Mrs. revere) has shown me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2010/03/nose_rape.php"&gt;Nose rape&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I am just a clueless male, but now that it's been pointed out to me, I think Mrs. R nailed it. It's so obvious. A bunch of militaristic "soldiers" jamming a big phallic object into an orifice. Yeah, that just about sums it up. It's either nose sex or nose rape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/now_i_know_what_bugs_me_about_those_omna.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/oooWBKYmTn4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269699026664"><id gr:original-id="http://brainblogger.com/2010/03/27/screening-for-postpartum-depression-not-worth-the-time-or-money/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/da12f142708280a7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Screening for Postpartum Depression Not Worth the Time or Money</title><published>2010-03-27T08:00:46Z</published><updated>2010-03-27T08:00:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/meA97YN9ULI/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://brainblogger.com/2010/03/27/screening-for-postpartum-depression-not-worth-the-time-or-money/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">More than 10% of women experience either major or minor depression six weeks after giving birth.

He responded to an email I sent him recently:&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;I don't really care whether or not some kind of god exists. I deny the Christian God. Once I can provoke doubt about that kind of God then the other gods will go by the wayside for the same reasons. Many atheists attack me for this but it's a strategy of mine based on my own anecdotal experience that I have never heard of a single Christian leaving the fold because he or she thought the arguments for the existence for God were faulty. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My goal is not to win debates but to change minds, although winning would be nice too. All some atheists are concerned with is whether or not I win debates. They don't understand what I'm doing. Do you? What do you think of this?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doug writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;I think your strategy is exactly right.  Not a single debate opponent I've had believed in only a generic "God-of-the-Philosophers."  Not a single one had a constituency interested in whether there was a God aside from the Christian one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, in at least two of my dozen or so debates, I was told by debate organizers that my opponent would be arguing for a generic god and not for Christianity in particular, and I was told in no uncertain terms that it would be a colossal waste of my time to prepare any anti-Christian arguments, such as against the empty tomb or the transformation of the apostles, etc. Well, in both cases I was told a lie, but fortunately I knew it was a lie and when the opponent argued for the Christian god in particular I was well prepared.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I agree with your approach. However, your point that it is also good to win debates is good too. Even if your opponent wins a debate about a generic god, though, the Christians will take that as a win for the Christian god.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-8855854801307568723?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/HHKq9tt50O8%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he turns to the president, some combination of careful listening and lip-reading suggests that Biden said "((this is)) a big fucking deal".&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not interested in &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=801"&gt;whether and how the FCC should get involved&lt;/a&gt; in the use of a taboo word on the air — or whether it matters that you need a good imagination to be sure that you heard it –  but rather in something about the part of the remark that remains if we leave the taboo word out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the OED tells us, "a big deal" (with or without the taboo intensifier) is an American expression for "Something considered important; a cause for excitement or concern."  But the phrase is also "Used as an ironical exclamation to express one's contempt for something regarded as impressive or  important by another person."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the contemptuous sense seems to be associated specifically with the exclamatory fragment "big deal", where the determiner is omitted.  That version can't be used predicatively: "This is big deal" might be the boast of a Russian who never mastered the English determiner system,  but it's not something that a native speaker would say "to express contempt for something regarded as impressive by another person".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiomatic contempt aside, the anarthrous exclamatory fragment &amp;quot;big deal&amp;quot; is syntactically regular, in that there are lots of other adjective+noun combinations used in a similar way. Some of them are also normally ironic, like &amp;quot;smooth move&amp;quot;,  but most may be sincere: &amp;quot;good man&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;nice try&amp;quot;,  &amp;quot;cute shoes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;great idea&amp;quot;, …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are always corresponding regular nouns phrases, like &amp;quot;a great idea&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;those cute shoes&amp;quot;. But the idiomatic irony associated with &amp;quot;big deal&amp;quot; seems to be limited to the isolated exclamatory form — and in the same way, the isolated exclamatory form in that case seems to be only the ironic idiom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus vice-president Biden said "((that's)) a big fucking deal", and, I imagine, meant it sincerely.  But if he'd said just "big fucking deal" it would have been a deflating attempt to subvert the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anarthrous exclamatory fragments are constrained in ways that are not entirely clear to me. For example, if you taste some soup with too much salt in it, you can certainly exclaim "wow, this soup is really salty!", but the anarthrous exclamative "salty soup!" doesn't seem to me to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the exclamations are supposed to be at least nominally positive. Thus "tasty soup!" works, and "spicy soup!" seem appropriate if you like it that way, but not if you don't.  But "tough luck!", though expressing support for the victim, involves a negative judgment about the event.  I bet that someone has studied this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idiomatic irony of &amp;quot;big deal!&amp;quot; means that the valence constraint is inverted — you can safely say &amp;quot;big deal!&amp;quot; only to express contempt, not to express admiration.  Luckily for president Obama, vice-president Biden seems to have started his remark with &amp;quot;this is a…&amp;quot;. Otherwise, the commentariat would be buzzing a different buzz.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269692189241"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/husdalcom/~3/PeSChpIEY6Q/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fb83d008307d3500</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Ménage à trois – the good, the bad and the ugly</title><published>2010-03-27T05:59:52Z</published><updated>2010-03-27T05:59:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/9ctU7rT9M6o/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/husdalcom/~3/PeSChpIEY6Q/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Triads in supply networks: Theorizing buyer-supplier-relationships  by Thomas Y Choi and Zhaohui Wu is a fascinating read and a brilliant attempt at classifying buyer-supplier triads into nine distinctively different [ ... ]...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Rather than set it as a quiz and waiting for the answers to come in, let me just supply the following sentence that Daniel Deutsch saw in the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/nyregion/21poet.html?pagewanted=all"&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt; With flowing black hair and a remarkable ability to pull off form-fitting black leather pants, Ms. Chang is a particularly glamorous ambassador of an art form not necessarily associated with lipstick and glitz. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Could the glamorous Ms. Chang really be noted for her prowess at tearing off her black leather pants?  One assumes that only her most intimate friends would know how good she is at getting undressed; even a glamorous art ambassador — even Lady Gaga — doesn&amp;#39;t customarily do that in public.  (And Ms. Chang is not in the same area of the arts as Lady Gaga; she is a poet — Tina Chang, the poet laureate of Brooklyn.)  So intended claim was surely the less dramatic one, illustrating not meaning (b) but merely meaning (a): that while you or I or the average poet might look silly in tight black leather pants, Ms. Chang succeeds in looking good in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how remarkable it is that the writer chose the &lt;i&gt;pull ___ off&lt;/i&gt; verb-preposition combination here without (one assumes) noticing the double entendre, and without the editors noticing it either.  As I believe I may have &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2079"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2148"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, it is really remarkable how much polysemy and ambiguity we tolerate during every single minute we listen to our language — and how little regard utterers pay to the business of ensuring that the addressee will not misunderstand.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

That was back when the show was still funnier than terminal cancer patients and was even known to cause actual laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was watching SNL. That night they were featuring a young musical guest named Sinéad O’Connor.  During her performance of the song &lt;em&gt;War&lt;/em&gt; she included lines about child abuse. And as the song came to a close, without warning, she pulled out a picture of the Pope, declared “Fight the real enemy,” and then proceeded to rip up the picture. This was followed by perhaps the quickest, most jarring cut to commercial in television history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighteen years later I still remember that night. I didn’t understand the full meaning back then but even then I loved seeing the breaking of taboos and I understood enough to applaud Sinéad O’Connor when so many were quick to condemn her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps I didn’t truly understand Sinéad’s message until now. This week, more than ever before in my lifetime, it seems that almost everyone else is beginning to understand what she was saying all those years ago too. Suddenly it seems like the world has finally caught up to her and people are actually interested in hearing this once despised musician’s take on the scandal she warned us about eighteen years ago. If only the people had listened then instead of cheering idiot celebrities threatening physical violence against her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only we’d listened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, eighteen years later, &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/25/AR2010032502363.html?hpid=topnews"&gt;The Washington Post has given Sinéad O’Connor a real platform to tell us exactly what she tried to tell us then&lt;/a&gt;. If only we’d listened the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s hope. Let us not make the same mistakes we made then. &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/examiner/x-9090-NY-Atheism--Skepticism-Examiner~y2010m3d26-In-The-Times-Pope-allowed-child-rape-to-continue"&gt;As I tried to convey in my most recent Examiner article&lt;/a&gt;, now is the time to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to stop looking the other way and pretending these problems don’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to fight the real enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I have some laptop problems (Dell PC with WinXP, only FF as browser).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first inklings of problems showed up right after the AAAS meeting last month. I have been dutifully cleaning with Symantec, Spyware Doctor, SUPERantispyware and Spybot Search&amp;amp;Destroy almost daily since then.  My Malwarebytes does not work - after uninstalling it, I get an error when trying to reinstall. Ad-Aware does not let me start (says I am a wrong user for it). WTF?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is this - Google sites give me 404, etc.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not Found

&lt;p&gt;The requested URL /accounts/ServiceLogin was not found on this server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache/2.2.3 (Red Hat) Server at www.google.com Port 443&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I cannot get into Gmail, Google docs, do Google searches, etc. It started a few days ago by letting me access these (and other sites) by first asking me to View Certificate (I click No and it proceeds to the site). That happened on and off - the same website would sometimes ask sometimes not for this. On Monday/Tuesday in Boston, this did not happen at all on the hotel wifi. It did again in a cafe on their wifi, and then again when I got home. Now, if I have a saved search (e.g., Google Blogsearch for my blog URL) I can get there and see it and change search terms, etc., but if I try to click on any of the search items it forwards to a commercial/spam site instead. I also get 404 if I try to Log In my Google profile at any site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All other sites on the WWW I can access just fine right now (and no call to view certificate either). I can check Gmail on iPhone but cannot download files, copy+paste, etc. from there. So, unless I can reply in two words, my response to your mail may be delayed until I get this fixed. Or re-send, if urgent, your message to my other e-mail: Bora@plos.org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spent the whole day and night yesterday cleaning up the laptop with four different spy/mal/ad-ware/virus cleaners- they did not find much of concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is not with the router - other family members using the same connection have no problems with their laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my Internet Explorer does not work, I cannot afford to remove Firefox (if it is Firefox that is borked) as I cannot get back online afterwards to re-download it again. I cannot first download Chrome, because it is a Google product, so I get 404. Any other browsers I should try?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other ideas?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/update_and_question_about_comp.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/U0XTjen8XBo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269658070976"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=4966">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0f9231f0fa570d5b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Social Security to run a deficit this year</title><published>2010-03-27T02:27:47Z</published><updated>2010-03-27T02:27:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/6gXVsZYD4JU/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Left Brain/Right Brain</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269657918823"><id gr:original-id="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/?p=912">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2ed9a01a0cdea633</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Hacks"/><category term="Hackademe"/><title type="html">Hackademe highlight: Turn an old laptop into a multi-purpose office door sign.</title><published>2010-03-27T02:45:05Z</published><updated>2010-03-27T02:45:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/v2zsPsrtw8M/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/2010/03/hackademe-highlight-turn-an-old-laptop-into-a-multi-purpose-office-door-sign/"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reposted from &lt;a href="http://www.hackademe.com/2010/03/turn-an-old-laptop-into-a-multi-purpose-office-door-sign/"&gt;Hackademe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.hackademe.com/images/difficulty5a.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="58"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by posts on &lt;a href="http://www.profhacker.com/2010/03/16/wheres-the-prof/"&gt;ProfHacker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5177762/turn-an-old-laptop-into-a-wall+mounted-computer"&gt;Lifehacker&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to hack myself a new office door sign. Moreover, I was determined to produce a working prototype for less than $100.  There are several how-to guides out there, but here are some specifics  of my pilot project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Obtain an old laptop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent around an email in my department asking for old laptops that still boot up but which are no longer being used.  I indicated that the laptop would not survive the procedure I had planned (at least not as a laptop), so my colleagues should only donate their old laptops if they didn’t want them back.  I received an old 2001 Toshiba Satellite the next day, and there are a few others coming soon.  I also contacted the campus recycling centre and asked them to keep an eye out for laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:290px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hackademe.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Toshiba_Satellite_2800_1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Toshiba_Satellite_2800_1" src="http://www.hackademe.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Toshiba_Satellite_2800_1.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="280"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not exactly as shown.  I forgot to take a &amp;quot;before&amp;quot; photo.  Also, I wasn&amp;#39;t sure this would all work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Strip down the laptop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only parts you need are the LCD screen, the motherboard (including fan, USB ports, ethernet port, etc.), the hard drive, the power switch, and the guts of the touch pad.  The latter is just so it will boot up without complaining that there is no mouse.  Pretty much everything can be disassembled by removing tiny screws.  Oh, so many screws.  It helps to have a computer toolkit, but any small screwdriver will work.  Be sure to recycle the plastic case and to dispose of the battery in an environmentally responsible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hackademe.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/walltop2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="walltop2" src="http://www.hackademe.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/walltop2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuff you don&amp;#39;t need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Get a picture frame.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to mount the door sign inside a picture frame.  The criteria for the frame are that it be large enough (I ended up with one 11″ x 14″), as deep as possible (you could also go with an actual shadow box), and cheap. Cost: $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hackademe.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/walltop3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="walltop3" src="http://www.hackademe.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/walltop3.jpg" alt="" width="392" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: Attach the laptop components to the frame.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this was just a pilot project, I didn’t worry too much about aesthetics.  To wit, I attached the LCD to the inside of the glass with electrical tape, trimmed and replaced the particle board backing and taped it in, and then taped all the components to the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hackademe.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Walltop1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Walltop1" src="http://www.hackademe.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Walltop1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="381"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrical tape is the new duct tape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This extended beyond the frame a bit, so I found some spacers and screws and attached a piece of old particle board that I had in my garage.  Again, I didn’t work under stringent aesthetic standards, so it’s pretty rough (but no one sees it most of the time anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:391px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hackademe.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/walltop7.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="walltop7" src="http://www.hackademe.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/walltop7.jpg" alt="" width="381" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side view showing spacers and back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5: Test.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plug in the power and test it to see if it will boot up.  In my case, it would get partway there and would shut down.  This sort of thing often happens if the processor is overheating, and sure enough there was an issue with the fan.  I took the fan off, replaced the heat sink compound, and put everything back in place.  It is now working fine.  Cost: $10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6: Mount on the door or wall.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will vary according to your office layout, but in my case I mounted the frame on the inside of my office door using some simple brackets.  Cost: $0.49 x 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:385px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hackademe.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/walltop6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="walltop6" src="http://www.hackademe.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/walltop6.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The back of my door.  I stuck a cool poster on it just because.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 7: Connect to internet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular laptop did not have wireless capabilities (did I mention it was old?), and using the campus wireless network requires logins and other hassles anyway, so I just ran a 25′ cable from a switch on my desk.  Cost: $30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 8: Make desktop wallpaper.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made an image of the correct dimensions that is black with some white boxes that provide information that I want permanently displayed, such as how to make an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 9: Set up Twitter. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have real time updates on my whereabouts available to visitors, I followed the example posted by others and set up a &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; feed just for this.  On the display computer I installed &lt;a href="http://www.twhirl.org/"&gt;Twhirl&lt;/a&gt; to show my tweets and added it to the startup programs.  Others have used &lt;a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/"&gt;TweetDeck&lt;/a&gt;, but I find that Twirl lets you do more customization, such as increasing the font size to make it easier to read.  I also installed a Twitter application on my BlackBerry so I can update it from anywhere easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 10: Create a slideshow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the extra space on the screen, I created a slideshow of images from our lab in &lt;a href="http://www.irfanview.com/"&gt;irfanview&lt;/a&gt;, set the size and location, and exported as an executable that loads automatically on startup.  I also set the Windows taskbar to auto-hide so it’s not visible most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 11: Set up remote access.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I can make changes on the mounted display computer by plugging in a USB mouse and keyboard, it’s handy to be able to access it from my desk.  To do this, I set up a free &lt;a href="http://www.logmein.com"&gt;LogMeIn&lt;/a&gt; account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 12: Set up Wake on LAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want the display computer to run all the time, but I also don’t want it to only be turned on if I am in my office.  This would defeat part of the purpose, which is to let people know when I am not in.  To be able to turn it on remotely, I first set the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_setup"&gt;BIOS&lt;/a&gt; to enable &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN"&gt;Wake on LAN&lt;/a&gt;.  You access the BIOS menu during boot up by hitting a particular key depending on your computer (e.g., DEL, F2), and if your motherboard supports it you will see a Wake on LAN option that can be enabled under Power Management Setup.  You will also need the IP address and MAC (aka physical) address of the computer, which you can get by running a command prompt (START -&amp;gt; RUN -&amp;gt; command) and typing “ipconfig /all”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c8/AwardBIOS_CMOS_Setup_Utility.png" alt="" width="400" height="294"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I set up a desktop application from &lt;a href="http://www.solarwinds.com/products/freetools/wake_on_lan.aspx"&gt;SolarWinds&lt;/a&gt; that can send the  “magic packet” to boot the mounted computer.  There are various other free programs available that will do the same thing.  This can also be done  through an online site that I can access &lt;a href="http://www.wakeonlan.me/"&gt;from  my other computer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://mobile.wakeonlan.me/"&gt;from my BlackBerry&lt;/a&gt;.   Wake on LAN  appears to be rather finicky and doesn’t seem to work every time, so I  am still fiddling with it.  Also, I have not yet found a decent  BlackBerry application that can remotely boot computers, which I would  prefer over using a webpage.  But in preliminary tests I was able to  turn it on from my desktop and from my BlackBerry, at least when I am on  campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it!  The sign is now operational and looks great on the door. Total cost: $62.00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Razib of Gene Expression has moved from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to his new digs &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp" title=""&gt;over there&lt;/a&gt;. Read his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2010/03/im_moving_to_discover.php" title=""&gt;Goodbye post on Sb&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/03/25/welcome/" title=""&gt;Welcome post&lt;/a&gt; over at Discover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed Yong of Not Exactly Rocket Science has moved from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to his new digs &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/" title=""&gt;over there&lt;/a&gt;. Read his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2010/03/metamorphosis_-_not_exactly_rocket_science_moves_to_discover.php" title=""&gt;Goodbye post on Sb&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/03/26/begin-phase-three/" title=""&gt;Welcome post&lt;/a&gt; over at Discover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Razib and Ed are joining the small but elite blogging network, backed by the well-known Discover brand, the likes of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" title=""&gt;Carl Zimmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" title=""&gt;Phil Plait&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" title=""&gt;Sean Carrol et al.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" title=""&gt;Sheril Kirshenbaum and Chris Mooney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/" title=""&gt;Andrew Moseman and Smriti Rao, plus NCBI ROFL&lt;/a&gt;, as well as their editorial blogs, e.g., &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats" title=""&gt;80 Beats&lt;/a&gt; aggregator, Rebecca Horne's &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/visualscience" title=""&gt;Visual Science&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/sciencenotfiction/" title=""&gt;Science Not Fiction&lt;/a&gt;. I hope you change your bookmarks and subscriptions and follow Ed and Razib at their new place. As they say, once a SciBling, always a SciBling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science blogging networks are growing and multiplying. Each network, be it &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/" title=""&gt;Scienceblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/" title=""&gt;Nature Network&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sciblogs.co.nz/" title=""&gt;SciBlogs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/" title=""&gt;Discover blogs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/" title=""&gt;ScientificBlogging.org&lt;/a&gt; or others has a different approach, different goals, different style, different target audience... Some start many new people at blogging, nurture them and build them until some of them become brand-names on their own. Others lure in already very popular bloggers. Some focus strictly on science. Others give bloggers complete freedom to explore any topics they are interested in (hopefully with some intersection with science most of the time). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not surprising that individual bloggers, as they change and mature, find that a move to a different network (or even maintaining multiple blogs on multiple networks) better fits their own changing goals. Each network occupies a slightly different niche in the science blogging ecosystem, and more such networks exist, the better for science communication as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, move by Ed and Razib from Sb to Discover is just a part of a regular shuffle. They did not disappear from the scene in any way. Is it a "loss" to Scienceblogs.com? Sure, in a way. But perhaps you noticed that Scienceblogs.com has grown quite a bit lately, adding a number of wonderful bloggers. Are you reading &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/observations/" title=""&gt;Observations Of A Nerd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/obesitypanacea/" title=""&gt;Obesity Panacea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/universe/" title=""&gt;Universe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/oscillator/" title=""&gt;Oscillator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/casaubonsbook/" title=""&gt;Casaubon's Book&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dotphysics/" title=""&gt;Dot Physics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/appliedstatistics/" title=""&gt;Applied Statistics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolution/" title=""&gt;Evolution for Everyone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tomorrowstable/" title=""&gt;Tomorrow's Table&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bookoftrogool/" title=""&gt;The Book of Trogool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/collectiveimagination/" title=""&gt;Collective Imagination&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/commonknowledge/" title=""&gt;Common Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, among the newest additions to this very large stable of bloggers? Do you check &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/channel/24-hours/" title=""&gt;The Last 24 Hours page&lt;/a&gt; every day? We had more bloggers join than leave lately. The network subtly changes over time. And that is how it goes. And that is a Good Thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Ed and Razib - we'll follow you there, of course. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/some_recent_changes_at_science.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/HO-xUTd5gDU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269657293711"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=10044">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/437f0d9e397479e2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Three pieces on Templeton</title><published>2010-03-27T02:34:49Z</published><updated>2010-03-27T02:34:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/26/two-pieces-on-templeton/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;a href="http://www.philosophypress.co.uk/?p=1141"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Philosopher’s Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Ophelia Benson has a long, dispassionate analysis of the Templeton Foundation and its effects on science. The piece ends with a question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the issue in a nutshell. Are philosophy, science and theology different branches of the same kind of inquiry into life and being, which can be usefully and happily united? Or are they fundamentally different kinds of thing, with substantively different ways of inquiring and evaluating the results of inquiry? Templeton clearly considers the first answer correct, while the irreligious tribe of philosophers mostly (but not unanimously) opt for the second. With so much Templeton money hinging on the answer, it could be the $6 million question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d go with the second answer, for the many reasons I’ve discussed previously, but I’d exempt philosophy.  The “knowledge” that religion produces isn’t at all comparable to scientific knowledge, for religious “truth” differs among different faiths, is based on revelation rather than rationality, and, most important, is impervious to disproof. In other words, religion has no way to adjudicate competing truth claims or to disprove &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; truth claim. Philosophy, on the other hand, comes with rational ways to weed out error, and propositions can be disproved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;em&gt;Metamagician&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2010/03/speaking-of-templeton.html"&gt;Russell Blackford disagrees a bit on the either/or question&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not quite with her on this. I (and probably a lot of other philosophers) actually think that philosophy and science are continuous with each other, and it’s not clear where one ends and the other begins. They are part of the larger realm of rational inquiry, and the divisions made within this realm are more practical and pedagogical than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theology is a mixed bag. Lot of different and ill-matching stuff gets shoved into theology. Insofar as it includes, for example, rigorous historical-textual analysis of the holy books, it is part of the larger field of rational inquiry. But the core of it is, indeed, something fundamentally different. Still, it can conflict with philosophy and science because it often makes claims that these have the resources to contest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure I’d agree with Russell that theology includes Biblical scholarship.  I’ve talked with some of the Biblical scholars at the University of Chicago Divinity School, and I assure you that they’d take great umbrage at being described as theologians! (In fact, they’ve set me straight when I made that mistake.) Biblical scholarship that involves dissecting and analyzing the historical and textual sources of the scriptures is a rational endeavor, and that puts it in line with science, which, after all, is just organized rationality.  The &lt;em&gt;woo&lt;/em&gt; part of theology, i.e., the part for which Templeton awards millions of dollars, is clearly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a way to gain knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve challenged people over and over again to tell me what “truths” religion offers that &lt;em&gt;could not be apprehended&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;by science and rational thinking&lt;/em&gt;.  I’ve never gotten a satisfactory answer: the usual response involves moral prescriptions like “Love your neighbor”, which of course are neither truths nor the exclusive results of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religion, then, isn’t a way of knowing; it’s a way of believing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Bob Park, a professor of physics at The University of Maryland, has &lt;a href="http://www.bobpark.org/"&gt;a couple of short takes on Templeton&lt;/a&gt;: “Sir John Templeton: the man who tried to buy science,” and “A bigger prize: how much would it take to buy the NAS [National Academy of Sciences]?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Francisco Ayala, who won the £1 million Templeton Prize for &lt;b&gt;scientific thought&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say what? There's no amount of science you can do that will win you a Templeton prize. It's a prize for &lt;b&gt;religious apologetics&lt;/b&gt;, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then Ayala reveals why he won the prize. Not for science, but because he doesn't like those annoying atheists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;said that attacking religion and ridiculing believers provided ammunition for religious leaders who insisted that followers had to choose between God and Darwin. "Richard Dawkins has been a friend for more than 20 years, but it is unfortunate that he goes beyond the boundaries of science in making statements that antagonise believers," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Dawkins antagonizes believers is a given, but then, antagonizing them is a trivial exercise — run a sign past them that says &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t believe in God? You aren&amp;#39;t alone&amp;quot; and they&amp;#39;ll scream &amp;quot;oppression!&amp;quot; Many of us are quite happy to antagonize deluded believers in superstition, and we aren&amp;#39;t too happy with scientists who suck up to them instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that other comment about going "beyond the boundaries of science" is a curious one. Where? I think that when you invoke an invisible, undetectable ghost in the sky who diddles quanta or turns into a man who raises the dead, &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; you are going beyond the boundaries of science. When someone points out that there is no evidence of such activities, that the claims of supernaturalists are contradictory and unreasonable, or explains that the material claims of priests are fair game for critical examination, they are actually operating entirely within the domain of science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to see a specific example from Ayala of an invalid scientific argument from Dawkins or any of the other &amp;#39;New&amp;#39; Atheist scientists — or is it his belief that antagonizing believers is sufficient to make a claim unscientific? In which case we&amp;#39;d have to argue that the Catholic Church was acting &amp;#39;scientifically&amp;#39; in their treatment of Galileo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ayala has more Templeton-worthy comments to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The professor, who was born in Spain and is a naturalised American, says science and religion cannot be in contradiction because they address different questions. It is only when either subject oversteps its boundary, as he believes is the case with Professor Dawkins, that a contradiction arises, he said. "The scientific fundamentalism proposed by Dawkins implies a materialistic view of the world. But once science has had its say, there remains much about reality that is of interest. Common sense tells us that science can't tell us everything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again with the boundary. Where is this boundary, please, and where does Dawkins cross it? Be specific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is absurd to claim that science and religion can't be in contradiction. Look at Ken Ham's Creation "Museum"; that's pure religion through and through, and it is clearly in contradiction with science. QED. Perhaps Ayala wants to claim that his religion (if he has one) is not in contradiction to science, but that's also bogus; science obtains its information from empirical observation of the real world, not magic and not revelation and not the interpretation of sacred texts. Almost &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; religion proposes an alternate source of information from a supernatural entity; science challenges those explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What aspects of reality are not subject to science, or materialism, or natural investigation? I'd like to know. Is Ayala proposing ghosts or angels or gods capable of intervening in the world? (I will do him the credit of assuming that he's not going to trot out the idiotic claim that love is not natural, which is the usual inane example that gets thrown at us.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing about Ayala is that he always avoids the topic of his own personal beliefs about gods, which he claims is to avoid biasing people about his views, but which instead to me looks like intellectual cowardice: if you will not lay your ideas out on the table plainly, no one can criticize them. Here's a &lt;a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/creacionismo/fuera/verdad/Dios/seria/abortista/elpepusoc/20100326elpepisoc_10/Tes"&gt;standard disclaimer from Ayala in a Spanish source&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/creacionismo/fuera/verdad/Dios/seria/abortista/elpepusoc/20100326elpepisoc_10/Tes&amp;amp;sl=es&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;hl=&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;google translation&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question. In his youth he was ordained a Dominican priest. Are you still a man of faith?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Answer. Never answer that question. Do not want any of the parties, faith or religion, influence how people perceive my views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either he's one of those faitheists, who doesn't personally believe but thinks other people should, or he holds a few ideas about gods that he knows are indefensible. Either way, I'm unimpressed. It means he's going to hide his opinions safely away, and as we can see in the Times article, snipe away at atheists (we already know he won't snipe at his fellow travelers in the Templeton world, which hints at where his loyalties lie already.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also gives two of the usual NOMA arguments for religion: that it's domain is answering the "why" questions and providing morality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Science and religion are two windows to look at the world. The world is watching it. But what is seen from the windows is completely different. Religion is the meaning and purpose of life and moral values and science attempts to explain the composition of matter, the origin of organisms. Areas are different, but not at odds. It is possible to maintain a scientific position and being religious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An answer on the meaning and purpose life built around an untestable and often falsified proposition is no answer at all. I could declare right now that the meaning of life is found in the worship of Saturn, which is where the aliens who created life on earth reside, and where our souls will return at death, and sure, it is an &lt;i&gt;answer&lt;/i&gt;, but it's wrong and it's a lie. Christians can declare that the meaning of life is found in Jesus all they want, but I don't believe it (and neither do the Muslims or Hindus or Shintoists), and it isn't a good answer, since they've got no reason but tradition and fear to back it up. Religion is a free-floating myth, completely wrong and therefore invalid as an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for morality…what a joke. Has he looked at the ethical shambles of his former church? The &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article7065824.ece"&gt;child abuse revelations keep pouring out&lt;/a&gt;. We cannot possibly take religion&amp;#39;s leadership in moral issues seriously — the purpose of the church is to maintain power and an exalted status for its leadership, not to provide any insight into the beneficent desires of a heavenly patron of our species. Unless, of course, the message is that raping children is a good and kind act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now you can see why Ayala won the Templeton Prize. He's a master of the non-committal waffle, the pious denial of any problem with faith. He's definitely not acting on the side of science in his declarations about religion, because science tends to be a bit more open and bold than that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/ayala_fires_a_shot_across_the.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/rthDbAsJ-gw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269650820580"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8285737581949527996.post-5743390079820488138">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6569fa2077d39b7f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Treating depression in general medical patients</title><published>2010-03-26T21:59:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-26T21:59:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pyjamasinbananas.blogspot.com/2010/03/treating-depression-in-general-medical.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>pj</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269649267810"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=22736">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2f74470e8d9f7afa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheist Generosity"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">American Atheists and The Stiefel Challenge</title><published>2010-03-27T00:00:08Z</published><updated>2010-03-27T00:00:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/26/american-atheists-and-the-stiefel-challenge/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year, activist &lt;strong&gt;Helen Mitzman&lt;/strong&gt; made a $100,000 matching offer to &lt;a href="http://atheists.org"&gt;American Atheists&lt;/a&gt;.  Whatever they could raise in a year, up to that amount, she would personally match.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Atheists (and donors everywhere) met that challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was so successful that &lt;a href="http://www.atheists.org/Join_%26_Support/Stiefel_Challenge"&gt;philanthropist &lt;strong&gt;Todd Stiefel&lt;/strong&gt; is matching the match&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“I was really impressed by the Helen Mitzman Challenge and the enthusiastic response to it,” said Mr. Stiefel. “So I decided to offer $100,000 on a dollar-for-dollar basis. I hope this helps to fuel the continued growth of American Atheists so we can better share our message and expand the efforts to maintain what Thomas Jefferson eloquently described as “a wall of separation” between church and state.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stiefel’s challenge was revealed to American Atheists members in a recent letter and has already produced a wave of contributions–over $25,000 has already been received, according to president Ed Buckner, including generous contributions from attorney Eddie Tabash and from Helen Mitzman herself.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the challenge is partly to help “change misleading public perceptions about non-religious people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AA is a fantastic organization and I’m proud to be a member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to donate and have your gift matched by Todd, &lt;a href="http://www.atheists.org/contribute"&gt;you can do so here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regal figure to the right is Terrill Dalton. He had a vision that revealed that he, personally, was the Holy Ghost, Jesus Christ's dad. Who knew the Holy Ghost would look a bit like the Pillsbury Doughboy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the Holy Ghost has come down a bit in the world. He's now living in a collection of campers and vans on a 5 acre lot in Montana, leading a breakaway Mormon sect that &lt;a href="http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/article_010a1768-3898-11df-9f6e-001cc4c002e0.html"&gt;was too crazy for Utah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the Church of the Firstborn and General Assembly of Heaven had fled to Idaho from Utah last year after their large home in a Salt Lake City suburb was raided by federal officials investigating claims of child sexual abuse and assassination threats against President Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Thomas S. Monson, president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also has a &lt;a href="http://thefirstborn.org/Firstborn/"&gt;webpage with an anorexic Jesus and a mushroom cloud background&lt;/a&gt;; he's been busy &lt;a href="http://thefirstborn.org/bible/default.htm"&gt;rewriting the Bible&lt;/a&gt;, which is good — a hobby might distract him from the molesting children and assassinating people gigs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/ive_always_wondered_what_he_lo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/XbDPSk-upbE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269640370082"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/moi_on_a_podcast.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a57b684ab5175cb2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">Moi?

&lt;p&gt;Darwin’s theory of evolution (and ours), unlike that of Lamarck, is variational, rather than transformational: the process of evolution is a change in frequency of different variants within a population, not a transformation of the individuals.  Darwin thus made the origin, nature, and inheritance of variation key problems for biology; indeed, for much of the 20th century, evolution and genetics were often taught as a single course at universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most distinctive sorts of variation is &lt;em&gt;polymorphism&lt;/em&gt;, in which two or more discontinuous forms are found in a single species (this is distinct from sexual or age related variation). Darwin himself &lt;a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_DifferentFormsofFlowers.html"&gt;pioneered the study of polymorphisms&lt;/a&gt;. Such discontinuous variation often has a simple genetic basis, with allelic variation at one genetic locus accounting for all (or most) of the variability.The color polymorphism in peppered moths (&lt;a href="http://ukmoths.org.uk/show.php?id=33"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biston betularia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is a well known and &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/h7n4r6h026q1u6hk/fulltext.pdf"&gt;well studied case&lt;/a&gt; involving industrial melanism, in which light and dark forms are adapted to polluted and unpolluted environments, respectively. A well known case of polymorphism in vertebrates are the two color phases of Cuban sparrow hawk (&lt;em&gt;Falco sparverius sparverioides&lt;/em&gt;). This case is not well studied, though, and we know nothing about the genetics, nor the adaptive significance (if any) of the polymorphism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;img title="Dimorphism in Cuban sparrow hawks" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dscn4719.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light and rufous phase male Cuban sparrow hawks (Falco sparverius sparverioides).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A polymorphism in vertebrates that many Americans and Canadians are familiar with are the &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5fVymWAez-YC&amp;amp;pg=PA229&amp;amp;lpg=PA229&amp;amp;dq=color+polymorphism+sciurus&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=-A1NJgvmz_&amp;amp;sig=u_pYyubo_6gk-jCg9OuN2nzLVd4&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=pdWsS8MIiro2z6-03Q8&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=9&amp;amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;melanistic and gray&lt;/a&gt; forms of the &lt;a href="http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-480-01-0001.pdf"&gt;gray squirrel (&lt;em&gt;Sciurus carolinensis&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;. The most frequent color form is gray, but &lt;a href="http://blog1.andreamcdowell.com/2009/02/20/black-squirrels/"&gt;blackish&lt;/a&gt; or dark brownish individuals are widely distributed, and in places quite frequent. I have seen them in Illinois (Cook County), Wisconsin (Racine and Kenosha Cos.) and Michigan (Ingham Co.), and also on the campus of Princeton University. (I was told at Princeton that, during football season, black squirrels are captured, and orange stripes applied to them, so that they resemble diminutive arboreal tigers, the tiger being Princeton’s mascot.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;img title="Gray squirrel, Annapolis, Maryland, 23 June 2008." src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/greg808-517-e1269489594319.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=325" alt="" width="500" height="325"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A demonic gray squirrel (locally known as &amp;#39;yard dogs&amp;#39;), Annapolis, MD, 23 June 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A much less common color morph is the leucistic or albinistic form, which is whitish, cream or yellowish. They are famously common in Olney, Illinois (due to an introduction of two albinistic individuals to an area previously lacking any gray squirrels at all), and also occur regularly in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, but I had never seen one before my recent trip to Washington, DC, where I saw one on the tree right across from the steps on the Mall entrance to the USNM.  (The picture was taken through a bus window.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:509px"&gt;&lt;img title="Leucistic or albinistic gray squirrel, Washington, DC, 16 March 2010." src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dscn4637-e1269489334364.jpg?w=499&amp;amp;h=612" alt="" width="499" height="612"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leucistic or albinistic gray squirrel, Washington, DC, 16 March 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vertebrate polymorphisms are often less well understood than those of invertebrates, because their generally greater size and longer generation times make experimental study more difficult. Melanism in squirrels, for example, has been related to &lt;a href="http://rparticle.web-p.cisti.nrc.ca/rparticle/AbstractTemplateServlet?calyLang=eng&amp;amp;journal=cjz&amp;amp;volume=57&amp;amp;year=0&amp;amp;issue=3&amp;amp;msno=z79-068"&gt;thermoregulation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/1381707"&gt;fire frequency&lt;/a&gt;, but no thoroughly compelling explanation has been found. One exception to this is coat color variation in mice of the genus &lt;em&gt;Peromyscus&lt;/em&gt;, where coat color seems to be an adaptation for camouflage in varying environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;img title="Peromyscus polionotus" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dscn4684-e1269488939809.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=383" alt="" width="500" height="383"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light and dark forms of Peromyscus polionotus from sandy and dark soils (P. p. leucocephalus on the left, P. p. polionotus on the right, I think).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1930s, F.B. Sumner conducted classic field and lab studies on light colored mice living on sandy soils and dark mice on dark soils. Unlike the melanistic and albinistic squirrels, which are variant individuals within a populations, there is an element of geographic variation in the mice, which live in distinct, though adjacent, places. Sumner’s studies showed that there were several (not just one) genetic loci involved in coat color, and the color forms intergrade where their habitats meet and they interbreed. &lt;a href="http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/hoekstra/"&gt;Hopi Hoekstra&lt;/a&gt; of the Museum of Comparative Zoology is currently conducting exciting studies of some of the same species studied by Sumner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the mice occur in distinct modal forms (white vs. brown), the intergradation where they meet shows an underlying continuous variation. The frogs below show that although we can pick out distinctly different individuals, the range of pattern from plain to mottled to striped makes it difficult to recognize a small number of discrete color morphs, and the variation approaches a continuous dictribution. Such continuous variations were thought by Darwin, and most biologists today as well, to be important raw material for the evolutionary process.&lt;/p&gt;

Taken by Mattes, and downloaded from the Wikimedia Commons 26/03/2010.You might think that shoes can only change your life if you are a sex-and-the-city type shoe lover, spending huge amounts of money on designer footwear. And for most of us, that kind of dedication to shoes is fairly incomprehensible - after all, they&amp;#39;re just things to wear to keep your feet safe from broken glass and tarmac, right? Wrong....In fact, footwear doesn&amp;#39;t just change your life in the way that owning that perfect pair of Jimmy Choos can affect a girl. Instead, it can influence the way you walk, the shape of your foot, and even the number and type of pathologies present in your foot bones. A recent study by Zipfel and Berger (2007), for example, has found that some 70% of European males and 66% - that&amp;#39;s two in every three! - females has some pathological condition in their big toe, compared to only about 35% of individuals from an archaeological population which habitually walked barefoot.The study found similar results for all other bones (Zipfer and Berger 2007), suggesting that the habitually unshod foot is healthier than the habitually shod foot in almost all ways. In addition, to ensure that the difference was not due to population differences, they included two other modern (shoe-wearing) populations, Zulu and Sotho, and found similar patterns for all three. The only major anomaly, in fact, was that while all populations (including the unshod one) showed higher proportions of damage to the end of the bones closer to the toes, the Zulu males showed a high proportion of damage to the bone shaft (Zipfer and Berger 2007). The authors concluded that this was because the Zulu population came from a mining town, where males were likely to injure themselves at work.Perhaps most telling, though, was the fact that high levels of bone deformation or pathological changes that obscured measurement could cause an individual to be excluded from the sample. This is normal in osteological studies: you have to be certain that the measurement you are taking is the same for each individual you study. Interestingly, Zipfer and Berger throw in the fact that while a number of individuals from the three habitually shod populations fell into this category - that is, their foot bones were so damaged they could not be measured - this was true for none of the archaeological, unshod population.So next time you buy a pair of shoes, take a moment to think if they are really comfortable and properly fitted - it may save you considerable pain later.ReferencesZIPFEL, B., &amp;amp; BERGER, L.

The original is idea was interesting: we understand actions by mirroring those actions in our own motor system.  But this is no longer the case according to R&amp;amp;S:By matching individual movements, mirror processing provides a representation of body part movement that might serve various functions (for example, imitation), but is devoid of any specific cognitive importance per se. p. 269Instead, understanding comes from matching higher-order representations of the goals of the action (the quote above continues immediately):By contrast, through matching the goal of the observed motor act with a motor act that has the same goal, the observer is able to understand what the agent is doing. p. 269This goal-matching, according to R&amp;amp;S is quite independent of any specific motor act. ...among the neurons in various areas that become active during action observation, only those that can encode the goal of the motor behaviour of another individual with the greatest degree of generality can be considered to be crucial for action understanding... Indeed, parieto-frontal mirror neurons encode the goal of observed motor acts regardless of whether they are performed with the mouth, the hand or even with tools. p. 269 So, mirror neurons, those cells that fire during specific actions such as grasping-with-the-hand and while watching the same specific action -- the very cells that got everyone SO excited -- are not involved in action understanding.  Rather, according to R&amp;amp;S, action understanding is achieved by cells that do not code for actions at all, but something higher level, goals/intentions. It&amp;#39;s worth noting that R&amp;amp;S directly contradict themselves in the sidebar definition of &amp;quot;Mirror-based action understanding&amp;quot;:The comprehension of an observed action based on the activation of a motor programme in the observer’s brain. p. 265A motor program presumably controls a specific action, such as grasping-with-the-hand, not an action-independent goal or intention.  Is the mirror system needed for coding all goals and intentions?  No, according to R&amp;amp;S:This does not mean that the parieto-frontal mirror mechanism mediates all varieties of intention understanding. p. 271But they want to say that the system IS needed for coding motor goals/intentions.  They illustrate with an example:Mary is interacting with an object (for example, a cup). According to how she is grasping the cup, we can understand why she is doing it (for example, to drink from it or to move it). This kind of understanding can be mediated by the parieto-frontal mirror mechanism by virtue of its motor chain organization. p. 271It is true that we can make limited inferences about what Mary&amp;#39;s intentions are by the way she grasps the cup. But (i) these inferences are underdetermined by the movement and (ii) motor experience with grasping cups is not necessary for making these inferences. Regarding (i), if Mary grasps the handle, rather than pushing the side with her fingertips, we may infer that she intends to drink rather than move. However, Mary could just as well be moving the cup, picking it up to put it in the sink, or picking it up to give to someone. Regarding (ii), simply having perceptual experience with grasping for drinking versus pushing for moving actions will result in the same inferential ability even without motor experience with cups.Acknowledging the point that action understanding does not require the motor system, R&amp;amp;S site several studies that show that understanding can be achieved without the mirror system.  They conclude, These data indicate that the recognition of the motor behaviour of others can rely on the mere processing of its visual aspects. p. 270So, to summarize:1. Cells that mirror specific actions (i.e., congruent mirror neurons), don&amp;#39;t support action understanding.2. The real work of action understanding is done by cells that abstract away from actions and instead code goals and intentions.3. Intentions can be coded outside the mirror/motor system.4. The recognition of actions of others can be achieved outside the mirror/motor system.So what does the mirror system contribute? ...[it] allows an individual to understand the action of others ‘from the inside’ p. 264What does &amp;quot;from the inside&amp;quot; mean to R&amp;amp;S?...the observed action is understood from the inside as a motor possibility and not just from the outside as a mere visual experience. p. 270In other words, it is the &amp;quot;understanding&amp;quot; that I-can-do-that-too and nothing more.

The bulk of biomass on the planet is made up of microbes. By some estimates, there may be 150 million species of bacteria, but scientists have only formally named a few thousand of them. One of the big causes of this ignorance is that scientists don’t know how to raise microbe colonies. If you scoop up some dirt and stick it under a microscope, you’ll see lots of different microbes living happily there. If you mash up all the DNA in that mud and read its sequence, you’ll discover an astonishing diversity of genes belonging to those microbes–thousands in a single spoon of soil. But now try to rear those microbes in a lab. When scientists try, they generally fail. A tiny fraction of one percent of microbe species will grow under ordinary conditions in Petri dish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This staggering difficulty is the reason why &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; and a few other species became the laboratory darlings of biologists during the 1900s. As I write in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMicrocosm-coli-New-Science-Life%2Fdp%2F037542430X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1190687076%26sr%3D8-1&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microcosm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; will happily explode in a flask full of broth. As a result, a lot of what we know about life we know from E. coli. Certainly a lot of those lessons hold true for any species–genes encoded in DNA, DNA used to produce RNA and proteins, a genetic code, and so on. But there are a lot of microbes that are very unlike &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. Even in our gut, for example, &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; is just a minor player in an ecosystem made up of hundreds or thousands of species. Yet we know relatively little about its neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason for the trouble we have in raising microbes is that the environment we like is not the environment a lot of them like. If you are feeding on minerals in boiling water at the bottom of the ocean, it’s possible that you might find life in a luke-warm flask in an oxygen-rich atmosphere at sea-level air pressure unbearable–perhaps even toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the physical surroundings of microbes can’t account for all the trouble they pose for would-be microbial zoo-keepers. If you scoop up some wet sand from a pleasant beach, you will still be hard-pressed to get more than a few species to grow in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To coax bacteria to grow, microbiologists have been upgrading their Petri dishes. They have been building cages that mimic the natural habitat of the bacteria, and in some cases taking their chambers out of the lab and putting them in the environments where the bacteria live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These semi-wild chambers have brought scientists more success, and they’ve also helped scientists figure out why the microbes are so hard to grow in the first place. Along with the right physical conditions, microbes need to live alongside the right microbes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new issue of &lt;em&gt;Chemistry and Biology&lt;/em&gt;, a team of scientists–led by Anthony D’Onofrio, a post-doc in the laboratory of Kim Lewis at Northeastern University, and Jason Crawford in the lab of Jon Clardy at Harvard–report &lt;a href="http://www.cell.com/chemistry-biology/abstract/S1074-5521%2810%2900079-7"&gt;a striking success&lt;/a&gt; in cultivating bacteria that were previously impossible to cultivate. They made their discovery while studying some bacteria that live on a beach near Boston. Some of the bacteria, while unable to grow on their own in a Petri dish, grew if they were near certain other species. Perhaps, the scientists speculated, the hard-to-grow bacteria depended on something the other species made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists tested different molecules made by bacteria to see if any of them were fostering the growth. They eventually figured out that the responsible molecule was something known as a siderophore. Some species of bacteria make siderophores as a way to get their minimal daily required does of iron. Iron is essential for the growth of cells, but in many environments free iron is in short supply. So bacteria make iron-trapping molecules–siderophores–and release them through special channels. The siderophores drift around, and sometimes manage to snag iron atoms. They fold up around the iron, assuming a shape that allows them to slip through other channels back into the bacteria. Once inside, they open up again and set their iron free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that a lot of species on the beaches around Boston–and presumably in a lot of other places in the world–don’t make their own siderophores. Instead, they rely on other species to produce siderophores, and once those molecules swallow up the iron, the bacteria that don’t make siderophores snatch them up. The scientists found that with different kinds of siderophores made by different species of bacteria, they could suddenly get a lot of microbes to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discoveries like these are exciting both in a practical and intellectual way. We’ve already harvested lots of valuable molecules from microbes, such as antibiotics and gene-copying enzymes. If scientists can raise lots of new species of microbes, they may be able to find new molecules. But the result is fascinating in itself. Apparently, a lot of microbial species depend on the kindness of strangers. And apparently, there are bacteria out there that are churning out siderophores despite the fact that other species are slurping up the iron they forage. If that was all there was to the story, this would not be a situation that could last long. The cheaters would thrive by skipping the effort of making siderophores, and eventually there wouldn’t be enough honest bacteria left to keep all the microbes supplied with their iron. It’s likely, instead, that the cheaters are not cheaters at all, but rather have services of their own to offer the microbial community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the reason that we know so little about life on Earth may be that we have yet to figure out the complicated social life of microbes.&lt;/p&gt;

I was baptized Catholic, my parents converted to Born-Again Christian when I was in 6th grade, and for quite a while after that I tried very hard to believe what they taught me and be a good little Christian girl.  I’m now 26, and for the last few years, though I absolutely do not believe anything born-again, it’s been a “don’t ask, don’t tell” kind of situation with my parents.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until this past September.  I outed myself when my father asked about my boyfriend’s beliefs because “there may be grandchildren” and he’s “concerned for their eternal destiny.”  During this 2 hour hellish discussion everything came out including that for years I tried to believe and sincerely wanted to believe but I felt like I was praying to the ceiling and it just didn’t make sense to me logically.  He quoted just about every main idea from “One Heartbeat Away” by Mark Cahill in which the author attempts to prove the bible is true.  My mother was very upset but said “We’ve trained you up in the way that you should go, and I believe you will come back to it one day.”  My dad wasn’t so understanding.  He kept going and going and quoting and quoting.  He finally just gave me the book and made me promise to read it.  (Which was basically 3 Chapters of illogical “proofs” the Bible is absolute truth and 7 Chapters that assume you believe it and tell you how to live your life as a newly saved Christian) I told him if I feel like he’s going to bring the subject up every time I come over, I’ll stop coming over.  He agreed to drop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, he hasn’t directly brought the subject up.  However, he’ll bring up Christian subjects to me as if I still do believe what he does.  He’ll discuss the situation in Israel and how that may play into the prophesies from Revelation or other prophesies from the old testament.  I’m not sure if he wants my non-Christian view of it, or he wants me to go along and agree with it, or is using it as an excuse to bring up the “great debate” again.  I’m not sure what to say to him when he brings this stuff up.  Mostly I smile and nod or say, “Interesting.”  What happens when I do have kids and he wants to preach to them and “save” them and bring them to church?  He’s a very hard-headed, stern, “I’m-right-you’re-wrong-you’re-going-to-hell” kind of Christian.  It’s incredibly stressful to anticipate these conversations or be a part of them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I handle him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signed,&lt;br&gt;
Frustrated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Frustrated,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handle him in the only way he understands. Forcefully. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell him that he made an agreement and  that you expect him to keep it, or you’re going to keep your part of that agreement. Remember this part of your conversation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I told him if I feel like he’s going to bring the subject up every time I come over, I’ll stop coming over.  He agreed to drop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s been breaking his agreement in sneaky ways, and you’re letting him get away with it.  Call him on it, and be prepared to follow through with your part of the agreement by temporarily stopping the visits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your dad is a strong, forceful, even domineering kind of guy. People like that are not always bad. They can be very useful in the right situations, such as a sergeant commanding his men in a firefight.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they generally only relate well to other strong, forceful, domineering people.  They don’t respond well to polite, reasoned argument or  gentle persuasion.  They don’t really know how to do that. They don’t persuade, they dominate and overwhelm by interrupting, being loud, being critical, or by repeating what they think is their strongest point over and over, even though it may not have anything to do with what the other person is asserting. If dominators do try to use argument, they often rely heavily on sources that they think are authorities, such as scripture or the books of others. They tend to not use much original thought of their own.  This is not necessarily because they are not bright enough. It’s because books have an aura of authority, and the authors are usually conveniently unavailable for direct challenge.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you tried to have a reasoned conversation with him, he just kept quoting and quoting from his authority source, trying to maintain control of the debate through barrage. You were sincere and candid, and for your pains you were bullied.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when you gave him an either/or demand, essentially “drop the topic or see me no more,” &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; was something he could understand. You were speaking his language. You apparently have something he wants, your company, and he doesn’t want that withdrawn. So he agreed to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But force-oriented people usually keep testing the enforcement of the agreements they make.  They won’t keep agreements on principle alone, but more on the strength of force behind it.  So if you let him get away with little incursions and little violations, he’ll keep going and escalating. I don’t think he really gives a damn (if you’ll excuse the expression) about your non-Christian viewpoint about an issue. Shining him on with a smile, a nod and “Interesting” is just asking for more, and is the source of your calling yourself “Frustrated.” You need to give your agreement a booster shot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;”Dad, you agreed that you would not bring up all this religious stuff when I come over, or I would just not come over.  I keep&lt;/em&gt; my &lt;em&gt;agreements. Please drop it now, or I’m out of here, as I promised.  I’d really like to enjoy my time with you.  Let’s talk about…”&lt;/em&gt; (have two or three subjects previously selected.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in case, be ready for him to call your bluff. That’s the thing about either/or demands with dominators. Never, ever bluff. If you don’t follow through, you can kiss any semblance of respect or even civil treatment goodbye. If he forces your hand, tell him you’ll be staying away for (x amount of time) to give him time to think about it, and then you’ll call him and you’ll ask him if he’s willing to keep his agreement. Your either/or demand never said anything about not trying again, and your making the gesture toward reconciliation is not a concession.  Just restate your demands and stick to them.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If and when the time comes for grandchildren and his “concern for their eternal destiny,” remember that grandparents &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to see the little ones. Use your same bargaining power, which will be considerably stronger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Dad, keep the religious stuff to yourself when I bring the kids over, or I just won’t bring them over. They’re my kids, not yours. Your kid is grown up and is making her own decisions.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might consider adding, &lt;em&gt;“If you really believe that God is almighty, then your grandchildren’s ‘eternal destiny’ is in his hands,&lt;/em&gt; not yours.  &lt;em&gt;So don’t go pretending that he needs you to do the work for him. Be their grandad, not their savior.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustrated, I said in my &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/23/ask-richard-atheist-grandfather-kept-at-arm%E2%80%99s-length/"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; that we should not sacrifice love over these trifles of belief or disbelief in The Great Invisible. But love cannot abide without respect.  I suspect that your dad respects you when you are strong and firm with him, and you stand your ground. You don’t have to make that show of strength by playing his game, and ending up in another futile and obnoxious squabble.  There’s no winning such a quarrel, there’s just you losing time, patience, and a chance to have a pleasant and loving time with your dad, chatting about some topic the two of you share in common.  Being firm with him every time is much easier than repeatedly giving in until you have to seriously fight to retake your territory.  So make your boundaries clear and solid, and offer alternative things to enjoy together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;J’accuse!&lt;/em&gt; Obviously, they walk among us! Or, more accurately, they are rooted among us. If prickly pear cacti have roots. I think they do. Yeah, let’s assume they do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe they’re not a major threat, but have you ever seen one up close? I’m positive I don’t want one probing me, I assure you. There’s a reason they’re prickly…&lt;/p&gt;

Dark matter.  I talk about it a lot here for a number of reasons.  These include:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the fact that it makes up about 85% of the mass of the Universe,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only way (so far) that it appears to interact with anything is gravitationally, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;from our observations, we've learned that it's made up of slow-moving, massive particles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
You put what we know about dark matter into a simulation, and it tells you what type of structure you expect to get out.  For example, if you run a simulation on the scale of about a billion light years, you would expect galaxies to be distributed like so.  (Image credit: &lt;a href="http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2008/arch08/080314holesinspace.htm"&gt;Martin White&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/dark_matter_we_dont_understand/070904redshiftspace.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/dark_matter_we_dont_understand/070904redshiftspace-thumb-500x314-43619.jpg" width="500" height="314" alt="070904redshiftspace.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you compare your simulation with what we actually observe, you get an idea of whether your theory makes sense or not.  Here's a map of the observed galaxy distribution from the two-degree-field galaxy redshift survey.  (Image credit: &lt;a href="http://rsaa.anu.edu.au/2dFGRS/"&gt;2dFGRS team&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/dark_matter_we_dont_understand/2dfnorth.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/dark_matter_we_dont_understand/2dfnorth.gif" width="500" alt="2dfnorth.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement is spectacular!  Well, what if we go down to a smaller scale, like say, down to the size of an individual galaxy?  You have a pretty good idea of what a typical galaxy looks like; after all, we're &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; one!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/dark_matter_we_dont_understand/eso9845d.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/dark_matter_we_dont_understand/eso9845d-thumb-500x503-43621.jpg" width="500" height="503" alt="eso9845d.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What our simulations tell us is that -- pretty universally -- all galaxies should be surrounded by a huge, spherical halo of dark matter.  How huge?  It should extend out around &lt;i&gt;a million light-years&lt;/i&gt; for a galaxy like ours.  That is &lt;b&gt;tremendous&lt;/b&gt;, considering that our galaxy is "only" about 50,000 light-years in radius. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/dark_matter_we_dont_understand/darkhalo_lg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/dark_matter_we_dont_understand/darkhalo_lg-thumb-500x500-43623.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="darkhalo_lg.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more than that is that our simulations tell us what the &lt;i&gt;density&lt;/i&gt; of this dark matter halo should be like.  Towards the edges, it should be very diffuse, but the density increases very quickly as you come in towards the disk of the galaxy, and then increases more slowly until you reach the center.  And that's what our simulations tell us.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not so fast, though.  Does this make sense?  A &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0553"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; out this week says perhaps not.  You see, at the center of each galaxy (including our own!) lives a supermassive black hole, millions to billions of times as massive as our Sun.  And, like all black holes, when matter falls into it (whether it's normal matter &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; dark matter), it cannot escape, and causes the black hole to grow larger and more massive.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/dark_matter_we_dont_understand/Black-hole-dark-matter-580x450.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/dark_matter_we_dont_understand/Black-hole-dark-matter-580x450-thumb-500x387-43625.jpg" width="500" height="387" alt="Black-hole-dark-matter-580x450.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the dark matter density at the center of each galaxy -- near the supermassive black holes -- were as high as simulations say, there would be a problem.  The black holes for the &lt;i&gt;most&lt;/i&gt; massive galaxies, like our buddy M87 (below), would experience &lt;b&gt;runaway growth&lt;/b&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/dark_matter_we_dont_understand/m87_cfht.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/dark_matter_we_dont_understand/m87_cfht-thumb-500x375-43627.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="m87_cfht.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this doesn't happen!  So something is amiss.  What gives?  Do black holes simply &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2010/03/22/astronomers-find-black-holes-do-not-absorb-dark-matter/"&gt;not absorb dark matter&lt;/a&gt;?  Improbable!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What it probably means is that something more complicated than our simulations are telling us is happening in the inner parts of these dark matter halos.  We've had many clues (such as the rotation curves of spiral galaxies) that dark matter simulations get us &lt;i&gt;close&lt;/i&gt;, but don't get it quite right.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/dark_matter_we_dont_understand/rotfit2.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/dark_matter_we_dont_understand/rotfit2-thumb-500x470-43629.gif" width="500" height="470" alt="rotfit2.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new paper appears to point toward the same idea: our simulations of dark matter get us close to the right answer most of the time, but there needs to be more to the story.  It makes sense that what you'd ask next is what's &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; going on.  For example, how do these dark matter halos actually achieve a lower density in the center than we predict?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're wondering that, I congratulate you!  You are now where I am: on the cutting edge of cosmology, trying to answer one of the open questions we have today.  My best guess is that there's a process we haven't yet discovered where dark matter &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; interact by some means other than through its gravity; that could explain both of these discrepancies, and is a property predicted by many dark matter models.  (The scientific term would be that the dark matter halo becomes &lt;a href="http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March05/Kormendy2/Kormendy3.html"&gt;isothermal&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazing, isn't it?  That looking at the most massive black holes in the Universe gives us clues to the nature of &lt;b&gt;dark matter&lt;/b&gt;, but here we are!  Any ideas on your end?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/dark_matter_we_dont_understand.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269627323298"><id gr:original-id="http://sciencetrio.wordpress.com/2010/03/26/begging-meerkat-pups-2/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a76ffbb4436eb71c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Begging meerkat pups</title><published>2010-03-26T13:25:57Z</published><updated>2010-03-26T13:25:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/ogtnb1O43Oc/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://sciencetrio.wordpress.com/2010/03/26/begging-meerkat-pups-2/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Learning about animal behavior never fails to fascinate me, and so it was with great interest that I read a recent paper on how meerkat pups alter their food-begging behavior depending upon the adult meerkat that they are nearest to. {1}  Not all adults are created equal, it seems, in the world of a [...]...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am literally floored, gobsmacked, speechless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m gay and have been a skeptic for about 10 years, since my late teens. Throughout this time James Randi has always been a personal hero for me. This is a very proud day. Mr. Randi’s courage and ceaseless, uncompromising intellectual honesty are a great inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m practically on the verge of tears right now. And no, not just because ‘he’s one of us’ or some such, but because things are REALLY actually changing in this country and gay people can finally be themselves for once. We don’t have to hide anymore. This means so much to me. I’m so happy for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*blubbers all over*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What? No comments about weaponized peppers? Bhut jolokia is cool stuff. My hometown even has a company called CaJohns that makes all sorts of sauces outta the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I can see how boobies could indeed distract one from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. I had a “peanut butter cup” moment.&lt;br&gt;
“Weaponized Boobies” That is all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/03/skepchick-quickies-3-25/comment-page-1/#comment-98152"&gt;jtradke said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;@mikerattlesnake: “Men, they drive like this: ‘dur dur dur, boobies’! But women, women drivers, they’re like ‘blah blah blah, feelings!’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which made me snort tea out my nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Friday!&lt;/p&gt;

Ed Yong of Not Exactly Rocket Science and Razib Khan of Gene Expression begin settling in today and I cannot imagine two better additions to the family!

In case you're not already familiar with these phenomenal blogs, Ed's an award-winning science writer who breaks down research papers into easy to understand posts like no one else. He only uses the primary literature and Not Exactly Rocket Science was just named Research Blog of the Year, Best Lay-Level Blog, and home of the Best Post of the Year in the Research Blogging Awards. In other words, Ed's writing is a must-read for anyone interested in science online.

Razib's also a superstar blogger and covers genetics better than anyone! He not only reports on the latest research, but he synthesizes and analyzes the data from primary sources in novel ways--ways that often impress those scientists originally engaged in the studies. Razib offers new insights on topics from human migration to standards of beauty and I always learn something new when I visit his site. He also makes me laugh.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px" title="OutCampaign Button" src="http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0034/2402/products/a-button_large.jpg?1269569138" alt="" width="231" height="231"&gt;Should we organize around the word “atheist”?  Yesterday I wrote about &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/25/cfi-blog-tilts-at-windmills/"&gt;my disagreement&lt;/a&gt; with Michael De Dora Jr.’s “&lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/the_problems_with_the_atheistic_approach_to_the_world/"&gt;The Problems with the Atheistic Approach to the World&lt;/a&gt;” – only to have him publish a response to criticism a couple hours before my post was scheduled to go up.  In &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/a_response_to_criticism_of_the_problems_with_the_atheistic_approach_to_the_/"&gt;his new post&lt;/a&gt;, he addresses one complaint that his statement “many atheists define their entire lives around unbelief and critique of theism” is untrue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my piece, I wanted to specifically discuss those who embrace atheism as the core of their lives, but I also admitted that not all atheists center their lives around their atheism (that would be another contradiction of what I said about the emptiness of the word atheist). Apologies if this was misread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, perhaps more to the point: how do I know many atheists do such a thing? To support my claim, I referenced The American Atheists. I also referenced the local New York City Atheists (which, for anyone knowledgeable, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a militant atheist organization) as an example of the “(Location) Atheists” groups we see around the nation. Then, of course, there is the Out Campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even though the American Atheists are more aggressive than other groups, they’re are far from “defin[ing] their entire lives around unbelief and critique of theism.”  A glance at their website shows a host of positive &lt;a href="http://atheists.org/Aims_and_Principles"&gt;Aims and Principles&lt;/a&gt; which include promotion of freedom of thought and inquiry, separation of church and state, nontheistic ethical systems, and general welfare.  I can’t imagine that Michael really believes they “embrace atheism as the core of their lives,” so I started thinking about what he must mean instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get the sense that Michael is really objecting to atheism being used as an organizing principle at all (hence his apparent opposition to the Out Campaign, which I support).  Some of his comments point in that direction, such as his critique of the New Atheists for “rallying around atheism” and “push[ing] people to start huddling under the ‘atheist’ banner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should we rally behind the “atheist” banner? &lt;/strong&gt; The discussion of tactics is worth having.  As it happens, I don’t see the word to be quite as empty and non-descriptive as he argues in his original piece.  The atheist label has real value and should be one of the tools of the secular movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s true that the word ‘atheist’ only says that a person has no god belief, it’s amazing how many other views follow or are at least correlated.  People who don’t believe in a god tend to share values because they focus solely on secular concerns.  There’s no particularly good secular reason to deny homosexuals the right to marry, so most atheists support that right.  We don’t believe in a god who cares about our politics, so most atheists support a secular government.   Lacking belief in divine revelation, atheists tend to promote science as the best way to learn about the world.  I can walk into a meeting of the Omnipresent Atheists in Columbus and expect to find a lot of people with values similar to my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose a name like “American Atheists” doesn’t &lt;strong&gt;explicitly &lt;/strong&gt;convey all that they stand for, but I think it’s implied to mean “American Atheists for a Variety of Values Which Tend to Particularly Stem from Focusing on Secular Concerns.”  Labels aren’t expected to be perfectly descriptive, they’re expected to be useful at implying shared values, explicitly or implicitly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, more specific labels like “skeptic” and “humanist” definitely have their purpose.  But so does a unifying, inclusive banner.&lt;/p&gt;

Citizens will be required to have acceptable coverage or pay a penalty of $95 in 2014, $325 in 2015, $695 (or up to 2.5 percent of income) in 2016. Families will pay half the amount for children, up to a cap of $2,250 per family. After 2016, penalties are indexed to Consumer Price Index.
Um, okay, so I will definitely have to buy health care by 2015 or so. That I get. After that, dodging it starts to hurt.

Meanwhile, my current MIT health care ends in May with the end of the Knight Fellowship. At that point, it seems likely that I'll return to being a freelance writer, so for about 3.5 years, I'm not sure what I'll be doing for health care.

My previous strategy was to buy something relatively cheap with a high deductible--catastrophic coverage, essentially. But I can't say the approach was particularly satisfying. I spent some $ 1300 per year (premiums increased each year) and barely went to the doctor, because I essentially had to pay 100 % for anything routine, like a check up or a bad cold that wouldn't go away.

&lt;p&gt;And he reveals that quantum physics has been &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; for theology, because a stupid old Newtonian universe would testify only to a deistic, wind-up-the-universe-and-let-it-go kind of God.  Quantum physics, however, provides a theistic God, one who changes the world by tweaking electrons. You have heard this before, of course, from Kenneth Miller, Francis Collins, and many other souls desperate to find evidence for a personal, interactive God in a world that appears to behave materially, predictably, and deterministically on the human plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polkinghorne:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the world were simply mechanical, as people thought in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, it would just be a gigantic piece of cosmic clockwork, and its creator would be an unseen cosmic clockmaker. That’s the creator who just makes the clock and lets it tick away. Quantum theory is something more subtle than that. We can believe a world in which we ourselves interact — we’re not clockwork at all — and we can believe in a world in which God interacts. We can believe in a God who doesn’t just sit and wait for it to happen but is involved in the unfolding of creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t this the worst sort of conflating science with superstition?  Quantum physics as &lt;em&gt;evidence for a theistic God&lt;/em&gt;!  Even Ayala, I think, would diagnose Polkinghorne as mixing his magisteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don’t these people ever, ever consider that they’re grasping at straws here—making a virtue of necessity by demoting their God to someone who changes the world by messing with subatomic particles? Isn’t it incumbent on them to explain why God would act this way instead of on a more macroscopic level? Is he trying to hide himself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hardly necessary to add that Polkinghorne won the Templeton Prize in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href="http://365daysofastronomy.org/"&gt;365 Days of Astronomy podcast&lt;/a&gt; – the official podcast of the &lt;a href="http://www.astronomy2009.org/"&gt;International Year of Astronomy 2009&lt;/a&gt; – is continuing into 2010. The format remains the same with each episode contributed by different people from around the world. Although many people have signed up for days in 2010, there are still plenty available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;…At the end of each weekly episode I read out a standard blurb describing the podcast and how to get involved. To shake things up a bit for 2010 I thought it would be nice to have a series of different voices read the outro. I have around 10 voices so far but still need another 42 before the end of the year. The voices I have are heavily biased towards the UK and US so I’m particularly keen to get voices representing other countries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy contributing to the &lt;a href="http://www.365daysofastronomy.org"&gt;365 Days of Astronomy&lt;/a&gt; podcast, so if you’d like to give it a go – try! Especially if you have a different accent to the US/UK collection of voices they already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to our new &lt;a href="http://www.skepticzone.tv"&gt;Skeptic Zone episode out&lt;/a&gt; (number 75! I can’t believe it!!) – it’s the anniversary of the &lt;a href="http://skepticallyspeaking.com/"&gt;Skeptically Speaking &lt;/a&gt;show this weekend, so check out their show if you haven’t already!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also promoting these shows because podcasting can be occasionally… a little unrewarding, if you think about it in terms of the effort to reward ratio. People who are your listeners don’t pay for what you do. They may donate, but that’s seems to be less popular and I know some podcasts have found sponsorship and advertising very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a few things I’ve learned over the years that helps puts things into perspective and leads me to support other people’s podcasts the way I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:359px"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/6922_175025465040_565365040_4106108_4370435_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/6922_175025465040_565365040_4106108_4370435_n.jpg" alt="" width="359" height="204"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Cheryl Herbert, Dr Rachie and zzzzzzzzzz.... at dinner, D*C 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t even know how many people donate to the &lt;a href="http://www.skepticzone.tv"&gt;Skeptic Zone show&lt;/a&gt;, but I guess it’s not many. I’d ask, but as long as there’s some who are kind enough to do so, I guess I’m pleased – running a site isn’t done for free, nor is hosting on Libsyn and the time and technology you need is another thing entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Saunders, apart from being well-known as the ‘nicest guy in skepticism’, is also one of the most hard-working. See the picture of him asleep at a skeptical gathering at D*C for evidence!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not, however, owing your audience anything in return though, because you’re doing this podcast for free. Sounds harsh in a way – but I personally create a podcast for more than one reason. News-flash – &lt;em&gt;it isn’t always all about you! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting out this audio and videos for free, even though podcasters do pay for it through things like hosting and the equipment… it’s still kind of liberating. It does cost us though, to do what we do. You might have a glimpse of that in the most recent episodes for both the Skeptic Zone and the Token Skeptic, where we have audio from Melbourne and Canberra – which is not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the same neighborhood as our homes in Sydney and Perth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard, Dr Rachael and I are three members who have traveled world-wide. We do &lt;a href="http://www.dragoncon.org"&gt;Dragon*Con, Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org"&gt;The Amazing Meeting&lt;/a&gt;. I only do the former, but if you think about round-the-world travel, hotels, the time taken off work… yes, this isn’t a profit-making ‘hobby’. We’ve traveled to Melbourne for both our own unique show for the &lt;a href="http://youngausskeptics.com.au"&gt;Young Australian Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;; Dave the Happy Singer and I have done the &lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org.au"&gt;Global Atheist Convention&lt;/a&gt; and various members of SZ have done the Australian Skeptics Conventions for the past few years – Melbourne, Tasmania, Adelaide and Brisbane. Eran Segev is probably returning to do TAM 8, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three of us have gone across the USA a few times; I’ve been to London and Auckland briefly and hope to revisit again some time in the future. Certainly if we can afford to have other members of our show come along with us as well, it’d be additionally brilliant – we want you to meet &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of us, not just us three! Here’s to uniting the team at TAM Australia!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t get paid for any of that, as podcasters. We &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to do it. So, we’re to blame for enjoying jet-lag just a bit too much perhaps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0T9JsV_IRM"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0T9JsV_IRM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, due to my studies, a great way for me to learn new skills as a presenter and I have had wonderful opportunities to meet well-known figures in person as well as contact them for interviews online later. I have met inspirational educators and found myself challenged time and time again by the exposure to international lectures. That is probably my main incentive, that I get to travel, meet great people, educate myself, improve my skills… then learn how to put it online and / or write it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps some people might like my interviews? That’s more of a bonus, really. Being a listener of a podcast is no way akin to being a customer. If I want to suddenly turn my whole show into my practice sessions of my Japanese grammar, I can do so if I wish. Or do video-casts of shodô, perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’ll go elsewhere? Or maybe you’ll practice your kanji along with me! Your choice, subscribe or not. That’s how it is. This is just one aspect of what we skeptic podcasters, much like any hobby. It doesn’t reflect all of what we are nor does every attitude or opinion expressed encapsulate all of our views as skeptically-thinking people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of other podcasts out there – hell, we listen to them ourselves and count many of them as friends and fellow travelers on the journey of finding out why and how we believe in things as we do. You’ll notice that in the video, for example, let alone episodes of the Skeptic Zone show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that in the way some podcasts just do as they like or have a particular audience in mind and cater to them. I like that one podcast said that they originally wrote two listeners – ‘one friend and their dad’! Everyone else was just a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might want to appeal to a broader audience – and all of us enjoy constructive criticism. I’ve seen great podcasts like the Geologic and Skepticality get completely unfair (and downright puzzling in its vitriol!) attacks in the past, &lt;a href="http://geologicpodcast.com/index.php?post_id=583825&amp;amp;comments=on"&gt;so I know from their example not to take it too personally when someone complains:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333300"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: “‘I’m not even ten minutes into this episode and wow… how about that incredibly disrespectful language in regards to… I don’t think it was necessarily appropriate to spend so much time…I understand that this podcast often jokes about off-colour topics, and I’m really not trying to complain about free entertainment. However, I do think that…”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A: “Good thing you’re not really trying to complain about free entertainment. Phew!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short – meh. Life is too short and fighting with GarageBand should and does take more of my time. Oh, and redoing all those podcast eps that have lousy sound quality. If you choose to listen to me, I’m very grateful and will try to improve as a matter of personal pride in my work. But I’m not getting that wrought up as to whether I appeal to the ‘teenage market’, as Tim Minchin writes. The message is more than just the medium I’m choosing to use in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do very much feel for situations faced by authors like JC Hutchins. I have Tweeted a link in the past and commented on the blog-post for &lt;a rel="bookmark" href="http://jchutchins.net/site/2010/02/24/an-update-on-the-7th-son-sequels-2010-and-my-creative-plans/"&gt;‘&lt;strong&gt;An update on the 7th Son sequels, 2010, and my creative plans&lt;/strong&gt;‘&lt;/a&gt; – if you haven’t read it, you might like to get an idea of what it’s like for those who use podcasting as an important element of their career. Buy his books already!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing from people in terms of how they enjoy the shows, what views and constructive criticism they have… and, that’s constructive, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; destructive criticism – kind of like the difference between &lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org.au/ac-grayling/"&gt;asking a polite question of AC Grayling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;or &lt;/em&gt;hogging the microphone at the Atheist convention to rant and rail for several minutes… because you weirdly think that it should be &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; up on the stage rather than Professor Grayling behind the lectern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s actually a lot easier to get your own podcast than to be &lt;a href="http://acgrayling.com/"&gt;AC Grayling&lt;/a&gt;, by the way. Feel free to do so if you want to have a bit of a rant, it’s well within many people’s capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like recommendations of what I should next add to my iPod. I’ve now become a listener of &lt;a href="http://www.wearecitizenradio.com/"&gt;Citizen Radio&lt;/a&gt; and I hope to continue being challenged by podcasts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and helping them out where I can. Again – consider donating some audio help to the &lt;a href="http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/astro/000926.shtml"&gt;365 Days of Astronomy podcast&lt;/a&gt; outros, and happy anniversary to Desiree Schell and the &lt;a href="http://skepticallyspeaking.com/"&gt;Skeptically Speaking&lt;/a&gt; crew! Here’s to wearing that exo-skeleton well when dealing with challenges that you never expected you’d be facing!&lt;/p&gt;

Racial epithets, death threats to Democrats, warnings of Armageddon, even juvenile &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/24/gop-senators-refusing-to_n_511639.html"&gt;refusals to work past 2 p.m.&lt;/a&gt;—all this should all be an embarrassment to thinking Republicans (or perhaps that’s an oxymoron).  How can Armageddon come from allowing people with pre-existing medical conditions to get insurance coverage?  In all my life I’ve never seen either political party behave in such an immature and irresponsible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krugman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For today’s G.O.P. is, fully and finally, the party of Ronald Reagan — not Reagan the pragmatic politician, who could and did strike deals with Democrats, but Reagan the antigovernment fanatic, who warned that Medicare would destroy American freedom. It’s a party that sees modest efforts to improve Americans’ economic and health security not merely as unwise, but as monstrous. It’s a party in which paranoid fantasies about the other side — Obama is a socialist, Democrats have totalitarian ambitions — are mainstream. And, as a result, it’s a party that fundamentally doesn’t accept anyone else’s right to govern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, especially delightful in view of the death threats, Sarah Palin’s PAC has put out a map with pro-health care Democrats targeted with—get this—gunsights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Palin map" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/palin-map1.jpg?w=403&amp;amp;h=651" alt="" width="403" height="651"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Palin’s blurb for her Facebook page urges dispirited Republicans to “reload”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/item.php?id=stereoimages&amp;amp;iid=113"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/03/STEREO_flare.jpg" alt="STEREO_flare" title="STEREO_flare" width="610" height="424"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image, &lt;a href="http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/item.php?id=stereoimages&amp;amp;iid=113"&gt;taken by the STEREO spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; (for Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory), shows the Sun in the far ultraviolet, almost at X-ray energies. The bright flare is on the left. The slightly tilted elongated diamond is not real; it’s what happens when an electronic detector gets flooded with light. Detectors like this convert photons of light into electrons, and if too many photons hit it, &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/planetx/soho.html"&gt;the electrons leak out and &amp;quot;bloom&amp;quot; into nearby pixels&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flares happen when the magnetic field lines of the Sun get tangled up. A huge amount of energy is stored in those lines! If the magnetic field gets too entangled, they can suddenly reconnect and release that energy. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Skies-These-Ways-World/dp/0670019976/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220913560&amp;amp;sr=8-8/badastronomy"&gt;In my book&lt;/a&gt;, I make the analogy to a bunch of bed spring coils all under tension and thrown into a bag. If one snaps back, it hits the others which then snap, and you get a very quick and &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; violent release of energy. For the Sun, that means a solar flare is released. The one shown here is little, but big ones can release as much as &lt;em&gt;10% of the Sun’s total energy!&lt;/em&gt; They roar out, vast and powerful across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays, and unleash a flood of subatomic particles as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look to the right of the flare, you’ll see some arcs extending up from the Sun’s surface. Those are also loops of magnetic energy, and a little time after this image was taken they too snapped, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/02/13/real-time-solar-flare-detection-now-online/"&gt;releasing a coronal mass ejection&lt;/a&gt;; it’s spread out more than a flare, so it’s less intense, but CMEs can blast out huge amounts of energy as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images like this, and more observations by STEREO, help astronomers understand our nearest star better. And this isn’t just academic knowledge: flares and CMEs can damage or even destroy satellites, which represent billions of dollars of assets. The government and private companies take this threat very seriously indeed, of course. Just imagine the number of TPS reports they’d have to fill out!&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s start with birds are dinosaurs.The slogan assumes we know something about the classification of dinosaurs, namely that they include birds. This assumption derives from a cladogram that shows that some dinosaurs (feathered therapods) are more closely related to birds than they are to other dinosaurs (see Gauither et al., 1998). Moreover, birds are diagnosed as any amniote that possesses feathers, meaning that therapods are birds. The slogan then should instead read  “some dinosaurs are birds”. This then begs the question “what are dinosaurs?” The phrase “Humans are apes” has been used quite often as a slogan, most notably by Richard Dawkins. Like the dinosaur bird example, it assumes that we know something about human classification. In fact, the term ‘ape’ refers to:“... any of two families (Pongidae and Hylobatidae) of large tailless semi-erect primates (as the chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, or gibbon) ...” (Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, 2010).Humans on the other hand belong to the Hominidae. In classification and in common usage, we are hominids and not apes. So why the confusion?Many scientists misuse existing terms in classification to make assumptions about evolution. Since evolution and classification are two separate issues, there is a degree of confusion. The slogan “humans are apes” is supposed to infer that humans evolved from apes or both apes and humans evolved from something else. In classification, this slogan is meaningless, unless it is meant to say that humans are members of either pongidae and hylobatidae. The same misuse of classification can be seen in a recent report of a newly discovered hominid from Siberia. The report by Krause et al (2010) states:“DNA sequence retrieved from a bone [the distal manual phalanx of the fifth digit, or the &amp;#39;pinkie&amp;#39;] excavated in 2008 in Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia. It represents a hitherto unknown type of hominin mtDNA that shares a common ancestor with anatomically modern human and Neanderthal mtDNAs about 1.0 million years ago (Krause et al., 2010).mtDNA is not used in taxonomy to diagnose new species. Moreover the variability in mtDNA has been found to be high between individuals (see He et al., 2010). So what is this hullabaloo about? It appears it concerns itself over a newly discovered pinkie and there isn&amp;#39;t much it can tell. You need more evidence than a pinkie to determine and describe a new species into an existing taxonomy. What Krause et al (2010) have found is a reconfirmation that hominid mtDNA is highly diverse. But yet, reading both Krause et al (2010) and the media, we are led to believe that a new species of hominid has been discovered. This is clearly not the case. Until further evidence is found (e.g., bones or bone fragments) and a diagnosis made can we be sure that “scientists have identified a previously unknown type of ancient human”.ReferencesGauthier, J.

While many people find that to be impressive, personally I've become so inured of it that I certainly don't take note of it much anymore. Certainly, I rarely point it out. So, you may ask, why am I pointing it out this time, even going so far as to start a post with it? The answer is simple. If there was one thing I always thought about having both an MD and a PhD, it's that it should render one more resistant to pseudoscience and woo. I know, I know, maybe I'm being incredibly arrogant or incredibly naive--possibly both--but it was what I thought for a long time, even well into my blogging years. You'd think that delving into the depths of woo on a nearly daily basis for five years would have taught me the error of my thoughts in this, but it didn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now. I've just encountered a man with a legitimate MD and PhD who has truly gone to the dark side. Meet &lt;a href="http://www.klinghardt.org"&gt;Dietrich Klinghardt, MD, PhD&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://www.neuraltherapy.com"&gt;Klinghardt Academy of Neurobiology&lt;/a&gt;. Here's a man who &lt;a href="http://www.neuraltherapy.com/dietrichbio.htm"&gt;started out seemingly promisingly enough until&lt;/a&gt;, well, this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dr. Klinghardt studied medicine (1969-1975) and psychology (1975-1979) in Freiburg, Germany, completing his PhD on the involvement of the autonomic nervous system in autoimmune disorders. Several publications followed. Early in his career, he became interested in the sequelae of chronic toxicity (especially lead, mercury, environmental pollutants and electromagnetic fields) for the course of illness. While working in India as a junior physician, he encountered Eastern concepts of disease etiology and blended them with his Western training. This laid the foundation for his 5-level system of Integrative Medicine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate it whenever I see someone refer to "Eastern medicine." There is no such thing, except as an artificial construct to justify woo compared to science-based medicine. Worse, Klinghardt seems to use a veritable cornucopia of serious woo:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/your_friday_dose_of_woo.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/your_friday_dose_of_woo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/-B_y5ZUv0HU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269606656673"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1777">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d6fd3ffd2411a823</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><category term="plasticity"/><category term="stem cells"/><title type="html">Neural Stem Cells and Plasticity</title><published>2010-03-26T12:17:05Z</published><updated>2010-03-26T12:17:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1777" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;New research is expanding our knowledge of the nature of plasticity in the brain, creating the potential to treat a variety of neurological diseases and injury with transplanted stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present the research is mostly in the proof of concept stage – doing animal studies to understand plasticity and the fate and function of neural stem cells. Plasticity is the ability of the brain to form new connections and pathways, even to change the pattern of its hardwiring. Plasticity is maximal when we are developing, and progressively declines with age. Although, even adults retain some plasticity and this likely results from the presence of neural stem cells (young cells capable of developing into new neurons) present even in the adult brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, all brain regions have a window of intense plasticity during which they are forming the majority of their connections. This development is closely tied to use, and if the brain is deprived of the appropriate sensory input or stimulation during this critical window of development, permanent deficits will develop. For examples, if children are not exposed to language by the age of 4 or so, their language window will close and they will never fully develop their language cortex. Or, if one eye is patched in young children, during the critical window in which binocular vision develops, they will never develop binocular vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) researchers, &lt;a href="http://news.ucsf.edu/releases/new-period-of-brain-plasticity-created-with-transplanted-embryonic-cells/"&gt;studying neural stem cell transplantation in mice&lt;/a&gt;, have been exploring the nature of these windows of high plasticity and have made some potentially useful discoveries. They isolated stem cells from the brain of embryonic mice and allowed them to age for various numbers of days. Meanwhile they patched one eye of other mice during their critical window of visual development, which results (due to the high degree of plasticity) in the visual cortex forming more connections to the open eye and fewer connections to the patched eye (called ocular dominance plasticity). This plasticity does not happen in more mature mice, after the critical window closes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then transplanted neural stem cells of various ages into mature mice, who were too old to display ocular dominance plasticity, to see if this would create a new period of such plasticity. They found that stem cells that were 33-39 days old (but not younger or older) resulted in ocular dominance plasticity. They also demonstrated that the stem cells distributed themselves throughout the cortex, matured, and formed connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this likely means is that the period of increased plasticity is determined by the age of the neurons themselves, specifically inhibitory neurons that release the neurotransmitter GABA. If there are 33-39 day-old GABA producing neurons present, there is plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several important proofs of concept here: neural stem cells can be transplanted and will survive and make meaningful connections; the window of maximal plasticity is largely determined by factors intrinsic to the neurons themselves (rather than some other mechanisms of signaling); and the window of plasticity can be recreated by transplanting stem cells of the appropriate age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all bodes well for the potential of neural stem cells to treat a variety of conditions – traumatic brain injury, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, cortical blindness, and maybe even Alzheimer’s disease. Any traumatic, developmental, or degenerative neurological condition in which the problem is dying or damaged neurons could potentially benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we need to extend this research to humans. The method of obtaining neural stem cells in this research would not be possible in humans, and so other methods would need to be developed. But there is already extensive and growing research showing the potential to derive stem cells from adult tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extrapolating technology is always tricky, but with the various proofs of concept already established by research we can easily imagine a future (once all the pesky technical details are worked out) in which a patient with one of the diseases I listed above or similar condition will have some of their fat cells (or some other cells) removed and then turned into stem cells. These stem cells will then be coaxed into forming neural stem cells and allowed to mature to the optimal age, and then transplanted back into the brain of the patient (either in a specific damaged location or more diffusely, as appropriate). Perhaps this treatment would have to be given multiple times. The stem cells will make connections, and due to plasticity will form the needed pathways, restoring function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long these new neurons will survive, and if they will fall prey to the original disease are important questions that later research will have to answer. Ideally, this type of treatment will result in young and vigorous brain cells that will last another lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises some further interesting, if speculative, questions. Would such treatments be useful for the brain atrophy and decline of function that most people (but interestingly not all) experience with normal aging? Will this technology make the “senior moment” a thing of the past?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, will such treatments be useful in making healthy young individuals smarter? Can an injection of neural stem cells before engaging in study or training enhance the benefits? Want to learn to speak a new language without an accent – no worries, just get an autologous transplant of neural stem cells in your language area and you are 3 years old again, ready to soak up a new language complete with all the phonemes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting question is this – what if someone with severe Alzheimer’s disease, in which the brain steadily atrophies until more than half of the brain cells are lost (and this would continue if the patient did not eventually die first), were treated with neural stem cells. The new cells replace the old, making connections, and restoring and maintaining cognitive function. After years of such treatment, most of the brain’s original neurons will have died and been replaced by new neurons. Will this still be the same person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the simple answer is yes. But I am interested in neurological function. It’s possible that if the process were slow enough there could conceivably be no cognitive changes – all the memories, personality, and talents will still be present. But that is the question – could this process slowly change the person neurologically, so that after 10 years and most of the brain being replaced the patient will actually be a different person in some meaningful respects. Will they have still lost some of their memories, will their personality and abilities change? Will they be almost like a newborn person (although with a very slow birth process)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think we will know unless and until we achieve this kind of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the research into neural stem cells is consistently moving in a very encouraging direction. So far, so good. It certainly would be a good thing if this technology ushers in a new age of restoring damaged brains. Right now treatments are mostly limited to treating symptoms, compensating for damage, or maybe slowing down the progression of degenerative diseases. In some cases we can support the limited self-repair potential of brains (relevant to injuries but not degenerative disorders). But there is no way to directly repair damaged brains.  That would be a welcome addition to our repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269606391691"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/03/scilla_siberica.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0f5271fe48bccd47</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biology"/><title type="html">Scilla siberica</title><published>2010-03-26T13:20:57Z</published><updated>2010-03-26T13:20:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/h3IB-BobqRA/scilla_siberica.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/03/scilla_siberica.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2010/03/scilla_siberica/P1010865lores.JPG" width="500" height="375" alt="P1010865lores.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the song, unbeknownst to the SNL people, she held up a picture of &lt;strong&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/strong&gt;, yelled “Fight the real enemy,” and tore it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5SRwuo3fOk"&gt;watch the video here&lt;/a&gt; (the incident takes place at the 2:55 mark).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news came out this week that &lt;strong&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/strong&gt; was part of a group that chose not to “&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/europe/25vatican.html?pagewanted=all"&gt;defrock a priest who molested as many as 200 deaf boys&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Victims give similar accounts of Father [Lawrence C.] Murphy’s pulling down their pants and touching them in his office, his car, his mother’s country house, on class excursions and fund-raising trips and in their dormitory beds at night. Arthur Budzinski said he was first molested when he went to Father Murphy for confession when he was about 12, in 1960.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’Connor was vilified two decades ago for her actions, but she was right.  You want to fight child abuse? Then you have to go after the Catholic Church.  &lt;a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/24/world/la-fg-sinead-qa25-2010mar25"&gt;They’ve done relatively little&lt;/a&gt; to combat the abuse in their own backyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This past weekend, Pope Benedict XVI issued a “pastoral letter” apologizing to the flock in Ireland for the church’s past failures. He did not outline any disciplinary action against the bishops who many here say covered up priestly misdeeds, though on Wednesday he accepted the resignation of Bishop John Magee, who had been accused of failing to report suspected pedophile priests to police. The pope also pinned no blame on the Vatican itself for a culture of secrecy that critics say it deliberately fostered.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does O’Connor have to say about this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s a study in the fine art of lying and actually betraying your own people… He starts by saying that he’s writing with great concern for the people of Ireland. If he was that concerned, why has it taken him 23 years to write a letter, and why did he or the last pope never get on an airplane and come to meet the victims in any of these countries and apologize?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were the boss of a company and some of the employees of your company were known to sexually abuse children, you would fire them instantly. You would also go instantly to meet the people who had been abused and profusely apologize and offer your help in any way whatsoever to deal with this… That has never happened.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a disgrace. The church has never accepted full responsibility.  People need to leave that organization and convince others to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

Results from a large number of twin, family and adoption studies agree that the heritability of g is very high – at least 50% and perhaps as high as 80%.  (This means that 50-80% of the variance in g across the population is due to differences in genes).  Some effects of a shared family environment are seen at early ages but these tend to disappear when examined in older individuals.  Whatever the effect of the family environment on IQ measures when an individual is within that environment, these effects seem to be temporary and diminish in later life.  (An important aside: Note that the heritability within populations does not tell us anything about what might cause a difference in the mean of a trait between two populations.  This is a common misinterpretation – differences in mean between populations may be entirely due to differences in environment, even if the trait is very highly heritable within each population, where environmental variance is low).   Presumably, some parameter of brain structure or function that correlates with intelligence is being affected by these genetic differences.  While a correlation with overall brain size has been repeatedly noted (“Check out the big brain on Brett!”), this leaves a lot of the variance in intelligence unexplained (and is also not particularly informative).  Is intelligence localized to a certain brain region or is it a distributed property of the entire network?   A number of recent studies, taking very different approaches, arrive at the same conclusion – it is the connectivity between areas of the brain that best correlates with intelligence.  Paul Thompson and colleagues analysed brain connectivity and intelligence in a large twin study (with 92 pairs of twins).  Using diffusion tensor imaging, they were able to assess the size, organization and “integrity” of axonal tracts connecting all areas of the brain.  They found, when comparing these measures across pairs of either monozygotic or dizygotic twins, that these parameters were more heritable for some tracts than for others.  Most importantly, they also found that intelligence was correlated with connectivity measures across numerous tracts in the brain.  They could also show a substantial shared genetic effect – the genes affecting structural connectivity were also affecting intelligence.  Ralph Adolphs and colleagues used a very different approach – they analysed a large collection of patients with lesions in different parts of the brain.  By looking across this collection for sites where lesions were consistently correlated with reduced intelligence they were able to map a network of important regions.  The most striking finding is that many of the “regions” thus defined were actually within the white matter – they were not restricted to specific cortical areas but rather reflected the connections between areas of the brain.  Again, the implication is that it is the efficiency and effectiveness of brain connectivity which are the major parameters affecting intelligence.  While the overall genetic effects are very robust, only a few specific genes have been identified that seem to influence intelligence.  For now, the neurodevelopmental processes which mediate the effects of these and other genes on the parameters of brain connectivity remain a mystery.      Chiang, M., Barysheva, M., Shattuck, D., Lee, A., Madsen, S., Avedissian, C., Klunder, A., Toga, A., McMahon, K., de Zubicaray, G., Wright, M., Srivastava, A., Balov, N., &amp;amp; Thompson, P.

A lot of that comment is mere conjecture whilst many of the studies in the area are cross-sectional, with small samples, producing conflicting results. The latest research contribution comes from Irena Stepanikova and her colleagues and involves a massive sample, some of whom were followed over time. The results suggest that more time on the internet is associated with increased loneliness and reduced life satisfaction. However, it&amp;#39;s a complicated picture because the researchers&amp;#39; different outcome measures produced mixed results.Over thirteen thousand people answered questions about their internet use, loneliness and life satisfaction in 2004 and in 2005. They&amp;#39;d been chosen at random from a list of US land-line numbers. The majority of the people quizzed in 2004 were different from those quizzed in 2005, but 754 people participated in both phases, thus providing some crucial longitudinal data. An important detail is that the researchers used two measures of internet use. The first &amp;#39;time-diary&amp;#39; method required participants to consider six specific hours spread out over the previous day and to estimate how they&amp;#39;d spent their time during those hours. The other &amp;#39;global recall&amp;#39; measure was more open-ended and required participants to consider the whole previous twenty-four hours and detail as best they could how they&amp;#39;d used that time. The cross-sectional data showed that participants who reported spending more time browsing the web also tended to report being lonelier and being less satisfied with life. This association was larger for the time-diary measure. The strength of the association was modest, but to put it in perspective, it was five times greater than the (inverse) link between loneliness and amount of time spent with friends and family. Turning to web-communication, the global recall measures showed that time spent instant messaging, in chat rooms and news groups (but not email) was associated with higher loneliness scores. For the time-diary measure, it was increased email use that was linked with more loneliness. The longitudinal data showed that as a person&amp;#39;s web browsing increased from 2004 to 2005, their loneliness also tended to increas (based on the global recall measure only). Both measures showed that increased non-email forms of web communication, including chat rooms, also went hand in hand with increased loneliness. Finally, more web browsing over time was linked with reduced life satisfaction by the time-diary measure, whilst more non-email web communication over time was linked with reduced life satisfaction by the global recall measure. Perhaps the most important message to come out of this research is that the results varied with the measure of internet use that was used - future researchers should note this. The other message is that more time browsing and communicating online appears to be linked with more loneliness, the two even increase together over time. However, it is important to appreciate that we don&amp;#39;t know the direction of causation. Increased loneliness may well encourage people to spend more time online, rather than web time causing loneliness. Or some other factor could be causing both to rise in tandem. It&amp;#39;s worth adding too that the web/loneliness link held even after controlling for time spent with friends and family. So if more web use were causing loneliness, it wasn&amp;#39;t doing it by reducing time spent socialising face-to-face. &amp;#39;We are hopeful that our study will stimulate future research ... ,&amp;#39; the researchers said, &amp;#39;but at this point any claims suggesting that as Internet use continues to grow in the future, more people will experience loneliness and low life-satisfaction would be premature.&amp;#39;_________________________________Stepanikova, I., Nie, N., &amp;amp; He, X.

But hey, why be shy?

And so you may imagine that urine and fluids have been on Sci's mind a little bit lately.  Another thing has also been on Sci's mind: the sheer amount of coffee that she has been drinking.  

She may be actually jonesing for her late PM dose right about now...

Sci has heard from many quarters that Coffee makes you pee, and that this is because caffeine is a diuretic.  On the other hand, Sci has also heard that coffee only makes you pee because it's a liquid and you're drinking it, rather than any specific diuretic properties.  So which is it?

This question is of great concern to Sci for several reasons.  First, Sci drinks a lot of coffee.   Second, Sci is a distance runner, and likes to compete in races.  She's been reading a lot lately about how caffeine just before a workout or race is good, and can increase your performance.  However, IF caffeine is ALSO a diuretic, this is something to keep in mind, because there is NOTHING worse than getting halfway through a 30K (18.5 miles, so say you're 9 miles in or so), and realizing that you REALLY have to pee (well, ok, maybe realizing you have diarrhea, or are going to vomit, pass out, or have a heart attack).  Races always talk about having port-o-johns, but at the side of the trail?  HAHAHAHAHAHA.  No.  Sci doesn't mind peeing in the woods, of course, but it wastes some seriously valuable time, especially in the shorter races, when a 30 second bathroom break WILL kill your chances of a win.

And so, Sci was curious, diuretic or not?  She decided to take a look around.

The Amateur Scientist says it better than I could:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, watching 3-D television requires owning a 3-D capable TV,  which almost nobody does.  But this is a way to make CatholicTV future  proof.  Eventually, 3-D TVs will be commonplace.  Unless, of course,  people realize they don’t give a shit about 3-D.  So, these new 3-D  shows are a way to reel in the kids who will never know a non-3-D world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, 3-D? Magical worlds? Two-dimensional villains? Needlessly long? Shitty plot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all sounds familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From the very beginning, I have always wanted this blog to be a blessing, something to help others, and never to hurt. I wanted to make people laugh, even in the midst of parenting trials.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It has become evident that I have not achieved that goal. I have unintentionally caused hurt and pain and for that I am truly sorry.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When I described a situation I observed recently, I was seeing in my mind and describing on my blog behavior that I have witnessed dozens of times in my own seven children and hundreds of students during my eight years as a school teacher. The behavior I described was nothing more to me than childishness and impatience, but I can see now that the words I used were viewed as symptoms of autism and many people were offended.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The most grievous part, for me, is that this has brought dishonor to the name of Christ, and that is wholly the opposite of my life’s mission.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is my sincere hope that this apology will bring healing and peace.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure that it was a hard journey to get to that apology, which I find heart-felt.  I am grateful for her apology, and I share her wish for peace and healing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update #5 &lt;/strong&gt;I have heard from a friend of Smockity&amp;#39;s that she&amp;#39;s received emails that attack her personally for her religious practices, or which call her vile names.  I fully and totally condemn such behavior, and have rebuked the commenters,  below, who tread a little too close to the line of attacking Smockity&amp;#39;s person rather than condemning her statements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update #4 (#s 1, 2, &amp;amp; 3 are at the bottom)&lt;/strong&gt; Smockity, if you happen to come here and read this, please know that in your post you  ridiculed behaviors (like toe-walking, hand-flapping, and perseverating) that many of my friends&amp;#39; children exhibit -- behaviors they can&amp;#39;t control, any more than a child with paralysis can get up and walk normally,  or a blind child can see.  I dearly hope that you can come to imagine the hurt these parents encounter, and resolve to be more accepting and more welcoming in the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, my real-life friend Squid, who has three children, one with autism,  wrote a post about a &lt;a href="http://www.squidalicious.com/2009/05/attention-costco-shoppers-you-have.html"&gt;very harrowing trip she took to Costco&lt;/a&gt;, in which her middle child (with autism) had a meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Please know that if you see a child who looks too old to be having
a tantrum going into full tantrum mode, there&amp;#39;s a good chance that
child is autistic. It&amp;#39;s okay to watch and see if the adult has the
situation under control&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

Squid&amp;#39;s post changed my behavior. I now &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; offer to help when I see a family struggling as she did with her tribe of three. I don&amp;#39;t care any more if I&amp;#39;m rebuffed -- the offer matters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal is here: many children with neurological challenges to their behavior appear to be perfectly normal.  Until you really have the tools to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to today&amp;#39;s topic: in which a &lt;a href="http://www.smockityfrocks.com/2010/02/in-which-smockity-considers-jabbing-a-ball-point-pen-into-her-eye.html"&gt;homeschooling mother of seven&lt;/a&gt; observed a child, and did not &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;. She blogs at &lt;a href="http://www.smockityfrocks.com/"&gt;SmockityFrocks&lt;/a&gt;.  I want to be generous to this person, even though her post, &lt;a href="http://www.smockityfrocks.com/2010/02/in-which-smockity-considers-jabbing-a-ball-point-pen-into-her-eye.html"&gt;In Which Smockity Considers Jabbing A Ball Point Pen Into Her Eye&lt;/a&gt;, made me feel....well, quite uncharitable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible, given that her family homeschools, and possibly where she lives, she has never met a family affected by autism. That&amp;#39;s the most generous view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me review for you some pointers that a child may be affected by autism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toewalking  or walking on &amp;quot;tippy-toes&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handflapping  or &amp;quot;stims&amp;quot;, which may help a child with autism self-regulate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repetitive strings of words or  &amp;quot;perseveration&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Urm.  I&amp;#39;m having a hard time capturing this.  OK: socially-awkward interactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behavior that is appropriate for a child months or years younger than the child appears to be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 

In her post &lt;a href="http://www.smockityfrocks.com/2010/02/in-which-smockity-considers-jabbing-a-ball-point-pen-into-her-eye.html"&gt;In Which Smockity Considers Jabbing A Ball Point Pen Into Her Eye&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;4 year old girl she mocks and ridicules&lt;/em&gt; exhibits all five of the pointers above.  Does Smockity even consider this child might be...neurologically non-standard?  Nope.  It&amp;#39;s mother&amp;#39;s and grandmother&amp;#39;s failure to parent well:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If you had a big mixing bowl and added 1 cup of overindulged, 1 cup of coddled, 1 cup of impatient, and a handful of annoying, stirred it up, rolled it out, and put it in a pan, your little Honeybun Adora-belle would be the tasty nugget that popped right out of the pan, and you are doing her a huge disservice in teaching her that what is not at all patient is what you call “patience”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

Sheesh. I&amp;#39;ve re-written this paragraph 10 times. Bless your heart, Smockity, that grandmother and granddaughter were doing as best they could.  How about you and your children?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And: What would Jesus say about your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elsewhere (Updated silently):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has come to my attention that my motives are being slandered because of what I meant to be a humorous look at life around me. I do not speak for any group of Christians, homeschoolers, stay at home moms, or anyone else, nor am I interested in defending myself to strangers who believe they can judge my character from one post.&lt;/p&gt;

Motives? Character? No, Smockity, you were being rebuked for your public statements. And the link takes you to Autism Speaks, an organization &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;not well-liked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/09/i-am-autism-awareness-video-by-alfonso-cuar%C3%B3n-ransom-reprise.html"&gt;loathed and reviled&lt;/a&gt; by many in the autism community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that not only is the Australian Vaccination Network anti-vaccine and anti-medicine in general but possibly also L. Ron Hubbard-worshiping cultists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear at this time precisely how large their connection is to $cientology but one thing that is certain is that&lt;a href="http://avn.org.au/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=33&amp;amp;products_id=886"&gt; they’re selling on their website propaganda &lt;/a&gt;produced by the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), one of the many well-known $cientology front group, &lt;a href="http://www.cchr.org/about_cchr/"&gt;which now openly admits their $cientology affiliation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, their selling the “documentary” &lt;em&gt;Making A Killing: The Untold Story of Psychotropic Drugging&lt;/em&gt;. Here’s what their website says about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychotropic drugs. Its the story of big money- drugs that fuel a  $330 billion psychiatric industry, without a single cure. The cost in  human terms is even greater- these drugs now kill an estimated 42 000  people every year. And the death count keeps rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containing  more that 175 interviews with lawyers, mental health experts, the  families of victims and the survivors themselves, this riveting  documentary rips the mask off psychotropic drugging and exposes a brutal  but well-entrenched money-making machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds an awful lot like that other CCHR produced “documentary” &lt;em&gt;Psychiatry: Industry of Death&lt;/em&gt; (also the name of their “museum” of alleged mental health atrocities throughout history caused by those evil psychiatrists) :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/australian-vaccination-network-linked-to-scientology/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/6qs9TLTvYFs/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But when $cientology is your ideological ally, you’re in big trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the true face of the anti-vaccine movement, the one they desperately try to hide when the cameras are rolling so that they can pass as rational by insisting all they want are safer vaccines. No, what you want is the tear down all of medical science and replace it with your own nonsense. And this is why you and your friends the $cientologists will be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

Several comments and statements quoted in those posts reveal recurrent questions regarding both plausibility itself and the history of the H. pylori hypothesis. In this post I’ll attempt to answer some of those questions, but I’ll also insert some new confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Plausibility ≠ Knowing the Mechanism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s first dispense with a simple misunderstanding: We, by which I mean We Supreme Arbiters of Plausibility (We SAPs) here at SBM, do not require knowing the mechanism of some putative effect in order to deem it plausible. This seems so obvious that it ought not be necessary to repeat it over and over again, and yet the topic can’t be broached without some nebbishy South Park do-gooder chanting a litany of “just because you don’t know how it works doesn’t mean it can’t work,” as if that were a compelling or even relevant rebuttal. Let’s get this straight once and for all: IT ISN’T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Novella explained why at the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4169"&gt;Yale conference&lt;/a&gt; and again &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4178"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We talked about it at &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=558"&gt;TAM7&lt;/a&gt; last summer. For a particularly annoying example, read the three paragraphs beginning with “Mr. Gagnier’s understanding of biological plausibility” &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1140750/?tool=pubmed"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, I’ll admit that I’m beginning to learn something from such frustration. Perhaps we’ve not been so good at explaining what we mean by &lt;em&gt;plausibility&lt;/em&gt;. The point is not that we don’t know a particular mechanism for homeopathy, for example; the point is that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; proposed mechanism would necessarily &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=42"&gt;violate scientific principles&lt;/a&gt; that rest on far more solid ground than any number of equivocal, bias-and-error-prone clinical trials could hope to overturn. The same is true for “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3423"&gt;energy medicine&lt;/a&gt;” and for claims based on non-existent anatomical structures (iridology, reflexology, auricular acupuncture, meridians, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3022"&gt;chiropractic “subluxations”&lt;/a&gt;), non-existent physiologic functions (”&lt;a href="http://faculty.une.edu/com/shartman/sram.pdf"&gt;craniosacral rhythms&lt;/a&gt;“), or non-existent anatomic-physiologic relations (”&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=62"&gt;neurocranial restructuring&lt;/a&gt;,” “detoxification” with &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=291"&gt;coffee enemas&lt;/a&gt;, dissolving tumors with orally administered &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1545"&gt;pancreatic enzymes&lt;/a&gt;). The spectrum of implausible health claims euphemistically dubbed “CAM” is full of such nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reader &lt;strong&gt;daedalus2u&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4178#comment-45328"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; a useful way to clarify the point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the idea of prior plausibility should actually be reframed into one of a lack of prior implausibility. It isn’t that one should have reasons to positively think that something is plausible before testing it, but rather that one should not be able to come up with reasons (actually data) why it is fatally implausible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of what We deem implausible will not be fatally so, of course. Implausibility can be based not only on established physical and biological knowledge, but also on studies, as is the case for &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=492"&gt;sticking needles&lt;/a&gt; into people, injecting them with &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=118"&gt;chelating agents&lt;/a&gt;, or claiming that autism is caused by &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=384"&gt;childhood immunizations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Plausibility and History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second theme, though not as simple, concerns the historical role of plausibility. Reader &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4178#comment-45304"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;anoopbal&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;introduced the point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;am not sure if you can apply biological plausibility to every situation. It is usually considered as a weak criterion because it is limited by our knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we used plausibility 300 years back, nobody would have used citrus fruits for scurvy nor people would have believed mosquitoes are linked with black water fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that &lt;strong&gt;daedalus’s&lt;/strong&gt; “reframing” proposal deals with that objection to a large extent. I also don’t think that &lt;strong&gt;anoopbal’s&lt;/strong&gt; examples are all that revealing. It seems to me that empiricism was the main source, other than myth, for plausibility at the time. Plausibility in the biomedical sense is not something that can be usefully discussed for the period prior to about the mid-19th century, when &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=157"&gt;enough was finally known&lt;/a&gt; about biology and chemistry to hatch science-based medicine in its full form. Prior to that, most useful diagnostic and treatment methods had been discovered empirically (accidentally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that someone living before the mid-19th century could not have applied plausibility to a medical question—obviously that could happen at any time—but that to attempt to do so, when so much was still mysterious (how cowpox pus worked, microbiology, Avagadro’s number, energy flux in living organisms, physiology, pharmacology, etc.) or &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/magical_thinking_in_complementary_and_alternative_medicine/"&gt;‘explained’ by magic&lt;/a&gt; (the Vital Force, miasmas, sympathetic magic, the 4 humors, etc.) would have meant very little by today’s standards. And I do believe that there is a fundamental difference—not merely a foolish conceit about modernity—between what we know today and what we knew 300 years ago. Thus I don’t think that biological plausibility is a weak criterion now, even if it was then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give &lt;strong&gt;anoopbal &lt;/strong&gt;his or her due, he seemed to partially agree when he &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4178#comment-45393"&gt;later noted&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that‘s exactly the limitation of biological plausibility. It is limited by what we currently know. Centuries back our knowledge about earth was limited, and you can’t blame them for believing the earth [was] a flat disc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;On to H. Pylori&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daedalus&lt;/strong&gt; offered another &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4178#comment-44863"&gt;interesting take&lt;/a&gt; on plausibility:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An idea does not have low prior plausibility if it does not agree with prior explanations, it has low prior plausibility if it does not agree with prior data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many (most?) scientists make this confusion too. That is because they are thinking on the level of the explanations, not on the level of the data that led to those explanations. The explanations may be wrong, the data that led to them is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the presumption that the data are accurate, we would all probably agree with this. &lt;strong&gt;Daedalus&lt;/strong&gt;, however, then got a little tripped up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of using antibiotics to treat ulcers was incompatible with the idea that ulcers were due to too much acid. It was not incompatible with any of the data surrounding ulcer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So did &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4204"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harriet Hall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of treating ulcers with antibiotics was not incompatible with any of the data about ulcers; it was only incompatible with the idea that ulcers were caused by too much acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time that Barry Marshall and Robin Warren proposed their bacterial hypothesis, there &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7034155"&gt;data suggesting&lt;/a&gt; that ulcers were caused by too much acid: acid neutralization or suppression of acid formation resulted in better than 90% healing of peptic ulcers, compared with about 30% for placebo. If such therapies were discontinued after healing, the ulcers typically relapsed, only to be healed again by renewed acid suppression. This did not rule out the possibility of some other factor also being involved, of course, but it would seem to have come pretty close to throwing down the gauntlet of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam&amp;#39;s_razor"&gt;Ockham’s Razor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why not just Treat with Antibiotics?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What might it have taken prior to 1984, short of what was subsequently done, to convince the world that peptic ulcer disease could be effectively treated with antibacterial agents? A reader sent just &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4178"&gt;such a question&lt;/a&gt; to Steve Novella:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would Science Based Medicine do if H. pylori was not known, but a study showed that antibiotics given to patients with stomach ulcers eliminated symptoms? I assume that SBM wouldn’t dismiss it outright saying that it couldn’t possibly be helping because antibiotics don’t reduce stomach acid. I assume a SBM approach would do further studies trying to discover why antibiotics work. But, in the meantime, would a SBM practitioner refuse to give antibiotics to patients because he doesn’t have a scientific explanation as to why it works?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A straightforward answer is as follows. Although the question may raise an interesting general point about plausibility, the example is not a good one. Antibiotics are not one medicine but many. They all have side effects, some quite serious. Bacteria are also not one species but many; they have widely differing sensitivities to various antibiotics. Which antibiotic(s) would the study have used, and on what basis? Responsible MDs would not have accepted such a scheme for PUD, because they would have needed to know what they were treating and how to treat it (H. pylori turns out to require three different antibiotics given simultaneously).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A predictable rejoinder to this is that many physicians routinely treat upper respiratory tract infections, most commonly caused by viruses, with an antibiotic. Without going into detail, let me assure you that this does not refute my point: in many cases MDs should not be treating these URIs with antibiotics, and in cases where it makes a bit of sense to do so it is done with a single, short-term antibiotic with a benign risk/benefit profile, known to be effective against the most common community-acquired bacterial culprits of the respiratory tract. This is quite different from attempting to treat a mysterious bacterium that might not even exist, for a disease that already has effective treatments that are safer and have fewer side effects than antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4178#comment-44789"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mikerattlesnake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; got the point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it’s a wise addendum to directly address the logical misstep in the question you received. Those who understand SBM would get the answer from the broad approach taken in your post, but those people aren’t the ones likely to parrot the fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it simply: finding that an antibiotic was effective against an ulcer would indicate a bacterial cause for ulcers that would warrant further study. The reason for that has entirely to do with prior plausibility. Antibiotics are known to fight bacteria. If an antibiotic cures ulcers, it gives us a plausible answer for the mechanism causing ulcers. The questioner makes the mistake of assuming that we would never abandon the assumed cause of ulcers, but SBM looks for mechanisms of action for ailments as well as cures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So did &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4178#comment-44845"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BillyJoe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with the appropriate caveat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one thing though: this could never have happened. As I understand it, the treatment involves taking three different tablets – two antibiotics and an acid suppressing drug – twice a day for a week. How likely is that to have happened by chance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Discoveries Require Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might assume that Robin Warren and Barry Marshall were the first to discover bacteria apparently living in the human stomach and duodenum, and the first to propose that the bacteria might be involved in diseases of these tissues, but this isn’t the case. Such bacteria were first observed in the 19th century. Over subsequent decades there were sporadic reports of similar bacteria, but they were not necessarily associated with diseases and their presence &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13183283"&gt;could not be reliably reproduced&lt;/a&gt;. The table of contents of &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Helicobacter-Pioneers-Scientists-Discovered-Helicobacters/dp/0867930357"&gt;Helicobacter Pioneers: Firsthand Accounts from the Scientists who Discovered Helicobacters 1892 – 1982&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, edited by Barry Marshall, gives a hint of just how close some investigators came to the truth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to Marshall and Warren, human gastric bacteria were not only inconsistently seen, but were never cultured and hence never characterized in a useful way (for a more basic treatment of this topic, please see my 2004 &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/bacteria_ulcers_and_ostracism_h._pylori_and_the_making_of_a_myth"&gt;essay in Skeptical Inquirer&lt;/a&gt;). At least two distinct technological advances were necessary to set the stage for the discovery and characterization of H. pylori in humans: first, a simple and safe method for obtaining gastric mucosa specimens from live patients had to be devised; second, the field of bacteriology had to appreciate the existence of highly fastidious organisms and devise methods for growing them in culture. The first of these requirements was satisfied only by the late 1970s, when flexible, fiberoptic endoscopy became widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not enough of an historian of bacteriology to state, with certainty, when H. pylori &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have first been cultured, if only its existence had been fully appreciated, but it is doubtful that it could have occurred much sooner than it did. &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Helicobacter Pioneers&lt;/span&gt; reports that the first successful culture of any helicobacter species—isolated from mice—occurred in 1968. Other examples of fastidious bacteria have also been characterized relatively recently: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma_pneumoniae#History"&gt;mycoplasma pneumoniae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydophila_pneumoniae"&gt;chlamydophila pneumoniae&lt;/a&gt;, two organisms that cause &lt;em&gt;atypical pneumonia&lt;/em&gt;, were still thought to be viruses until the 1960s; several new species of helicobacter and campylobacter, some of which are human pathogens, have been discovered only in the last 10-15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culture requirements of H. pylori, moreover, are esoteric: it grows best in an atmosphere of 5% oxygen and is helped by the presence of certain antibiotics to discourage overgrowth by more hardy contaminants, which are almost impossible to avoid when collecting specimens from the stomach via the mouth. Helicobacter takes much longer to grow than most bacteria, and but for serendipity Warren and Marshall might have missed it. They abandoned their first 34 culture attempts (or, more precisely, “junior microbiology staff” abandoned them) in spite of multiple variations of media and temperatures, after no growth had occurred within 48 hours. It was only after a five-day Easter vacation, during which the 35th attempt was left undisturbed, that tiny, transparent colonies appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;John Lykoudis: the Real Galileo of PUD?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An intriguing story in &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Helicobacter Pioneers&lt;/span&gt; is found in chapter 7: &lt;em&gt;John Lykoudis: The general practitioner in Greece who in 1958 discovered the etiology and a treatment of peptic ulcer disease.&lt;/em&gt; You can read most of this chapter at the &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lK4ATW-lQZQC&amp;amp;dq=helicobacter+pioneers&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=bn&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=PHuqS5ntFIT68Ab_5u2ABw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=4&amp;amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;Google Books&lt;/a&gt; website. If it is accurate, it makes the answer to the question that the reader posed to Dr. Novella not so straightforward as Mikerattlesnake, BillyJoe, and I argued above: it inserts the “new confusion” that I promised at the beginning of this post. Lykoudis’s story has all the necessary tragic elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;a general practitioner in a small, isolated town in Greece, prompted by a single clinical observation, developed on his own the concept that PUD and gastritis had an infectious etiology. As if this was not enough, this most unlikely student of PUD proceeded to devise an apparently effective treatment, based on the antibiotics of his time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lykoudis’s treatment, apparently developed by trial and error, consisted of 3 antibiotics (2 quinolines and streptomycin, for you microbiology/infectious disease enthusiasts out there) and vitamin A, taken orally. He patented this regimen in a pill that he named &lt;em&gt;Elgaco&lt;/em&gt;, “from the Greek word for ulcer (= &lt;em&gt;el&lt;/em&gt;kos), &lt;em&gt;ga&lt;/em&gt;stritis and &lt;em&gt;co&lt;/em&gt;litis” (for which he also asserted that his treatment was effective). He eventually claimed to have treated 30,000 patients with nearly perfect results and no toxicity. According to the authors of the chapter,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success of &lt;em&gt;Elgaco&lt;/em&gt; cannot be quantified from extant notes on thousands of patients, because the outcome of each patient is not recorded. We have concluded, however, that his treatment was successful, based on the following considerations. First, our current understanding of the etiology and treatment of PUD makes it plausible that his treatment was effective. Second, there is the written testimony (some of it sworn, as explained later) of many of the patients who were treated by Lykoudis. All report prompt responses to his therapy. In some cases, patients even detail that radiographically proven ulcers were cured following treatment with &lt;em&gt;Elgaco&lt;/em&gt; and that such cure was confirmed by repeat radiological series. Third, Lykoudis had a large following and despite fierce opposition from the establishment, patients flocked to him from all over Greece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of this, his attempts to make his discovery known to the world were rebuffed at every turn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He encounter[ed] formidable obstacles in convincing the medical establishment, the Greek regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry. In fact, Lykoudis spent the rest of his life engaged in incessant activity to propagate his treatment of PUD and gastritis. His archives, some made recently available by his family, make it clear that he was fully aware of the importance of his discoveries. They also convey an almost suffocating sense of frustration…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[He was] completely shunned by the medical establishment of his time, or at best, considered an eccentric provincial physician…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1966, Lykoudis attempted to publish his observations in the Journal of the American Medical Association, but his manuscript entitled “Ulcer of the Stomach and Duodenum” was rejected…Unfortunately, no copy of this manuscript survives for re-evaluation in the light of current knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lykoudis did, however, publish his own booklet, “The Truth about Gastric and Duodenal Ulcer.” In it he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that gastritis and duodenitis, which have gastric and duodenal ulcer as their complication, are inflammations due to an infectious agent…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lykoudis made numerous attempts to get his remedy approved by the Greek Drug and Pharmacies Administration, to no avail. He even managed to enlist the aid of influential politicians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1967, Lykoudis succeeded in getting the attention of the Prime Minister’s office. His correspondence with the Minister of Health on 21 August, 1967, a sad document indeed, is revealing. He registers his frustration that medications with apparently no effect on PUD were approved, whereas &lt;em&gt;Elgaco&lt;/em&gt; was repeatedly rejected. He proposes, in essence, a phase III trial: 100 PUD patients to be treated at a State hospital by the eminent professors, 50 with conventional treatment and 50 with &lt;em&gt;Elgaco.&lt;/em&gt; ‘Their refusal to approve it is understandable, but their refusal to test it is not!’ he writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lykoudis continued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the study proves them correct, they will be vindicated and I will become a laughing stock…It is dramatically urgent to clarify this issue…Too much, endless talking, which leads nowhere, while it is simple to resolve this in a practical way. Only facts constitute the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet again he was refused. Lykoudis also tried, unsuccessfully, to interest several drug companies in his regimen. The final insults were these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…he was referred for disciplinary action to the Athens Medical Association, of which he was a member, ‘because (a) he prepared and distributed an unapproved medicinal preparation…and (b) he made his method publicly known to attract patients’…On 6 November 1968…the Disciplinary Committee, presided over by a neurology professor, fined him 4000 drachmas…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more serious problem for Lykoudis was his indictment in the Greek Courts…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latter instance numerous former patients came to his support; one of them testified that Lykoudis “treated also many poor ulcer patients free of charge.”  We are not told the outcome of the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lykoudis died in 1980 without knowing that he would soon be vindicated. His story is disturbing because it is an almost perfect hybrid of two entirely different possibilities: on the one hand, a legitimate innovator who is unfairly rejected and persecuted, in spite of heroic efforts over more than 2 decades to prove his theory; on the other, a classical example of unwitting foolishness, bordering upon quackery or sociopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only in hindsight that we can grant that there is a good chance that it wasn’t the latter. Consider the striking parallels, however, to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=92"&gt;Nicholas Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;, whose main arguments have consisted of patient testimonials and case reports selected by himself, who claims that his regimen is nontoxic, who claims to treat some patients for free, who was hounded by regulatory boards for a time, who found political allies to help defend him, and who for years pleaded that all he wanted was a chance to &lt;a href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/whccamp/meetings/transcript_10_05_00_evening.txt"&gt;test his regimen&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe in research. I don’t want this to be out there until we prove it works by the strictest standards of orthodox medicine. What I have wanted from the day I began researching this under Dr. Goode at Cornell in 1981, was to do appropriate clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Again: Discoveries Require Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sense, reading the story of John Lykoudis, is that he &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; treated unfairly, and I think that most people would agree. A major caveat is that the authors of the chapter are clearly sympathetic to him, and it’s quite possible that another account would read differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether fair or not, it seems to me that the major weakness in Lykoudis’s case is that he never characterized the putative bacteria in any way: he didn’t see them, he didn’t provide direct evidence of them for others to examine, and he didn’t culture them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even his sympathetic biographers recognized this. Although they attributed his failure to “his lack of academic credentials” and even more to “his thesis [being] contrary to established, albeit unsubstantiated, dogma,” they also observed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when he was compelled to identify these elusive organisms, particularly when dealing with regulatory agencies, he meandered around known pathogens, unable to build a strong case for any of them. His main argument, and the strongest one he could marshal in all his writings in favor of the infectious etiology of these clinical entities, was the response to treatment that he had witnessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good argument can be made that characterizing the “bug” not only is, but ought to be a &lt;em&gt;sine qua non&lt;/em&gt; for treating a putative infectious disease with drugs. This is true because the drugs are not benign or universally effective, as argued above, but also because there are precedents suggesting that to do otherwise opens the door to mistreatments. Bacteria or viruses are frequently offered as potential etiologic agents for all sorts of diseases whose causes are poorly understood, particularly when there is an inflammatory component (that is one reason that the H. pylori hypothesis didn’t represent a new “paradigm”). Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are examples, but these have, so far, eluded attempts at proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first learned about &lt;a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/sarc/sar_whatis.html"&gt;sarcoidosis &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/crohns/"&gt;Crohn’s disease&lt;/a&gt; in medical school in the 1970s, I would have bet dollars-to-donuts that they, and rheumatoid arthritis and a few other diseases for that matter, would eventually be shown to have infectious etiologies. I would still almost make that bet, my only hesitation being that after 30+ more years of investigations and impressive advances in microbiology (including vastly more powerful methods of detecting well-veiled foreign invaders, from electron microscopy to nucleic acid amplification), no apparent culprits have feen found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that same time, moreover, not only peptic ulcer disease but also Lyme disease, Legionnaire’s disease, and Toxic Shock Syndrome were shown to have bacterial origins, and AIDS was shown to be caused by a virus. Thus on the basis of what has been learned about infectious diseases it can’t be argued, with a straight face, that biomedical progress is hampered by stodginess or petty jealousies or dogmatic thinking or conflicts of interest or any of the other usual suspects, even though they certainly all exist among individual scientists. What hampers progress, in cases such as Likoudis’s, is what hampers all scientific progress: the context is not prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instances in which at least some people have become convinced of a spurious infectious etiology, on the other hand, have not been pretty. In the early 20th century, prior to the discovery of antibiotics, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cotton_(doctor)"&gt;some psychiatrists&lt;/a&gt; became convinced that “insanity” was caused by bacteria in the mouth and that the appropriate treatment was “surgical bacteriology”: tooth extractions, tonsillectomies, and in intractable cases removal of “testicles, ovaries, gall bladders, stomachs, spleens, cervixes, and especially colons.” More recently a putative &lt;a href="http://www.heartfixer.com/Nanobacterium/NB%20-%20Overview.htm"&gt;bacterial cause of atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt; has spawned a small &lt;a href="http://www.chelationtherapyonline.com/articles/p54.htm"&gt;quack industry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if any of the diseases mentioned above is eventually found to be infectious in origin, this will not necessarily vindicate those whose premature exuberance put patients in harm’s way. Such exuberance ought to motivate legitimate investigations, not half-assed, ill-conceived treatments. Still, I seem to hear a ghostly voice in my ear, speaking Italian with a thick Greek accent…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E pur si muove!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Or it might not be. The bone, which comes from what New Zealanders call a "little finger", Americans call a"pinky" and paleo-anthropologists call the "distal manual phalanx of the fifth digit", was found in the Denisova cave, in a region of Siberia from which remains of members of both our own species (Homo sapiens) and Neanderthals  (H. neanderthalensis) have previously been found. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences generated from the finger bone are distinct from both modern human sequences and from previously published neanderthal sequences, but inferring species boundaries is a tricky business and the mtDNA sequences are not, in and of themselves, proof that the finger belonged to a member of a third human species.

Here's the big figure from the paper, which was presented by Johannes Krause and colleagues in Nature yesterday. It's a phylogenetic tree which relates the little finger's mtDNA to H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis sequences (click to see a high-resolution version):

The Denisnova sequence is red, Neanderthal sequences are in blue and modern humans are grey. So, the Denisova mtDNA forms a distinct lineage that isn't represented in modern humans or in previously published Neanderthal sequences. By using the tree as the basis for molecular dating the researchers where able to estimate that Denisova lineage separated from other human mitochondrial lineages between 0.78 and 1.3 million years ago. The temporal context the molecular dating adds to the phylogenetic tree helps to us understand where this new mitochondrial lineage might fit into humanity's family tree.I've said before that most of our species' history was played out in Africa, and, in fact, the same is true when we step up a taxonomic level and look at our genus. All the human species that have been found outside of Africa descend from migrants that moved out of that continent at some stage. Here's a schematic representing some of the species in the wider human family tree and the timing of the migrations that moved them out of Africa.

How does the new evidence presented by Krausse et al. fit into that scheme? Perhaps the simplest interpretation is the the Denisova lineage represents a new species. The estimated age of the Denisova lineage makes it too young to have been carried out of Africa by the first wave of H. erectus migrants to leave Africa and apparently too old to have been inherited from the migrants that went on to form the Neanderthal lineage. If the Denisova sequence is something new then we'll have to update our family tree, adding a new branch and a fourth migration out of Africa. 

John Hawkes thinks we should hold off on updating the family tree too qucikly. The Desinova specimen might be a Neanderthal. At first glance the tree presented by Krausse et al. seems to dispel that possibility since previously identified Neanderthal sequences are more closely related to modern human sequences than the new linaeage, but that tree is based entirely on mtDNA. The mitochondrial genome is inherited as if it was a single gene. We can often use trees estimated from a single gene ("gene trees") as a proxy for species-level relationships ("species trees") but, in fact, every gene in a population has its own history and there there are scenarios that can push a given gene tree away from underlying species tree. Perhaps the easiest way to visualise how you'd end up with mitochondrial lineages that diverged millions of years ago within a single species is to think about genetic lineages moving through a population while speciation happens. Rember, speciation is  a process, not an event, when new species form when populations stop sharing genes with each other. What happens if multiple different gene lineages are present in the ancestral population at the time that this gene flow stops? Usually, given enough time, each species will "sort" into specific gene lineages that descend from just one of the lineages in the ancestral population, but it's also possible for one (or both) species to maintain multiple lineages for some time. Such "incomplete lineage sorting" makes gene trees bad proxies for species trees and it's just possible that something like this has happened in Neanderthals:

Perhaps by moving to the very Easterm edge of the Neanderthals range  we've sampled for the first time a lineage that existed in that species for the whole time it was in Europe. Maybe, and Hawkes surely knows a lot more about paleobiology than I do, but I don't really buy it. It's certainly possible for a species to harbour deeply divergent mitochondrial lineages, but the time it takes for gene-lineages to sort within a species is relative to the effect population size of that species. Neanderthals probably had a relatively small effective population  size (and mtDNA definitely does, since only females pass it on and then in only one copy)  making the retention of multiple lineages over  hundreds of thousands of years seem like a long shot. As Hawkes argues, strong geographic structure in Neanderthal populations might have aided the retention of divergent genetic lineages against those odds, maybe the Denisova mitochondrial lineage was extinct in Western Europe but common in Central Asia? It's possible, but I wouldn't bet on it.Finally, the Denisova sample might be our first look at H. erectus DNA.  H. erectus remains have been recovered from China so it seems possible they where in Siberia too.  As I've said, the molecular dating of the Denisova lineage probably makes it too young to be a descendant of the first wave of migration form Afirca (though, of course, there is some uncertainty associated with that dating), but it might be evidence of genetic exchange between African and Central Asian populations of H. erectus. As we've come to understand the origin of our species we've realised that the simple "Out of Africa" model is just that, a model, and the true pattern is more complex. H. sapiens really did have its start in Africa and it really did push out into the rest of the world in the last 50 000 years but during that expansion populations have continued to exchange genes. There's no reason to believe that that H. erectus would not have done the same, perhaps the main thrust of the H. erectus expansion was 1.6-2 million years ago but genes continued to flow in and out of African for sometime after that. So, there are three possibilities for the Denisova sample:

 It could be a new species,

It could be an ancient mitochondrial lineage retained in eastern Neanderthal populations but lost elsewhere

 It could be the first H. erectus sequence.

We'll need more genes (Krausse et al. report they are working on the nuclear genome) or more complete specimens to know for sure but I'll throw caution to the wind and say I think the first scenario to be the most likely and the second the least probable (remembering of course, that I'm not an anthropologist and these are pretty subjective estimates!). Perhaps I'm displaying some biases because I aslo think numbers one and three would be the cooler results. In either of those scenarios are true then we can add a third human species (alongside the Neanderthals and the 'Hobbit' H. floresiensis) that modern humans might have interacted with - it's just so fascinating to imagine our ancestors living alongside other human species and how differently the world might have turned out if those other species had survived the few thousand years that separate us. You should read Carl Zimmer's post on the paper, he's compiling expert opinions as they come to him.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no opposition between faith and science, says Benedict XVI, who proposed the example of St. Albert the Great to illustrate this truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, of course!  What better way to demonstrate the compatibility of science and religion than with the example of a man who lived 800 years ago, back in the heyday of science!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might not be familiar with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Albert_the_Great"&gt;Albert&lt;/a&gt;, as for some reason *cough* anti-religious-bias *cough* they tend not to teach much about him in science class, but he was a real scientist’s scientist.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, he was an earlier pioneer of &lt;i&gt;alchemy&lt;/i&gt;, and (like Nicolas Flamel in the British versions of &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/i&gt;) he wrote a treatise on the &lt;a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone"&gt;Philosopher’s Stone&lt;/a&gt;.  He discovered the &lt;a href="http://marthaandtom.com/2010/02/return-to-st-albert-the-greats-fish-fry/"&gt;depilatory effects&lt;/a&gt; of frog ashes.  His theory of &lt;a href="http://www.renaissanceastrology.com/albertusmagnusastrologicalmagic.html"&gt;astrological talismans&lt;/a&gt; was centuries ahead of its time.  He witnessed the creation of gold by “transmutation,” which even today’s scientists can’t manage.  And he was even said to be interested in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology"&gt;phrenology&lt;/a&gt;, which wasn’t even really popular until 500 years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next time someone tries to tell you faith and science aren’t compatible, you just remind them that the 13th century says different!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269576483617"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=22824">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9f1e43e5601aa1b0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Lawsuits"/><title type="html">Cartoonists on the Catholic Church Abuse Scandal</title><published>2010-03-26T04:02:41Z</published><updated>2010-03-26T04:02:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/25/cartoonists-on-the-catholic-church-abuse-scandal/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kleine Zeitung&lt;/em&gt;, a newpaper in Austria, has some biting political cartoons discussing the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/europe/25vatican.html?ref=general&amp;amp;src=me&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;child abuse scandal in the Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

There seems to be something awful going around down there: Ken Ham, Ray Comfort, and now…Gary Ablett, Sr. He's an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Ablett,_Sr."&gt;Australian rules footballer with a few seedy drug-related incidents in his past&lt;/a&gt; — he&amp;#39;s also a world-class moron. He&amp;#39;s just written a &lt;a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/what-kind-of-world-do-we-want-to-live-in/story-e6frf7jo-1225845501207"&gt;long and mostly incoherent complaint about atheists&lt;/a&gt; for the Herald Sun, a cheesy tabloid in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s the football — they play without the heavy armor American footballers wear, so maybe he&amp;#39;s got brain damage. After all, &lt;a href="http://www.youngausskeptics.com/2010/03/atheist-convention-causes-gary-abletts-head-to-implode/"&gt;Jason Ball wrote a nice rebuttal&lt;/a&gt;, and he's Australian, too, so it's obviously not a Southern Hemisphere epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Jason has addressed most of the silly claims of this poor pious twit, I'll just mention one thing that caught my eye: the recycled fatuity so common to creationists. Ablett makes an old argument against evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's take another example. Evolution teaches that matter plus energy (light or heat) plus time equals biogenesis, the cause of new life.

Yet our entire food industry relies on the fact that the evolutionary formula doesn't work. For example, if you take a jar of peanut butter (matter), expose it to light and heat (energy) and add time you will never get new life (biogenesis) in that jar. And are we grateful about that! Why is new life impossible in a sealed jar? Because we are missing the most important aspect: information.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The very reason food is sealed is to keep information out, it's only if and when the seal is broken that a contamination can occur because information has got inside the jar! We need to take this fact very seriously because in the food industry this experiment is conducted over a billion times a year collectively, and has been doing so for more than a hundred years, which proves that the absence of information renders life impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that sound familiar? It should. It's practically verbatim from this quaint exhibition of stupidity by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Missler"&gt;Chuck Missler&lt;/a&gt; (also, not from Australia or New Zealand — he&amp;#39;s an Idahoan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/FZFG5PKw504%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No scientist gives much credibility to the ancient Peanut Butter Earth hypothesis. We suspect that life arose in a chemically active watery environment, not a big brown glop of concentrated fats and proteins in a jar in the Archaean. We're also not surprised that life doesn't spontaneously arise everywhere anymore: conditions on Earth are very different from those in the abiotic/early biotic period, and what's more, any new life that arose now, improbable as that is, would face a world populated by bacteria with 4 billion years of evolutionary refinement behind them. So it's a very, very stupid argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of Ablett&amp;#39;s arguments are just as inane, and are similarly ripped off almost literally from common creationist canards. There&amp;#39;s nothing original and nothing intelligent anywhere in it — it&amp;#39;s just sad how feeble these guys are getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly and entirely unsurprisingly, &lt;a href="http://buggery.org/2010/03/26/if-gary-ablett-is-the-product-of-intelligent-design-ill-be-a-monkeys-uncle/"&gt;big chunks of Ablett's article were plagiarized&lt;/a&gt;. It seems like most of their stuff can be traced back to a small population of ur-creationists in the 1960s, and there brains have been locked up solid ever since.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/ablett_couldnt_even_translate.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/hV6dkXMxLRU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269574706020"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/are_you_as_horrified_by_this_a.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2cb84c8cf6c90230</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">Are you as horrified by this as I am?

But it seems that of late, I find myself defending the religious. In particular, skeptics who don’t call themselves atheists or agnostics. Indeed, there are several people within the skeptical community who are deists or theists or even (GASP) Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Daniel_Loxton/status/10989782766"&gt;re-tweeted a message&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/"&gt;Daniel Loxton&lt;/a&gt; referencing Hal Bidlack, who is an active skeptic and a good man. Hal is usually the MC for The Amaz!ng Meeting in Las Vegas and a shining example of a skeptical activist and a proponent of science, education and critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is also a deist as he explains in &lt;a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/skepticality/057_skepticality.mp3"&gt;this episode of Skepticality&lt;/a&gt; from 2007.  You should listen to it, but be warned: you’ll probably cry. It made me cry the first time I heard it at TAM 4 and it made me cry again in the car on the way to work this morning when I listened to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some skeptics, the idea of a non-atheistic skeptic poses a huge problem.  Atheism is, they say, the logical end result of skepticism.  Why should we give religion a ‘pass’ when we stand against all other forms of pseudoscience and non-critical thinking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why indeed.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;We all know that religion addresses some of the biggest questions that human beings face. What happens when we die? What is my purpose in life? Where am I going and how do I fit into this world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always said that Atheism will never become the prevalent belief system in the world simply because we have a terrible marketing message: There is no God and nothing happens when you die.  I personally take this as call to arms, to do all I can with the precious time I have and I find that message to be pretty inspiring. But you know what I mean.  Religion has a much softer, nicer, more appealing message and we need to understand that some people will prefer to believe in that message. I’m a big believer in diplomacy and tact, particularly when dealing with such huge, life altering questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, when I posted the link to Hal’s talk, @Data_Jack posed this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine this: A group of sincere psychics show up to TAM each year, and strongly agree w/us that homeo &amp;amp; alt med are woo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His question was, would it be OK for one of them to MC TAM? This question actually gave me pause. Was I being too ‘accommodating’? Of course I wouldn’t want Sylvia Browne to MC TAM (although I would pay good money to see her try).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a big difference between a practicing psychic and a deist.  Hal freely admits that his beliefs are not rational.  He understands that they exist outside his skeptical world view.  Hal doesn’t try to put his worldview or belief system forward as being true or real or scientific. He makes no claims that are testable and if he does, he knows that it is free game for his friends in the skeptical community to question them and ask for evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that this is the key difference. A psychic would be making a claim to a power; something that could actually be tested and proven to be right or wrong.  Hal and other religious skeptics are simply saying that they have faith and a belief in something else. They don’t claim to be right or demand that we agree with them. They simply want to hold on to a belief that brings them happiness and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings are not completely rational beings. We strive so hard as skeptics to act on the evidence but as skeptics, we need to understand that reality makes it impossible for any human to always act completely skeptical in everything we do.  If every person who called him/herself a skeptic acted completely rationally 100% of the time, there would be no skeptics who smoked or got drunk. No skeptics would eat french fries or be overweight!  We know, rationally, logically, that these things are bad for us. The evidence is clear that smoking puts you at a higher risk for cancer and yet, plenty of people who call themselves skeptics go ahead and light up every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does that make them less of a skeptic? A hypocrite? Less intelligent? Would you stop a smoker from MC-ing TAM?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not.  It simply makes them human. Taking comfort or pleasure in a glass of wine or a cigarette is simply that – finding comfort in something we rationally know isn’t ‘good for us’. I don’t see how that is any different from someone who prays because it makes them feel better. Or believes there is a higher power because it helps give them some perspective about where they stand in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying that when we see religion doing harm that we shouldn’t speak out. When the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/03/the-pope-ignored-child-rape-the-pope/"&gt;Pope ignores child molestation&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href="http://afghanistan.blogs.cnn.com/2010/03/18/shaming-her-in-laws-costs-19-year-old-her-nose-ears/"&gt;women are oppressed in the name of religion&lt;/a&gt;, when religious organizations try to blur the lines between church and state from a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/11/us/politics/11texas.html"&gt;legal or educational&lt;/a&gt; perspective, the skeptics MUST stand up and call them out. And if a person of faith (skeptic or otherwise) attempts to make a claim that is based on religion, it is absolutely our duty as skeptics to question it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a religious person is not automatically an enemy of critical thinking or the scientific method. If someone decides to put aside rationality and believe in a higher power at an emotional level, it is unfair to say that this precludes them from being a skeptic. Unfortunately, what I see is a lot of atheists who say that any spiritual belief is simply bad thinking. Skeptics with faith are therefore often treated with condescension and considered stupid at best, hypocritical at worst. They are the black sheep of the skeptic family, tucked out of sight when company comes over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of black and white arguing could tear the skeptical movement apart. We have few enough troops in this war and far too many important battles to fight.  The next time you worry that someone identifying as a skeptic may actually talking to an invisible person in the sky, perhaps you should put things into perspective.

	&lt;p&gt;Art Gallery of NSW - Tim Minchin by Sam Leach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Well done to Sam Leach, with his great portrait of a local skeptical-legend, Tim Minchin! &lt;a href="http://www.thearchibaldprize.com.au/"&gt;The Archibald Prize&lt;/a&gt; is is one of Australia’s oldest and most prestigious art awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Sam Leach says he approached Minchin ‘primarily because I really like his style of comedy. The topics he deals with – social commentary, the appeal to reason over religion and that kind of thing – tie in with my work. But in a funny way I also see my career reflected in his. His career is much bigger than mine but we became successful in our fields almost simultaneously and our first and second children were also born about the same time.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leach met Minchin in London last year when he was exhibiting work in a group show at Bedfordbury Gallery, Covent Garden. They talked about a portrait and Minchin suggested Leach portray him crucified on a neon Perspex cross. ‘But I don’t know if that’s my style,’ says Leach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;They had a day together at Minchin’s London home where Leach did sketches then caught up again in Melbourne during Minchin’s current tour, Ready for This. ‘I wanted a full-length portrait because he does use his whole body when he performs. It’s him in his house so there are a few personal pointers, like the baby’s lamb skin.’”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leach beat 34 finalists and a record number of entries for the $50,000 prize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ooh, my much-loved Digital Cuttlefish has commemorated my work  in verse, again – &lt;a href="http://digitalcuttlefish.blogspot.com/2010/03/sceptics-circle-24-march-2010.html"&gt;Skeptic’s Circle out at their site now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I’m reading – ‘&lt;a href="http://justinelarbalestier.com/blog/2010/03/25/a-question-for-you-my-dear-readers/comment-page-1/#comment-88833"&gt;A Question for You My Dear Readers&lt;/a&gt;‘ over at Justine Larbalestier’s site, the author of ‘Liar Liar’. It’s raising (again…) &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2010/03/the_writing_style_of_twilight.html?sc=fb&amp;amp;cc=fp"&gt;this discussion of &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on NPR in which ‘much mock is made of the writing style of &lt;em&gt;Twlight&lt;/em&gt;.’ See what you think of the comments, figure out your own views on the matter. Oh, the post I refer to in my comment is called “&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2008/12/skeptics-should-support-reading-to-a-twilight-hating-teen/"&gt;Skeptics Should Support Reading&lt;/a&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald challenges astrology with ‘&lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/gullibility-is-written-in-the-stars-20100325-qzc3.html"&gt;Gullibility is written in the stars&lt;/a&gt;‘:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a case before the Bombay High Court at the moment seeking a ban on astrology, along with a host of other new age practices such as reiki, feng shui, tarot and palmistry, on the basis that they are not science. Here in Australia, it is staggering to see how sympathetic we still are towards new age fluff such as horoscopes. Are people really so gullible and desperate for direction that they consult these vague, boring predictions that were declared back in 1975 by 186 leading astronomers and physicists (including 18 Nobel prize winners) as having “no verified scientific basis”?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Out of curiosity, I decided to compile various horoscope readings on a single day from a range of media sites to see if there was any internal consistency to astrological readings. The inconsistencies were laugh-out-loud silly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally – &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://sunbury-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/hume-councillor-absent-for-prayer-time/"&gt;Hume councillor absent for prayer time:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I don’t come to council to have prayers laid on me. I object to having an external person lay his faith on me.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It is difficult to avoid the observation that, whenever believers give advice to atheists on how to run our movement, it is always in the direction of telling us to be more quiet, to tone it down, to be less confrontational and less visible. I have yet to see a believer advise the atheist movement to speak up more loudly and more passionately; to make our arguments more compelling and more unanswerable; to get in people’s faces more about delicate and thorny issues that they don’t want to think about; to not be afraid of offending people if we think we’re right. I have received a great deal of advice from believers on how atheists should run our movement… and it is always, always, always in the direction of politely suggesting that we shut up.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It's great to see such a staunch champion of the teaching of evolution, and of embryonic stem cell research, winning this award. There is no better demonstration, I think, that science and religion don't have to be at war all the time--for after all, Ayala is also a former  priest and has been exceedingly prominent in making the argument against the problematic "conflict thesis."

Meanwhile, those who embrace that thesis, and dislike the Templeton Foundation, will still have a hard time saying anything bad about Ayala, I would imagine.

In addition to fighting doggedly in defense of evolution, his scientific credentials include winning the National Medal of Science and serving as president and chairman of the board of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In congratulating Ayala, the National Center for Science Education adds:
Among his contributions to the defense of the integrity of science education was his testimony for the plaintiffs in McLean v. Arkansas and his coordination of support for evolution education at the National Academy of Sciences, including his lead authorship of the publication Science, Evolution, and Creationism (National Academies Press, 2008).

I have some reservations about it, because one thing scientists aren’t, is secretive. We talk about what we do constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, they have a series of short videos about teen astronomer &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Moore"&gt;Caroline Moore&lt;/a&gt;, who recently discovered a rare type of supernova. She found this supernova, by the way, when she was 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also &lt;a href="http://www-tc.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/secretlife/site_media/video/CM_10questions_FINAL_512x288-PJPEG-Prepro.mp4"&gt;asked her 10 questions&lt;/a&gt;, and while I might disagree with her choice of a news source, I think it’s great that they let her be her, and she shines right through in these videos.

If that sounds like a stretch, consider that VigilantCitizen.com has raked in over 1,300 comments on its conspiratorial &lt;a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/?p=3423"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of “Telephone.” Hundreds of thousands of people have likely read it, and perhaps many believed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vigilant Citizen’s warning to America is that Gaga and other singers have been given the full Manchurian-Candidate treatment under the CIA’s “Monarch Program” and unleashed on pop culture to rep the devil-worshipping Illuminati. The wider goal of the conspiracy remains hazy, but it has to do with seducing and softening up the &lt;em&gt;hoi polloi &lt;/em&gt;with a mind-controlling pageantry of outrageous sex, decadence, murder, madness, and technological excess — all elements in “Telephone” and preparatory ingredients in a transhumanist, authoritarian New World Order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s backtrack. What is this CIA “Monarch Program”? Vigilant Citizen talks about it as if it’s a well-established fact. Curious and unwilling to put anything past the CIA, I went in search of credible sources testifying to its existence. But the whole notion of the program originates with one woman named &lt;a href="http://www.trance-formation.com/"&gt;Cathy O’Brien&lt;/a&gt; and I wouldn’t call her credible. I would call her batty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Monarch Program” is a figment of O’Brien’s “recovered memories.” The inducement of such memories, almost always fabricated, was a fad in the 1980s, and fueled that decade’s satanic sex abuse scare. Michael Barkun, in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Culture-Conspiracy-Apocalyptic-Contemporary-Comparative/dp/0520238052"&gt;Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; writes that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;O’Brien was hypnotized by her husband and began recalling her brainwashing under the Monarch Program and subsequent work as a CIA drug smuggler and sex-slave to George H.W. Bush and Hillary Clinton. The claims were so outlandish that her critics included the late Jim Keith, an originator of the black-helicopter conspiracy theory, and the author of &lt;em&gt;Saucers of the Illuminati&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Casebook on the Men in Black&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Culture of Conspiracy &lt;/em&gt;notes that a Ufologist investigated O’Brien’s story with an open mind and gave up after finding her accusations “never came backed with hard evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t mean to imply the CIA hasn’t tried controlling people’s minds or programming them. It has. You needn’t look any further than &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKULTRA"&gt;Project MKULTRA&lt;/a&gt; for proof of that. But Vigilant Citizen stakes its Gaga theory on the existence of a separate, unsubstantiated CIA conspiracy that’s been dismissed as improbable by the black-helicopter people — and for that the website loses all credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interesting than the question of Lady Gaga’s dark history with the CIA is that of Vigilant Citizen’s popularity. How to explain it? The easy answer is that conspiracy theorists have always been around. But there’s no denying we live in especially paranoid times, and Vigilant Citizen’s popularity is helped by the fact that an oligopoly controls the airwaves – raising perhaps legitimate concerns that content is being screened and manipulated by a small cadre of record executives. It also helps that Lady Gaga’s music is unprecedented and provocative — and that she’s thrown red meat to the conspiracy theorists by, for instance, posing in a Masonic temple wearing &lt;a href="http://www.crawdaddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/gagaaa.jpg"&gt;Hello Kitty dolls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I admit with no reluctance that Vigilant Citizen is an entertaining read and makes astute points here and there. The website was somewhat correct in linking Gaga with Fritz Lang’s &lt;em&gt;Metropolis&lt;/em&gt;, the dystopian sci-fi film from Weimar Germany. She derived her name from “Radio Gaga,” a Queen song whose &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBUr1pSWTVI"&gt;promotional video&lt;/a&gt; was set in &lt;em&gt;Metropolis&lt;/em&gt;. And she’s posed for a photo shoot &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://seeker401.wordpress.com/2009/12/21/lady-gaga-invokes-metropolis-for-new-photo-shoot/"&gt;(caution: graphic)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in a robot outfit, scaling skyscrapers with a Zeppelin and sprawled naked bodies in the background, leaving no doubt that she’s fashioned herself after Weimar modernism. That fact itself is a riddle of the zeitgeist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe the deeper meaning in Vigilant Citizen’s popularity is that music — and I mean everything from the marches of John Phillips Souza to Elvis’s alleycat yowls to Lady Gaga’s androidal croon — is moving and terrifying, a force of nature as well as a reflector and creator of culture. If the Puritans ascribed to music occult, evil, and paranormal properties, so do some modern Americans. Vigilant Citizen speaks for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s true! At least based on the principles of homeopathy it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick homeoprimer: Homeopathy is medicine based on the idea that like cures like. If something is causing you to be ill, that same thing will cause your body to get better if you take it in small doses. It’s not all &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; crazy at this point. I mean, that’s what a vaccine is – curing mumps by giving a child a very very small dose of mumps for his body to fight off. But homeopathy requires the doses to be even smaller than what you get in a vaccine. And the smaller the dose, the stronger the medication. I know, that makes no sense! But homeopaths aren’t ridiculously stupid… see, while you’re diluting, you have to also &lt;em&gt;shake&lt;/em&gt; the remedy. It’s the agitation that makes it stronger. Now it makes sense, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So based on this, I made a huge mistake! There are some coins in the bottom of my washing machine. I’ve left them there for a month, not even thinking about it! So now I’ve got money + lots of water + an automatic agitator and it’s being applied to the pockets of my family’s pants! I just used money to cure money! Now I’ll never get a job!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to start washing overdraft statements. And maybe slip some narcissus flowers into my kid’s sippy cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you could cure any mundane problem using homeopathy what would you cure and what would you use to cure it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I don't quite get it; this is money the government is disbursing to encourage jobs for the sake of jobs, and if they were hiring people to dig holes and fill them in again, it would accomplish their task. However, the money is being spent sensibly on projects that also improve the nation's infrastructure in small ways and increase knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the targets of their scorn are science projects, including this one, improving the facilities at an insect collection in Michigan. You might not want to watch this if Hannity and Tucker Carlson make you gag, but the scientist in charge, Anthony Cognato, does a good job of making his case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/m7f52y4Nq4E%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad guys are really reaching here. Carlson tries to imply that they didn&amp;#39;t need the money, that all they had to do was stick the &amp;#39;bugs&amp;#39; in a refrigerator, but that doesn&amp;#39;t work — this is a working collection, you can&amp;#39;t just archive them away in a deep freeze, and storing a million-specimen collection in a bank of -80° freezers would be rather substantially more expensive than putting in more effective shelving. &lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/templates/trackable/display/news.jsp?type=news&amp;amp;o_url=news/display/57258&amp;amp;id=57258"&gt;Cognato addressed this&lt;/a&gt; (that link is behind a paywall, sorry):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interview began and Carlson transformed into an effective pundit for the Right; the questioning was quick, the topics a little disconnected, and at times he seemed to fish for a particular sound bite that would support the opinion that funding the collection was a waste of money. For example, he asked me a couple times if I could have controlled collection pests by just continually freezing the drawers that contain the specimens, thus making our purchase of new storage cabinets unnecessary. I answered repeatedly that freezing our thousands of drawers was not optimal for long-term preservation, that it drained time and resources, and kept researchers from using the collection for scientific studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they try to suggest that all the $200,000 did was to hire a few students at $8/hour, which is not true: those students weren't in charge of building shelves. That was a professional job from a company called &lt;a href="http://www.bioquip.com/PreHome.asp"&gt;BioQuip&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My﻿ job is one of the many that were affected by this grant. I work for BioQuip, the California company that manufactures the drawers that MSU bought. Our company employs 27 people whose jobs were all affected by this grant as well as the lumber company, glass company &amp;amp; trucking companies we use along the way. This grant has benefited the US economy, created &amp;amp; maintained US jobs on a level far greater than 4 jobs at a single university. Hannity &amp;amp; Carlson need to do their homework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the Right doesn't see this. &lt;a href="http://hannity.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/03/10/web-exclusive-full-interview/"&gt;Read the comments on Hannity's site about this subject&lt;/a&gt;: it's &lt;i&gt;insane&lt;/i&gt;. Most of the people are ranting about Pelosi and Obama with no connection at all to the topic of the video…except for the weird Cyrillic comments (Russian spam of some sort?).&lt;/p&gt;

The Prize celebrates no particular faith tradition or notion of God, but rather the quest for progress in humanity’s efforts to comprehend the many and diverse manifestations of the Divine." In other words, it's a prize of £1,000,000 sterling for the best accommodationist. The National Center for Science Education has just posted an official press release praising the winner of this religious prize [&lt;a href="http://ncse.com/news/2010/03/ayala-wins-templeton-prize-005389"&gt;Ayala wins the Templeton Prize&lt;/a&gt;.] &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's up with that? What does tying to understand God have to do with science education? I don't know if NCSE makes a habit of issuing press releases for this sort of thing. Does anyone know if they've posted official press releases for the winners of the Richard Dawkins Award given out by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist_Alliance_International"&gt;Atheist Alliance International&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In case there was ever any doubt, NCSE publicity supports the position that science and religion are compatible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's the full press release ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;NCSE congratulates Francisco J. Ayala on winning the Templeton Prize. The prize, worth about $1.5 million, is awarded annually by the John Templeton Foundation to "a living person who has made exceptional contributions to affirming life's spiritual dimension." A March 25, 2010, press release from the Foundation highlighted  Ayala's vigorous opposition to "the entanglement of science and religion while also calling for mutual respect between the two," saying, "Even as he has warned against religion’s intrusion into science, Ayala, a former Dominican priest, also champions faith as a unique and important window to understanding matters of purpose, values and the meaning of life." Ayala told the Los Angeles Times (March 25, 2010) that he regarded the award as honoring his scientific work and its "very important consequence of making people accept science, and making people accept evolution in particular."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his essay "Science and religion: Conflict or dialogue?" posted on the Washington Post's On Faith blog (March 25, 2010), Ayala sketched his views on science and religion, writing, "Science and religious beliefs need not be in contradiction. If they are properly understood, they cannot be in contradiction, because science and religion concern different matters. ... The proper relationship between science and religion can be, for people of faith, mutually motivating and inspiring. ... As I see it, scientific knowledge is consistent with a religious belief in God. More so than the 'creationists[']' assertion that everything in the world has been precisely designed by the Creator. Because, then, how to account for human crimes and sins (including the Biblical Fall) and for all the catastrophes that pervade the natural world?" His Darwin's Gift to Science and Religion (Joseph Henry Press, 2009) presents his views in greater detail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Supporter of NCSE since its founding, Ayala is University Professor, the Donald Bren Professor of Biological Sciences, and Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Irvine; he received the National Medal for Science, the nation's highest award for lifetime achievement in scientific research, in 2002. Among his contributions to the defense of the integrity of science education was his testimony for the plaintiffs in McLean v. Arkansas and his coordination of support for evolution education at the National Academy of Sciences, including his lead authorship of the publication Science, Evolution, and Creationism (National Academies Press, 2008). NCSE's executive director Eugenie C. Scott commented, "Ayala's contributions to NCSE and its goal of defending the teaching of evolution in the public schools are comparable to his contributions to biology in general: immense."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-2047965614174577216?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269545252160"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=22777">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/19e64bf97e9cb1f5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Jesse Galef"/><title type="html">CFI Blog Tilts at Windmills</title><published>2010-03-25T19:00:39Z</published><updated>2010-03-25T19:00:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/25/cfi-blog-tilts-at-windmills/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;by Jesse Galef -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;float:right;width:300px;height:255px" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3299/3503448168_7cfb49b975.jpg" alt=""&gt;I’ll admit to being confused and disappointed by &lt;strong&gt;Michael De Dora Jr.&lt;/strong&gt;’s post on the CFI blog last week entitled “&lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/the_problems_with_the_atheistic_approach_to_the_world/P50/"&gt;The Problems with the Atheistic Approach to the World&lt;/a&gt;.”  I’ve met Michael a couple of times and like him a lot, and I’ve found myself both &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/12/16/skepticism-and-atheism/"&gt;agreeing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/01/19/a-defense-of-secular-government/"&gt;disagreeing&lt;/a&gt; with him in the past.  Not only is he Executive Director of CFI-NYC, he’s also a new co-blogger on &lt;a href="http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/"&gt;Rationally Speaking&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;Massimo Pigliucci&lt;/strong&gt; and my sister, &lt;strong&gt;Julia Galef&lt;/strong&gt;.  Clearly, he’s in esteemed company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But reading his recent post left me scratching my head.  I wasn’t quite sure where to begin responding, and a question kept popping up in my mind: who or what, exactly, is he talking about?   Nowhere does Michael actually address the “Atheistic Approach to the World,” as the title implies he would.  His criticism spans “the radical atheists” to the very label “atheist” to &lt;strong&gt;Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;PZ&lt;/strong&gt;’s tone.   More often that not, his target is a strawman – such as the assertion that atheists “tend to think” religion is the only problem in the world.  As I read, I kept thinking: “Well, yes, that view would certainly be a problem – if anyone in the world held it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t go through point by point – &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Coyne&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/20/weekend-accommodationism/"&gt;already did so&lt;/a&gt; with his characteristic fervor.  Instead, I’ll try to get to one key source of disagreement: who the new/radical atheists are.  I’ve selected a couple quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, an issue that received less focus was a more strategic one: the fact that many atheists define their entire lives around unbelief and critique of theism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[A]theists tend to view religion as either the problem, or the cause of the problem, even when other problems are apparent. But while theism is a problem, it is not the problem, and while atheism might be correct, atheism is not the answer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I surely disagree with atheists who hold those views.  But… they don’t exist.  You won’t find a single person who “defines their entire [life] around unbelief and critique of theism,” or anyone who thinks religion is the only problem in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is Michael’s view of the atheistic approach to life, no wonder he’s against it!  In his post, he portrays it as needlessly divisive, full of arrogance, and stubbornly refusing to address topics other than theism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atheist approach to the world is just fine – as part of the picture.  It isn’t, in itself, all there is to life.  But that’s true of any label.  What makes the ‘atheist’ label so valuable is that it serves as an underlying foundation for growth in many different directions.  There are atheists who are also skeptics, humanists, or just plain members of their community – but they’re all united in caring only for secular concerns.  That’s an important step forward.  Beyond that, every atheist brings his or her own interests and passions to the world – as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every atheist who pushes back against dogma and theistic belief is doing it for some reason: we do it because we care about children’s mental and medical health, we care about science education, we care about research, we care about politics, we care about ending discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a discussion to be had about what tone is most effective in achieving our myriad goals.  For the record, I’m a big fan of &lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2010/02/what-can-the-atheist-movement-learn-from-the-gay-movement.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greta Christina&lt;/strong&gt;’s view&lt;/a&gt; that a movement takes all sorts – let the firebrands be firebrands and let the diplomats be diplomats.  There’s also a discussion to be had about how we should label ourselves.  But in order to include those topics, perhaps Michael’s title should have been: “The Problems with Having Only an Atheistic Approach to the World: Why We Should Do More and be More Polite When We Talk About It.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Update]:&lt;/strong&gt; Michael’s &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/a_response_to_criticism_of_the_problems_with_the_atheistic_approach_to_the_/"&gt;response to comments&lt;/a&gt; on his post went up earlier today, after I’d written this.  He admits to framing his post poorly and being unclear, and tries to address some of the criticisms.  I’ll put up my thoughts tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

What&amp;#39;s not clear is whether turning to religion actually helps to relieve anxiety.Even less well understood is which, if any, aspects of religion are effective. Does the social support that comes with attending religious meetings help, or some other religious activity, or is it some facet of belief itself?Terrence Hill, at the University of Miami, and colleagues have looked at this using data from the US General Social Survey. Basically, they were looking to see what aspects of religion correlated with anxiety (health warning: these are just correlations. The effect could go either way).Unfortunately they don&amp;#39;t tell us whether religious people are more or less anxious than the general population. But they do show that, after correcting for other factors that can affect anxiety (gender, wealth, ethnicity, etc), more religious people are a little bit less anxious(Even after including a number of demographic factors in their model, including religion, they could still only explain about 12% of the variation in anxiety between people - so clearly the major causes of anxiety lie elsewhere.)What they found was that church attendance was linked to a very small reduction in anxiety. Belief in the afterlife was linked to a somewhat larger reduction.However, people who believe that human nature is fundamentally perverse and corrupt (as opposed to basically good) tended to be slightly more anxious.With prayer, the results were more complex. What they found, first of all, was that people who prayed more often were neither more nor less anxious than people who don&amp;#39;t pray.Digging a bit further, they found that prayer has different effects in different people. In people who have poor health, or whose finances have recently worsened, prayer significantly decreased anxiety. In people without these problems, prayer was linked to more anxiety.There was a similar interaction with belief in the afterlife and financial decline. Remarkably, however, belief in the afterlife did not reduce anxiety more in people whose health was poor. Perhaps they were not looking forward to meeting their maker!On a more serious note, this supports other evidence which suggests that religious beliefs are particularly valued by people looking for support in this world, rather than by hopes for a happy afterlife.Ellison CG, Burdette AM, &amp;amp; Hill TD (2009).

He recently had to take some kind of test with a group of other players, and this is &lt;a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/03/23/tebows-pre-wonderlic-prayer-request-falls-flat/"&gt;what happened&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Scouting Combine, the Wonderlic exam is administered to players in groups.  The 12-minute test is preceded by some brief instructions and comments from the person administering the test.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Per a league source, after the person administering the test to Tebow's group had finished, Tebow made a request that the players bow their heads in prayer before taking the 50-question exam.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Said one of the other players in response:  "Shut the f--k up."  Others players in the room then laughed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of people are getting fed up with the excessive piety, and I'm glad some are speaking out. Tebow wants to pray, fine; Tebow wants to drag others into his delusion, fire back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, Tebow got a 22 out of 50 on the test. I had to look up this Wonderlic test — it seems to be a &lt;a href="http://walterfootball.com/draftwonderlic.php"&gt;remarkably trivial 'intelligence' test&lt;/a&gt; of the sort you might see in a grade school, I would think. "When rope is selling at $.10 a foot, how many feet can you buy for sixty cents?" and "A boy is 16 years old and his sister is twice as old. When the boy is 22 years old, what will be the age of his sister?", that sort of thing, nothing that requires any reasoning beyond elementary algebra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm shocked that a grown man could get below 50% on this thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/tim_tebow_gets_a_lesson.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/dRGI8GSIJAY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269543848363"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-6644982665100487622">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/05a2144cf0143c2e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Francisco Ayala Wins Templeton Prize</title><published>2010-03-25T18:44:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-25T18:44:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2010/03/francisco-ayala-wins-templeton-prize.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/S6uz-v3hl0I/AAAAAAAAKgw/FXQJY1lEMf4/s1600/tmp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:320px;height:320px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/S6uz-v3hl0I/AAAAAAAAKgw/FXQJY1lEMf4/s400/tmp.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Francisco Ayala has won this year's &lt;a href="http://www.templetonprize.org/currentwinner.html"&gt;Templeton Prize&lt;/a&gt;. It's a very wise political choice on the part of the Templeton Foundation since Ayala is a top notch evolutionary biologist and a vocal opponent of Intelligent Design Creationism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The announcement was made at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington D.C. A few year ago, Ayala chaired the committee that product the NAS booklet on &lt;i&gt;Science, Evolution, and Creationism&lt;/i&gt;. That book made the case for science and it also made the case for accommodationism—something that NAS should have avoided. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's a repeat of a posting I made on January 4, 2008. It explains why science organizations get into trouble when they try to support some religions and not others. They should be neutral.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/R35nVTyn1zI/AAAAAAAAENU/CoOCDkZpXC4/s1600-h/tmp.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/R35nVTyn1zI/AAAAAAAAENU/CoOCDkZpXC4/s320/tmp.gif" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The National Academies (Science, Engineering, Medicine) (USA) have just published their latest book on the evolution/creationism controversy. You can download it for free on their website [&lt;a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11876#toc"&gt;Science, Evolution and Creationism&lt;/a&gt;]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like the previous versions, this one is quite well done. It explains evolutionary concepts correctly and gives clear examples of the evidence supporting the &lt;i&gt;fact&lt;/i&gt; of evolution. The book—actually a large pamphlet—describes the various forms of creationism and why they are rejected by science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was troubled by one part of the book describing the compatibility of science and religion. It's only two paragraphs plus three pages of quotations but it promotes the fallacy of the &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/01/changing-your-mind-are-science-and.html"&gt;Doctrine of Joint Belief&lt;/a&gt;. This fallacy makes a virtue out of compartmentalization. It says that because scientist X is religious, it follows that religion and science are compatible. Similarly, because religious leader Y, accepts evolution, it follows that science and religion are not in conflict.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While preparing to blog about this fallacy, my daughter Jane alerted me to a piece in today's &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/04/us/04evolve.html?_r=1&amp;amp;oref=slogin"&gt;Evolution Book Sees No Science-Religion Gap&lt;/a&gt;]. The article in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; is written by Cornelia Dean who has previously written about the compatibility of science and religion [&lt;a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/God-And-Science23aug05.htm"&gt;Scientists Speak Up on Mix of God and Science&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;In today's article, Cornelia Dean briefly reviews &lt;i&gt;Science, Evolution and Creationism&lt;/i&gt;. She says,&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this volume is unusual, people who worked on it say, because it is intended specifically for the lay public and because it devotes much of its space to explaining the differences between science and religion, and asserting that acceptance of evolution does not require abandoning belief in God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 70-page book, “Science, Evolution and Creationism,” says, among other things, that “attempts to pit science and religion against each other create controversy where none needs to exist.” And it offers statements from several eminent biologists and members of the clergy to support the view.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I think it's unfortunate that the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; article places so much emphasis on this part of the book but the authors of the book&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; must have known what they were doing. Too bad they were misguided.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's what they wrote in &lt;i&gt;Science, Evolution and Creationism&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acceptance of the evidence for evolution&lt;br&gt;can be compatible with religious faith.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, many religious denominations accept that biological evolution has produced the diversity of living things over billions of years of Earth’s history. Many have issued statements observing that evolution and the tenets of their faiths are compatible. Scientists and theologians have written eloquently about their awe and wonder at the history of the universe and of life on this planet, explaining that they see no conflict between their faith in God and the evidence for evolution. Religious denominations that do not accept the occurrence of evolution tend to be those that believe in strictly literal interpretations of religious texts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Science and religion are based on different aspects of human experience. In science, explanations must be based on evidence drawn from examining the natural world. Scientifically based observations or experiments that conflict with an explanation eventually must lead to modification or even abandonment of that explanation. Religious faith, in contrast, does not depend only on empirical evidence, is not necessarily modified in the face of conflicting evidence, and typically involves supernatural forces or entities. Because they are not a part of nature, supernatural entities cannot be investigated by science. In this sense, science and religion are separate and address aspects of human understanding in different ways. Attempts to pit science and religion against each other create controversy where none needs to exist.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;There are two fallacies here. The first one is the one I already alluded to (the Doctrine of Joint Belief). Just because you can find scientists and theologians who proclaim that evolution is compatible with religious faith doesn't make it so. You need to examine their understanding of evolution and also what they mean by "religious faith." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/R35l2zyn1xI/AAAAAAAAENE/mpFZwXEoqcE/s1600-h/Theistic_Evolution_Books.bmp"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/R35l2zyn1xI/AAAAAAAAENE/mpFZwXEoqcE/s400/Theistic_Evolution_Books.bmp" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As you might have guessed, the book trots out quotations from the usual suspects, Francis Collins and Kenneth Miller&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Their words of wisdom appear on a page with the title "Excerpts of Statements by Scientists Who See No Conflict Between Their Faith and Science." The book makes some amends, in my opinion, by including the following statement on that page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scientists, like people in other professions, hold a wide range of positions about religion and the role of supernatural forces or entities in the universe. Some adhere to a position known as scientism, which holds that the methods of science alone are sufficient for discovering everything there is to know about the universe. Others ascribe to an idea known as deism, which posits that God created all things and set the universe in motion but no longer actively directs physical phenomena. Others are theists, who believe that God actively intervenes in the world. Many scientists who believe in God, either as a prime mover or as an active force in the universe, have written eloquently about their beliefs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The good part about that statement is that it mentions deism, which is a form of religion where the conflict between science and religion really is minimized. The bad parts are that theists who promote interventionist Gods are touted as examples of those who see no conflict between science and religion. (The reason why Theistic Evolutionists don't "see" a conflict is because they choose to look the other way [&lt;a href="http://bioinfo.med.utoronto.ca/Evolution_by_Accident/Theistic_Evolution.html"&gt;Theistic Evolution: The Fallacy of the Middle Ground&lt;/a&gt;].)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other bad part is that atheists are equated with the philosophical position of scientism. That's an unnecessary complication. It would have been sufficient, and preferable, to state that many scientists do not believe in supernatural beings. They could have gone on to state that many of those non-believers see a conflict between science and the supernatural.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second fallacy in the two paragraphs quoted above is something I call the Fallacy of the Undetectable Supernatural. The authors of &lt;i&gt;Science, Evolution and Creationism&lt;/i&gt; repeat the silly argument that "supernatural entities cannot be investigated by science." Why not? The only kind of supernatural beings that could never be investigated by science are those that exist entirely as figments of the imagination and have absolutely no effect on the real world as we know it. As soon as your God intervenes in the real world his actions become amenable to scientific investigation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this, I agree with Stephen Jay Gould's description of Non-Overlapping Magisteria (NOMA). He states very clearly that religion violates NOMA as soon as it makes a claim for an interventionist God (Gould, 1999). In that case religion is no longer compatible with science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;The first commandment for all versions of NOMA might be summarized by stating: &amp;quot;Thou shalt not mix the magisteria by claiming that God directly ordains important events in the history of nature by special interference knowable only through revelation and not accessible to science.&amp;quot; In common parlance, we refer to such special interference as &amp;quot;miracle&amp;quot;—operationally defined as a unique and temporary suspension of natural law to reorder the facts of nature by divine fiat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                                    Stephen Jay Gould (1999) pp. 85-85&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The National Academies are violating NOMA unless they specifically refer to belief in Gods that do not perform miracles of any kind. There are very few religions that believe in non-interventionist Gods who never perform miracles. Therefore, it is much more scientifically accurate to say that science conflicts directly with almost all religious beliefs, including those of Ken Miller and Francis Collins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is an important error in &lt;i&gt;Science, Evolution and Creationism&lt;/i&gt; since Americans have a right to expect that the National Academies can define the proper magisterium of science. Instead, the National Academies, like NCSE, has taken the easy way out by redefining science as that field of study that is not in conflict with the religious views of Francis Collins and Ken Miller.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1.
