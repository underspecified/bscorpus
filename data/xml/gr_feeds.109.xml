&lt;p&gt;The Society’s &lt;a href="http://www.vertpaleo.org/video/WeAreSVP/index.cfm" rel="external "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
WE ARE SVP is a 33-minute video that tells the inside story of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology – who we are, what we do, and why our work is important for science and society.  The video is introduced and narrated by Sam Waterston, the long-time star of “LAW &amp;amp; ORDER.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the whole video is worthwhile, some of you may want to go straight to Chapter 4, “Evolution Vs. Creationism.”  It’s got Kevin Padian and more., Go ahead - &lt;a href="http://www.vertpaleo.org/video/WeAreSVP/index.cfm" rel="external "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you know you want to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Harvey Burnett about healing. Harvey assures me he and his church have the ability to heal via God and prayer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harvey states: “I have done that Harry. I have first hand experience of seeing some who the doctors had medically gave up on before believers gathered, prayed and God raised them up and or reversed their physical illness. In fact Harry, I have some people in my church that were medically diagnosed with cancer and in at least 1 case cancerous tumors. Those tumors no longer exist and cancer is either &lt;span&gt;inremission&lt;/span&gt; or cannot be found.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He further claims: “That's the problem with your thinking Harry, I cannot heal anyone...ONLY God can and that's the part that escapes you. So far as taking what seems to be an impossible situation and healing it, there have been credible testimonies gathered over the years for such &lt;span&gt;phenomea&lt;/span&gt; INCLUDING the regrowth and extension of limbs development of organs etc. in response to believing prayer.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here’s the problem with Harvey’s claim. There is no objective external proof that anything but random events and positive thinking did any healing. In light of the more positive Religious Atheist I’&lt;span&gt;ve&lt;/span&gt; debated here, our charismatic Pentecostal Christian, Harvey is at least attempting to make the Bible claims live today as much as it did 2,000 years ago even if our boat (God) that’s dead in the water appears to be acting, but which is in reality, is only drifting with the wind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, another commenter named David is more &lt;span&gt;inline&lt;/span&gt; with what I call a hard-core Religious Atheist. Like most Fundamental Baptist, he sees the New Testament miracles (called in Greek “Signs and Wonders”) some how as having officially ended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except for faith, David has only wishful thinking (or positive energy called prayer) to hope one is healed or God’s will is done. For me, David is less of a believer that Harvey and is left with only a god called Faith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To push my point, I took a stance in line with claims given by Jesus and the New Testament that “Signs and Wonders” are proofs of the truth early Christianity had over classical and stagnant paganism. David &lt;span&gt;emphaticly&lt;/span&gt; stated they had ended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harry: “Please quote me chapter and verse where the Bible states these gift have ended.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David replied: “No sir, your claim is under question here. Please quote me chapter and verse where the Bible states "signs and wonders" should still be manifest.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since I like case studies, I have posted below an event that happened at a local Baptist church. In order to prove that there are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Religious Atheist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; commenting here and that the ONLY thing they have is a god called FAITH, I want any Bible Believing Christians to explain in your apologetic defense, why God failed to act by either sending this rabid fox down the road to attack and bite the “debauched men and women” at the local strip club or, as Daniel in the Lions Den, protect these Christians as they cried out to God (or anyone else that would listen) for help!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My thesis is that, except for their god called Faith, their explanation will be just like the explanation of any secular person or what I now call &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Religious Atheist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fox Attacks Family Inside Church&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greenville&lt;/span&gt; News&lt;br&gt;Published: November 6, 2008&lt;br&gt;A fox attacked two adults and a 6-year-old child inside a &lt;span&gt;Spartanburg&lt;/span&gt; County church Wednesday evening, that’s according to the &lt;span&gt;Greenville&lt;/span&gt; News.&lt;br&gt;Other members of Liberty Baptist Church, on Bishop Road, were scratched by the fox as they tried to get the animal out of the church fellowship hall. The Rev. David Duncan said the attack occurred around 6:55 p.m. when his daughter, 20-year-old Alicia Duncan, opened the fellowship hall door. The fox jumped on her and bit her several times before biting another woman’s leg when the animal latched onto her ankle, he said.&lt;br&gt;The fox then went into the fellowship building and started attacking those inside, even as they used metal chairs to hit the fox, the pastor said. The animal went into the hallway of the church’s main building and back into the fellowship building before it was forced outside, under a car, where it later died.&lt;br&gt;Duncan said those who were bitten were treated at &lt;span&gt;Spartanburg&lt;/span&gt; Regional Medical Center.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Spartanburg&lt;/span&gt; County Environmental Enforcement Director Don Arnold said results to determine whether the animal was rabid will be available Friday.&lt;br&gt;Arnold urges those who live in the area to make sure all outdoor pets have been &lt;span&gt;innoculated&lt;/span&gt; against rabies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Up Date:&lt;br&gt;The local news tonight (11/07) confirmed the fox was rabid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I thought that in terms of the poetical qualities of the translation it was far superior to the anti-intellectual (as I perceived it) New International Version.  Even so, I owned both translations in Study Bible editions.  Both Bibles were replete with supplementary maps (Paul's journeys, The Miracles of Jesus, the route the Israelites took from Egypt to the Promised land, etc.) and special notes that made the books of the Bible more accessible.  I bought my New King James Version Bible (black, leather bound) for about 50 dollars at a Borders bookstore.  It was published by Thomas Nelson.  My New International Version, being merely a supplementary reference work, was just the 25 dollar paperback study bible published by Zondervan.  I used to enjoy comparing and contrasting verses in each Bible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part of my journey to atheism was coming to understand more clearly that my attitudes about the Bible were more the result of my exposure to Christian marketing and advertising than anything else.  When you read the article behind this link you will see that the Bible business is actually quite sophisticated:  http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/12/18/061218fa_fact1.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to develop, over a few posts, the following ideas, which I am presenting here in hopes that Christians and atheists will give me some specific feedback... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.  Christian businesses market goods and services that are useful to the pious/faithful lifestyle, e.g. businesses like Bible publishers, music distributors, church camps, foreign missions etc.  A christian company/business is judged by the quality of the products it puts out: products that affirm family values, preach an clear evangelical message, reinforce Christian beliefs and heritage. For example, look at this page:  http://www.cbaonline.org&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;2.  Bible publishing companies add value to the Bible by adding supplementary material to the text itself to make the Bible sell at a higher price.  They also present the Bible in various bindings to increase its selling price.  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;3.  In all of this we see nothing more than Business at work.  No god.  No Holy Spirit.  Through marketing, various businesses create a "christian" lifestyle, which the consumer can participate in by making specific purchases.  Charity itself is just another consumer activity, marketed and advertised, and christians tend to prefer certain sorts of charities over others.  For example, few fundamentalists or evangelicals see donations to Greenpeace or the Sierra Club or Amnesty International as being laudable, which is to say that donating to environmental charities is not part of the christian lifestyle, while donating to other charities, for example charities whose aim it is to ban condom distribution in public schools, is very much a pious/godly sort of giving. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;4.  The early growth of the church, and christianity's ultimate adoption as the official religion of the Roman empire, is usually taken by christians to be a proof of the power of god working to convert the world.  There was no way for early christians to understand the overall idea that in the marketplace of ideas, theirs was a successful brand.  Their success in finding converts was not a sign of god working through them.  Now that we understand the way in which brands are adopted and consumer choices define a lifestyle, we can see that the success of christians to find converts is no more special than the fact that Apple has been able to find a wide audience for the iPod.  There is no God at work here and never was.  There is a real business interest in expanding the Bible market. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;5.  There are a number of initiatives afoot in the christian world to send as many Bibles as possible to people in foreign countries.  These initiatives, like the International Bible Society/Send the Light, present people in foreign countries as "lacking" Bibles and entreat the christian to give money so that Bibles can be sent to those who urgently need them.  The Bibles that are sent are of course cheap mass produced copies.  They have the function of doing nothing more than creating a culture of students/consumers among the foreigners who receive them.  We make ourselves into their teachers, and then sell them christian products.  They become the market for our ever expanding christian businesses.  Eventually, they purchase nicer leather bound Bibles and other marketed items necessary for status in the christian lifestyle.  There is nothing particularly spiritual at work in these businesses, but it is absolutely essential to their business that they present themselves as particularly pious/faithful christians.  This is exactly the same sort of pose that Pagan idol makers must maintain in order to maintain the value of their products. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;6.  Christian marketers and christian consumers play off of each other to create an appearance all around of a genuine faith: they organize christian events and activities participation in which confirm your piety/faith which at the same time put you in the audience for marketing materials to reach you, your response to which proves your piety/faith.  This is not a sign of faith but rather Brand Loyalty. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;7.  The success of Mormons and Muslims to find converts completely undermines the christian's claim that something special is happening when a person responds to evangelism by adopting christianity, as we can now see that christianity is just another brand/lifestyle in the marketplace of spirituality. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;8.  Christian Bible publishers should stop selling Bibles.  There are enough Bibles printed now that all of the Bible needs of the world have been more than sufficiently met.  The Internet makes it possible to simply give the Bible away for free.  Christians could commit themselves to making it a reality that everyone on earth have access to the Internet, and then the Bible would be universally available for free.  There is no reason why each person needs to own a personal Bible.  They can be found online.  Why increase demand for Bibles through marketing?  Without marketing, demand for Bibles would decrease over time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's possible, even likely, that McCain campaign staffers are trying to make Palin the scapegoat for the failure of their candidate and them, but there's abundant other evidence that Palin was pretty ignorant about a great many things--far too ignorant to be a heartbeat away from the Presidency. Regardless of whether this report is true or not, that makes it easy for the knives to come out, now that the election's been lost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/sarah_palin_didnt_know_that_africa_was_a.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/446193565" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1226120662846"><id gr:original-id="http://draust.wordpress.com/?p=190">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/26e5a78051b3dc75</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Correct pronunciation - we old folk are particular about this</title><published>2008-11-07T23:07:51Z</published><updated>2008-11-07T23:07:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://draust.wordpress.com/2008/11/07/correct-pronunciation-we-old-folk-are-particular-about-this/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">In which Dr Aust starts worrying about the pismonunciation of worms

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good news: &lt;/strong&gt;The Geek Bonfire was awesomer the second time around.  Asking “What kind of geek are you?” started a whole discussion about potato chips and communism. (I’m guessing that’s a wonk geek.)  Thanks to hosts &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ginatrapani"&gt;Gina Trapani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/MitchWagner"&gt;Mitch Wagner&lt;/a&gt;,  especially the gallant Mitch, who hardly flinched when I told one too many TMI stories.  (Quick shout out to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/muteboy/"&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt;, my newest skeptical friend: congrats on 1A!!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad news: &lt;/strong&gt;All that smack talk about 11/13 DS SF, and I’m not even going to be there!  Worse, I’ll be &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; San Fran at a client meeting, but not out with the cool kids. (Not to say that you’re not cool, dear clients, if you happen to be reading here.  You’re totally cool.  Smart and good looking too.)  However, &lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/500-club-san-francisco"&gt;The 500 Club &lt;/a&gt;is the winner of the Drinking Skepchickally official SF hangout, and I encourage all of you who were going next Thursday to go anyway:  it seems to be a fun place, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3704#comment-37761"&gt;skepchicks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3704#comment-37688"&gt;will&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3704#comment-36763"&gt;abound&lt;/a&gt;, and it will prepare you for….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinking Skepchickally, San Francisco, Wednesday, December 10, 2008.  7:00pm.  The 500 Club&lt;/strong&gt;, this time with 100% more a.real.girl!!   This one will have a special guest or two, local to San Fran, who I’ll fill you in on when we get closer to the event.  Also, first round is on me for missing 11/13!  One local who won’t make it is my pal &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/malidragon"&gt;malidragon&lt;/a&gt;, as she’ll be heading down San Diego way that day.  To make it up to her, she suggested, and I agreed, that we simply must do:&lt;/p&gt;

Mali might have to be the one holding court, as I might be hanging from the night before, but it’s on: a Californian Drinking Skepchickally double header.  Anyone who shows up in San Diego who was with us in San Fran will have all their drinks paid for by yours truly.  (But, no, you can’t crash on my couch.)&lt;/p&gt;

It was from Kate Fisher, the marketing director of KKMS radio, a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/01/was_that_fun_or_what.php"&gt;Christian talk radio station I've dealt with before&lt;/a&gt;. They had a request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am with AM980 KKMS, a Christian Teaching &amp;amp; Talk radio station in the Twin Cities.  We would like to do a creation debate in mid-January.  I am writing today to check on your interest level in participating in something like this and if you are, what your availability and honorarium is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't have any problem making a decision on that, and immediately sent my reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, I had a debate on your station last January — in which I exposed the creationist on the other side as an ignorant fool. The response from your station was then to give the ignorant fool an hour to babble unopposed the next week. I&amp;#39;ll add that you also &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/01/standard_creationist_tactics_a.php"&gt;abruptly changed the topic of the debate&lt;/a&gt; an hour before I went on, at the request of my opponent, an unforgivable and sleazy tactic. I do not trust you at all, and I think you would abuse my participation to promote the lies of the creationist position.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So, no, you could not get me to play your game for any amount of money. I have no respect at all for &amp;quot;Christian Teaching &amp;amp; Talk radio&amp;quot;, thanks to your disreputable actions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I am, however, impressed with the level of shameless gall you have to ask me again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a &lt;i&gt;little bit&lt;/i&gt; tempted to put one pinky to a corner of my mouth and say, &amp;quot;My honorarium will be…one MILLION dollars.&amp;quot; I resisted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Fisher just replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sincerest apologies as I wasn't aware that this was what happened.  I was simply given your name as a good debater and asked to contact you about doing an event with us.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My spirits lifted when I saw another &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFD01r6ersw"&gt;Youtube clip&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="http://tenser.typepad.com/tenser_said_the_tensor/2007/04/friendly_milk.html"&gt;the Tensor&lt;/a&gt;) wherein Fry and his comedic partner Hugh Laurie hilariously hold forth on language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/ZFD01r6ersw%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my money, "Hold the newsreader's nose squarely, waiter, or friendly milk will countermand my trousers" trumps colorless green ideas sleeping furiously any day. And now comes more heartening evidence that Fry is a true language lover and no prescriptivist stick-in-the-mud. On his newly redesigned blog, The New Adventures of Mr Stephen Fry, he kicks things off with a wonderfully rambling post entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.stephenfry.com/blog/?p=64"&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Mind Your Language…&lt;/a&gt;". A choice excerpt follows below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;For me, it is a cause of some upset that more Anglophones don’t &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; language. Music is enjoyable it seems, so are dance and other, athletic  forms of movement. People seem to be able to find sensual and sensuous  pleasure in almost anything but words these days. Words, it seems  belong to other people, anyone who expresses themselves with  originality, delight and verbal freshness is more likely to be mocked,  distrusted or disliked than welcomed. The free and happy use of words  appears to be considered elitist or pretentious. Sadly, desperately  sadly, the only people who seem to bother with language in public today  bother with it &lt;em&gt;in quite the wrong way&lt;/em&gt;.  They write letters to broadcasters and newspapers in which they are  rude and haughty about other people’s usage and in which they show off  their own superior ‘knowledge’ of how language should be. I hate that,  and I particularly hate the fact that so many of these pedants assume  that I’m on their side. When asked to join in a “let’s persuade this  supermarket chain to get rid of their ‘five items or less’ sign” I  never join in. Yes, I am aware of the technical distinction between  ‘less’ and ‘fewer’, and between ‘uninterested’ and ‘disinterested’ and  ‘infer’ and ‘imply’, but none of these are of importance to me. ‘None  of these are of importance,’ I wrote there, you’ll notice – the old pedantic me would have insisted on “none of them is  of importance”. Well I’m glad to say I’ve outgrown that silly approach  to language. Oscar Wilde, and there have been few greater and more  complete lords of language in the past thousand years, once included  with a manuscript he was delivering to his publishers a compliment slip  in which he had scribbled the injunction: “I’ll leave you to tidy up  the woulds and shoulds, wills and shalls, thats and whiches &amp;amp;c.”  Which gives us all encouragement to feel less guilty, don’t you think?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are all kinds of pedants around with more time to read and  imitate Lynne Truss and John Humphrys than to write poems,  love-letters, novels and stories it seems. They whip out their Sharpies  and take away and add apostrophes from public signs, shake their heads  at prepositions which end sentences and mutter at split infinitives and  misspellings, but do they bubble and froth and slobber and cream with &lt;em&gt;joy&lt;/em&gt; at language? Do they ever let the tripping of the tips of their tongues  against the tops of their teeth transport them to giddy euphoric bliss?  Do they ever yoke impossible words together for the sound-sex of it? Do  they use language to seduce, charm, excite, please, affirm and tickle  those they talk to? Do they? I doubt it. They’re too farting busy  sneering at a greengrocer’s less than perfect use of the apostrophe.  Well sod them to Hades. They think they’re guardians of language.  They’re no more guardians of language than the Kennel Club is the  guardian of dogkind.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The worst of this sorry bunch of semi-educated losers are those who  seem to glory in being irritated by nouns becoming verbs. How dense and  deaf to language development do you have to be? If you don’t like nouns  becoming verbs, then for heaven’s sake avoid Shakespeare who made a  doing-word out of a thing-word every chance he got. He TABLED the  motion and CHAIRED the meeting in which nouns were made verbs. New  examples from our time might take some getting used to: ‘He actioned it  that day’ for instance might strike some as a verbing too far, but we  have been sanctioning, envisioning, propositioning and stationing for a  long time, so why not ‘action’? ‘Because it’s ugly,’ whinge the  pedants. It’s only ugly because it’s new and you don’t like it. Ugly in  the way Picasso, Stravinsky and Eliot were once thought ugly and before  them Monet, Mahler and Baudelaire. Pedants will also claim, with what I  am sure is eye-popping insincerity and shameless disingenuousness, that  their fight is only for ‘clarity’. This is all very well, but there is  no doubt what ‘Five items or less’ means, just as only a dolt can’t  tell from the context and from the age and education of the speaker,  whether ‘disinterested’ is used in the ‘proper’ sense of non-partisan,  or in the ‘improper’ sense of uninterested. No, the claim to be  defending language for the sake of clarity almost never, ever holds  water. Nor does the idea that following grammatical rules in language  demonstrates clarity of thought and intelligence of mind. Having said  this, I admit that if you want to communicate well for the sake of  passing an exam or job interview, then it is obvious that wildly  original and excessively heterodox language could land you in the soup.  I think what offends examiners and employers when confronted with  extremely informal, unpunctuated and haywire language is the  implication of &lt;em&gt;not caring&lt;/em&gt; that  underlies it. You slip into a suit for an interview and you dress your  language up too. You can wear what you like linguistically or  sartorially when you’re at home or with friends, but most people accept  the need to smarten up under some circumstances – it’s only  considerate. But that is an issue of fitness, of suitability, it has  nothing to do with correctness. There no right language or wrong  language any more than are right or wrong clothes. Context, convention  and circumstance are all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Rahm? No, please — after campaigning on a slogan of &amp;quot;change&amp;quot;, buying into one of the most deeply imbedded beltway insiders is not encouraging. Maybe there&amp;#39;s some virtue in working with the Democratic establishment, so I can forgive one concession to the status quo, but let&amp;#39;s see some innovative thinking, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More worrisome is the idea that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could get a prominent appointment. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/say_it_aint_so_barack_say_you_aint_serio.php"&gt;Orac has torn that one apart&lt;/a&gt;, and I agree: we do not need another irrational purveyor of woo and fluffy substanceless hysteria contributing to this country's administration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing you can do is &lt;a href="http://www.change.gov/page/s/contact"&gt;contact the transition team and voice your disapproval&lt;/a&gt;. Demand rigor in the people running our government!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salon has an illuminating perspective on Rahm: he's Obama's &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/11/07/rahm/"&gt;designated asshole&lt;/a&gt;.

I agreed to get involved because it sounded interesting, but I had no idea it would become such a big deal.    There have been active discussions at many of the Sb blogs on this issue, particularly here, at Abel's TerraSig, and at DrugMonkey.  As part of the discussion, I put out a piece on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/the_ethics_of_blog_anonymity.php"&gt;the ethics of blog anonymity&lt;/a&gt;.  Now here's a related question (which I would prefer to treat in a general sense, without referring to any ongoing RL disputes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a quote from an anonymous writer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We shouldn't have anonymity or pseudonyms in place to protect people from the consequences of expressing bigotry, we have it so they can tell the truth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that we can always be held responsible for what we write, and anonymity is not guaranteed.  I've written earlier that I don't think anonymity is a right, as such, but more of a clause in a contract.  If I, as the writer, break the contract by launching nasty attacks on others, does that abrogate the responsibility of my readers to guard my identity?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another anonymous writer brings up a glitch here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What you are saying here is that if you, personally, think someone should be outed for whatever arbitrary personal reasons you would do so.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there is no agreed-upon set of rules in the blogosphere (remember, it's dangerous---bring a helmet), there can be no single answer here.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a blogger is spewing hate-filled white-supremecist rhetoric, I won't feel so bad about outing him.  But that's just my (ultimately) &lt;i&gt;arbitrary&lt;/i&gt; judgment.  Is there a decision-making tool in our ethics kit that measures when an outing or threatened outing is fair?  Part of the decision-making process has to involve the good or bad that accrues with either outing or not outing someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to see a real discussion of this, without over the top hostility, and without reference to any ongoing disputes.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, we are duplicating much effort. We are spending a great deal of time focusing on the 20% of topics, and the other 80% are hardly getting any attention at all. We need more skeptics to focus on that long tail, those lesser known topics. We need web sites that will fill in the long tail of skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Tim right?  And if he is, what’s on the list of the 80% that skeptics who are looking for projects to focus on?  If he isn’t, how can a newbie skeptic make a general purpose skeptical website stand out amongst the crowd?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.  Tim has a good starter list in his post already - of course, I’m looking for things outside that &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Masala Skeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1226083663966"><id gr:original-id="http://holfordwatch.wordpress.com/?p=1751">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7d116ce87e61b635</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">The Telegraph: The End of More Illusions</title><published>2008-11-07T14:38:05Z</published><updated>2008-11-07T14:38:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://holfordwatch.info/2008/11/07/the-telegraph-the-end-of-more-illusions/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">I used to be under the impression that - if something was in the Telegraph - it had been subjected to a reasonable amount of scrutiny.  DVNutrix has recently written heretically about a sad shattering of illusions about the Economist; likewise, I have recently become much less confident in the contents of the Telegraph.  The [...]</summary><author><name>jonhw</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1226083663965"><id gr:original-id="286 at http://layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e2ed9949c50c30c2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">The Carnival of the Liberals: Election Special!</title><published>2008-11-07T13:20:01Z</published><updated>2008-11-07T13:20:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://layscience.net/node/286" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Carnival of the Liberals, and an edition that is special for two reasons. Firstly, this marks the carnival's entry into the fourth year of its long and illustrious life, making it about ninety-six in carnival years. And secondly, it's the first edition to take place after an historic election. Yes, Labour won the Glenrothes by-election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently there was an election in America too, and a particularly significant one at that. After 43 European-American presidents, the nation has finally elected an African-American. Perhaps one day they'll elect an actual American, but I wouldn't hold your breathe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest problems for manned deep space flight is not the cost or the reliability of the technology but the inherent deadliness of space weather itself. The solar wind and cosmic ray particles that permeate space are deadly to humans whether it’s a short intense burst or low level radiation for extended periods of time like a 2 year mission to mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, computer simulations by a team in Lisbon and at Rutherford Appleton showed that it may be possible to create a small magnetic bubble to protect astronauts. Recently, these simulations were confirmed by a team in the UK using equipment designed for fusion research. They created a magnetic hole in an artificial solar wind. All the charged particles went around the hole. This reminds me of the meta-materials being used to make objects invisible. In a sense, anything in that void is invisible to the solar wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar wind consists primarily of protons and electrons ejected from the outer atmosphere of the sun. These charged particles can go as fast as 750 km/sec and they constitute a 6.7 billion ton loss of mass every hour for our dear exfoliating sun. No worries though since only about .01% of the sun’s mass has been lost this way. The solar wind creates a shield of sorts around our entire solar system protecting us from harmful interstellar radiation. It is called the heliosphere and it extends well beyond Pluto. In case you wanted another entry on your “Danger From Space” list…there is actually some &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/protective-shield-of-the-sun-is-shrinking/2008/10/19/1224351057111.html"&gt;concern&lt;/a&gt; that the heliosphere is shrinking which could potentially allow more of the high-energy galactic radiation through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cosmic Rays are also primarily protons but they mostly come from outside our solar system and can have energies that are many orders of magnitude greater than anything that the LHC can create (10&amp;gt;20 electron volts compared to 10&amp;gt;14 electron volts). It is believed that rotating neutron stars, supernovae, and black holes within our galaxy create them. There are some cosmic rays with such energy however that they would have to come from sources outside the Milky Way such as radio galaxies or quasars. The term “Cosmic Ray” itself sounds cool but it is a bit of a misnomer since the “ray” consists of discrete particles which are not part of any coherent ray or beam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charged particles from the solar wind and cosmic rays are no joke. These high velocity particles can rip through the human body and leave in their wake atoms with electrons yanked out of their orbits, broken chemical bonds, and DNA damage that can cause cancer. According to the international space agencies, “space weather” is the greatest obstacle to deep space travel for people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hasn’t been a problem in the past because we’ve only been outside the protection of our atmosphere and the earth’s magnetosphere a handful of times during the brief moon-walk missions of the 60’s and 70’s. An extended voyage to mars however is a completely different story. It would be almost inevitable that the mars crew would be bombarded by intense bursts, not to mention the constant low-level exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth’s magnetoshpere is the magnetized region around earth created by our magnetic field which in turn appears to be created by the movement of liquid metal in the core. This field protects the earth from radiation and also has the lovely side-effect of creating auroras (both borealis and australis) by funneling charged particles from the sun to the magnetic poles where they interact with the atmosphere and give off light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogimages/magnetosphere.jpg" alt="" width="546" height="298"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok..back to the main story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really opened my eyes to the main problem with extended manned space missions was a 2006 article in Scientific American (Shielding Space Travelers By Eugene N. Parker February, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eugen Parker is professor emeritus of physics at the University of Chicago and in this article he really laid out how dangerous this is and what little we can realistically do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply shielding a ship would work but Parker estimates 400 tons of shielding would be needed. This would cost somewhere in the billions to launch just the shield for the ship and obviously is not very practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parker even evaluated a magnetic shield and concluded that 9 tons of machinery would be required making this impractical as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference is that Parker assumed as did most scientists that a huge 20 tesla magnetic field would be required. This could produce something like a 100 kilometer wide magnetic field. The key finding in this most recent research is that a small 1 tesla field which would create a bubble a few hundred meters wide might be stable and strong enough for a spaceship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be relatively light and inexpensive to loft into space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this idea works out. I’m a big proponent of robots in space but there’s nothing like leaving some real bootprints on a planet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bob Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1226082282056"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4054">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/007fd71ce03cb34c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Comments"/><category term="Sylvia Browne"/><category term="cotw"/><title type="html">COTW &amp;amp; a PSA!</title><published>2008-11-07T18:19:32Z</published><updated>2008-11-07T18:19:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4054" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get to the much-anticipated Comment o’ the Week, we have . . . a Public Service Announcement! It’s not even court-ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Smoooooosh by Skepchick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skepchick/2833418817/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3070/2833418817_6dbf4ebc40_m.jpg" alt="Smoooooosh" width="180" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was watching the &lt;a href="http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2008/11/lets-check-in-o.html"&gt;puppy cam&lt;/a&gt; the other day when I noticed a banner announcing that it is &lt;a href="https://community.hsus.org/campaign/sheltersrock?source=gabhee"&gt;National Animal Shelter Appreciation Week&lt;/a&gt;! I can find no information that confirms this apart from the banner, and there are no dates on the banner so for all I know, NASAW happens every week. But! That doesn’t matter, because I am a big fan of animal shelters and I encourage all of you to be, as well. There are way too many homeless animals out there who are scared and alone and would make wonderful companions if someone gives them the chance. A few years ago I adopted two 18-month old sister cats who were surrendered because they clawed the furniture and were a general nuisance. Rarely have I met two sweeter, more loving animals. They sleep next to me in bed, they crawl into my lap whenever possible, they look like spastic goofballs when they see a bug, they once killed a mouse and didn’t spread its guts all over the place, they purr loudly and often, they use the scratching post, they make me laugh, and they are &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=cat&amp;amp;w=81493359%40N00"&gt;unbelievably adorable&lt;/a&gt; 99% of every day. The other 1% involves pooping, but at least it always goes in the litter box. Also sometimes they barf but not often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the point is that shelter animals can be wonderful, even (especially!) when you adopt older companions. You can also donate money, time, toys, and supplies to your local shelter. Oh, and have your pet spay or neutered. That is all. On to the COTW! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week was legendary, due to the fact that as everyone must know by now, Skepchick had a lengthy political thread that did not devolve into angry bickering. Also, the US elected its first black president. Kudos all around!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Comment o’ the Week, however, was made in another thread entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria posted a Halloween-inspired Afternoon Inquisition asking what really scares you. Apparently, Skepchick readers are disproportionately terrified of adults wearing floppy shoes, wigs, red noses, and white face paint. &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3912#comment-37789"&gt;COTW runner-up number one&lt;/a&gt; described clowns as “hell-spawn joy-mongers.” &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3912#comment-37874"&gt;COTW runner-up two&lt;/a&gt; suggested “I think next Halloween I’ll own my fears and go as a clown-shark.” The true COTW winner, though, goes to a comment that made me laugh not necessarily because he was trying to be humorous, but because it is the kind of comment that could really only appear on Skepchick:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What truly frightens me are clowns. There is just something creepy about someone hiding under a fake painted on smiley face, and have been scared of them since I was little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than clowns, a complete lack of separation of church and state would be down-right terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, it’s the last line that gets me. I’m going to repeat it for the most effective horse-beating: “Other than clowns, a complete lack of separation of church and state would be down-right terrifying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disagree with me? Too bad, and better luck next time! Nominate your favorite COTW for next week by clicking the arrow in that comment box and posting “COTW” so’s I see it.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s part of the Chandra (X-Ray Observatory) Deep Field South, an effort to map out distant regions of the Universe across the entire spectrumwith incredible resolution and depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image is mostly in the near ultraviolet, or UV. It’s a total of &lt;em&gt;55 hours&lt;/em&gt; of observations. Despite that, like many things, at first glance it doesn’t look like much:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3010131549/sizes/o/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3194/3010043797_21854020aa_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click any of the images in this post to embiggen.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, you see lots of stars in it, right? But the image I displayed here has been compressed; if you download &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2008/images/phot-39-08-fullres.jpg"&gt;the complete full-res image&lt;/a&gt; (warning, 32MB file!) you get a much clearer view of this field. Those dots you saw above? Those aren’t stars, &lt;strong&gt;they’re galaxies&lt;/strong&gt;. Thousands of them. &lt;em&gt;Tens&lt;/em&gt; of thousands. I don’t know how many, exactly. A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scanning the full-res image is incredible. There’s so much to see! Each dot, each smudge, is a full-blown galaxy, a collection of billions of stars. They’re very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; far away; some of these galaxies are estimated to be 10 billion light years distant; you’re seeing them as they were just a couple of billion years after the Universe itself began, and the faintest are &lt;em&gt;one-billionth&lt;/em&gt; as bright as objects you can see with your own eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They come in all shapes and sizes (though the apparent size depends mostly on distance; the bigger ones are almost certainly much closer than the smaller ones). Some appear to be loners, while others group together. Here’s an interesting cluster that, from the sizes of the galaxies, is at an intermediate distance from us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3010043523/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3199/3010043523_acf957a85d.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Milky Way is a member of a small cluster called the Local Group, and I imagine from a couple of billion light years away it looks a lot like this one. When I look at this little cluster, I can’t help but wonder if anyone is looking back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Universe was younger, it was smaller, and clusters were smaller. That means collisions between galaxies were more common back then. So you expect to see a few galaxies twisted up, distorted from the impact. Guess what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3010880268/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3212/3010880268_2e92a1c67e.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks like a spiral galaxy that had a smaller galaxy plow through it. Gravity warps the gas and stars into a ring surrounding the nucleus, and the gas forms new stars. These stars shine brightly, so the ring is a very obvious structure. The apparently interlocking ring to the lower left is a bit puzzling, though. It might be the interloping galaxy, torn apart by tidal stresses from the bigger galaxy, or it might be a tendril of material torn off the bigger galaxy. The perspective makes it hard to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But see that faint glowing fan of material to the right? That points right to the center of the ring galaxy, and that is a pretty clear indicator it’s a jet, a focused beam of material being spewed out by the galaxy. Every big galaxy has a monster black hole in its core (ours does, too). When galaxies collide, huge amounts of gas fall to the galactic center. The physics of the situation pretty much demand that the material forms a flat disk which swirls around the black hole. Near the Final Plunge, the disk gets incredibly hot (amazingly, through friction). This hot material tries to escape, and magnetic and other forces focus it into twin beams or jets of matter and energy that scream out in opposite directions at nearly the speed of light. Galaxies like this are said to be &lt;em&gt;active&lt;/em&gt;, an oddly understated word for the mind-numbing amount of sustained violence going on — the energy contained in those beams can be millions of times the Sun’s total output. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re talking cosmic blowtorches here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/12/17/taste-my-death-ray-3c321/"&gt;Seeing a jet coming from a distorted galaxy&lt;/a&gt;, especially one shaped into a ring, is dead giveaway. That dude had a head on crash, and not terribly long ago. Maybe a couple of hundred million years at most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fan of material is coming from a closer galaxy in the image, too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3010880560/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3292/3010880560_3c8c296121.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time the jet is fainter, but the galaxy itself looks more normal. Maybe it had a recent collision too, but the offending collider was much smaller, so the bigger galaxy doesn’t appear overtly distorted. But again, the jet points right back to the core of that nearly edge-on spiral, so it’s a pretty clear indicator of an active galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love galaxies, but I have to say that my favorite spot on this whole ginormous picture shows not some distant collection of billions of stars, but instead a single star, one that is far, &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; closer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3010044127/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3216/3010044127_5b4c59c0ce.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, not the bright one. See the little weird thing to the left of it? The things that’s green on top and reddish-pink below? That’s a nearby star, one so close that its motion across the sky caused it to blur during the few years it took to get the observations of this image! Normally, you don’t notice the stars’ motions in the sky; the constellations look pretty much the same as they did thousands of years ago. But stars do move across the sky as they follow their separate orbits around the Milky Way center. In high-magnification images, some fast-moving stars can be seen to change position. The changing colors for this star are because some exposures were made with one filter, and then later exposures with a different filter, with the star moving in the intervening time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the galaxies billions of light years away, this star is inside our own Galaxy, most likely only a few dozen light years away at most. If it were much farther its motion would be dimmed by distance, and it would appear as rock steady as the other objects in this picture. Incidentally, I found another object blurred in a similar multi-hued way, but it looks like a galaxy. Since galaxies don’t move that quickly (they are too far away to see that motion) I think it might be a reflection inside the telescope from a bright nearby star. Such ghost images are common in deep exposures like this, and play havoc with analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are a handful of close-ups I found in a few minutes of perusing this devastating image. What will astronomers find over years of study? No doubt they’ll look at statistics of the galaxies; how close together they appear to be, how clustered they are as opposed to spread out. Once distances are found to some of these objects we can begin to learn more about how the early Universe behaved itself. We can figure out how galaxies formed at such an early time, and what the structure of the Universe was like back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember as you look at this picture: you’re seeing one teeny tiny fraction of the area of the entire sky. No matter where we look in the sky, &lt;em&gt;we see galaxies splayed out like this&lt;/em&gt;.  The cosmos is a grand place, full of wonder and delight. Exploring it is just about the noblest thing we can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be clear by now to readers of this blog that pseudoscience is not a problem of just the right.  The left wing areas of pseudoscience are just as cranky, just as wrong-headed about science, just as likely to use &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/about.php"&gt;the tactics of denialism&lt;/a&gt; to advance a non-scientific agenda.  We have been dealing with the denialism of the right more because they've been in control.  Now is the time to nip the denialism of the left in the bud so it doesn't take root in this new administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. is a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/04/unified_theory_of_the_crank.php"&gt;crank&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/say_it_aint_so_barack_say_you_aint_serio.php"&gt;Orac for more&lt;/a&gt;), and one of the problems with cranks is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/06/crank_magnetism_1.php"&gt;Crank Magnetism&lt;/a&gt;.  When people have one type of pseudoscientific belief it tends not to be isolated.  Instead it reflects a general incompetence in understanding science, evaluating the quality of evidence, and what constitutes good science.  RFK Jr.'s crankery will not be limited to vaccines and autism.  He will undoubtably become the poster boy for all sorts of left wing crankery - be it environmental extremism, toxin/radiation paranoia (we'll never get public wifi), or his already well known anti-vax crankery.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My letter to the transition team is below the fold.  Please join me in trying to prevent this terrible error on the part of the Obama campaign.&lt;br&gt;

I think it's now the correct pinyin transliteration. Please correct me in the comments if you know, and it's still wrong.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Today you get the recipe for one of my very favorite dishes. Since I
married a Chinese woman 14 years ago, I've learned a lot of chinese
cooking, and of all of the things I've learned to make, this is probably
my favorite. It's called Shanghai Xu Chao Mien. It's a variant of
what's called Lo Mein in the US, except that it's actually authentic.
And as is typical of authentic dishes, it's &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better that
the crap you get at a typical chinese takeout in the US. (Chow mien is a
traditional chinese dish, but it's got nothing to do with what we call
Chow Mien in the US; "Chao" means "stir fried", and "mien" is noodles -
chow mien is stir-fried noodles.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This is the shanghai variant of the dish. It uses a different kind
of noodle, and a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different sauce. You'll have to go to a chinese grocery store for the two key ingredients. Finding them can
be a bit of a problem, because they're typically not well-labelled in english, but they're well worth the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="260px-Shacha_sauce.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/260px-Shacha_sauce.jpg" width="260" height="195"&gt;
&lt;p&gt; First, you need a kind of shrimp paste which is the base of the sauce. It's called sha-cha, and it's made from a mixture of chilis,
garlic, fermented brill-shrimp, and oil. It's usually sold in small glass jars, labelled "barbeque sauce" in english. It's a dark paste, which has red chili oil floating on top of it. Thanks to a commentor, a picture of a jar of the brand I use appears to the right.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="chineseeggnoodles.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/chineseeggnoodles.jpg" width="341" height="267"&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The other is the noodles. The typical lo-mein noodle is a sort-of square-profile yellow egg noodle. Shanghai Shu Chow Mien uses a plain flour noodle, which is thicker and wider - the noodles are between 1/4 and 1/2 an inch wide, and they're a sort of pale-tan white. They're sold fresh in the refrigerator case, not dried. They're usually labelled "shanghai noodles". Thanks to Google, you can see a picture of the kind of noodles I use to the right.&lt;/p&gt;

There were so many wild cards in this past presidential election that surely scholars will be poring over it for years to come. In light of Obama's victory, I had a thought that may already be on some scholar's mind, although the proof of this thesis will hardly be simple.

Paul J.J. Payack, as Language Log readers know, is the assiduously self-promoting president of the &lt;a href="http://languagemonitor.com/"&gt;Global Language  Monitor&lt;/a&gt; who has managed to hoodwink unsuspecting journalists on a range of pseudoscientific claims, most notably the number of words in the English language. (He now claims we're 2,248 words away from the millionth word, a progression that he &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004189.html"&gt;turns on and off&lt;/a&gt; based on his publicity needs.) During the U.S. presidential election season, he's attracted media attention for "&lt;a href="http://www.languagemonitor.com/2008-election"&gt;linguistic analysis&lt;/a&gt;" of key debates and speeches. Last month, &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/03/debate.words/"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; trumpeted his findings about the Biden/Palin vice-presidential debate: Palin spoke at a tenth-grade level and Biden at an eighth-grade level, and Palin used passives to deflect responsibility. That nonsense went unremarked here (except briefly in the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=669#comment-10593"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;), but Payack's latest round of flapdoodle, pegged to Barack Obama's victory speech on election night, is deserving of mention, even if it helps to fuel his cynical promotional machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again CNN is the easy mark for Payack's pronouncements, which are uncritically repeated under the headline, "&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/06/obama.speech.analysis/"&gt;Linguist deems Obama's speech a winner&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; For starters, Payack is not a professional linguist — he often boasts of a Harvard degree, which turns out to be some coursework in comparative literature that he took through Harvard&amp;#39;s extension program. But no matter: I&amp;#39;m firmly of the belief that amateur linguists can often make signal contributions to the study of language, as long as they take the time to learn the basics of contemporary linguistic scholarship. To no one&amp;#39;s surprise, that&amp;#39;s not the case for Mr. Payack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payack once again peddles his "grade level" analysis, saying that Obama's victory speech was at grade 7.4 level, down from 8.3 in his 2004 Democratic Convention address, indicating that "he has learned to speak more directly and more succinctly when he's giving a major address." On this point I have nothing to add to the critique made by Gabe Doyle on his &lt;a href="http://motivatedgrammar.wordpress.com/2008/10/07/that-you-can-measure-it-doesnt-make-it-meaningful-part-1/"&gt;Motivated Grammar&lt;/a&gt; blog, referring to Payack's similar scoring of the vice-presidential debate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me start off by addressing the idea that grade-level in speech, as  measured by readability tests, is a meaningful measure of anything:  IT’S NOT.  Payack’s analysis assigns grade levels based on a modified  version of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch-Kincaid_Readability_Test"&gt;Flesch-Kincaid&lt;/a&gt; readability test.  George Klare, all the way back in 1963, &lt;a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/344599.344630"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that most studies have shown that listener comprehension is not  significantly affected by readability values from Flesch-Kincaid and  similar tests.  Furthermore, Klare’s lack of effect was based on  testing the comprehension of someone listening to a speaker reading  pre-prepared text; presumably listener comprehension of an  extemporaneous speaker would be even less well-correlated with  readability of the transcript. …&lt;br&gt;
Even if readability scores were appropriate for assessing anything  about extemporaneous speech, the reported distinction is almost  certainly less than the margin of error for the readability test.  No  matter how you cut it, the distinction is illusory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides his meaningless readability scores, Payack also creates specious analysis of the use of active and passive voice. For the veep debate, he said, "Passive voice can be used to  deflect responsibility; Biden used active voice when referring to  Cheney and Bush; Palin countered with passive deflections." Gabe Doyle took up this assertion in &lt;a href="http://motivatedgrammar.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/global-language-monitors-debate-analysis-nonsense-part-2/"&gt;another Motivated Grammar post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kudos, GLM, for being honest and stating that passives aren’t by  definition bad.  But there’s one minor tripping point to this analysis:  Palin &lt;strong&gt;didn’t&lt;/strong&gt; use passives to deflect responsibility when Biden mentioned Bush or Cheney.  OOPS!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After searching through the transcript and coming up empty-handed, Doyle was puzzled about what Payack might have been identifying as Palin's passive constructions, since he didn't specify any of them. This time around, with the Obama speech, Payack does give CNN an example of a supposed passive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though most of Obama's verbs were in the active voice, 11 percent  of the sentences were in the passive voice, a dependable method of  deflecting responsibility, Payack said. He cited Obama's "There will be  setbacks and false starts" as an example.&lt;br&gt;
"He's spreading the  responsibility around," Payack said. "He didn't say, 'I will have  setbacks. I will be wrong. I will make mistakes.' He used the passive  voice for those types of constructions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it appears that Payack&amp;#39;s definition of &amp;quot;the passive voice&amp;quot; is a bit, shall we say, expansive, including active-voice existential clauses like &amp;quot;There will be setbacks and false starts.&amp;quot; Payack is not alone in identifying existential clauses as passive — Geoff Pullum noted an example &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004527.html"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; from NPR's Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep in an interview with   U.S. Army General   Dan McNeill, the NATO commander in Afghanistan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's put it in the passive tense: there was a ceasefire agreement in  Southern Afghanistan with some members of the Taliban at one time.  Is that something you would pursue if the opportunity came up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inskeep committed a double-oops by referring to "the passive tense" rather than "the passive voice." Payack at least gets the "voice" part right, but again, he's seeing a passive construction where there isn't one. The Inskeep example led Geoff to ponder the question, "What on earth do  people imagine the passive construction is?":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tentative answer, of  course, is that they mostly think a passive clause is one that is &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002380.html"&gt;vague  about agency&lt;/a&gt;, nothing more and nothing less.  Which is of course  untrue in both directions: you don't have to be vague about agency in a  passive clause, and you don't need a passive clause to be vague about  agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lay discussions of the "passive" can tell us a lot about folk-linguistic beliefs (see, for instance, the treatment of "folk grammaticality" in Nancy Niedzielski and Dennis R. Preston's 1999 monograph &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nfZVLY8i1QcC"&gt;Folk Linguistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, pp. 270ff.). But in the CNN article we have a self-styled "linguist" throwing around words like "passive" in a spectacularly uninformed fashion. We've set the bar pretty low if we're listening to an "expert" whose knowledge in his professed field of expertise wouldn't get him very far on "Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?".&lt;/p&gt;

That's because plants often contain biologically active molecules; i.e., they often contain drugs. Of course, the problem with plant-based medicines is that they are, in essence, highly contaminated drugs, the predictability of whose responses is variable because the amount of active ingredient can vary widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also a problem when claims for a plant-based compound become grandiose. It immediately makes me suspicious, even when there might be some biological plausibility that some compound with derived from a plant might have anticancer properties, when I see claims of "cancer cures" or the extensive use of testimonial evidence. Recently, I became aware of just such a "cancer cure" derived from, of all things, eggplant. The advertising for a cream based on this comound has it all: Testimonials, claims of near 100% efficacy in curing certain types of cancer, and claims of near miraculous efficacy. In essence, a man named Dr. Bill E. Cham takes a plant-based "treatment" and claims that it can not only cure skin cancer but regenerate and rejuvenate. In brief, he takes something that might have some efficacy and makes unbelievable claims for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, Dr. Cham's claim is that &lt;a href="http://www.eggplantcancercure.com/"&gt;eggplants cure skin cancer&lt;/a&gt;? Naturally, I know it's true because I &lt;a href="http://www.curaderm.net/"&gt;saw it on the Internet&lt;/a&gt;, and I've even seen some credulous reporting on it:&lt;/p&gt;

These are the results by county, with color reflecting the percentage that voted Republican (red) and Democrat (blue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what it looks like when the counties are scaled by population size; the smear of reds is greatly diminished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="election_results.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/07/election_results.jpg" width="425" height="287"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s striking how the emptiest places in the country are enriched with fervent conservatives. People are always fretting over how conservatives are outbreeding liberals, but it seems to me that that actually works in liberals&amp;#39; favor — as communities become larger and more interdependent, as people grow up &lt;i&gt;aware&lt;/i&gt; of social support systems, as their numbers create richer opportunities for education, there&amp;#39;s a trend towards embracing liberal values. There are, of course, historical contingencies that can counter that pattern — Utah has been growing, but isn&amp;#39;t becoming more Democratic, for instance — but it&amp;#39;s interesting that fast-growing urban areas in even the reddest states somehow end up favoring the Democrats. Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be ironic if the Quiverful movement, that strange idea on the religious right that women ought to bear swarms of children, was a policy that would simply breed new generations of liberals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is the alternative explanation: this distribution is an indirect measure of prosperity. People tend to move towards areas with more upward mobility and better economic prospects, so population is only a proxy for opportunity—and it&amp;#39;s broadly distributed wealth that produces more liberals. Then it would be the case that pumping out a dozen babies that you can&amp;#39;t afford to educate properly would still produce more minions of the Republicans…by impoverishing the region. I&amp;#39;m sure the religious right would find that notion reassuring, since it also seems to be one of their goals to wreck the political and economic health of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the explanation is, I want more blue in these maps. There are &lt;a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/"&gt;more election cartograms&lt;/a&gt; to peruse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/purple_america.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/445487673" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1226062790463"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/11/migraines_prevent_breast_cance.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/538ad55d00318274</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Migraines prevent breast cancer!!!!!!!</title><published>2008-11-07T12:18:58Z</published><updated>2008-11-07T12:18:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/445438089/migraines_prevent_breast_cance.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/11/migraines_prevent_breast_cance.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;When reporting on science, reporters and editors like sexy stories.  Since most science isn't particularly sexy, there's usually a hook.  If you can squeeze "risk" and "cancer" into a headline, an editor sees good headline. What I usually see is a sensationalist article that is going to get it very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the questions most often asked in the medical literature is "what is the risk of &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;?"  It's a pretty important question.  I'd like to be able to tell my patient with high blood pressure what their risk of heart attack is, both with and without treatment.  And risk is a sexy topic---the press loves it.  Whether it's cell phones and the "risk" of brain cancer, or vaccines and the "risk" of autism, risk makes for cool headlines.  Take &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSTRE4A518L20081106"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Migraines cut breast cancer risk 30 percent: study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean?  Should I tell my wife to go out and find some migraines?  What the hell is risk, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk, in the most basic sense, is a causal association.  If, for example, I find that members of the "Thunderstorm-lovers Golf Association" have a higher incidence of being struck by lightning than golfers who don't belong to this odd club, I may have stumbled upon a measurable risk.  There is both a measurable association, and a plausible reason to causally link the associated variables.   If I find that members of the National Association of Philatelists have a higher incidence of heart disease than other folks, I may or may not have stumbled on a risk.  Is there a reason that philatelists should have more heart disease?  Is it a coincidence?  Is it worth investigating further?  Is there a confounding variable, e.g. are philatelists in general older, and did I fail to control for this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is the question of the degree of risk.  How strong is the risk observed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statisticians have ways of measuring risk, but many of these terms---such as relative risk, absolute risk reduction, odds ratio---are not intuitive concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take the study in question.  The premise is interesting.  Migraines and breast cancer are both &lt;em&gt;associated&lt;/em&gt; with estrogen.   Many breast cancers are estrogen-dependent, and the risk of developing breast cancer correlates with exposure to estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migraines appear to be associated with estrogen as well, but negatively.  This is a much more tenuous connection.  It has been observed that migraines tend to wax during estrogen-poor times, and wane during estrogen-rich times---high estrogen, fewer migraines; low estrogen, more migraines. Or so it's been observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors of this study invoked migraine as a &lt;em&gt;negative risk factor&lt;/em&gt; for breast cancer.  The English meaning of "risk" is a bit lost here---what they are saying is that women who have migraines are less likely to develop breast cancer than women who don't have migraines. This shouldn't be all that surprising, as migraines and breast cancer are both associated with, well, womanhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all this aside, it's the "30%" headline annoys me.  That a big number!  Get me a migraine, stat! But thirty percent is an "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"&gt;odds ratio&lt;/a&gt;", which is a mathematical way of describing an association in a &lt;a href="http://rationalwiki.com/wiki/Case-control_study"&gt;case-control study&lt;/a&gt; such as this one.  Odds ratios are not intuitive, and as a measure of risk, they tend to break down when looking at common occurrences, such as migraines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look directly at the data from the study, the data used to calculate the odds ratio, we see something else.  In this study, the control group was post-menopausal women without breast cancer.  The case group was women &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; breast cancer.  Among women without breast cancer, 19% had ever had a migraine.  Among women with breast cancers, 14-15% had ever had a migraine.  So, there was about a 4-5% difference in migraine rates between women with and without breast cancer.  Does that still sound like a big number?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics are non-intuitive.  I have to work pretty hard to try to dig out the clinical meaning from stats, and I still get it wrong sometimes.  &lt;a href="http://www.stats.org/stories/2008/acupuncture_fertility_march_3_08.html"&gt;The press gets it wrong much more often.&lt;/a&gt;  Be very wary of banner headlines about risk.  Besides the difficulty of understanding the difference between risk reduction and odds ratios,  what does it mean in the real world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be perfectly frank, I think the authors have studied a question that no one is asking.  We already know that estrogen is positively associated with breast cancer, and we suspect that estrogen reduces migraine frequency (maybe).  What is the point of looking at the relationship between two secondary outcomes?  In other words, if a and b are both dependent on c, does it even mean anything to say that a and b vary inversely?

The major political theme I have discussed over the last two years on this blog is that science needs to be transparent and free from ideological meddling. Our society is best served when politics and government are informed by objective science, and great harm is done when political ideology dictates science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see this in numerous issues - global warming, biofuels, stem-cell research, vaccine policy, prevention of HIV and unwanted pregnancy (basically every environmental issue and public health issue), not to mention the teaching of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is broad-based criticism of the Bush administration and conservatives in general over the last eight years that they significantly shifted the balance - subverting science to political ideology. This resulted in an appropriate push back, coming mostly from the left but also from the scientific community in general. It seemed that regardless of who won the recent election the situation would improve, as both candidates promised (see their responses to questions from &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedebate2008.com/www/index.php?id=42"&gt;Science Debate 2008&lt;/a&gt;) to restore the proper role of science in government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama, having won, now has the task of assembling his administration. His picks for cabinet positions and as heads of major federal agencies (like the FDA, EPA, and numerous other agencies) will be the earliest indication of what an Obama administration’s position toward science will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why it is extremely disturbing that Obama appears to be considering Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for either Secretary of the Interior or as head of the Environmental Protection Agency.  This would be an unmitigated disaster for science in government, and I don’t think I am overstating the case. It would mean that abuse of science for ideological reasons is not a defect only of the extreme right but one easily embraced by the left as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes - there is already evidence for such abuse from across the political spectrum. Abuse of science was never the sole purview of conservatives. But the Bush Administsration raised science-abuse to a new level, and now the eyes of the scientific community are on President-Elect Obama to see how much he is going to correct what Bush did. Appointing RFK Jr. would send a terrible signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for concern is that RFK Jr. is an &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=58"&gt;antivaccinationist crank&lt;/a&gt;.  He has defended the belief, against all evidence, that thimerosal in vaccines causes autism. He has attacked scientists who are just doing research and reporting on the evidence as being part of a dark government conspiracy, and as “attacking moms.’ His is a particularly vile form of antivaccinationist crankery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/say_it_aint_so_barack_say_you_aint_serio.php"&gt;Orac has done his usual thorough job&lt;/a&gt; of detailing the entire story, so I won’t bother to duplicate it.  Read his entry for more details on RFK Jr., and on how the antivaccine community is ecstatic about his possible appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there are other considerations in such a pick - RFK Jr. would bring his celebrity status to the EPA, and he would be a payback to the Kennedy family for their crucial early endorsement of Obama. But from the point of view of the specific issue of whether or not Obama wants to signal a new era, and a stark change from the Bush administration, in terms of science and the federal government - RFK Jr. would be a disaster. It comes down to priority, and that is precisely why this will be a good barometer of what priority science integrity will have in an Obama administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that Obama will focus on RFK Jr.’s history of environmental advocacy and his antivaccine crankery will be below the radar. But that seems unlikely - even a casual vetting process should reveal the firestorm of science bloggers and scientists against RFK Jr.’s conspiracy mongering and crank science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that environmental advocacy is all about the science, and the Democrats have been whining for eight years that the Republicans have been distorting environmental science for their ideological purposes.  This position requires someone who understands science and the proper role of science as a tool of effective regulation and specifically environmental advocacy. Putting a known antiscientific crank in this position is inexcusable, and would strongly signal that perhaps we cannot look forward to the change we were hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s hope saner heads prevail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_____________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addendum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/11/7/8140/84940/439/656545"&gt;Daily Kos&lt;/a&gt;, a liberal blog, has chimed in on this issue.  The article and the comments seem to indicate that science bloggers are being heard. It is generally negative toward RFK Jr. on the grounds that his anti-science stance on vaccine disqualifies him for a position. Let’s hope that is a positive sign.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been notably quiet - subsumed in work, study and applications - but I am catching up on writing about the clerkships I've done in the meantime (Pediatrics, Psych, OB/Gyn and Family Medicine).  But since I'm applying for residency now (MD/PhDs have an abbreviated 4th year) I figured now would be a good time to tell people about what this is like, and in the coming months what cities I'm going to be in from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing a medical specialty is a &lt;i&gt;big&lt;/i&gt; decision.  I've necessarily made up my mind, am very confident I've made the right choice and encourage you to take bets on my choice - it will be fun to see what people think.  But the decision making process is famously difficult and many different strategies have been devised to help the indecisive (not me).  Perhaps most famous is this chart first published in the &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/331/7531/1529"&gt;BMJ by then-resident Boris Veysman&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="Medicalspecialty.gif" src="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/Medicalspecialty.gif" width="440" height="418"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're very patient you can answer 130 redundant questions at &lt;a href="http://www.med-ed.virginia.edu/specialties/Home.cfm"&gt;this site offered by UVA&lt;/a&gt; to help you make up your mind, or read &lt;a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Choosing-a-Medical-Specialty/Brian-Freeman/e/9780071479417"&gt;one of the books on the subject&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is the famous &lt;a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/177/12/1545?ck=nck"&gt;Goo index&lt;/a&gt;, which I think may be quite useful.  Basically, chose your specialty based on which types of bodily fluid you can stand being in contact with every day for the rest of your life.  If you have a low tolerance for any goo, psychiatry or neurology might be up your alley.  If you can take any fluid being sprayed at you at high velocity, surgery may be an excellent specialty for you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is the general opinion among the goo-heavy specialties that you should avoid the goo you dislike the most.  For instance, if snot is bothersome, avoid pulmonary specialties and pediatrics.  If it's urine, maybe you shouldn't go into urology (or if you don't want to stare at genitalia all day).  If you don't mind blood but don't like any of the stinky stuff, maybe neurosurgery is the right match.  It's all about balancing your goo exposure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't want to get divorced during residency, maybe &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/336/11/800"&gt;read this paper&lt;/a&gt;.  The surprising result?  Psychiatry is the worst at a 50% cumulative divorce rate followed by surgery at 33%, and most other medical specialties between 22-30%.  I guess psychiatrists drive their spouses nuts when they bring their work home.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is the Myers-Briggs &lt;a href="http://www.gesher.org/Myers-Briggs/mbti%20chart%20and%20specialty.html"&gt;guide to specialties&lt;/a&gt; which is only useful if you're the type of person that likes astrology or other advice based on vague, general descriptions of people coached in psuedoscientific drivel.  There is a lot of study of personality traits specific to different specialties, &lt;a href="http://jca.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/10/3/362"&gt;a review of the subject&lt;/a&gt; concludes that for the most part medical students tend to be too homogeneous for the blunt-instrument personality tests to distinguish something so specific as an ideal career choice and there is more variation of personalities within a given field than between fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, using these highly-scientific and time-tested methodologies, which kind of medicine would you like to practice?  Which do you think I chose?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/11/choosing_a_medical_specialty.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/445389134" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1226050760780"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/contact_the_obama_transition_team_to_tel.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aa68dd9d975453ba</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/starred" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="starred"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antivaccination lunacy"/><title type="html">Contact the Obama transition team to tell them why Robert F.

That disturbing development is the multiple reports that antivaccine crank Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is being seriously considered to head the Environmental Protection Agency or even the Department of the Interior. Given RFK, Jr.'s conspiracy-mongering over vaccines, his utter failure to change his belief that mercury in vaccines causes autism in the face of overwhelming evidence that it does not. My argument was that appointing someone who is so anti-science about the issue of vaccines, who is such an utter crank, would be a terrible self-inflicted wound and seriously damage Barack Obama's cred as a pro-science President.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I've gotten a number of questions about what we can do to prevent this from coming to pass. Some readers have pointed me to this &lt;a href="http://www.change.gov/page/s/contact"&gt;contact page&lt;/a&gt; for the Obama transition team and this &lt;a href="http://change.gov/page/s/ofthepeople"&gt;Of the People&lt;/a&gt; page. I suggest that everyone who opposes the politicization of science use it to respectfully lodge their protest. You know that antivaccinationists who worship RFK, Jr. will be doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My RFK, Jr./Department of the Interior/EPA posts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really is. It's simply amazing that &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Skeptics' Circle&lt;/a&gt; has been around so long. It's been around so long that we're already up to the &lt;a href="http://ferretcage.blogspot.com/2008/11/99th-skeptics-circle.html"&gt;99th Meeting of the Skeptics' Circle over at Ferret's Cage&lt;/a&gt;. The new generation of skepticism has landed with a great addition to the lore of the Skeptics' Circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is...well...me. Given how long it's been since I've hosted a Circle, I decided to take the organizer's prerogative and host the 100th Meeting of the Skeptics' Circle. So send your entries to me by November 19, and I'll see what sort of twisted and entertaining Circle I can serve up for you two weeks hence on November 20. What we're looking for is described in &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2005/10/skeptics-circle-archive-and-schedule.html"&gt;these guideline&lt;/a&gt;s.

In general, they insult me for a bit (always charming), and then pull out their trump card: &amp;quot;Why don’t you ever talk about methane?! It’s a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The triumphantly close out their missive with another insult or two, and I am chastised, sobbing, beaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or am I? Duh, no. I don’t talk about methane because I understand math. There’s a lot more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the air than methane!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; makes up roughly about 0.04% of the Earth’s atmosphere by volume. Methane? &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air"&gt;0.0002%&lt;/a&gt;. Methane is in fact a more efficient greenhouse gas than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but there’s so much less of it that the overall effect is much lower. Methane’s contribution to the greenhouse effect is only about half or less that of carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, water vapor is far and away the biggest contributor to greenhouse warming. The amount in the air is hugely variable, but relatively unaffected by man’s activities. So over time, those variations even out, and the contribution of warming from water vapor is steady. The increase we see in temperature — and there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an increase in temperature — cannot be from water vapor, and the methane contribution is small. We also know &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/04/29/is-global-warming-solar-induced/"&gt;it’s not from the Sun&lt;/a&gt;, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why atmospheric scientists primarily study carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they’ve been studying it a long, long time. It’s a very difficult field of research, fraught with hidden variables, difficult measurements, and political landmines. &lt;em&gt;But chances are they know more about this than you and I do.&lt;/em&gt; There’s a reason they’re called experts, folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the next time you want to send me some snarky email to embarrass me about some piece of info you just found on the intertoobs, please do yourself a favor: stop, think for just a moment, and ask yourself: &amp;quot;Is this really likely to have been missed by thousands of really smart highly educated people who have been studying this field for a combined length of time equaling many man-millennia?&amp;quot; The embarrassment you save just might be your own.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1226023308549"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/oh_no_nightmares.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d37ef1a6ab3bb46a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Oh, no!

I would like to suggest that you go read his post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is important.  I voted for Obama.  I believe that he is one of the brightest people we've every had the chance to vote for, and I think that after 8 years of open hostility to science, we have a chance to remove some of the politics from the issues that affect all of us.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Obama has floated a lead balloon for the head of EPA.  Robert Kennedy, Jr. is an anti-science wacko.  He has drunk the Kool Aid (I know, Flav-R-Ade, stop correcting me!) of the anti-vaccine movement, and crankery is never isolated---it &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; carries over from one area to the next, as it indicates a flawed way of thinking.  Read Orac's post for specifics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building an administration is probably hard.  Please, Mr. Obama, don't get off on the wrong foot with science.

It’s doing pretty well, and I’m happy. Reviews are starting to trickle in, and in general they are very positive. I don’t think I’ve seen a negative one yet, except &lt;a href="http://www.dailygrail.com/news/death-from-the-skies"&gt;by one goofy antiscience guy&lt;/a&gt; who doesn’t seem to understand literary metaphors (read the off-topic weird comments there, too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found out today that a pretty big magazine (with a circulation well over 1 million) will do a review of the book. I’ll write about that when it comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So things are going pretty well. If you want to read the reviews, here are the ones I’ve seen so far. If you have a review I haven’t seen (or forgot about because I’m a bonehead sometimes) please link to it in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

And as Chris Potts &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=808"&gt;makes clear,&lt;/a&gt; if you measure a word's connotations by the items it co-occurs with, &lt;em&gt;fucking&lt;/em&gt; doesn't seem to keep particularly salacious company. So it's simply wrong to claim that these emphatic, expletive, and figurative uses of the word (e.g., as in&lt;em&gt; fuck up&lt;/em&gt; etc.) fall afoul of the FCC&amp;#39;s rules, which define indecency as language that  “depicts or describes… sexual or excretory activities or organs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hang on. Emphatic &lt;em&gt;fucking&lt;/em&gt; may not depict or refer to sex, and may not even bring it explicitly to mind. But the link is still there. Why would these uses of the word be considered "dirty"  if they weren't polluted by its primary literal use? And what could be the original source of that taint if not the word's literal denotation (or at least, of its denotation relative to the attitudes that obscene words presuppose about sex and the body)? In fact if &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fucking&lt;/em&gt; weren't connected to sex in all their secondary uses, they would serve no purpose at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I mean &amp;quot;taint&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;pollution&amp;quot; in a literal way — dirty words are magic spells that conjure up their references. We first learn about dirty words at an age when we still believe literally in magic, and I don&amp;#39;t think anything we learn afterwards palliates their irrational power. That&amp;#39;s why we behave as if we could render them inefficacious by the simple expedient of using asterisks in place of some of their letters — magical spells have no power unless you say them just so . And it&amp;#39;s why they bleed through quotation marks and the other devices we use to hold content at arm&amp;#39;s length: if the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; can't allow itself to print "Adam Clymer is an asshole" then it can't print "Bush called Adam Clymer an asshole," either (strong racial epithets have these properties, as well). And most important here, it's why they retain their stigma even when they're detached from their literal references and applied to other things (meddling, bungling, cheating, and so on), or turned into simple emphatic noises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it's very easy to conclude that the indignation that some people feel over the promiscuous use of epithetical &lt;em&gt;fucking&lt;/em&gt; and the like is a reflection of their prudish inhibitions about sexuality, and that embracing the language helps to dispel those attitudes. As George Carlin &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1817192,00.html"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;, "There are no bad words. Bad thoughts. Bad Intentions." That was an article of faith among a the faction among the sixties radicals who made sexual liberation an inseparable part of their political programs. As Jerry Rubin &lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/189446"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's one word which Amerika hasn't destroyed. One word which has maintained its emotional power and purity. Amerika cannot destroy it because she dare not use it. It's illegal! It's the last word left in the English language: FUCK!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The naked human body is immoral under Christianity and illegal under Amerikan law. Nudity is called "indecent exposure." Fuck is a dirty word because you have to be naked to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think most cultural liberals still uncritically adopt a version of this understanding of the words. When they uphold people's right to use this sort of language in public against the attempts to censor or limit it, they think of themselves not just as defending free speech, but as striking a blow against sexual repression and hypocrisy. That is, they see themselves as being in a line that stretches back to the &lt;em&gt;Lady Chatterly&lt;/em&gt; decision — part of the long historical process that Rochelle Gurstein &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;amp;id=1B-lWAXxb9YC&amp;amp;dq=%22repeal+of+reticence%22&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ots=b82zfz_nFH&amp;amp;sig=3hYh0VL_5iLrjokndIRkZzSxuyA&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;resnum=3&amp;amp;ct=result"&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; as "the repeal of reticence."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if it ever were possible to purge &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; of its literal stigma by eliminating the inhibitions and hangups that the word seems to trail, the secondary uses of the word would lose their &lt;em&gt;raison d'etre.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fucking&lt;/em&gt; can only work in its figurative meanings if it remains dirty in its literal meaning. If there's still an aggressive intensity to calling somebody a fucking asshole it's because we haven't abandoned our conviction that sex and the body are something to be ashamed of. Every time we use &lt;em&gt;fucking&lt;/em&gt; as an emphatic, whether to commend or condemn something, we strike a little blow for old-fashioned sexual values. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That isn&amp;#39;t to say that we shouldn&amp;#39;t continue to oppose any legal and administrative penalties to using these words and defend people&amp;#39;s right to use them in appropriate circumstances (I don&amp;#39;t need to hear them on &amp;quot;Meet the Press&amp;quot;). But we should acknowledge that the words are suffused with an affect that&amp;#39;s derived from their sexual meanings. (It doesn&amp;#39;t really matter whether you want to call that a connotation, which is a word that can have a lot of meanings, most of them imprecise — though in an odd way, I think these &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; connotations in the sense of &lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/2250722"&gt;J. S. Mill&lt;/a&gt;, who invented the modern logical sense of the word).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoff Nunberg</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1226000900849"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/where-do-car-dealerships-go-when-they-die/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/70b4c948cd2e1bba</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="financial crisis"/><category term="urban planning"/><title type="html">Where Do Car Dealerships Go When They Die?</title><published>2008-11-06T19:12:47Z</published><updated>2008-11-06T19:12:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/57P-ZG-UVPs/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/where-do-car-dealerships-go-when-they-die/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">As many as 700 new-car dealerships will close in 2008.

But In most cases, outside the confines of this blog or other forums, we don’t know the people we interact with online. The reality is, we may not be as hip and together in our personal lives as perceived.&lt;/p&gt;

Bush Sewage Plant."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought this a supremely bad idea.  Such a move (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Marine_Corps_Recruiting_Center_controversy"&gt;like protesting the Marine Core in Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;) would invite a conservative reaction, possibly stripping the city of federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a local public utilities supervisor &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/11/03/BAQG13S22D.DTL"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, our waste station is progressive, like much of the city: "The potential irony here is that this is a modern facility that protects the ocean and the environment every day," [Tony] Winnicker said, "and I'm not sure that's the right legacy for President Bush."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Measure R failed by 69-30 percent!  There is some good sense in San Francisco, sometimes.  We also rejected a measure that would have legalized prostitution.

This is an interesting incremental advance in cloning technology. Using DNA from a previously frozen specimen has been done before, but using a specimen frozen for about 3 years. This significantly increases the time frozen to 16 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloning (specifically reproductive cloning) is the technology of taking the nucleus of one cell and placing it into an egg whose own DNA has been removed. The egg then needs to be stimulated, either electrically or chemically, to trigger the process of division and development. The result is an organism that is a twin (sort of) of the individual from which the donor DNA was taken. The resulting clone is actually less identical to the donor than twins are to each other. Twins also share the same parent egg (not just nuclear DNA - for example, there is also mitochondrial DNA outside the nucleus), and the environment of the womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two other types of cloning. Recombinant cloning places pieces of DNA into a host cell so that it will become incorporated into it. This has been done for decade, to make bacteria, for example, that will produce drugs or other useful chemicals. There is also therapeutic cloning, a topic of some controversy, whereby eggs are created not for the purpose of developing into a living creature, but to provide raw material for research or potential therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This current research deals with reproductive cloning. It is of extreme interest how long DNA can survive in a frozen state before it degenerates beyond usefulness. This is because of the very cool prospect of resurrecting the woolly mammoth and other ice-age mammals. (Side note - I see “whooly”, “wooly”, and “woolly” in roughly equal proportion, but the most authoritative sites seems to prefer “woolly”.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite is the woolly rhinocereos. Take a look at the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/gloucestershire/7710415.stm"&gt;photo here&lt;/a&gt; - this is a story of a little girl who found a woolly rhino fossil at the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally ice-age mammals are found frozen in the permafrost - which means they have been frozen since death. Soft tissues are preserved. The most common species to be found is the bison, but rarely mammoths have been recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises the intriguing possibility of cloning a mammoth and returning, for the first time, a species back from extinction. Mammoths are closely related to living elephants, so they would make perfect surrogate. There are a couple of approaches that have been proposed. The first is to simply clone a mammoth - take a nucleus from a frozen specimen and implant it into an enucleated elephant egg. The result would be a full mammoth. If we can make even a few clones in this way, then it is theoretically possible to nurture back into existence a self-sustaining population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to recover the frozen sperm or egg from a mammoth and then use that to fertilize an elephant egg. This is much easier and more likely to work, but the result would be half elephant and half mammoth. However, this process can be repeated several times with the half-breed offspring, each time fertilizing the partial mammoth with full mammoth sperm or egg. After a few generations the result would be mostly mammoth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with both these approaches is that DNA does not survive unscathed for thousands of years. While 16 years is a nice proof of concept, it is not 10,000 years. Also, the mouse was preserved for 16 years at a constant temperature (-20C) in the lab. This is different than the fluctuating temperatures out in the wild. And, while freezing temperatures in the arctic are cold, they are not cold enough to prevent decay - only to slow it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we can recover some (albeit degraded) DNA form frozen mammoths. Perhaps we can sequence the mammoth genome. Computers could analyze thousands of fragments and assemble them, like a puzzle, into an intact genome. We could then compare this to the genome of a living elephant - then we would only need to tweak the sequence to change an elephant into a mammoth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn10510"&gt;This project is already under way&lt;/a&gt;. Hendrik Poinar of the &lt;a href="http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/adna/"&gt;McMaster Ancient DNA Centre&lt;/a&gt; at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario has been sequencing the mammoth genome. He has already sequenced a number of nuclear genes. They have found that the mammoth genome is 98.55% identical to the African elephant. This is consistent with the fossil evidence suggesting they split about 5 million year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently this project is slowed due to lack of funding, which would be a shame. Genetic information is information - once lost it is lost forever. The paleogenomics project is an attempt to gather this information and reconstruct it before it is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar efforts are also underway for recently extinct species, &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=299"&gt;like the thylacine&lt;/a&gt; (Tasmanian tiger).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several important aspects of this kind of research. There is no doubt that human activity is wreaking a mass extinction on this planet. While we need to explore way to minimize this, developing the technology to preserve the genomes of lost species is an important hedge against man-made extinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second - how totally cool would it be to go to the zoo and see a woolly rhino or mammoth? It would be like a trip back in time. This coolness factor is potentially important - cool science that sparks the imagination is important to getting children interested in science, and to continue public support (i.e. funding) of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resurrecting the woolly mammoth, if played properly, could inspire a generation of biologists and geneticists the way the moon landings inspired a generation of engineers and astronomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not saying science is only important when it is dramatic and entertaining. But when we have such science that is accessible to the public, it is an opportunity that should not be missed.&lt;/p&gt;

A young girl is accused of a heinous crime — use your imagination here, too, and think of the most horrible thing a person can do — and she is trapped in front of you, helpless. You have a rock in your hands. People around you are urging you to kill her; they say that you are justified in taking her life. What would you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say you don't have a rock, but are just part of the large crowd of spectators, witnessing a small group of men killing this girl. What would you do then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be honest now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to do kill anyone, and I would try to stop the killers. She could be an unrepentant mass murderer, and I couldn&amp;#39;t be an executioner — I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to sink to her level, and I think killing is an easy &amp;#39;solution&amp;#39; that solves nothing. At the same time, it reduces the humanity of the killers, and diminishes the quality of our culture. I may not be the target myself, but such acts harm me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That makes this story of a &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7708169.stm"&gt;13 year old girl stoned to death for adultery in Somalia&lt;/a&gt; incomprehensible to me. I know that people do evil all the time, but this was a mob of a thousand people watching 50 thugs murder someone in a particularly brutal fashion. Couldn't just a few have raised a voice in protest, couldn't some small fraction of that thousand intervened? Are the killers so divorced from empathy and morality that they would gladly snuff out the life of someone who can do them no harm?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s especially appalling is that the murderers weren&amp;#39;t driven by a fundamental human need — they didn&amp;#39;t kill her because they were defending themselves, or because they were starving, or because she had some real power that could harm them. She was killed because she offended their sense of sexual propriety. Because they perceived her as sexually potent, she challenged their own insecure, mouselike manhood. This is outrageously vile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even at that, she was an innocent. She was a 13 year old girl who had been &lt;i&gt;raped&lt;/i&gt; by three men, and for this she was dragged out, begging for her life, buried up to her neck, and then stoned to death by weak, blustering men who let their machismo overwhelm their humanity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, this was driven by Islamist delusions. Religion is excellent at elevating intangible, untestable lies to a higher plane of moral significance than something as real and as simple as the life of a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should also add, before everyone condemns this as simply the act of a primitive society, that the same impulse is at work right here in America. Those people who voted yes on Proposition 8 in California were simply performing a slightly more civilized version of casting a stone at those who offend their moral and religious sense of propriety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/god_and_sex_two_potent_ideas_t.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/444487208" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225987205252"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/ron-paul-will-now-take-your-questions/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/104469f166c5c7c5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="2008 election"/><category term="Interviews"/><category term="Q &amp; A"/><category term="Ron Paul"/><title type="html">Ron Paul Will Now Take Your Questions</title><published>2008-11-06T15:48:37Z</published><updated>2008-11-06T15:48:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/O57qdIkYhlY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/ron-paul-will-now-take-your-questions/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Congressman Ron Paul of Texas ran for president in the Republican primaries this year, raising more than $34 million and receiving more than 1.3 million votes.

It&amp;#39;s a plus when they confirm what you&amp;#39;ve said or add more information to the discussion, and it&amp;#39;s also wonderful when they correct you on errors. I think most scientists are getting the idea that blogs are tools to help disseminate scientific ideas to a wider audience than the science journals can. They certainly don&amp;#39;t replace the journals, but add a way to inject the results into the public sphere, where they can be part of a popular conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you do find scientists who don't quite get it. &lt;a href="http://isisthescientist.blogspot.com/2008/10/transition-to-day-light-savings-time.html"&gt;Dr Isis wrote a critique of a paper in the NEJM that reported a correlation between the change to daylight savings time and heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;; she thought the data was interesting, but the interpretations were sloppy. She pointed out some observations that were glossed over, suggested that some specific interpretations were a bit off, and listed some other articles on similar topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors took exception to the criticisms and &lt;a href="http://isisthescientist.blogspot.com/2008/10/response-from-janszky-and-ljung-dr-isis.html"&gt;left a comment&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, it wasn&amp;#39;t the kind of informative comment, pro or con, that advances an argument — it was more of a condescending dismissal that ignored her comments and suggested that she needed to learn some basic epidemiology. And then there was this bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There can be many other explanations and pathways not written here (again we had a strict limit). The reviewers and editors agreed to our interpretation as probably the most likely one. So were experts in this field all over the world who commented our study so far. We would actually encourage you to write a comment to NEJM. NEJM is well known for its devotion for scientific debates on recently published papers. &lt;b&gt;That would be a normal way to debate and discuss scientific findings. We would also have a possibility to answer on an "equal ground"&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part is a particularly annoying misconception. Peer review is only a first, preliminary hurdle for a paper to cross; passing peer review and getting published does not mean that your work is right. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/02/a_baffling_failure_of_peer_rev.php"&gt;Some incredibly awful papers get through the review process, somehow&lt;/a&gt;. Getting published only means that &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; your paper is going to be opened up to wider criticism. Don't take the attitude that publication means vindication; I know reviewers, and I've reviewed papers, and I know that reviewers are sometimes lazy, sometimes susceptible to croneyism, and &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; overworked, and that publication doesn't mean you are right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last part shows that the authors have the wrong idea about blogs. A blog post is different from a letter to NEJM; it can reach a much wider audience, for one thing, and uses a little more stylistic variety than dry academic writing to appeal to a larger group (Dr Isis is definitely guilty of that — she uses &lt;i&gt;humor&lt;/i&gt;, which is often sadly lacking in medical journals). I get the impression that the authors would prefer criticisms be made in the journal, not because it would directly target the best people able to understand the argument, but because it would limit the number of people who would see the disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attitude that this is the "normal" way to discuss science is also aggravating. It is a restrictive view that contributes to the popular conception of scientists as aloof and unengaged with the culture, and it's not true. We need to change the idea of normal so that talking about science over breakfast is normal, that having a conversation about science around the watercooler at work is normal, that guys at the bar get into arguments over science instead of football (sometimes) is normal. Change normal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, a blog &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; equal ground. The authors could have easily thrown in a few observations and explanations that supported their position, rather than treating Dr Isis like some ignorant nobody they could swat away by telling her to take a course in epidemiology. Explain your answers as you would to an undergrad or bright high school student. If you can't, it implies that you aren't looking for an equal opportunity, you are looking for a way to avoid probing questions.&lt;/p&gt;

However, I thought it was about time to get people up to date with some of the clerkships I've finished in the meantime before letting you guys in on some of the decision-making processes involved in choosing a residency.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, time to talk about pediatrics.  Pediatrics, despite a reputation for warmth and fuzziness, is a challenging field.  Kids aren't just little adults, and the treatment and diseases of infants are different than those of toddlers, which are different from pre-adolescents, which are different from the problems of teenagers and young adults.  It's an intense mixture of preventative medicine, diagnostics, and a lot of the intangible skills involved in getting the necessary information out of uncooperative patients and distressed parents.  One also has to remember that a pediatrician has to spot the rare very sick kid in a field of sniffles, coughs, and possibly malingering youngsters who just want out of school.  It's a helluva a field of medicine, and if anything it has made me more passionate about educating against anti-vaxxers and quacks.  For one pediatrics is critically dependent on prevention - which the anti-vax movement seeks to undermine with potentially dangerous consequences.  For another, many of the diseases of childhood when they do occur are serious - but imminently treatable if recognized.  The idea of a quack tinkering in this field without proper respect for the enormous amount of medicine involved, and potential for harm, is terrifying.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's talk about a set of pediatric cases and just to piss off the gun nuts, why it's a good thing that pediatricians screen for guns in homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's emphasize the differences between medicine in different age groups.  Because it's pediatrics the past medical history is easy - they have none.  Here are two cases, details altered, but both real patients I saw almost at the exact same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patient #1:  A 2.5-year-old male presents to the ED because her mom is concerned he is "puffy".  She sought care in a PCP's office 6 days ago who initially treated him for a potential allergic reaction with Benadryl and advised her to return if he did not get better.  The child has had no illnesses except for a cold 2 weeks ago, has met developmental milestones and is fully immunized. Mom has lost confidence in her PCP and now presents to UVA, very worried.  On physical exam the child appears to be alert, awake, in no acute distress, with completely normal physical exam except for puffiness - non-pitting edema in the extremities and face.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should we be concerned?  What tests would you order in this patient?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patient #2:  A 14.5 year old male presents to the ED with a camp counselor with complaint of fainting during band practice (it's summer and it's hot).  For the last week he has felt unwell, but has been continuing to go to practice and participating in activities.  He has had no other illnesses, is fully vaccinated and has a normal physical exam.  He has no other complaints except his eyes are "puffy".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should we be concerned? What tests would you order in this patient?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/11/pediatrics.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/11/pediatrics.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/444297211" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225973243169"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=813">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/759ae5d63d6037df</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Semantics"/><title type="html">"Cannot underestimate" = "must not underestimate"?</title><published>2008-11-06T12:04:49Z</published><updated>2008-11-06T12:04:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=813" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=807"&gt;recently noted&lt;/a&gt;, people often get confused about English phrases involving negatives combined with other negatives, modals, or scalar predicates, and there's a &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=site%3Aitre.cis.upenn.edu+overnegation&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq="&gt;series of Language Log posts&lt;/a&gt; that collectively offer several (non-exclusive) hypotheses for why this confusion is so easy to &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/000500.html"&gt;fail to miss&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/002719.html"&gt;Our poor monkey brains&lt;/a&gt; just can't deal with complex combinations of certain logical operators;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/000856.html"&gt;The connection between English and modal logic&lt;/a&gt; may involve some unexpected ambiguities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/002192.html"&gt;Negative concord is alive and well&lt;/a&gt; in English (or in UG);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odd things become idioms or at least verbal habits ("&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=site%3Aitre.cis.upenn.edu+%22could+care+less%22&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq="&gt;could care less&lt;/a&gt;"; "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=site%3Aitre.cis.upenn.edu+%22fail+to+miss%22&amp;amp;btnG=Search"&gt;fail to miss&lt;/a&gt;"; "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=site%3Aitre.cis.upenn.edu+%22still+unpacked%22&amp;amp;btnG=Search"&gt;still unpacked&lt;/a&gt;").&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday's post specifically involved expressions like "cannot underestimate X" or "X cannot be underestimated", as a way of saying that "X is very large or important"; and I followed &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004716.html"&gt;Lila Gleitman&lt;/a&gt; and many others in assuming that these phrases are examples of the class of common logical errors involving negation, modality, and scalar predication. We seem to be saying that X is so large that it&amp;#39;s impossible for us to underestimate it — that is, our estimate of X will always be greater than X, no matter how large our estimate is. And this will be true if X is rather small, which is not what we&amp;#39;re trying to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Now, when I say "common logical errors" I mean "things that people say or write a lot, which mean more or less the opposite of what their authors want to convey". Thus "cannot underestimate" gets 55,000 Google hits, and "can't underestimate" gets 284,000, and it looks like pretty much all of them have the meaning that I just claimed is a logical solecism. Similarly, the various forms of "fail to miss" get almost half a million hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#39;t mean that I&amp;#39;m wrong to call these phrases mistakes — there are a lot of web hits for common misspellings. Still, I got a few protests in the comments from sensible people who refuse to be persuaded that &amp;quot;cannot underestimate&amp;quot; is logically backwards, and so I thought I&amp;#39;d take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll start by reconstructing (what I think is) their argument, which is similar to one that &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000856.html"&gt;Barbara Wallraff made&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the many meanings of the English modal &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is one that the OED glosses "to be allowed to, to be given permission to" (OED sense 6.b.), and the AHD glosses "used to indicate that which is permitted" (AHD sense 2b.).  This sense is often viewed with alarm by those who feel that it's a mistaken colloquial substitution for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Thus the &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/76/C0057600.html"&gt;AHD entry&lt;/a&gt; has a usage note that begins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Generations of grammarians and teachers have insisted that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; should be used only to express the capacity to do something, and that &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; must be used to express permission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, this sense is common even in formal writing, especially in negatives. For example, in Volume 4 of &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2b-a_ZPIYscC"&gt;In Conversation with God&lt;/a&gt;, written by an Opus Dei priest named Francis Fernandez-Carvajal, and translated and published "With ecclesiastical approval", we're told that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In the way we dress, in personal hygience, when playing games, we cannot be careless about decorum and modesty. We cannot be seen in a place that is unbecoming for a good Christian, even though it is the fashion or most of our friends go there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  author and translator clearly do not mean to tell us that we lack the capacity to be careless about decorum and modesty, or to be seen in an unbecoming place — rather, their point is precisely that we do have the capacity to do these things, but we are not permitted, by religious principles, to exercise that capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it's a theorem of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontic_logic"&gt;deontic logic&lt;/a&gt; that if it's not permissible that A, then it's obligatory that not A; or in symbols&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¬PA  →  O¬A&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This follows straightforwardly from the fact that PA ("A is permissible") is defined as ¬O¬A ("not obligatory that not A"), and ¬¬O¬A becomes O¬A by cancellation of the double negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since "cannot" can mean "not be permitted to", while "must not" or "should not" can mean "be obliged not to", it somewhat confusingly follows that "cannot" sometimes means the same thing as "must not" or "should not".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is exactly true in the quote from Fernandez-Carvajal, where "We cannot be seen in a place that is unbecoming for a good Christian" and "We must not be seen in a place that is unbecoming for a good Christian" and "We should not be seen in a place that is unbecoming for a good Christian" all can be interpreted to mean essentially the same thing. Similarly, "We cannot be careless about decorum and modesty" is the same as "We must/should not be careless about decorum and modesty".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22cannot+be+careless%22&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq="&gt;Web search&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the particular phrase "cannot be careless", meaning "must not be careless" or "should not be careless", is a favorite with religious authors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;We have to differentiate between the singular and the plural form of a word; we cannot be careless about it. Sin and sins are different in the original language.&lt;br&gt;
…Allah (SWT) means we should keep our defence ready, we cannot be careless about the defence of the Muslim Ummah…&lt;br&gt;
Since we are told to spend much time in prayer, we cannot be careless and must strive to pray only as the Lord would have us to pray.&lt;br&gt;
We cannot be careless, thinking that we can say things rashly. […] We have to fear God and must not speak in a rash way.&lt;br&gt;
To know the word of God we must study the bible carefully: we cannot be careless when handling the word of God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, we find this in the translation of one of &lt;a href="http://www1.lanic.utexas.edu/project/castro/db/1996/19960214.html"&gt;Fidel Castro's speeches&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It is important that at the conclusion of the harvest we can say we have fulfilled our sugar production plans. That is why we cannot fail anywhere. We cannot be careless in any province. No sugarmill can be careless, and anytime a problem emerges, we must have a solution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, Castro is not saying that he and his hearers do not have the capacity to fail or to be careless, but rather that it is not permitted (by the principles of communist rather than catholic ethics) for them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when someone writes that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;We cannot be careless about our diets and assume that all is well with our bodies because we take every known vitamin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he is not claiming that being careless about diets is beyond our capacity, but rather that there is an ethical system, a system of permissions and obligations, that forbids us to do it. Here the ethical foundation is neither religious nor political, but rather scientific — the source is Donald Gray Cook, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GFQkKazGh2cC"&gt;The Science Book of Wonder Drugs&lt;/a&gt;, and it's something like the laws of biochemistry, rather than the word of God or the Communist Party line, that determines what is permitted or obligatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strange equivalence of "cannot" and "must not"  does not generalize to the cases where &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is used to mean "to have the power, ability or capacity". Thus the proverb "An empty sack cannot stand upright" doesn't mean that "An empty sack must not stand upright". And it's true that I can't hit a major league curve ball, but I refuse to believe that I shouldn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor does the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that is used to "express a possible contingency" generally allow the "cannot" = "must not" equivalence, since again, we don't use &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to express the right kind of necessity. Thus it turns out to be true that &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cannot be solved for integer n greater than 2 and non-zero integers a, b, c — but it would be quite odd to say that this equation must not be solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, let's go back to "cannot underestimate". Consider a random example from the web:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;You cannot underestimate the importance of link building to boost your website in the search rankings. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this means that link building is so important that you do not have the capacity to underestimate it, the author has clearly said the opposite of what he wants to say. Likewise, if it means that link building is so important that it's not logically possible for you to underestimate it, he's again gotten things backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On either of these construals, we're in the territory of hypothesis (1) in my list: our poor monkey brains just can't reliably cope with this combination of negation, modality, and scaling. If a particular expression of this kind becomes frequent enough, we might move into the area of hypothesis (4), since idioms need not be semantically compositional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But could the correct explanation be hypothesis (2)? Can the subtlety of modal logic rescue "cannot underestimate"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that idea to work, this "cannot" must involve the deontic &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the one that means &amp;quot;is permitted to&amp;quot;. And my reaction has always been that this is preposterous — in our chosen example, surely the author doesn&amp;#39;t mean to tell us that we&amp;#39;re not permitted to underestimate the importance of link building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or does he? As the examples about sugar cane and vitamins show, people sometimes talk about political and scientific systems as if they were ethical ones. Perhaps in this case, the author is, in effect, preaching to us about search engine optimization — treating it as as a system of permissions and obligations, in which what we cannot underestimate is therefore also what we must not underestimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not philosophically or temperamentally inclined to treat estimating the importance of link building (or, in the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=807"&gt;original example&lt;/a&gt;, of grassroots organizing) as a matter of morals. But your mileage, as they say, may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explanation also sheds new light on the real-world examples that &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004716.html"&gt;Lila Gleitman sent me&lt;/a&gt; last year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;(1) The importance of this position cannot be underestimated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;(2) The importance of this effect shouldn't be overestimated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) came from one of Lila's papers, and her friend Barbara Landau teased her about this logical mistake. (2) came from one of Barbara's papers, and was the basis of Lila's revenge. But in both cases, the context suggests that the authors were preaching to their readers about the positions and the effects in question; and as a result, perhaps these weren't mistakes after all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225966923315"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/say_it_aint_so_barack_say_you_aint_serio.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ed1a77128f81e175</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Say it ain't so, Barack!

That's one reason why I was very disturbed when I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/why_did_someone_have_to_kill_my_election.php"&gt;read a post&lt;/a&gt; on Election Day suggesting that antivaccinationist crank and activist extraordinaire, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., was being seriously considered for the position of Secretary of the Interior. Yes, in the comments a lot of you told me it was "almost certainly bullshit" or that Interior wouldn't be a bad place for him because he really "cares" about the environment. Never mind that he's a booster of pseudoscience, a hothead prone to comparing political enemies to Hitler and Mussolini, and a lawyer whose science background appears to be primarily torturing science to fit his agenda more than anything else. I started to rest easy for a while, convinced that the report was nothing more than idle speculation or a trial balloon. I really hoped that Obama would not jeopardize his promise to take science seriously and depoliticize it by appointing someone who would trample on science just as much as the worst ideologues in the Bush Administration, the only difference being that he'd stomp on it with his left foot instead of his right foot, if you know what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I'm not resting so easy anymore. There are now &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en-us&amp;amp;q=obama+rfk+jr+epa&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8"&gt;several reports&lt;/a&gt; that RFK, Jr is being considered for an even worse position, a position where he could do incalculable mischief and at the same time provide credible ammunition to Republicans that the complaints of Democratics that science was politicized under the Bush Administration were hypocritical, given that Kennedy has been politicizing science with gusto and pushing pseudoscience ever since I can remember. I'm talking about numerous &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1108/15320.html"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that RFK, Jr. is &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/11/05/robert-f-kennedy-environm_n_141454.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;being considered to be tapped to &lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href="http://www.mlive.com/us-politics/index.ssf/2008/11/obama_considers_stars_for_cabi.html"&gt;run the Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;. He has even been quoted on that repository of all things antivaccine, &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;, as saying "&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/11/05/robert-kennedy-jr-on-obam_n_141506.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;if asked, I will serve&lt;/a&gt;." Meanwhile, antivaccinationists like Generation Rescue founder &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/11/rfk-jr-to-head.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;J. B. Handley&lt;/a&gt; are salivating at the prospect, and, betraying liberal claims to be part of the "reality-based" community, the denizens of Democratic Underground are (mostly) &lt;a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=show_mesg&amp;amp;forum=389&amp;amp;topic_id=4385234&amp;amp;mesg_id=4385234"&gt;orgasmic at the prospect&lt;/a&gt; of an RFK, Jr.-led EPA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say it ain't so, Barack! Please don't do it. It would be a huge mistake so early in your administration. By appointing such a strident and die-hard advocate of pseudoscience, in one fell swoop, you would seriously damage your credibility as a pro-science President and leave yourself open to charges that you're just as willing to politicize science as the Bush Administration was.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/say_it_aint_so_barack_say_you_aint_serio.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/say_it_aint_so_barack_say_you_aint_serio.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/444224214" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225954821381"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/385d6ce88bb89bfd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Stranger Danger</title><published>2008-11-06T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2008-11-06T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/crime/prevent/doorpound.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">E-mail warns about the dangers of opening your door to strangers claiming to be in distress.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225949663074"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/11/05/aurora-cam/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ffbba164733bfc50</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><title type="html">Aurora cam</title><published>2008-11-06T05:24:45Z</published><updated>2008-11-06T05:24:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/11/05/aurora-cam/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;How awesome is this? &lt;a href="http://salmon.nict.go.jp/awc/live/index_n_e.php"&gt;A live webcam in Alaska that shows the aurorae&lt;/a&gt;!

(The Supreme Court &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122583967017598695.html"&gt;took up this question yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.) However, my post doesn't offer any suggestions for how to get a clear look at what the F-word does contribute to a discourse. Though I don't have results for the F-word in particular, I do have results for more mildly-taboo items, including English &lt;em&gt;damn&lt;/em&gt; and the Chinese intensive &lt;em&gt;tama(de)&lt;/em&gt;. (I'm hoping that this follow-up post allays any fears Geoff Pullum might have that I now see &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003299.html"&gt;language as&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000256.html"&gt;a big bag of words&lt;/a&gt;…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a clear look at what expressives like the F-word contribute, we need to know about the circumstances under which they were produced. Here in UMass Amherst Linguistics, we've  been &lt;a href="http://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/TMxNGMzN/"&gt;studying expressives in corpora of online product reviews&lt;/a&gt; in which each text is associated with a rating, one-star through five-stars. The ratings approximate linguistically important aspects of the author's emotional/attitudinal state while writing. These collections don't contain the F-word, but they contain plenty of other expressives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;em&gt;damn&lt;/em&gt;, the overall picture is this: it is  significantly more frequent in the extreme reviews — the  angry one-star reviews and the exuberant five-star reviews — than it is in the more ambivalent two-to-five star reviews. Here is a picture, using the same statistical methods employed in &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=677"&gt;this post about affective demonstratives&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/damn-amazon-review-glm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/damn-amazon-review-glm.jpg" alt="&amp;#39;damn&amp;#39; on Amazon.com" width="375" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gray line is a quadratic regression. The numbers point to the conclusion that this is a good model, thereby validating the U-shaped impression of the empirical log-odds distribution (the black dots). (We've shifted the five-star ratings over by three to get a better picture of where the turning point of the curve is.) The linear fit (dashed line) is poor. Results like this suggest that &lt;em&gt;damn&lt;/em&gt; is a marker of heightened emotion, though one that doesn't say much about whether that emotion is positive or negative.  Other English items that have distributions like this are &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;wow&lt;/em&gt;, and sequences of exclamation points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some expressives do, of course, bias for one emotional polarity or another. The &lt;a href="http://singaporeangle.blogspot.com/2005/07/lu-xun-on-chinese-national-swear.html"&gt;Chinese national swear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;tāmā&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;de&lt;/em&gt;) is a nice example of a mild expressive with a negative bias:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/tama-myprice-glm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/tama-myprice-glm.jpg" alt="&amp;#39;tama&amp;#39; in MyPrice.com.cn" width="375" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the linear fit is good; the frequency drops off steadily as the reviews get more positive. (My thanks to my coauthor &lt;a href="http://people.umass.edu/nconstan/"&gt;Noah Constant&lt;/a&gt; for collecting the corpus from &lt;a href="http://www.myprice.com.cn/homepage/"&gt;MyPrice.com.cn&lt;/a&gt; and analyzing the expressives in it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure whether the F-word would look more like &lt;em&gt;damn&lt;/em&gt; or more like &lt;em&gt;tāmā&lt;/em&gt;. One the one hand, the F-word clearly has positive uses, and it can  be used exclamatively, as Bono and &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=801#fnPhillies"&gt;Chase Utley&lt;/a&gt; showed us. On the other hand, it might be caustic enough to show a significant bias for negativity, perhaps dropping off in frequency sooner than &lt;em&gt;tāmā&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The election stole the spotlight from everything else, so there really hasn't been much to write on. The creationists have been shoved out of the spotlight. Astronomy news doesn't come as frequently anymore since I'm not constantly reading journals after graduation. So there really hasn't been much to say. And if there is, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/"&gt;that crazy bald guy&lt;/a&gt; seems to always beat me to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now all the political nonsense is out of the way, I'll try to post a bit more frequently.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/25327006-3241246645845884466?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225928078673"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=811">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9c4752a8dbf01629</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Lost in Translation"/><title type="html">Nibble His Chicken</title><published>2008-11-05T23:32:28Z</published><updated>2008-11-05T23:32:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=811" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you were a foreigner walking down the street in a Chinese city and you passed the restaurant below, you would do a double-take, because the familiar KFC has morphed into KFG, and Colonel Sanders doesn't look quite right.  But if you were a Chinese walking down the street and passed by the same restaurant, you would do a triple-take, because the familiar 肯德基 (KEN3 ["consent; agree; be willing"]DE2 ["virtue"]JI1["foundation; base"]), which is simply a phonetic transcription of "Kentucky," has become 啃他雞 (KEN3 ["nibble; gnaw"] TA1 ["he, him, his"] JI1 ["chicken"]), with a blatant double entendre on the last syllable (referring to the male of the species).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This obvious infringement of a famous brand is merely one instance of a very widespread phenomenon in China, numerous examples of which are documented &lt;a href="http://www.chinasmack.com/pictures/funny-and-clever-chinese-shanzhai-brands/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such linguistic machinations and design manipulations are altogether different from the Chinglish gaffes that we have studied from time to time on LL.  Whereas the latter are inadvertent, this type of trademark piracy is entirely intentional.  Sometimes the piracy is done crudely, sometimes cleverly.  Often the results are hilarious, and it is surprising how frequently the fake brand names are vulgar, such as when "White Cat [Detergent]" (BAI2MAO1 白猫) is transformed into "F*ck Cat [Detergent]" (RI4MAO1 日猫).  The use of RI4 日 ("sun") to express a slang term that I have heard on countless occasions in Sichuan is a good example of how seemingly innocent characters can be utilized for the filthiest swear words.  Before long, I shall write about the rather amazing applications of NIU2 牛.  For the present moment, I'll simply close by mentioning that the proliferation of knockoffs and ripoffs in China is commonly attributed to SHAN1ZHAI4 山寨 ("mountain stronghold / fortress") entrepreneurs, SHAN1ZHAI4 referring to the lairs of bandits who are outside the law.&lt;/p&gt;

Sure, it's fun to play &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeboat_ethic"&gt;the lifeboat game&lt;/a&gt;, but when you're dealing with flesh and blood human beings on a daily basis,  games aren't all that helpful.  So here's a non-life-and-death question:  if a patient comes to see you and smells of alcohol, can you add an alcohol level to their blood work without specifically informing them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethical discussions are best held as, well, discussions, so I'll lay out some ethical principles and let you discuss before I weigh in further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, any patient who comes to see a doctor signs a "general consent for treatment" which usually contains a phrase such as: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I request and authorize Health Care Services by my physician, and his/her designees as may deem advisable. This may include routine diagnostic, radiology and laboratory procedures and medication administration.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, for your reference, &lt;a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/2512.html"&gt;here is the summary&lt;/a&gt; of the AMA's code of medical ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, a brief list of the most agreed-upon basic principles of medical ethics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;Beneficence - acting in the best interest of the patient.&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;Non-maleficence - avoid harm to the patient&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;Autonomy - the patient has the right to refuse or choose their treatment&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;Justice---fair distribution or resources&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;Dignity&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;Truthfulness/informed consent&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that ethics aren't a checklist. Real life situations are just that---real, with real people.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, the thread is now open.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/11/how_drunk_is_too_drunkanother.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/443595421" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225915380594"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/11/05/alien-nation/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f1d0693397feda06</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Alien nation</title><published>2008-11-05T20:00:01Z</published><updated>2008-11-05T20:00:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/11/05/alien-nation/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is happy that Obama won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know what it does with you non-Americans. Those bits of geography don't seem to exist on this map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A charismatic new face appeared on the political scene, somebody who was honest and sympathetic and intelligent. So he was a little more religious than I liked; he's still a good man who promises to repair the damage of the former presidency. He's running against a relic of that previous corrupt administration, his campaign slogan is all about change, and I am so relieved to have a promising choice. I campaigned for him, I stayed up all night with my friends on election night cheering him on, and I woke up the next morning optimistic for the future, glad that we finally had a progressive president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, that wasn't this year's election. It was 1976, the very first presidential election in which I was eligible to vote, and the candidate was Jimmy Carter, a man I still think was probably the most honorable and decent president of the 20th century. But optimism and good intentions were not, are not enough. What followed Carter's election was well-meaning bumbling, a dismal and unaccomplished presidency, and Ronald Reagan, the catastrophe that paved the road to our current state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This election was so much like that one, only even more so. And I dread the possibility that jubilation will lead to complacency, that moderation will produce stasis, and that what will follow an Obama presidency could be something far, far worse than we can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So no, no ebullience from me, no brief relaxation into celebration. I'm charging up my cattle prod, because I want to goose the Obama administration into actually getting something done in the coming years. I think Obama &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; be a great president, especially since greatness in that office is measured by the magnitude of the challenges faced (which are off the scale), and the ability of the leader to rise to them. There is reason to have hope, but hope doesn't get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years from now I don't want to be praising Obama by commenting on his generosity and his &lt;a href="http://www.habitat.org/how/carter.aspx"&gt;carpentry skills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/context.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/443549494" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225911650238"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4040">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f4b6ced1d371bcac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Chat"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Stuff You'll Like"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition 11.5</title><published>2008-11-05T19:00:20Z</published><updated>2008-11-05T19:00:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4040" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eabf0397d6a4639a524a2211391c2d47&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Election craziness is finally behind us!

&lt;p&gt;Let’s end this poltical season with some logical fallacy fun! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politcal campaigns are rife with logically fallacious arguments. Some are fun to pick apart, some are so awful you can’t bang your head against your desk hard enough to knock the newly-implanted stupid out of it. But you’ve got to have some favorites. So…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your favorite logical fallacies? Which ones do you like to use yourself? Which are your favorite to refute.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Elyse</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225910919009"><id gr:original-id="http://badidea.wordpress.com/?p=662">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ddc762f1fd0eb784</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheism"/><category term="Barack Obama"/><category term="Blogging"/><category term="Christianity"/><category term="Culture"/><category term="Election"/><category term="election-2008"/><category term="God"/><category term="John McCain"/><category term="McCain"/><category term="Media"/><category term="News"/><category term="Obama"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Religion"/><category term="bigotry"/><category term="Obama victory"/><category term="Palin"/><category term="Sarah Palin"/><title type="html">Obama-Fan Ruins the Moment</title><published>2008-11-05T18:48:23Z</published><updated>2008-11-05T18:48:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://badidea.wordpress.com/2008/11/05/obama-fan-ruins-the-moment/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://badidea.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I know I’ve been silent for a while, but I have a good excuse… which I won’t tell you.  Suffice to say that the end of the election has something to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, after a one of the happiest nights of hugging strangers that I’ve ever had, I was driving home and listening to some woman on NPR going on about what the Obama victory means for America. It went a little something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Never thought I’d live to see, etc… and this is a victory against bigotry.  Against sarcasm.  Against….uh… against atheism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost drove off the road.  Leave alone the fact that that last comment doesn’t make a lick of sense politically (yeah, all us Sarah Palin-loving atheists!), but how exactly does your perception of reality become so twisted that you can possibly work waxing poetic against the evils of bigotry into the same speech that you smear non-belief and non-believers?  Isn’t that a form of bigotry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I shouldn’t too hard on the woman: maybe, like so many others, words fail her in what is a tremendously emotional time.&lt;/p&gt;

Creationist brains, already in a state of disarray, are already predisposed to this kind of inanity, so don't be too shocked at what &lt;a href="http://timpanogos.wordpress.com/2008/11/05/is-our-children-learning-science-o-woe-is-texas/"&gt;Cynthia Dunbar, creationist, Christian, and member of the Texas State Board of Education has to say&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we can imagine the blatant disregard for our Constitution, but what other threats does an Obama administration pose? We have been clearly warned by his running mate, Joe Biden, that America will suffer some form of attack within the first 6 months of Obama's administration. However, unlike Joe, I do not believe this "attack" will be a test of Obama's mettle. Rather, I perceive it will be a planned effort by those with whom Obama truly sympathizes to take down the America that is threat to tyranny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Obama is going to have the terrorists he loves so much carry out some awful action, which will excuse the use of martial law and the subsequent abridgment of our constitutional rights.

&lt;p&gt; Anyway, it's a good day to be a liberal. As you all know by now, it was Obama in an absolute landslide. He won by a huge margin in the electoral vote, and by a good margin in the popular vote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Democrats also kicked Elizabeth Dole and John Sununu out of the senate, which is wonderful. But they didn't take enough seats to get
past a filibuster in the Senate. This means that we can expect to see a really dramatic level of obstructionism from the remaining Republicans in the senate. And based on various comments that he made, I think we can count on Holy Joe Lieberman to join in with the right-wingers in blocking the Senate from getting anything done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; There are a few interesting things that I wanted to comment on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/images/Chandrayaan-1_lunar_transfer_orbit_ISRO_H.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/11/chandrayaan-1_lto.jpg" alt="Chandrayaan-1 LTO"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been orbiting the Earth since its launch on October 22. Technically, it still is orbiting the Earth, but this new LTO is a highly elliptical path that takes the probe very close to the Moon. On November 8, Chardrayaan-1 will fire its thrusters again, and that will slow it enough to achieve lunar orbit. From there, it will settle down into a much lower, more circular orbit, and then the fun begins as it maps our nearest neighbor in space. I’m really looking forward to the images and science it will return!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225904026545"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/11/looks_like_the_samesex_marriag.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d020124143714961</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Looks Like the Same-Sex Marriage Amendment Passed</title><published>2008-11-05T15:36:26Z</published><updated>2008-11-05T15:36:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/443362384/looks_like_the_samesex_marriag.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/11/looks_like_the_samesex_marriag.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here in California, the &lt;a href="http://www.southparkzone.com/episodes/712/All-about-the-Mormons?.html"&gt;Mormons&lt;/a&gt; poured millions into an initiative constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, after the California Supreme Court found a right to marry in the State's Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

This is part of a national college speaking tour that draws from and promotes Bob Avakian's new book, "AWAY WITH ALL GODS! Unchaining the Mind and Radically Changing the World", and here's what she'll be talking about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freethinking activist Sunsara Taylor will explore the questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is believing in gods actually harmful? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How has Christianity for centuries served as an ideology of conquest and subjugation? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is the "Bible Belt" in the U.S. also the "lynching belt"? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the intensifying conflict between U.S. imperialism and Islamic fundamentalism, is the only choice to take one side or the other? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is patriarchy and the oppression of women foundational to so many religions? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can people be good without god?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Unlike some of my science-blogging colleagues, I prefer to keep my personal politics separate from my advocacy of science and skepticism. But I do want to make a few politically-neutral observations about yesterday’s election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what side of the political spectrum one resides and whether or not your candidate won - it is alway wondrous every four years to watch the process itself unfold. There are occasional glitches, but for the most part, the voters express their desires and that is the final word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, after a hard-fought campaign, John McCain graciously conceded defeat to Barack Obama, called on his supporters to now come together behind the new president, and pledged to work with him. Shortly after that, Obama declared victory and emphasized his desire to represent all of America, not just those who voted for him. Yes - this is the standard rhetoric that is expected of acceptance speeches - but that itself speaks powerfully of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 20th 2009 there will be a peaceful and orderly transition of government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This election also seems to mark a trend that I hope will continue - the restoration of science to its proper place within the wheels of government. Science needs to be a transparent meritocratic system. Governmental decisions that involve scientific questions should be informed by the best unbaised science available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This relationship has eroded over the last seven years to one in which ideology dictates science, where the flow of information is backwards. I hope that recent history serves as a reminder of the follies of this approach, and that the backlash against it will result in an appreciation and respect for the necessary role of science in government even greater than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedebate2008.com/www/index.php"&gt;Science Debate 2008&lt;/a&gt; was one manifestation of this backlash, and I hope that it becomes a permanent fixture in American elections.  I further hope that Obama lives up to the promises he made in his answers to the 14 questions given to him by SD2008 - which include increasing the role of science advisors to the president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific community, including science bloggers and popularizers, needs to keep the pressure on. Science is too important to allow it to become a victim of political ideology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama is a conservative/centrist Democrat who will at best implement a small shift in American policies — he hasn&amp;#39;t promised any strong change in Iraq, and his health care plans are an incremental improvement over the existing situation. And the opposition is shrieking &amp;quot;socialist!&amp;quot; at every suggestion, so don&amp;#39;t expect an easy road to accomplishing even the centrist plans of President Obama…especially since he&amp;#39;s inheriting the wreckage of 8 years of Bush misrule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He still has to work with a self-interested, triangulating congress made up of many of the same Democrats and Republicans who have collaborated with Bush in screwing over America for the last eight years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're still afflicted with the curse of religiosity as a political prerequisite, and Obama has strengthened it. That is a poison that will harm us over the long term; we may have made the more rational choice in this one election, but reinforcing the potency of irrationality will come back to bite us over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media isn't helping. The news this morning was all a-babble over a "post-racial America". Nonsense. A significant minority still hates people over the color of their skin, and you know the skinheads are cleaning their rifles right now. This self-congratulatory nonsense distracts us from the real problems that still exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still have the rot of ignorance and hatred in the American electorate. Proposition 8 won. Saxby Chambliss won. Michele Bachmann won. Norm Coleman might yet win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not dancing in the street yet. I'm anticipating many years of struggle ahead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/the_glass_is_half_empty.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/443244155" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225894825769"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/rain_man_or_does_rainfall_cause_autism.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9d2bbf08c680e752</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Rain man?

&lt;p&gt;One non-political thing that this election has reminded me of is that when you've been blogging as long as I have (nearly four years now--almost as long as a Presidential term!--assuming you're good and have found a niche in the blogosphere, you can become one of the "go-to" bloggers for certain subjects. Even though I've taken on the pseudonym (and, some might say, the persona) of a cranky talking computer with a bad attitude that looked like a cheap Plexiglas box of multicolored blinking lights and was featured in a 30 year old British science fiction series that was known for its fantastic plots but BBC-level low budget sets recycled from old &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; episodes, in person I'm nowhere near as arrogant as my namesake, who was known for his amazing feats of condescension towards his human owners. On the other hand, I do realize that I'm quite a good blogger and writer. I also realize that I've occupied a certain niche in the medical and skeptical blogosphere that's remained fairly unique even now, covering medicine, science, skepticism, and even Holocaust denial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Into this rather strange mix that, oddly enough, has held together over the years, is an interest in the cult of antivaccinationism (these days led by that ex-Playmate, former gross-out comedienne Jenny McCarthy) that believes that somehow, someway, mercury in vaccines causes autism or vaccines themselves cause autism. This belief persists despite virtually no scientific support and against multiple lines of evidence, including large epidemiological studies, that have looked for and utterly failed to find a detectable correlation between either mercury in vaccines and autism or between vaccines in general and autism. An unexpected development of my interest in antivaccine lunacy and the quackery that flows from that lunacy has been an interest in the science of autism and what causes the condition. Consequently, one of the topics for which I've become a "go-to" blogger is dubious autism science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it came as no surprise that a number of my readers have e-mailed me about a story about a rather odd little study about autism. Actually, it was a bit of a surprise when the first e-mail arrived, mainly because I hadn't known that this study was in the pipeline or that it had been published, but soon I became aware that David Kirby was using it as "exoneration" and my usual sources started to weigh in. To some extent I was blindsided on this one, but I quick. So what is this story that's buried my e-mail in box under, oh, around a dozen e-mails or so? (Hey, this isn't &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;, you know. I don't get hundreds of e-mails about &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were stories in &lt;a href="http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2008/11/study-links-rai.html"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27536036/"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt; about a &lt;a href="http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/162/11/1026"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that concluded that rain causes autism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/rain_man_or_does_rainfall_cause_autism.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/rain_man_or_does_rainfall_cause_autism.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/443258228" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225893264062"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=806">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a95e6968eaca3b4d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and politics"/><title type="html">Obama is the Y of Z</title><published>2008-11-05T13:52:16Z</published><updated>2008-11-05T13:52:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=806" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've commented several times on the rhetorical template X is the Y of Z ("&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003394.html"&gt;X as the Y of Z&lt;/a&gt;", 7/28/2006; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005495.html"&gt;X as the Y of Z, again&lt;/a&gt;", 3/25/2008), and several others have &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22X+is+the+Y+of+Z%22&amp;amp;btnG=Search"&gt;joined us&lt;/a&gt;. Following Barack Obama's historic victory in yesterday's election, it occurred to me to wonder which versions of this pattern would be instantiated over the next few news cycles. The first one that I've seen was produced by John F. Harris and Jim Vendehei at 5:28 a.m.("&lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1108/15300_Page2.html"&gt;A new world order&lt;/a&gt;", Politico, 11/5/2008):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Obama is the Google of politics: He has technological expertise and an audience his political competitors simply cannot match. Looking ahead to 2010, House and Senate Democrats will be jealously eyeing Obama’s e-mail lists and technology secrets — giving him even greater leverage over them. Republicans will be forced to invest serious money and time to narrow the technology gap.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This one is effective, but not strikingly original, since "X is the Google of Y" long ago became common enough to be discussed as a meme ("&lt;a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/03/google-as-symbol-of-excellence.html"&gt;Google as a Symbol of Excellence&lt;/a&gt;", 3/31/2007):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;When you want to say that a company is a leader in a field or has the best products, you say it's the Google of that field. If you search for "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22*+is+the+google+of+*%22&amp;amp;num=100"&gt;* is the Google of *&lt;/a&gt;", you'll find a lot of services and companies compared to Google.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explanation of the metaphor is different, and seemed wrong to me — Harris and Vandehei emphasized not just leadership but also &amp;quot;technological expertise and … audience&amp;quot;. But the first page of the cited search includes &amp;quot;Potash is the Google of fertilizer&amp;quot;, so go figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, the recently concluded campaign produced many interesting variants applied to both candidates. One of my favorites was "&lt;a href="http://joehillfiction.com/?p=378"&gt;John McCain is the Jud Crandall of America&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; — though this one requires familiarity with the movie &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098084/quotes"&gt;Pet Sematary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the easiest pattern to search for — most of the hits are things like &amp;quot;is the 44th president of the United State&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;is the embodiment of this American dream&amp;quot;. So if you come across genuine instances of &amp;quot;X is the Y of Z&amp;quot; applied to the current political landscape, please put them in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225891512695"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10900970.post-404972842635478874">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5facb9921c3fc926</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Assholes</title><published>2008-11-05T12:52:00Z</published><updated>2008-11-05T12:52:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2008/11/assholes.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/" type="html">Fucking intolerant, bigoted, douchebag Mormon, asshole Templeton, religious, backward, archaic, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_state_elections,_November_2008#Proposition_8"&gt;homophobes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yes, I'm psyched that Obama won, but I'm really pissed that Prop. 8 passed in California - even though I'm Canadian and not gay.

&lt;p&gt;That’s right, it’s time again for the anthropology blog carnival that brings together the best posts of of the last two weeks or so for your reading enjoyment.  You can visit the official &lt;a href="http://fourstonehearth.net/"&gt;Four Stone Hearth&lt;/a&gt; Page where you will see future editions, such as &lt;a href="http://www.moneduloides.com/"&gt;Moneduloides &lt;/a&gt;on November 19th, or sign up to host in the future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here’s the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll start off with &lt;a href="http://remotecentral.blogspot.com/2008/11/human-evolution-on-trial-indo-europeans.html"&gt;Remote Central&lt;/a&gt;, offering a post called Human Evolution on Trial - Indo-Europeans.  Guest blogger Terry Toohill offers one part of a multi-post discussion on linguistics and archaeology as they relate to human diversification and migration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Part II we have looked in some detail at several geographic margins of the human distribution. Our examination of both the Polynesian and Indo-European ancestors of the New Zealand population showed that human migration, language replacement and gene flow has been virtually continuous for at least the last five to ten thousand years. This process has led to the patterns we see for the development of races and diversification into tribes, sometimes speaking different languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar topic can be found over at &lt;a href="http://anthropology.net/2008/10/31/on-the-genetic-similarities-linguistic-diversity-of-the-people-from-the-bismarck-archipelago-bougainville-melanesia/"&gt;Anthropology.net&lt;/a&gt;, which has an article titled On The Genetic Similarities &amp;amp; Linguistic Diversity Of The People From The Bismarck Archipelago &amp;amp; Bougainville, Melanesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earliest inhabitants of the area arrived around 40,000 years ago, but there was an additional migration into the region about 3,300 years ago. We know that primarily because of the linguistic diversity. The two major languages are Oceanic and Papuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://anthropology.net/2008/10/17/neandertal-broad-noses-due-to-lower-face-prognathism/"&gt;&lt;span style="float:right;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://anthropologynet.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/inetercanine-breadth-of-neandertal-skull.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=262&amp;amp;h=262" alt="" width="300" height="262"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Anthropology.net&lt;/a&gt; brings a second interesting article dealing with physical anthropology. Neanderthal Broad Noses Due to Lower Face Prognathism offers a discussion of the nature of Neanderthal nasal physiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this may sound like adaptionist mumbo-jumbo, but researchers have observed these adaptations to cold climate in other animals. Compare the profiles of polar bears, walruses, and mammoths to cheetahs, antelopes, and giraffes, and you’ll see how some of this makes sense&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;a href="http://archaeozoo.wordpress.com/2008/07/02/integrating-phytoliths-within-use-wearresidue-studies-of-stone-tools/"&gt;Archaeozoo&lt;/a&gt;, one finds the sort of in depth archaeological analysis the dite often presents.  This time, the author digs into phytoliths and lithic use markings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sites have a sequence of volcanic tephras with a well-developed soil in the upper horizon of each. The volcanic events have been dated by radiocarbon. The tephras have been sourced and cross correlated by macroscopic and geochemical techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://archaeoastronomy.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/questions-answered/"&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/1/2733473_95b35b1369_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Archaeoastronomy &lt;/a&gt;returns from a bit of a hyatus in order to answer some readers’ questions, I might suggest not citing this page in your freshmen term papers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Equinox is a small marsupial found in Australia. It’s four-legged, about twelve inches high off the ground and looks a bit like a cross between a horse and an ox, hence the name &lt;em&gt;Equine&lt;/em&gt; Ox&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Martin at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2008/10/classifying_an_archaeologist.php"&gt;Aardvarchaeology &lt;/a&gt;offers a more serious post, discussing his being labeled as a new archaeologist, and the actual differences between current types of archaeology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d like to say that I am neither a culture-historical, a New nor a post-processual archaeologist. I’m science friendly, I’m hostile to untestable speculation, and above all I’m hostile to jargon, such as that of the aesthetic disciplines in the humanities. But I fail to see any radical “paradigm shifts” in the history of my discipline, and I believe all interpretive determinism to be unscientific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jlowe, the archaeologist not the super mommy, writes at &lt;a href="http://whereinthehellami.blogspot.com/2008/11/tas-meetings.html"&gt;Where the Hell Am I&lt;/a&gt;.  Currently, he is blogging on the Texas Archaeological Society Meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I got to drink a lot of beer, meet some new people and catch up with some old friends, and I learned stuff! I also found out that Lubbock is really boring and ate almost no vegetables all weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a bit more of actual content and informattion in there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:right;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://middlesavagery.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/platform_001.jpg?w=200&amp;amp;h=255" alt="" width="200"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I love Catalhoyuk.  I am not a neolithicist or really that intersted in prehistory, but the site is close to me because my friends dig there, and some of the outreach carried out under Hodder is very cool.  &lt;a href="http://middlesavagery.wordpress.com/2008/11/03/catalhoyuk-in-second-life-mikes-horned-platform/"&gt;Middle Savagery&lt;/a&gt; offers a look at some of the work that goes into this, with a brief post on some of the second life construction being carried out at Catalhoyuk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m slowly getting better with the building tools in Second Life.  The platform’s texture is actually from the wrong building, and the horns are “concrete” textured, but it’s a start.  I have to make the features of the building before I can burn them, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroanthropology offers up two articles this Four Stone Hearth.  The first, looks at the use of the term “&lt;a href="http://neuroanthropology.net/2008/10/30/anthropologies/"&gt;Anthropologies&lt;/a&gt;“, and its possible substitution for “cultures”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really like this use of “anthropologies,” and the fact that it got past the copy editors at the Times must mean that they assume it has enough common meaning for people to grasp some general concept behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, an article discussing a film clip and &lt;a href="http://neuroanthropology.net/2008/10/28/multimodal-redundancy/#more-1555"&gt;multimodal redundancy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why am I posting this clip on Neuroanthropology, I dare to pretend to hear you ask? It’s because of the multimodal redundancy of audio and visual signals that link socio-cultural history with neural processes through the ongoing construction of meaning from the musical sounds observed and dance moves heard. a ‘faite-totale’! (sp?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my major areas of interst in archaeology is provenance of artifacts and sites and how we use them today.  In Mexico, archaeologists are attemtping to bring legal recourse against concert organizers for staging an event in the site of &lt;a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/world/10/04/1004mexconcerts.html"&gt;Chichen Itza&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;MERIDA, Yucatan — Placido Domingo’s concert at the Mayan ruins of Chichen Itza tonight is being billed as “the world’s greatest tenor at one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World,” a claim few lovers of opera or history would dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some Mexicans question whether the show should go on at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there have been a number of articles recently on the earliest occurences of archaeological remains of specific types.  This is always a big issue in archaeology, because it’s a great way to be known among other things.   I offer up links to some of the origional articles, so that you can be the judge of the validity of these claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oldest &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27240370"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international team of scientists has just identified what they believe is the world’s first known dog, which was a large and toothy canine that lived 31,700 years ago and subsisted on a diet of horse, musk ox and reindeer, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest creation of &lt;a href="http://africa.reuters.com/odd/news/usnTRE49P27P.html"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, published in a recent edition of Quaternary Science Reviews, mapped 12 archaeological layers at Gesher Benot Yaaqov in northern Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oldest &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/11/081103-hebrew-text.html"&gt;“Hebrew”&lt;/a&gt; text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3,000-year-old pottery shard with five lines of text was found during excavations of the Elah Fortress, the oldest known biblical-period fortress, which dates to the tenth century B.C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so maybe I made it a bit obvious to see which I am a bit ambivulent about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/images/thumbs/081103-hebrew-text_170.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="119"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you too can have your articles in any edition of Four Stone Hearth.  Just go to the site of the next host or &lt;a href="http://fourstonehearth.net/"&gt;Four Stone Hearth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s not my opinion, obviously. It was &lt;a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/11/speaker-at-mccain-rally-says-non-christians-want-an-obama-win/"&gt;the opinion of Arnold Conrad&lt;/a&gt;, the former pastor of Grace Evangelical Free Church in Davenport, who took it upon himself at a McCain rally a few weeks ago, to warn God of the implications of an Obama win: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are millions of people around this world praying to their god—whether it’s Hindu, Buddha, Allah—that [John McCain’s] opponent wins, for a variety of reasons. And Lord, I pray that you will guard your own reputation, because they’re going to think that their God is bigger than you, if that happens,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK, well ignoring for now that Allah is just another name for the God that the Jews, Christians and Muslims all worship, and that Hindu and Buddha are not gods anyway, what can we conclude from last night’s Obama victory? Presumably that the Christian god is smaller than that of the other religions. According to pastor Conrad, anyway. And he should know, being a pastor and all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, prayer has no effect on anything. Perhaps any Christians reading this can tell us which. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess we should all be grateful Conrad didn’t call on any &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; powerful gods. For example Thor, who &lt;a href="http://www.atheistnetwork.com/viewtopic.php?t=2213&amp;amp;sid=8fd28d611d1b3132d5953a84ec36998db"&gt;would have&lt;/a&gt; beaten them all with his big Smashum

&lt;p&gt;MSNBC and Fox News both give Obama 200 electoral votes at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add 55 for California, which Obama will take&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add 11 for Washington, which he will take&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a total of 266 electoral votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Obama takes one more state (two if he takes either Montana, South Dakota, or Alaska).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is almost certain he will take Hawaii (4 votes), Oregon (7 votes), and is ahead in Colorado and Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks pretty much like 270 plus at the current point.  There remains the possibility of some state switching, but the polls up to the election make it seem pretty clear.&lt;/p&gt;

I just got off my long shift as an election judge — I was filling in for Horton Township, a small, very rural precinct south of Morris, with a registered voting population of 114 people. The good news: 110 votes! The bad news: these guys broke 103:7 for McCain. Ewww. Now that I&amp;#39;m home, though, I see the news is saying Minnesota&amp;#39;s electoral votes are going for Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what else is new? What excitement/dismay/horror are you experiencing as you watch the returns?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am vastly relieved to see that Obama has won a landslide victory, but I'm not going to say that I'm overjoyed. He's got a lot of work ahead of him, and I'm definitely not an uncritical supporter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re still waiting on the Franken/Coleman senate race here — it&amp;#39;s horribly close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposition 8 in California may pass.

If I'm still blogging four years from now, we'll see if I feel like morphing into a political blogger again, just for one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I found this nifty little widget that does the job for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, you can just keep coming back to this page to follow election night returns. Of course, it is MSNBC; so its projections may or may not be accurate, but over time it will have to tell the story, as more and more returns come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I suppose I'll have to think about analyzing that study that several of you have been sending to me while I'm watching the election returns. I have to admit, I haven't seen a study quite so bad in a while, so much so that I'm not sure I want to subject my brain to the pain just to provide blog material for your entertainment, edification, and enlightenment tomorrow. I go to great lengths for my readers, but I do have limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, hell, I'll probably do it, but it'll definitely take a couple of beers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/i_hadnt_planned_on_liveblogging_the_elec.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/442650203" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225843976792"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4006">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/97cb4fdd58a08883</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><category term="antibacterial"/><category term="cidal"/><category term="guardian angel"/><category term="soap"/><title type="html">Pope on a rope</title><published>2008-11-05T00:10:13Z</published><updated>2008-11-05T00:10:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4006" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4af58566587f868164f2085bcbfe08d8&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week I discovered something about my antibacterial soap, Cidal. I was amused and frankly a little shocked (given the secular nature of the UK) that the strap line on the packaging is…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/cidal.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/cidal.jpg" alt="" width="305" height="80"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get what they’re going for, sort of. In mythology a guardian angel is a heavenly creature which overlooks a particular individual. We’ve all seen It’s A Wonderful Life. The idea dates back to Plato and beyond, and although there isn’t a definitive modern agreement by religions on the existence of such beings, the theme endures. How many of you know someone who has had a brush with death or a lottery win and attributes it, even jokingly, to their guardian angel looking out for them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you have an angel looking after your body and soul. That’s sort of like soap! Without the soul part, and without any sort of consciousness (unless the ring around my bathtub has enough life in it to quicken the soap). Er…also, soap ebbs away the more you use it, and smells of grapefruit, unlike guardian angels who stick with you til death and smell of ambrose and nectar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular soap smells of grapefruit because it contains Citricidal, a “broad spectrum antimicrobial compound synthesized from the seeds and pulp of grapefruit.” According to &lt;a href="http://www.naturalingredient.org/files/Citricidal%20Brochure.pdf"&gt;this document&lt;/a&gt;, it’s an effective antibacterial agent, although it’s interesting that my instinct was to shun it because it’s ‘natural’. Foolish, if it works, and I believe it does. I don’t want to go into too much detail about backne and the horror that is the occasional cleavage zit, but suffice to say I prefer an antibacterial soap and I find that Cidal is effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My understanding is that the jury is somewhat out on this topic, with no clear evidence either way regarding the efficiacy of antibacterial soaps (let alone Cidal) in clearing or preventing body acne. I don’t really mind, as it works for me, is really cheap and smells great. I could probably use a regular grapefruit soap and get the same results but my supermarket doesn’t sell one. It doesn’t matter because the soap makes no claims in this regard. What is fascinating is that the one claim they choose to make is divine in nature.

&lt;p&gt;I saw this at Comic Con a few months ago, but it’s airing in England now. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKVLemud6Ug"&gt;It’s a one-minute long trailer for the Doctor Who Christmas special&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Cybermen! Woohoo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) I remember seeing a longer version of this at Comic Con. I may be mistaken, but we’ll see if a longer one surfaces. Either way, I’m looking forward to seeing new Who!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still gluing the fragments of my skull back together, and stuffing whatever brains I could find back in. Fortunately, a nice lady at the polling place helped me collect all the chunks and pieces, and she wrapped them in an old newspaper for me. Without her help, I probably wouldn’t have made it. (It’s surprisingly difficult to focus on the clean-up tasks after your head explodes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause of it all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was just too much for me to make an informed decision about &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; candidate and &lt;em&gt;every &lt;/em&gt;race and issue being contested. And when I encounter something complex, I tend to get explody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get wrong. The front of the ballot was easy. It had all the big races on it; president, senators, congressmen. You know, the ones we pay attention to. I mean, we’ve been force-fed this election for the last two years, so I knew those candidates. I was in no danger of suffering any head trauma yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before long I got to the smaller, more obscure races, and that’s when the cranial tremors began. Trying to process all the names and offices was impossible. I don’t know if anyone was watching, but I read the ballot, trying to maintain an informed look that said, “Hmmm . . . Yeah, this is not the first time I’ve heard of these people”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps Chester Handy would make a fine Commissioner in Precinct 3,” my contemplative face said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in my mind I was thinking, “What the hell’s a comptroller? What does a County School Trustee do exactly? Is Railroad Commissioner really a position we need to vote on? What’s the difference between a District Clerk and a County Clerk? How do you pronounce Ahmad Hussamassaouwan?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, alarm bells began to sound in my mind. My head was throbbing. It felt like a soda can that had been shaken up; just a nudge and brains would come spewing out of my ears. Then I turned the ballot to the page with all the local referendums and city and county propositions, and I got that nudge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh no! Four pages of referendums?!?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wait . . .vote &lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt; to do away with the old sewage treatment plan, or &lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt; to accept the new one?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Proposition G funnels sales tax on cigarettes into road repair and highway maintenance? So I want to vote for it? No against it? No for it? But Referendum 42 restructures commerce funding, doesn’t it? What if I vote &lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt; for both of them? And wasn’t there a Bond issue for that a couple pages ago?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt; on Prop 17 will create a fund for a new county court house? But &lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt; on Prop 76 will move the county seat to a city on the north side?!?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Aaaaarrrrrrrrrgggggghhhhh!!!!!!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KABOOM!!!&lt;/p&gt;

She says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What made Wallace so unpopular compared to Darwin is that he insisted that in science, evidence matters. Carl Sagan-style proclamations like “They’re out there! How could we be so arrogant as to think we are all alone!” do not become science just because they are proclaimed by scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the idea that Wallace was ever wildly unpopular is ridiculous, he was a grand old man of evolution and British science when he died.  Second, if Wallace insisted that evidence matters and O’Leary likes this, then I guess she considers this a strong vote for common ancestry and natural selection, both of which Wallace defended as vigorously as anyone.  We evolutionists win I guess.  Third, let’s have a look at what &lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/alfred-russel-wallace-on-why-mars-is-not-habitable/" rel="external "&gt;Wallace actually said&lt;/a&gt; about Lowell’s hypothesis that intelligent designers were the best explanations for the patterns he thought he saw on Mars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one great feature of Mars which led Mr. Lowell to adopt the view of its being inhabited by a race of highly intelligent beings, and, with ever-increasing discovery to uphold this theory to the present time, is undoubtedly that of the so-called ‘canals’–their straightness, their enormous length, their great abundance, and their extension over the planet’s whole surface from one polar snow-cap to the other. The very immensity of this system, and its constant growth and extension during fifteen [[p. 103]] years of persistent observation, have so completely taken possession of his mind, that, after a very hasty glance at analogous facts and possibilities, he has declared them to be ‘non-natural’–therefore to be works of art–therefore to necessitate the presence of highly intelligent beings who have designed and constructed them. This idea has coloured or governed all his writings on the subject. The innumerable difficulties which it raises have been either ignored, or brushed aside on the flimsiest evidence. As examples, he never even discusses the totally inadequate water-supply for such world-wide irrigation, or the extreme irrationality of constructing so vast a canal-system the waste from which, by evaporation, when exposed to such desert conditions as he himself describes, would use up ten times the probable supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, he urges the ‘purpose’ displayed in these ‘canals.’ Their being &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; so straight, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; describing great circles of the ‘sphere,’ all being so evidently arranged (as he thinks) either to carry water to some ‘oasis’ 2000 miles away, or to reach some arid region far over the equator in the opposite hemisphere! But he never considers the difficulties this implies. Everywhere these canals run for thousands of miles across waterless deserts, forming a system and indicating a purpose, the wonderful perfection of which he is never tired of dwelling upon (but which I myself can nowhere perceive). [[p. 104]] Yet he never even attempts to explain how the Martians could have lived &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; this great system was planned and executed, or why they did not &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; utilise and render fertile the belt of land adjacent to the limits of the polar snows–why the method of irrigation did not, as with all human arts, begin gradually, at home, with terraces and channels to irrigate the land close to the source of the water. How, with such a desert as he describes three-fourths of Mars to be, did the inhabitants ever get to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; anything of the equatorial regions and its needs, so as to start right away to supply those needs? All this, to my mind, is quite opposed to the idea of their being works of art, and altogether in favour of their being natural features of a globe as peculiar in origin and internal structure as it is in its surface-features. The explanation I have given, though of course hypothetical, is founded on known cosmical and terrestrial facts, and is, I suggest, far more scientific as well as more satisfactory than Mr. Lowell’s wholly unsupported speculation. This view I have explained in some detail in the preceding chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    Mr. Lowell never even refers to the important question of loss by evaporation in these enormous open canals, or considers the undoubted fact that the only intelligent and practical way to convey a limited quantity of water such great distances would be by a system of water-tight and air-tight [[p. 105]] tubes laid &lt;em&gt;under the ground&lt;/em&gt;. The mere attempt to use open canals for such a purpose shows complete ignorance and stupidity in these alleged very superior beings; while it is certain that, long before half of them were completed their failure to be of any use would have led any rational beings to cease constructing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    He also fails to consider the difficulty, that, if these canals are necessary for existence in Mars, how did the inhabitants ever reach a sufficiently large population with surplus food and leisure enabling them to rise from the low condition of savages to one of civilisation, and ultimately to scientific knowledge? Here again is a dilemma which is hard to overcome. Only a &lt;em&gt;dense&lt;/em&gt; population with &lt;em&gt;ample&lt;/em&gt; means of subsistence could possibly have constructed such gigantic works; but, given these two conditions, no adequate motive existed for the conception and execution of them–even if they were likely to be of any use, which I have shown they could not be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoops!  And now that I’m thinking of it, we’ve seen &lt;a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/03/life_on_mars_th.html" rel="external "&gt;IDists shooting themselves in the foot with Lowell’s Martians before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.: Go vote!!&lt;/p&gt;

On the one hand, when he &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/06/oops_he_did_it_again_1.php"&gt;takes down Bill O'Reilly&lt;/a&gt; for defaming U.S. troops or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/10/palin_autism_and_fruitflies_it.php"&gt;Sarah Palin for anti-science idiocy&lt;/a&gt;, I have to admit, he's effective and sometimes even amusing. However, like &lt;a href="http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2007/02/23/everyone_loves_keith_olbermannexcept_me.php"&gt;some others&lt;/a&gt;, I often find him diving too far into meanness, becoming in essence a left-wing version of Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity. That's why I found this SNL parody particularly amusing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to kind of like Keith Olbermann. These days, though, I tend to find him to be almost as much of a blowhard as any rightwing pundit--rather like the parody above. I also found &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/11/3/122622/582/956/650959"&gt;Olbermann's response&lt;/a&gt; to the parody rather lame as well. The dude needs to lighten up about himself. I realize I'm close to alone around ScienceBlogs in thinking this, but at least I'm &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2007/06/keith_olbermann_paris_hilton_a.php"&gt;not totally alone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I have a confession to make.  I’ve been feeling very cynical about this election for a long time now.  I watch very little television, generally, but the snippets I catch offer glimpses of the divisiveness the old media spew, 24-7, in an attempt to cash in on the current political climate in the US.  It’s really quite sickening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think independent commentator &lt;a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/cs"&gt;Dan Carlin&lt;/a&gt; nailed it in a recent &lt;a href="http://cdn3.libsyn.com/dancarlin/cswdcb36.mp3?nvb=20081104153632&amp;amp;nva=20081105153632&amp;amp;t=063deb5065b1057dddf8e"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;. I’d encourage you all to check out the entire podcast, including the fantastic &lt;a href="http://www.eisenhowermemorial.org/speeches/19610117%20farewell%20address.htm"&gt;Eisenhower speech&lt;/a&gt; at the tail end, but if you don’t, his basic point is that whatever the outcome of this election, thanks to the rhetoric that’s been circulated in this campaign, we will have a large percentage of the population who believes whole heartedly that the president is not just wrong, but actively evil.  And that the people that voted for him are somehow less “American” than they are, whatever that means.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how much more of this we can take.  It seems that with every election, the Democrats and Republicans reach new heights of dehumanizing each other in order to gain and/or maintain power.  Where does this leave us?  It honestly wouldn’t surprise me if, four years from now, candidate a releases an ad claiming that candidate b has sold his/her soul to satan, and shows the paperwork to prove it.  We need to start rehumanizing each other.  I think people are mostly good, and want what’s best for our country, but just have different ideas about what that looks like and how to get there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess you could call this a friendly reminder (to you as well as to myself) to keep in mind that we are all in this together, and while we may disagree, we should aspire to do so while simultaneously maintaining respect for those with whom we differ.  Which is something that I think most of us around here get, but maybe we can try to spread it around.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225830670583"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/04/am-i-drinking-because-of-the-price-or-the-election/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d6a30d3da270e141</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="2008 election"/><category term="wine"/><title type="html">Am I Drinking Because of the Price or the Election?</title><published>2008-11-04T20:12:50Z</published><updated>2008-11-04T20:12:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/47SNUbdGYZc/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/04/am-i-drinking-because-of-the-price-or-the-election/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">We saw this sign in the window of a local wine store offering a 10 percent discount on selected brands until 9 p.m. on election night.

&lt;p&gt;The first major flight hardware for the Ares-1 rocket arrived via barge at Kennedy Space Center this week. &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/nov/HQ_08281_First_Rocket_Parts.html"&gt;It’s an upper stage simulator&lt;/a&gt;, basically a shell with the same size and weight of an actual second stage. It’ll be mated with a lower stage and launched to test out the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/11/nasa_ares-1.jpg" alt="Drawing of NASA’s Ares-1 rocket"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was amazed to see that test launch is scheduled for July 12 of next year! Then I had to smile: I keep thinking of Ares (and the Shuttle retirement) as happening some time in the nebulous future, but in fact the Shuttle retires in just a year and a half from now. And so Ares test flights need to start &lt;strong&gt;soon&lt;/strong&gt;, the sooner the better. Somehow all this slipped away from my conscious mind. The Shuttle has been flying since 1981, most of my life (I remember the first launch of Columbia, back when I was in high school). It’s hard to imagine that it all ends so soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m glad NASA is getting their act together on this. Both Presidential candidates — and I only need to write it that way until the end of the day, phew! — have promised extra cash for NASA to help get Ares on track, and I think in the end that’s a good thing. &lt;/p&gt;

There is no reason to seek converts to atheism in the way that Christians have a personal incentive to give "witness".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For me the issue comes down to Power. Christians have power. The source of that power is faith in god. It does not follow that if there is no god, christians would have neither faith nor power. There are many reasons that patent falsehoods might still be adhered to and powerful. For example, politically speaking one might argue that the christian faith is part of who we are as a nation, and so we should continue to advocate for it, whether it is based on falsehoods or not: it binds us together and gives us a common faith that we can understand in a way that, say, Hinduism would not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are many examples from intellectual history that show that falsehoods can be very useful: the theory of Luminous Ether in physics, the use of the concept of infinitesimals in early theories of the calculus, the theory of the atom that purportedly explained how the first atomic weapons worked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The useful falsehood that I think christians would be well advised to study is the sentence V=L from set theory. What "V=L" says is that the universe of sets consists only of the constructable sets. As everybody who understands the iterative conception of sets knows, there are more sets than just the constructable ones. And yet the statement "V=L" is usually counted as an axiom, especially in discussions of the independence of the generalized continuum hypothesis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do not expect christians to know anything about set theory, of course. I merely wish to point out that even in mathematics patent falsehoods can be counted as axioms, and useful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an atheist writer I try to liberate people from the clutches of oppressive fundamentalist ideology. There were happy Nazis, but an ideological attack on the intellectual basis of Nazism was still a good thing. Likewise with attacks on christianity. There are happy christians. There are people who get everything they need and want from christianity. But there is a sinister dark side for many people too. For many people, christianity is experienced as an oppressive dogma that makes it impossible for them to live fulfilled lives free of guilt. There are countless people living in small towns being bullied by christian fundamentalists in a thousand different ways. What they need is a clear way out of the ideological net that christians have thrown over them. And here it is: God does not exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem is that intelligent people have been proving that god does not exist since before Jesus was killed. One of the charming aspects of the crucifixion narrative for me is that it is recorded by the christians themselves that even as Jesus is being crucified he is also being debated: if you are god, come down from the cross. While you are actually in the midst of dying is hardly the time for a philosophical/theological argument. The christian story about the death of Jesus is actually totally polemicized in the new testament, however: the gospel writers make sure to toss in a Roman centurion who says "Surely this man was the son of god," as if we wouldn't have known that from the rest of the story already. I point all of that so as to draw attention to the fact that christians cannot escape the basic anxiety of the thought: what if none of this is true? They struggled with this anxiety even in their attempts at recording Jesus's death. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that the Roman appears in the crucifixion narrative saying "surely this man was the son of god" is proof to me that he most certainly was not the son of god. Why, if the story is true in the way that the christians claim it is true, would the gospel writers feel the need, at the decisive narrative moment, to toss in a philosophical/theological "footnote". The answer is that as writers they knew that their case needed some bolstering. So they trot out a symbol of imperial authority and force him to witness to the truth of what they are arguing. This sort of argumentation only makes since if (1) the writers of the story had Roman political authority in mind as the ultimate audience for their writing and (2) felt like the events as experienced by the purported tens of thousands of people who witnessed them first hand did not speak for themselves. Let me say what I mean directly here: the gospel writers themselves had the sinking feeling that what they were writing wasn't true and sought to fluff up the story with a keen eye on political power. Hence, the Roman centurion, which is so obviously just a stereotype, appears at the decisive moment in the story and basically is made to explain "this is true!" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The anti-christian literature on such matters as the rhetorical/polemical devices that can be found in the gospel narratives is now, at this late stage in history, quite advanced, and there is no way to come away from a sincere engagement with that literature believing that Jesus was really god. One can read Voltaire, or Nietzsche, or Bertrand Russell or any one of a hundred scholarly discussions of the Bible and the verdict is always the same: Jesus was not god. There is no lack of cogent, decisive argumentation here. But none of it has the slightest impact on small town fundamentalist christians going to church all over america. The evangelical movement keeps preaching the gospel pretty much exactly as it is found recorded in the book of Acts because on a certain mentality it works. No one can deny it works. It works for Muslims seeking converts in Africa as well as it works for Mormons seeking converts in El Salvador. It worked for Paul in Corinth as well as it worked for Methodist preachers in 18th century England.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess I want to help the person who is, like I was, stuck in an oppressive situation in a small town being lectured by fundamentalists and evangelicals. God does not exist. Yet such a person, the person for whom I am writing, is, like I was, trapped in very delicate power relations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My whole family goes to the same fundamentalist church together. I was alone in my assertion that god does not exist. This assertion put me in direct conflict with my family. How could I humiliate my grandfather in the eyes of all of the grandchildren by using lofty intellectual arguments to say that everything he had based his life on was a lie, a misunderstanding, a falsehood? How could I be so haughty as to give the impression that the books I had read "proved" that Jesus Christ hadn't died for our sins, especially when saying such things had the potential to corrupt the minds of the little innocent children in our family? Did I really want to humiliate my Uncles by proving that the Bible is not literally true?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are very personal power relations, and I am talking here about how difficult it really is to live as an atheist in small town america today. But I see fundamentalist children in Afghanistan and Kansas who are basically facing the same predicament. The personal cost of standing up for what you believe in is too great. I am not going to convince my grandfather that everything he has said at church for the last 53 years is bunk, and my family will not let that happen anyway. They have a stake in defending their position that has nothing whatsoever to do with whether god really exists. I am not going to convince the toddlers in sunday school who are coloring cute pictures of Noah's Ark that the seemingly nice ladies teaching the class are in fact lunatics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the christians are on the wrong side of history. None of the core beliefs of the fundamentalists or evangelicals have any credibility anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, who is the audience for atheist writing? It is not the lonely prisoner sitting in a cell with nowhere to turn but the Bible. It is not the elderly widow who sits alone in an empty apartment with no one to talk to but Jesus. It is not the four year old color pictures of the Garden of Eden in sunday school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For me the audience is that lonely young person who sits in church listening to the same tired gospel message week after week knowing that it isn't true but not knowing how to say so. For me the audience is that lonely young person who is looking for a way out of the oppressive culture of fundamentalism. To such people I would say that there are many people who have realized that god does not exist and then gone on to live happy, decent lives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My buddy and coworker Jennifer sent me &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/garden/30haunted.html?pagewanted=1&amp;amp;_r=2&amp;amp;ref=style"&gt;this New York Times article called Supernatural Cleaning Methods&lt;/a&gt;, possibly in the hopes of seeing the top of my head explode. Despite the fact that it goes on for five pages, is filled with personal anecdotes of ghostly encounters, and the most skeptical voice in the first 2.5 pages comes from those idiots on the Ghost Hunters show, it’s actually quite enjoyable thanks to the tongue-in-cheek style of the journalist. The author, Joyce Wadler, must be familiar with Mary Roach since she has such a similar way of presenting skepticism without stepping all over the fun of the story. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suddenly, a Reporter Is Aware of Her Psychic Gifts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that when the New England real estate agent mentioned above was reached on her cellphone, it was about 6 in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, are you driving down the Mass Turnpike in pitch-blackness?” she was asked in an attempt to set the mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh my God — how did you know?” Ms. Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we’re treated to a blurb with everyone’s favorite paranormal investigator Joe Nickel (I always want to call him Uncle Joe for some reason. Uncle Joe Nickel. Wouldn’t he make the greatest uncle ever?). Because of this, I’ll forgive the journalist the subtitle following Uncle Joe’s bit: “Frankly, the Believers Tell a Much Better Story.” Fair enough, since she was referring to Joe’s story of a woman who thought she was photographing ghost orbs but was actually capturing her blurry camera strap. If you ask me though, it’s much more interesting to hear how a woman might fool herself with a camera strap than to hear a True Believer recount an obviously made-up story about floating books and other tropes that have become far too boring for modern day horror films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I often post about really awful, overly credulous “news” articles about the paranormal, so I thought you’d all enjoy one that is actually, well, enjoyable, and even skeptical. Here’s one more favorite bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 “I recommend making a mixture of powdered sage, holy water and cedar oil, some water from a church or that has been blessed by someone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you’re an atheist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be something to this occult stuff, because suddenly the reporter feels a deep chill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cedar oil has cleansing properties,” Ms. Hoolihan continued, ignoring the question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca Watson</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225817604972"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=805">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e4a3e10059684f60</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Changing Times"/><category term="Taboo vocabulary"/><category term="Words words words"/><title type="html">Anti-Latin P.C. poppycock</title><published>2008-11-04T16:51:23Z</published><updated>2008-11-04T16:51:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=805" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Robert James Hargrave has pointed out to Language Log that several regional councils in England are prohibiting their employees from using "elitist" Latinate phrases like "bona fide" or "vice versa"  The &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3362150/Councils-ban-elitist-and-discriminatory-Latin-phrases.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has an article about it.  I quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#990000"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bournemouth Council, which has the Latin motto Pulchritudo et Salubritas, meaning beauty and health, has listed 19 terms it no longer considers acceptable for use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes bona fide, eg (exempli gratia), prima facie, ad lib or ad libitum, etc or et cetera, ie or id est, inter alia, NB or nota bene, per, per se, pro rata, quid pro quo, vis-a-vis, vice versa and even via.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its list of more verbose alternatives, includes "for this special purpose", in place of ad hoc and "existing condition" or "state of things", instead of status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In instructions to staff, the council said: "Not everyone knows Latin. Many readers do not have English as their first language so using Latin can be particularly difficult."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose one must applaud, however limply, the thought of council bureaucrats worrying about the needs of employees who are immigrants from Poland or Lithuania or Nigeria who might be perplexed by odd bits of Latin-derived jargon in memos.  But this really smacks of the sort of P.C. nonsense that brings down ridicule on the heads of honest folk working to reduce prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first four things that seem to me pathetic about the above story are:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is surely nothing elitist about &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;vice versa&lt;/i&gt; or even &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt;;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nobody needs to care about the etymologies since they could just as well have come from other languages (and &lt;i&gt;vis-a-vis&lt;/i&gt; actually did: it's an 18th-century borrowing from French);&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helping staff to learn the words and phrases needed for the job seems more appropriate than trying to force other staff to censor their vocabulary; and&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you do decide to censor and simplify, there is no reason to start with renaissance Latin borrowings rather than Greek compound words like &lt;i&gt;neurophysiology&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/i&gt;, or for that matter all words longer than four syllables.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need not worry too much; widespread mocking of the councils involved has already begun.  I doubt very much whether the useful preposition &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; is doomed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p&gt;You know what to do. Get out there and vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to be squeezing in a long day working as an election judge at my local polling place (and I&amp;#39;m hoping that I will be very, very busy with a large turnout), in addition to taking care of teaching. If it&amp;#39;s a little quiet around here, don&amp;#39;t worry — it&amp;#39;s just that today is the culmination of a lot of anxious agonizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least, I'll be back online after the polls close. Until then, tell us about &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; voting experiences — may they all be routine and boring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/your_civic_duty.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/442131496" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225807829685"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3996">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b8efd3f858d5290</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 11.4</title><published>2008-11-04T13:56:47Z</published><updated>2008-11-04T13:56:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3996" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

Fox Television Stations&lt;/em&gt;, the case of the &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005475.html"&gt;fleeting expletive&lt;/a&gt;. Bono got things going when exclaimed  &amp;quot;really, really fucking brilliant&amp;quot; at the 2003 Golden Globe Awards.[&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=801#fnPhillies"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;] The FCC first judged such usage non-offensive, then back-tracked in the face of pressure from the  Parents Television Council.  In &lt;a href="http://www.fcc.gov/eb/Orders/2004/FCC-04-43A1.html"&gt;this note&lt;/a&gt;, the FCC declares that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  given the core meaning of the &amp;quot;F-Word,&amp;quot;  any use  of that  word or  a variation,  in any context, inherently has a  sexual connotation
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language Loggers have commented on &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?cat=30"&gt;this and related topics before&lt;/a&gt;, and Arnold &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=794"&gt;recently went meta on the Times coverage of the case&lt;/a&gt;. I recently spoke with Jess Bravin at the Wall Street Journal about the FCC's statement and the coming Supreme Court hearings. (&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122575539538895001.html"&gt;His article with Amy Schatz&lt;/a&gt; appeared today, along with &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122575539538895001.html#articleTabs=slideshow"&gt;a cool wordle-like graphic on the results below&lt;/a&gt;.) During out conversation, Jess asked how a linguist might test the FCC&amp;#39;s claim about the connotations of the F-word. Does it in fact have sexual connotations even when used as an intensive, as in Bono&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;really, really fucking brilliant&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formal linguistic theories of meaning have, unfortunately, had relatively little to say about connotations. However, I think there is a chance here to apply methods from information extraction. Soon after talking with Jess, I undertook a small pilot experiment to try out an idea that bridges these two fields nicely. The pilot begins from this hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Connotations hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt;: A word's connotations are reflected in the words that it tends to co-occur with.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political operatives know this hypothesis well. It is why they repeat the same phrases over and over again, seeking to  instill particular words with new connotations. This is a core insight behind &lt;a href="http://lsa.colorado.edu/"&gt;Latent Semantic Analysis&lt;/a&gt;. George Lakoff discusses similar hypotheses under the rubric of &lt;a href="http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/projects/strategic/simple_framing/"&gt;framing&lt;/a&gt;. The most famous recent example is the systematic, large-scale effort to link  &lt;em&gt;Iraq&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/em&gt; in people's mind by mentioning them in the same breath again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the connotations hypothesis, we can evaluate the FCC's claim. To do this, I gathered about 9.5 million words of blog posts from &lt;a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/"&gt;Eschaton&lt;/a&gt; (left-wing politics), &lt;a href="http://sayanythingblog.com/"&gt;Say Anything Blog&lt;/a&gt; (right-wing politics), and &lt;a href="http://dlisted.com/"&gt;DListed&lt;/a&gt; (celebrity gossip). Posts at DListed tend to be about sex and sexuality in one way or another, so it's a good one to include. The full collection is designed to ensure that we don't see too many influences from particular domains or usage patterns. The main motivation for using these blogs, though, is that their authors are not shy with the F-word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then built a word-by-word matrix consisting of all the content word with counts above 150. Here is a snippet from it (the full matrix is 808 x 808):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="300" border="1" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4"&gt;
&lt;tr align="center"&gt;
&lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;fair&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;fall&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;family&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;federal&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align="center"&gt;
&lt;th&gt;fair&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;223&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;123&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align="center"&gt;
&lt;th&gt;fall&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;176&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align="center"&gt;
&lt;th&gt;family&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;456&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align="center"&gt;
&lt;th&gt;federal&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;123&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;894&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cells are filled with the number of times that the two words co-occurred in a blog post. The posts are mostly short (average length: 119 words), so it's safe to say that these associations are close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now compare word distributions by comparing  vectors of counts. The closer the vectors for &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;w'&lt;/em&gt; are to each other, the closer their distributions match. For this, I use a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity"&gt;cosine measure&lt;/a&gt;. For a given target word &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;, we can compare &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt; with all the others words in the matrix, then rank the results for closeness. Here, for example, are the nearest content words to a few target words (bold), ranked in decreasing order of closeness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;speech&lt;/strong&gt;: free, speak, political, speaking, calling, sort, terms, freedom, called, group  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;movie&lt;/strong&gt;: love, watching, family, girl, guys, mind, couple, head, hell, back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;video&lt;/strong&gt;: people,	thing,	time,	playing,	part,	telling,	play,	watch,	statement,	called&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;obama&lt;/strong&gt;: barack, obama's, campaign, mccain, candidate, election, presidential, john, race, senator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mccain&lt;/strong&gt;: john, obama, barack, campaign, obama's, presidential, candidate, election, senator, race&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;america&lt;/strong&gt;: great, terrorists,	hope,	protect,	step,	work,	nation,	lives,	tonight,	americans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tax&lt;/strong&gt;: taxes,	income, spending,	property,	cut,	rate,	pay,	measure,	economic,	lower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sex&lt;/strong&gt;: life, woman, women, happy, gay, young, thing, love, called, parents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results look pretty good. Thus, let's move to the punchline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fucking&lt;/strong&gt;: time, imagine, here's, understand, things, wanted, wrong, hell, stop, stay
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks chaotic to me.  It certainly doesn't look sexual. The reason for that seems clear: contra the FCC's claims, the F-word is primarily a marker of emotional content. It is compatible with a wide range of emotions. In addition, it is extremely flexible syntactically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this a pilot study. I do not pretend that this is the best approach to (or the ideal data set for) characterizing connotations, but I think it might be a step in a useful direction. Perhaps other approaches  would support the FCC's claim that the F-word is invariantly sexual, though I would now approach such claims very skeptically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the strength of this approach rests on how good the overall model of connotations is. We should get intuitive results back for the majority of words in the database. Since I do not presently know of a way to automatically evaluate the model, I'd like to enlist the help of the Language Log readers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Enter a word. If it is in the database, the script will give you the top 15 nearest neighbors to that word, closest neighbor leftmost.&lt;/strong&gt;



&lt;p&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;span style="background-color:#cccccc;padding:2px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;How do the results look to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caveats&lt;/em&gt;: You'll notice that some non-content words are still in the database. Also, I didn't do any morphological analysis, so perhaps try variants of the form you are interested in before giving up. (The Javascript source containing the mapping to top-15 nearest neighbors is &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/getconnotationneighbors.js"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Election Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two years of painful, annoying, surprising, infuriating, and, on rare occasions, uplifting campaigning, it all comes down to this: Voters, alone in little booths, casting ballots that will decide which direction our nation goes for the next four years. I know that there were times when you (and I) thought this day would never come. The length and intensity of American Presidential campaigns have turned into more of an endurance contest than anything else, a two year Iditarod through the wasteland, not to mention a test of which campaign can raise the most money and organize its supporters the best. Whether such skills translate into skill at governing and leading is debatable at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to tell you whom to vote for. Regular readers know my inclinations. All I'm going to say to my fellow Americans who have not yet voted is: Vote. There's no excuse for not doing it. Regardless of what happens today, history will be made. Here's hoping it's history that gives us hope. By the time this uncharacteristically brief bit of prose posts, I will be at my local poll. Find time today to make it to yours, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/november_4_2008_election_day_its_morning.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/442050061" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225803241382"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=411">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/479ae2a1d8f39b7b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">Homeopathy Still Sucks</title><published>2008-11-04T12:53:14Z</published><updated>2008-11-04T12:53:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=411" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the most deceptive science press release I have seen in a while. The title is “&lt;a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-11/ncfh-nef110308.php"&gt;New Evidence for Homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;” - but the papers do not include any new evidence. These studies are nothing more than a reanalysis of a prior meta-analysis, which is kind of like refried refried beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005 the Lancet published a meta-analysis of homeopathy trials and compared them to trials of conventional medicine, concluding that the evidence supports the conclusion that homeopathy is nothing more than a placebo. This meta-analysis, however, suffered from the problems of all meta-analyses - they are only as good as the literature they review, the criteria used to pick studies, and the techniques used to combine the data. In general  a meta-analysis is a very weak form of evidence, and they have a poor track record of predicting large definitive clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systematic reviews are much more reliable than meta-analysis. A review looks at all published trials for overall patterns. For example, are there any high quality studies, do the better studies tend to be positive or negative, and is there consistency of outcomes among trials of the same treatments for the same conditions. Systematic reviews of homeopathic treatments have been negative - because the literature is generally negative. For example, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17285788?ordinalpos=46&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;here is a review&lt;/a&gt; of all homeopathic treatments for childhood conditions, which concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence from rigorous clinical trials of any type of therapeutic or preventive intervention testing homeopathy for childhood and adolescence ailments is not convincing enough for recommendations in any condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or pick a condition - &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15303632?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=4&amp;amp;log$=relatedarticles&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is not enough evidence to reliably assess the possible role of homeopathy in the treatment of asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no indication for which any homeopathic remedy has met a reasonable burden of evidence that it actually had any physiological effect.  This is not surprising, since homeopathy is a pre-scientific magic-based system. The principles of homeopathy are, simply put, magical thinking that 200 years of subsequent science has shown to be absurd. Like cures like, for example, is simply an expression of sympathetic magic. There is no scientific basis for it. The law of infinitessimals states that the more your dilute a remedy the more powerful it becomes - in direct contradiction to chemistry and physics (not to mention common sense). Homeopathic remedies contain (generally) no active ingredient. They are water. They cannot work, and it is therefore not surprising that they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the lack of plausibility and lack of compelling evidence for efficacy, homeopathy is a scientific dead end. It survives only because of cultural inertia, dedicated practitioners and believers who are not science-based, financial motivations, and ineffective quality-control regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original meta-analysis was interesting in that it tried a new approach - to see if there is a difference between the pattern of evidence in the homeopathic literature and the pattern of evidence in studies of mainstream treatments. I think, however, that a meta-analysis was the wrong approach, for the reasons I stated above. There are simply too many new variables that can bias the interpretation. This opened the door for dedicated homeopaths to point out those weaknesses, and make it seem like mainstream scientific medicine is biased against homeopathy - well, only in that science-based medicine is appropriately biased against unscientific or disproved modalities. It also opened the door for reinterpretation of the data in a worthless and biased fashion toward homeopathy so that proponents can put out a press release with the absurd headline of “new evidence for homeopathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course the apologists for unscientific medicine are jumping on the bandwagon. Dr. Brian Kaplan reported on the meta-analysis proclaiming “&lt;a href="http://drkaplanarticles.blogspot.com/2008/11/tide-is-turning.html"&gt;The Tide is Turning&lt;/a&gt;.” Here’s a bit of history - homeopathy is already well beyond it’s peak. It has been largely displaced and now relegated to a fringe. It has made a bit of a comeback, riding along the wave of gullibility called “complementary and alternative medicine,” but already there is a pro-science push back. I don’t pretend to know how this will all play out, but the notion that the tide is turning in favor of homeopathy defies the history of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the CAM movement in general, homeopaths have long since lost the battle within science. They are therefore fighting a propaganda and political war. This is an effective strategy - change the venue to one you can win. The creationists have learned to do this in their battles against evolution and “materialism.” Similarly, proponents of unscientific medicine have broadened their war to one against “scientism” - a strategy reflected in Kaplans blog entry. He even equates efforts to fairly apply a scientific standard in medicine to Richard Dawkin’s war against God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if they are not considered sufficiently qualified there is always the greatest exponent of Scientism on the planet (besides the magician, James Randi) Professor Richard Dawkins to call upon to &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;prove&lt;/span&gt; that homeopathy is nonsense. After thousands of years of unsuccessful efforts, this man has finally &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/RDbooks"&gt;disproved the existence of God&lt;/a&gt; so what chance has homeopathy got against him? We, homeopaths lie vanquished in the gutter next to God licking our wounds. What can we possible say except that at least we are in good company?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right - if you’re against homeopathy, then you are against God. This is further evidence, in my opinion, that these individual struggles against pseudoscientific notions like homeopathy are part of a greater cultural war. Science has largely displaced mysticism as the dominant explanatory model in modern culture. The mystics, gurus, prophits, psychics, cultists and charlatans of the world are not happy about that. They are waging all-out war against science - science in medicine, science in the classroom, science in government, and science in culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their strategy is to portray science as biased, Western, cultural hegemony, narrow-minded, and just another belief-system. They are using fancy philosophical terms like “scientism” and “materialism”, and made up words like “Darwinism” to make science into just another “ism”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skeptical movement gets what is going on and is pushing back. The mainstream scientific and academic communities, in my opinion, are still largely clueless, but they are slowly catching on. The broader public is increasingly divided, and the gulf seems to be widening.  At the same time they seem to compartmentalize - still respecting science and what it can do, but also fascinated by spiritualism and pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will just have to wait and see where it all leads, but in the meantime skeptics have their work cut out for them.&lt;/p&gt;

He sets up this fancy museum, he keeps pushing his silly ideas, and what happens? Smart people like Daniel Phelps, president of the Kentucky Paleontological Society, &lt;a href="http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/aroundtheworld/2008/10/28/evolutionist-calls-aig-morons/"&gt;calls him a moron&lt;/a&gt;. Deservedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't need to say much, though. The &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2008/10/ken-ham-im-not-moron-no-really.html"&gt;scathing excoriation of Ham&lt;/a&gt; has already been done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You said that &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2008/06/answers-in-genesis-unicorns-are-fucking.html"&gt;unicorns are real&lt;/a&gt;.  You claim that the &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2008/09/answers-in-genesis-beowulf-was-real.html"&gt;Beowulf story is evidence of human cohabitation with dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt;.  You say that &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2008/10/answers-in-genesis-sometimes-religious.html"&gt;sometimes religious genocide is OK&lt;/a&gt;.  You think that &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2008/08/ken-ham-missing-link.html"&gt;the government is training people to talk to aliens&lt;/a&gt;.  You believe that &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2008/09/ken-ham-coward.html"&gt;evolution is a random process&lt;/a&gt;, a process of &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2007/12/ken-ham-functionally-retarded.html"&gt;blind chance&lt;/a&gt;, which is just factually wrong.  You &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2007/09/stie-review-kidsanswersorg.html"&gt;target children&lt;/a&gt; because they can't defend themselves and trust you (talk about a cowardly act).  You believe &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2008/04/if-2-year-old-understands-it-it-must-be.html"&gt;if a 2-year old understands it, it must be cutting edge science&lt;/a&gt;.  You believe that &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2008/09/evolution-disproved.html"&gt;observation and measurement cannot trump "common sense."&lt;/a&gt;  You believe you do &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2008/09/how-about-little-filthy-answers-in.html?showComment=1222188900000"&gt;the type of science that you need faith to understand instead of, you know, understanding to understand&lt;/a&gt;.  You believe...&lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2008/07/what-is-aigs-problem-this-week.html"&gt;whatever the fuck this is&lt;/a&gt;.  You employ &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2008/07/hjhop-your-source-for-lost-hjhop.html"&gt;the nanny-nanny boo-boo defense&lt;/a&gt;.  Your ilk &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2007/11/aig-bitchfest-continues.html?showComment=1195264080000"&gt;do not even try to publish outside of their little circle&lt;/a&gt;, and you &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2008/01/happy-fatwah-on-answers-in-genesis.html"&gt;set up a bogus journal&lt;/a&gt; to pretend that you were scholars, THEREBY AVOIDING THE DEBATE YOU CLAIM TO CRAVE.  &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2007/09/logic-resistant-strain-of-aig-virus.html"&gt;You stare at evolution, describe evolution, and then say, "It's not evolution."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet you wonder why someone with an education and responsibilities and a reputation would not talk to you?  Despite this record of shame (I could have gone on and on just looking at my website alone), you have the balls to claim that you &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;won something &lt;/span&gt;by [being] so catastrophically ignorant as to be not worth speaking to?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;KEN, WE ARE TIRED OF TRYING TO TALK TO YOU.  WE HAVE MOVED ON TO RIDICULE.  THIS IS WHAT YOU DESERVE, YOU PIG-IGNORANT SLAVE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Ham needs to put up another self-pitying post for each of the insults in there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/aww_his_feelings_are_hurt.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/441946705" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225793324445"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=800">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6b2937b7b9acb001</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and politics"/><title type="html">Ground game</title><published>2008-11-04T10:06:41Z</published><updated>2008-11-04T10:06:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=800" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It didn't make William Safire's list of "&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/magazine/02wwln-safire-t.html?ref=magazine"&gt;'08-isms&lt;/a&gt;", but for me, the most prominent phrase of this political campaign has been &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ground game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus Bob Drogin and Robin Abcarian, "&lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-ground3-2008nov03,0,4761332.story"&gt;In Ohio, Obama's &lt;strong&gt;ground game&lt;/strong&gt; outguns McCain's&lt;/a&gt;", LA Times 11/3/2008:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Learning from the Bush effort, Obama has taken his fight directly into suburban and rural GOP strongholds in an effort to curb McCain's potential margins. Obama has 82 offices in the state, nearly twice as many as McCain. Labor unions are backing his effort with more than 12,000 volunteers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"McCain does not have the kind of ground organization that Obama has, not even close," said Nancy Martorano, associate professor of political science at the University of Dayton.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"I've never seen anything like the Obama &lt;strong&gt;ground game&lt;/strong&gt;," agreed Paul Beck, professor of political science at Ohio State University in Columbus. "It is light-years ahead of what the Democrats did four years ago."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or Walter Shapiro, &amp;quot;Ohio, Indiana, Virginia and Beyond…&amp;quot;, Salon, 11/4/2008:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;There are secret weapons in every campaign for Election Day, but rarely do they include bulbous red noses or tossing plates in the air. Doug Kelly, the executive director of the Ohio Democratic Party, proudly explained his three-ring-circus strategy: "We have hired every juggler, clown, balloon entertainer and high-school marching band in the state of Ohio to keep people waiting in line to vote."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;No one is suggesting that the battle for Ohio's 20 electoral votes will be decided by greasepaint smiles and off-key renditions of "Stars and Stripes Forever." But in a campaign year when parsing the polls has become a national obsession, the impossible to quantify X-factor is the potency of Barack Obama's &lt;strong&gt;ground game&lt;/strong&gt; for getting out the vote. "There are no phone calls in Ohio today by the Obama campaign," said David Wilhelm, a former Democratic National Committee chairman who lives in suburban Columbus. "Everything is door-to-door. I think the impact is different from this kind of personal validation, neighbor-to-neighbor. It's a big deal, especially in rural southeastern Ohio."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The McCain campaign in Ohio is much more heavily reliant on phone banking, as was the 2004 Bush campaign that eked out a keep-the-White House 120,000-vote victory here. As Kevin Dewine, the deputy chairman of the state Republican Party, put it, "Our &lt;strong&gt;ground game&lt;/strong&gt; is not loud. It's not flashy. We don't brag. But we get it done."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Neighboring Indiana, with 11 electoral votes, is this year&amp;#39;s most unlikely presidential battleground state — the Democrats have carried it exactly once since the 1930s. (The 1964 Lyndon Johnson landslide.) But the Obama campaign has been sending organizers into counties where, based on prior elections, Esperanto speakers outnumber Democrats. Brian Howey, the nonpartisan editor of Indiana&amp;#39;s leading political journal, predicted, &amp;quot;With all the polls showing the race here as too close to call, I&amp;#39;m going to say that Obama will pull it out, because he has a &lt;strong&gt;ground game&lt;/strong&gt; and an intensity that Indiana has never seen."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell from a quick site search, the NYT used the phrase in eight news stories during the past 30 days — two of these were about football and six were about politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the application of the phrase to local political organizing is not new. The earliest example that I&amp;#39;ve been able to find is from twenty years ago — Robin Toner, &amp;quot;Dukakis Nears the Wire in 9-State, 48-Hour Dash&amp;quot;, 11/8/1988, NYT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In Ohio, as in California and elsewhere, the Dukakis campaign was touting its field operation and hoping that it would make the difference in close states. "What it comes down to is the old &lt;strong&gt;ground game&lt;/strong&gt;, maybe," said Paul Pezzella, an organizer in Ohio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Or maybe not, at least for Dukakis in 1988.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implicit contrast is with activities "in the air", especially political advertising, as made explicit by a quote in Leslie Wayne, "Iowa Pivotal for Forbes's Battle to Counter Bush", 12/13/1999:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;This time, the Forbes campaign here says, it has learned from those mistakes. "In 1996 we threw some ads up on the air, but we didn't have a &lt;strong&gt;ground game&lt;/strong&gt;," Mr. Grubbs said. "This time we have a ground organization second to none to compete with Bush."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of "game plan" in politics is older, e.g. "Nixon 3: Daring 'Game Plan' For the Economy", 2/1/1970:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;President Nixon and his Council of Economic Advisers outlined last week an almost daring "game plan" for economic strategy in 1970.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes discussions of political game plans use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ground game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in a completely non-specific way, as in Gerald M. Boyd, "Bush is Sticking With a Safe Game Plan", 10/24/1988, where the metaphor is not transferred from football except in the vague sense that a "ground game" is one of a number of different strategic options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Mr. Bush&amp;#39;s strategists had been considering a shift in the campaign to focus more on the election of republican senatorial candidates or on a post-election agenda. meeting in recent days, they decided against such a move. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"If the game plan has been one of throwing the ball, we are not about to suddenly change to a &lt;strong&gt;ground game&lt;/strong&gt;," said Charles Black Jr., a strategist for the Bush campaign, discussing the contest in terms of a football game. "That won't make any sense."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In football the contrast is indeed between the &lt;em&gt;ground game&lt;/em&gt; (where the offensive team tries to advance the ball by running with it) and the &lt;em&gt;passing game&lt;/em&gt;. The earliest explicit reference that I've been able to find to "ground game" (with or without "passing" nearby) is in  "Rockne favors changes", NYT 10/25/1930:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In a radio talk at Pittsburgh last night over the Columbia Broadcasting System, Knute Rockne, Notre Dame football coach, declared that the restrictions on the &lt;strong&gt;ground game &lt;/strong&gt;in favor of forward passing had overbalanced football and that the rules committee could undoubtedly restore the balance by altering the rules.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you can antedate this one for the Gipper, please let us know in the comments.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of "running game" in contrast to "passing game" seems to be earlier, e.g. "Harvard Freshmen hold the 'Varsity", NYT 10/22/1914:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The youngsters' score came at the end of the practice, a kick being blocked, and then when the 'Varsity had stopped the freshmen's &lt;strong&gt;running game&lt;/strong&gt;, Horne, a back field man, made a drop kick goal from the field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The Canadian players went home tonight. They have spent three days showing the second team their &lt;strong&gt;passing game&lt;/strong&gt;. Harvard may use some of this later, but now is better prepared than formerly to defend itself against the rugby tactics that are being used at New Haven.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier examples tend to reference the kind of &lt;strong&gt;ground-game&lt;/strong&gt; that the OED defines "game which lives on the ground, as hares and rabbits"; uses of this phrase are especially thick around the time of the &lt;a href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1880/sep/02/ground-game-bill-no-211"&gt;Ground Game Bill&lt;/a&gt; of 1880.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[As in many areas of words derived from American sports, the OED is due for some improvement here. There doesn't seem to be any specific sub-entry for (either football or political) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ground game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the current on-line version, though the entry for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blitz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt;, has this citation:&lt;/p&gt;

All of you! Hear that? Hell!&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;ANTH204 - Introduction to Human Evolution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;An outline of human evolution. Relates changing human physical characteristics with evolving social and cultural adaptations. The relationships of humans to other primates are explored within an evolutionary framework. Documents transformation of human culture over the last two million years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I tried to get exam credit for this one as I bet I could pull it off, but they don't offer it. Oh, well. It'll be interesting anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;ANTH205 - Human cultural Diversity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using concepts and models of cultural anthropology, this course will survey the principal cultural types of the world and their distribution, and will undertake a detailed analysis of societies representative of each type.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This one will be new. I really don't know very much about cultural anthropology. Maybe we'll study some crazy crap like the !Kung.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;ANTH312 - The Archaeology of Ancient Egypt and the Near East&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selected topics on the archaeology of ancient Near Eastern cultures in Mesopotamia, the circum-Mediterranean area, Egypt, and the Nile Valley, emphasizing an anthropological interpretation of the political, social, religious, and economic systems that contributed to their development.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This sounds &lt;i&gt;awesome&lt;/i&gt;. I'm looking forward to this one more than any others, I think. I kind of want to focus on archaeology because I'd like to someday curate a history museum. I mean, my dream is to run a kids' science museum, but there are lots of other options. Plus ancient Egypt is just cool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;ANTH335 - Primate Behavior&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Biological differences between human individuals and groups, causes of variations, the role of genetics, concepts of race, and the interrelationships between the social and biological means of race will be considered.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This one I find kind of odd. I mean, I know humans are primates, but when I see a class called "Primate Behavior," I tend to think monkeys and apes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So starting this spring I might be blogging &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt; about anthropology. Since all I need for the second degree are the major requirements for anthro, it's literally all I'll be taking for the next year and a half. No electives. At least 12 hours of anthro every semester, and as many as they'll let me take in the summer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225782453136"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1629">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0948fc1bf8f62d28</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Why the Supreme Court matters to the autism community</title><published>2008-11-04T06:33:07Z</published><updated>2008-11-04T06:33:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/441783781/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225782453135"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v5/?p=919">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ec108936dd3c486c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">SciencePunk in the US - biometric art</title><published>2008-11-04T05:34:49Z</published><updated>2008-11-04T05:34:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v5/2008/11/sciencepunk-in-the-us-biometric-art/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Already well-known for its high-end burger joint, Madison Square Park in NYC is currently home to a nifty biometric art installation by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer entitled Pulse Park.  Two sculptures containing heart rate monitors transform the pulses of visitors into a light display created by two hundred theatrical spotlights.  The effect is pretty cool.

&lt;p&gt;I guess it isn&amp;#39;t that surprising that a poll of game players might get results that reflect the real world vote, but the strange thing is that there were some game-associated differences. People playing the Horde side (undead, orcs, that sort of thing) were mostly for Obama, while those on the Alliance side (humans, elves, dwarves) gave more mixed results, with dwarves being the only group that favored McCain. There&amp;#39;s a joke lurking in there, I&amp;#39;m sure…I just can&amp;#39;t think what it would be.&lt;/p&gt;

Proposition 48 was crushed, losing by a 3-to-1 vote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Colorado, Proposition 48 is up for vote on Tuesday. It is a rather simple statement; &lt;a href="http://www.elections.colorado.gov/admin/LogReportingManagement/LinkClick.aspx?table=Links&amp;amp;field=ItemID&amp;amp;id=3417&amp;amp;link=Initiatives%2fTitle+Board+Filings%2f2007-2008+Filings%2fResults%2fresults_36.pdf"&gt;here it is in its entirety on the Colorado ballot&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shall there be an amendment to the Colorado constitution defining the term “person” to include any human being from the moment of fertilization as “person” is used in those provisions of the Colorado constitution relating to inalienable rights, equality of justice, and due process of law? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, this amendment to the Colorado Constitution would define a person as an legal entity at the moment a human sperm fertilizes an egg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prop 48 is ridiculous for any number of legal reasons. For example, if a woman who is pregnant for a day has a few drinks which cause damage to the embryo, can she be charged with reckless endangerment? What if she takes medicine that saves her but endangers the embryo? If I drive a pregnant woman around, can I use the HOV 3 lanes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other vital issues, like how granting civil rights to a collection of cells takes away many civil rights of women, and the huge increase in governmental involvement this would mean in people’s lives. These are important to be sure, but not the point I want to make here. Also, these are age-old arguments, and in fact I can see where intelligent people can come down on opposite sides of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real point is, Prop 48 isn’t about science, and it’s not even about legal issues. &lt;strong&gt;It’s about religion&lt;/strong&gt;. This proposition is obviously based solely on religious beliefs; there is little reason outside of that to even bring the argument up that a fertilized egg is entitled to rights as a human being. It is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; the belief that the human soul enters the cell at that moment that this is an issue at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposition 48 is religion trying to create legislation, pure and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s based on flawed reasoning. Try this thought experiment: you’re walking down the street, and you see a building on fire. You enter it to help anyone out, and see it’s a lab. On one side is a five-year-old boy, and the other is a petri dish clearly labeled as having a dozen fertilized eggs in it. You only have time to rescue the boy or the eggs. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would argue that it would be, ironically, an &lt;em&gt;inhuman&lt;/em&gt; act to rescue the dish. Yet, according to the law if Prop 48 passes, you would have just chosen to let 12 human beings die to save one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, those cells are just that: cells. There is nothing there that makes them human other than their DNA and their potential to grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this leaves the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; question: &lt;strong&gt;what makes us human?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t even have a definition of what &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt; is — I can argue rather convincingly that fire is alive — let alone what it is to be human. And since we are talking legal issues here, you cannot state that it has to do with when a soul enters a body. I want to be perfectly clear about that, since that is an outright and clear violation of the First Amendment. The government cannot legislate religious beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have smart readers. Can anyone here give me a reason, &lt;em&gt;besides a religious one&lt;/em&gt;, that a fertilized egg is a human being? I’m willing to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let me help you here. It won’t fly to say that it has the coding (DNA) to become a human. Any cell in the body has that. I wouldn’t even accept that it has &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; to be human, because the egg and sperm &lt;em&gt;individually&lt;/em&gt; have potential to become human, if only they meet. You might counter and say that an egg already has that step done, but there are still many more on the way to being human. An egg can’t become a human without a lot of outside help (from the mother’s body), so the fertilization, while critical, is just one more step in the process. If any number of those steps fail, you don’t get a human out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you wonder where I think the humanity begins in all this, I’ll say I don’t know. I don’t think it’s necessarily definable. I might — &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; — be talked into saying a fetus becomes human once brain activity starts. Many definitions of death are when brain activity stops, so that at least is reciprocal. But even then it’s difficult. What brain activity? Thought? &lt;em&gt;Conscious&lt;/em&gt; thought? Does that make an adult gorilla more human than a five-day-old embryo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;, finally brings me to the ultimate point here: &lt;em&gt;we are trying to define something here that is fundamentally undefinable.&lt;/em&gt; Being human is not a line in the sand where you can say, this is human and this isn’t. I can tell when something is well over the line, like a cat, or a rock, or Rory Calhoun, but something closer to the line is very hard to delineate. Biologists still argue over whether viruses are alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposition 48 is bad science, bad religion, and bad law. Even if you are religious, and you believe God breathes a soul into a fertilized egg, it’s &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; a bad idea. Your religion may have a majority in Colorado right now, but it may not always. Separation of Church and State is a fragile thing, a wall made of nothing but ideas. And as we have seen, over and over again, ideas can be stomped flat by ideologues. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came..."&gt;Your ideas may be next&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225774836372"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d3dad882ec1638ce</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Le-A</title><published>2008-11-04T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2008-11-04T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/racial/language/le-a.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Mother names her child "Le-a," which she insists be pronounced "Ledasha."</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225769826333"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-8520758406398077781">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2b4b9b6c722bc300</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Somalia" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="bibiolatry" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Proposition 8" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="stoning" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="fundamentalism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="gay marriage" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Two Stadiums Where Religion Made the World Worse</title><published>2008-11-04T02:52:00Z</published><updated>2008-11-04T02:55:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/441642089/two-stadiums-where-religion-made-world.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/8520758406398077781/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=8520758406398077781" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/11/two-stadiums-where-religion-made-world.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">Within a few days of each other last week, on opposite sides of the world, on opposite ends of the wealth and privilege spectrums,  the faithful filled two stadiums.  In one, in Kismayo, Somalia, 1000 Muslim believers watched the stoning of a 13 year old girl—Aisha was her name--condemned for adultery because she dared to complain about being gang raped.  In the other, in San Diego, California, thousands of Evangelicals sang and swayed and pledged their bodies and souls to the purpose of stripping gay men and women of equality under the law and specifically the right to marry.  Like Aisha, those men and women have names.  One of them is named David.  Another Will. I know because I love them , as Aisha’s broken parents loved their daughter. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The horror of imagining a thirteen-year-old raped and stoned is so enormous that it is hard emotionally to put the two events in the same bucket.  And yet we must, if we are to understand what is happening to our country and to our world.   We must, because they belong there.  Both events can be understood only in terms of a single human phenomenon:  the worship of specific brutal words that were written in a brutal time and place.  Those 1000 Muslims and thousands of Evangelicals are “People of the Book,” the ideological Sons and Daughters of Abraham, bound by a lineage of clay tablet and papyrus and vellum and paper to moral priorities of our Bronze Age ancestors.  &lt;br&gt;These ancestors were sworn enemies of sex--outside of the relationship in which a man controlled and jealously guarded his females: wives, slaves, and daughters.  He owned them all, and to violate one of them was to violate his property (“You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.” Exodus 20.)  He owned their offspring, and if he was vigilant enough he could be reasonably confident about whose DNA his females carried in their bellies.  When he went to war, he raped or kept the women of his enemies, as a part of the plunder.  (“Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.  But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.”  Numbers 13.)&lt;br&gt;The stoning, like the urgent need to bar gays from acceptance as full members of society comes straight out of the Books, chapter and verse.  And though one seems more vile than the other, both reflect the widespread human willingness to deny to others the rights we want for ourselves:  liberty, the pursuit of happiness, or even life.  How quickly we turn brutish when we idolize the fears and angers of our ancestors or our own fear and anger –and thus give divine sanction to our darkest impulses.  In the end, in California, over 30 million dollars were spent in an attempt to deny one of the world’s most basic  human rights to young couples, and old lovers, and pairs of moms and dads with kids in school or highchairs.  An equal amount was spent in defense of fairness.   How many thirteen-year-old girls might have been saved—from malaria or starvation  or even stoning-- if the American People of the Book could let Books be books and could freely turn their moral energy toward alleviating suffering instead of causing it. &lt;br&gt;Valerie Tarico&lt;br&gt;Seattle.

&lt;p&gt;They do love to book that auditorium in the Physics building — don&amp;#39;t be fooled, though. None of the science departments on campus endorse this nonsense, and I know from talking to some of them that the faculty cringe at this use of their facilities…and you know the creationists do this for the faux-sciencey illusion that they&amp;#39;re actually presenting their work in the heart of academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is being presented by Dave Nutting of the &lt;a href="http://discovercreation.org/"&gt;Alpha Omega Institute&lt;/a&gt;, which, despite the grandiose name, is two wackaloons operating out of a small rental office &lt;a href="http://discovercreation.org/contact/contact.htm"&gt;next to a storage unit and behind the pet clinic&lt;/a&gt; in a Grand Junction, Colorado. They're doing a &lt;a href="http://www.tccsa.tc/notices/nutting_oct_nov_08.pdf"&gt;tour&lt;/a&gt; through central Minnesota, and are being promoted by our local collection of kooks, the &lt;a href="http://www.tccsa.tc/"&gt;Twin Cities Creation Science Association&lt;/a&gt;. I have no idea why it says Coca Cola at the bottom of the flyer; I hope they aren't sponsoring this silliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I'm going to be in Washington D.C. this weekend, so I have to miss the circus.

These sizes range from the lower end of &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt; downwards into the &lt;em&gt;Homo habilis&lt;/em&gt; range. The fossils contain a mixture of anatomical features from &lt;em&gt;erectus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;habilis&lt;/em&gt;. They could arguably be considered to belong either to primitive &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;H. ergaster&lt;/em&gt;), or to a new species, &lt;em&gt;Homo georgicus&lt;/em&gt;. Vekua et al 2002 concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Dmanisi hominids are among the most primitive individuals so far attributed to &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt; or to any species that is indisputably &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;, and it can be argued that this population is closely related to &lt;em&gt;Homo habilis&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;sensu stricto&lt;/em&gt;) as known from Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, Koobi Fora in northern Kenya, and possibly Hadar in Ethiopia.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These skulls are intermediate in both anatomy and size between &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;H. habilis&lt;/em&gt;, and as a result are exceedingly difficult for creationists to classify. Creationists therefore either ignored them (the usual reaction), or were forced into the absurdity of claiming that the biggest skull is human but the smallest two are apes (Lubenow 2004), or the almost equally implausible suggestion that all of them are human (Line 2005).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2007, further light was thrown on the Dmanisi hominids with the announcement that a substantial number of bones from below the skull had been discovered (Lordkipanidze et al 2007). These included a right femur, tibia and kneecap (the most complete known lower limb of early &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;); an ankle bone, part of a shoulder blade, three collar bones, three upper arm bones, five vertebrae, and a few other small bones. Some of these bones were associated with some of the previously discovered skulls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the bones shows that the Dmanisi hominids definitely walked bipedally and upright. However, the bones show a number of differences from modern humans and have some features associated with &lt;em&gt;Homo habilis&lt;/em&gt;. The upper body differences lead the authors to suggest, with some caution, that “the Dmanisi hominins would have had a more australopith-like than human-like upper limb morphology”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their final conclusion was:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lordkipanidze et al 2007 Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The following preliminary conclusions can be drawn: the morphology of the upper and lower limbs from Dmanisi exhibits a mosaic of traits reflecting both selection for improved terrestrial locomotor performance and the retention of primitive characters absent in later hominins. The length and morphology of the hindlimb is essentially modern, and the presence of an adducted hallux and plantar arch indicate that the salient aspects of performance in the leg and foot, such as biomechanical efficiency during long-range walking and energy storage/return during running, were equivalent to modern humans. However, plesiomorphic features such as a more medial orientation of the foot, absence of humeral torsion, small body size and low encephalization quotient suggest that the Dmanisi hominins are postcranially largely comparable to earliest &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; (cf. &lt;em&gt;H. habilis&lt;/em&gt;). Hence, the first hominin species currently known from outside Africa did not possess the full suite of derived locomotor traits apparent in African &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt; and later hominins.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, these new bones just make the Dmanisi hominids look more transitional than ever. They were clearly most of the way towards modern human posture and locomotion, but weren’t completely there yet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gibbons 2007 Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The bones are so primitive that a few researchers aren’t even sure they are members of &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;. “They are truly transitional forms that are neither archaic hominins nor unambiguous members of our own genus,” says paleoanthropologist Bernard Wood…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One creationist who has discussed the Dmanisi postcranial fossils is Casey Luskin of the Discovery Institute, in a web article &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/09/human_origins_update_harvard_s.html" rel="external "&gt;Human Origins Update: Harvard Scientist and New York Times Reporter Get the “Plug Evolution Memo”…Sort of&lt;/a&gt;.  (Luskin’s article was addressed at the time by blog articles by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/09/luskins_latest_lie.php" rel="external "&gt;Mike Dunford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/afarensis/2007/09/22/muffler_falls_off_ford_pinto_l/" rel="external "&gt;Afarensis&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luskin concludes that the upper body and skull of the Dmanisi fossils are very apelike and that any claim for transitional status rests only upon the supposed humanness of the legs, so he goes to work to discredit that claim:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Luskin Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Yet these leg and foot bones in many respects resemble modern apes as much as they resemble modern humans. I cannot be faulted for being skeptical of the claim that these species were necessarily evolving towards modern humans.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are these supposed respects in which the bones resemble apes as much as humans?  Here are two of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Luskin Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
According to the Figure 3 in the Nature report, the femoral length is like that of a human or a gorilla (Fig. 3b).  … Figure 3 also reports the length of an arm bone, as the humeral length resembles that of a human or perhaps a chimp (Fig. 3b).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These statements are correct as far as they go, but that isn’t very far. Figure 3b was a graph which compared femoral length with humeral length for a number of fossils and species. This particular comparison distinguishes humans from chimps from gorillas from orangs very effectively. Guess what - the Dmanisi fossil falls smack in the middle of the human range:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style="width:348px"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/10/29/figure3b.jpg" alt="figure3b.jpg" width="342" height="266"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3b&lt;/strong&gt;. Legend:
Star: Dmanisi hominid;
Z: recent &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;;
Y: gorillas;
+: chimpanzees;
squares: orang-utans.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s quite clear from this graph that the humeral and femoral lengths together strongly support the claim that the Dmanisi leg bones are humanlike. To claim that these measurements are as much evidence of apelike characteristics as humanlike ones is blatantly dishonest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another graph, figure 3c, which compares femoral length with tibial length, also shows the Dmanisi fossil in the middle of the human cluster. However, it is also in the middle of the gorilla cluster. This comparison doesn’t differentiate humans from gorillas, but it’s quite clear from the size and anatomy of Dmanisi that it’s nothing like a gorilla, and figure 3c does clearly differentiate Dmanisi from chimps and orangs, both of which are more comparable to it in size. So on balance, this graph also shows Dmanisi to be more humanlike than apelike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third graph, figure 3a, compares the tibial length with a tibial width (the tibial mediolateral distal width, to be precise). This time, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an apelike characteristic: the tibial width could match just about anything (humans, chimps, gorillas or orangs), but the tibial length is too short for a human, matches a gorilla, and is too long for chimps or orangs. But wait a minute - wasn’t tibial length also measured in graph 3c?  So it was, and there it fell in the human range, so how can it fall outside of it now? It turns out figure 3a is erroneous - Table 1 on the previous page says that human tibial lengths range from 290 to 374 mm, but that’s not the range shown in figure 3a. So, the one attribute from these graphs that did look unambiguously apelike rather than humanlike turns out to be a mistake. And, for once, it’s not even Luskin’s fault.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style="width:346px"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/10/29/figure3a.jpg" alt="figure3a.jpg" width="340" height="261"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3a&lt;/strong&gt;. Legend:
Star: Dmanisi hominid;
Z: recent &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;;
Y: gorillas;
+: chimpanzees;
squares: orang-utans.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Luskin made another mistake when he said that the tibial width matched that of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonobo" rel="external "&gt;bonobo&lt;/a&gt;. Luskin appears to think that the &lt;em&gt;Pongo pygmaeus&lt;/em&gt; referred to in the graphs is the bonobo. Might I suggest that people who don’t know that &lt;em&gt;Pongo pygmaeus&lt;/em&gt; is the formal name for the orang-utan should probably not be trying to critique scientific papers on human evolution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luskin’s claim that the foot bones resemble modern apes as much as modern humans is also a misrepresentation. Lordkipanidze et al 2007 has a long paragraph on the foot bones which mentions only one minor apelike characteristic, the angle of a groove for a tendon which is “slightly oblique” compared to the “more vertical orientation” of humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Luskin’s counting of ape vs. human characteristics mentioned in the paper would be of little value even if he had not misrepresented them. The shape, or morphology, of bones is far more complex than can be conveyed by a few lengths. And we know that the leg bones of the Dmanisi hominids are overall very humanlike, because Lordkipanidze et al tell us so very plainly in their conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lordkipanidze et al 2007 Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The length and morphology of the hindlimb is essentially modern, and the presence of an adducted hallux and plantar arch indicate that the salient aspects of performance in the leg and foot, such as biomechanical efficiency during long-range walking and energy storage/return durring running, were equivalent to modern humans.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s confirmed by leading paleoanthropologist Erik Trinkaus, &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/09/070919-human-fossil_2.html" rel="external "&gt;quoted by National Geographic&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What is clear is that the overall anatomy is primarily for walking on the ground.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few other reasons why Luskin’s insinuation that the Dmanisi hominids are apes won’t fly. Although Luskin dismisses the skulls by saying only that they are small, hence like &lt;em&gt;habilis&lt;/em&gt;, hence apelike, the skulls have many similarities with those of &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt;, enough to have been originally allocated to that species (Vekua et al 2002). The smallest Dmanisi skull is indeed very small (600 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), but the biggest one, at 780 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, is larger than any ape, and &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; larger than any ape of comparable size. The Dmanisi hominids also made stone tools (Gabunia et al 2000). So if these are apes, as Luskin wishes to imply, they are apes that walked bipedally, made tools, and had skulls very similar in both size and shape to Homo erectus. That sure makes them transitional in my book!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luskin has one final attack to make against the Dmanisi hominids:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Luskin Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, according to the currently reported data, these new fossils can’t be transitional between the Australopithecines and the genus Homo. The new fossil finds were dated at 1.77 million years. Yet Homo erectus itself has been dated at 1.9 million years of age, a point conceded by Lieberman’s article.&lt;/strong&gt; Thus, it is impossible that these fossils themselves were actually transitional between the Australopithecines and Homo erectus. (bold in original)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that the Dmanisi fossils are a little younger than the oldest &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt; fossils, but that only means &lt;em&gt;those particular individuals&lt;/em&gt; can’t be the ancestor of the older &lt;em&gt;erectus&lt;/em&gt; fossils.  It doesn’t mean that they aren’t anatomically transitional, and it doesn’t mean that earlier members of their population couldn’t be ancestral to &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt;. The Dmanisi hominids didn’t live at only a single point in space and time. They mostly likely existed for hundreds of thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of Luskin’s article isn’t specifically about Dmanisi. In it, Luskin compares quotes from commentators and tries to whip up imagined contradictions into a half-serious fantasy about how scientists are supposedly sending each other memos about plugging evolution to the public. Here is one of the pieces of evidence Luskin provides to support his conspiracy theories. Read it and laugh:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Luskin Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
NY Times’ reporter John Noble Wilford’s reversal in rhetoric is even more striking. Keep in mind that he originally reported that “Other paleontologists and experts in human evolution said the discovery [an earlier one] strongly suggested that the early transition from more apelike to more humanlike ancestors was still poorly understood.” But consider the highly different tune sung by his most recent article: “Other paleoanthropologists said the discovery could lead to breakthroughs in the critical evolutionary period in which some members of Australopithecus, the genus made famous by the Lucy skeleton, made the transition to Homo.” Apparently last month, “other paleontologists” said human evolution was “poorly understood” and now the “other paleontologists” are finding “breakthroughs in the critical evolutionary period.” What a difference a month makes! I think Wilford got the memo.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, because “other paleontologists” said that human evolution was poorly understood (actually they didn’t, if you read carefully), and a month later “other paleontologists” (not necessarily the same ones) talked about “finding breakthroughs” (again, they didn’t, if you read carefully) we’re supposed to be impressed? This is just delusional. There is nothing remotely contradictory about saying that a new discovery &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; provide new information about something that is currently not well understood. Nor are either of Wilford’s statements “rhetoric”; they’re factual reporting of non-sensational statements from experts. “rhetoric” far better describes Luskin’s writing, which distorts everything it touches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When scientists say things like “the early transition from apes to humans is poorly understood”, that might mean that we don’t know over what area the transition happened, when and at what speed it happened, the order of anatomical changes, the range of variation throughout the process, and the causes of the transition. Even superb fossils like Dmanisi can only illuminate one point in a complex process. Saying that something is “poorly understood” is not a crushing admission about the lack of evidence for evidence, it’s just being honest - hominid fossils between 2 and 3 million years ago are especially rare, and we really don’t know a lot about what was going on then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know is that the Dmanisi hominids lived 1.8 million years ago, that they looked very transitional, and that creationists can’t handle them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;There were essentially two says to investigate colloquial language non-anecdotally: collect your own corpora (by eliciting speech, recording it, transcribing the recordings, and coding the transcriptions); or use other people&amp;#39;s corpora, collected for other purposes (in which case, other people do the elicitation, recording, and transcribing, leaving you to do the coding — and of course the counting and the analysis). That&amp;#39;s still the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collecting your own corpora is hard work, it takes time (transcription is particularly tedious), it takes skill (in elicitation, especially; you can't just stick a microphone in someone's face and tell them to talk to you). and it takes money. Piggy-backing on other people's corpora hugely simplifies the task. For many purposes, that just won't do. But sometimes, things sing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's where Studs Terkel comes in. He spent decades interviewing (mostly) ordinary people and publishing the conversations, and he was fantastic at establishing a rapport with the folks he interviewed. The result was a body of corpora that's a goldmine of data for (some) linguists, from &lt;em&gt;Division Street&lt;/em&gt; (1966) on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has its limitations, of course. In particular, the material is edited, which means that variants that either the interviewees or the editors are conscious of as socially significant are probably out of bounds, and some kinds of statistical tests are probably not going to be doable. But if you choose the right question, you can gain some insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the old days, you still had to search through the texts by hand, mark all the relevant examples, code them, put them on index cards (so that they could later be sorted and counted on your living-room floor, or its equivalent); it helps a lot if the stuff you&amp;#39;re reading actually has some interest for you. Some of this — though not all — can now be automated and immeasurably speeded up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studs's books were a big help. In particular, I used them to provide data for my first work on "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001266.html"&gt;stranded &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001266.html"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;", Verb Phrase Ellipsis leaving infinitival &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; as a remainder (as in "They told me to leave, but I didn't want to ___"). (My first published discussion was &lt;a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~zwicky/stranded-to.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, in 1982.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I use his first name (well, the name he used; his birth name was Louis), partly because almost everyone did, and he invited it, but also because we actually talked, back in 2002, when I was trying to persuade him to give a plenary talk at the New Ways of Analyzing Variation conference at Stanford that year. He was charmed and honored by linguists' interests in the way be interviewed people and crafted his texts, but at around 90, the prospect of a plane trip from Chicago to San Francisco and a long crowded weekend of meetings, all of which would take him away from projects he wanted to finish before he died, was just too much. Who could argue with that?]&lt;/p&gt;

It all started with &lt;a href="http://isisthescientist.blogspot.com/2008/10/transition-to-day-light-savings-time.html"&gt;a harmless little analysis&lt;/a&gt; of a letter published in NEJM.  The strange part (to those of us who live here) was that &lt;a href="http://isisthescientist.blogspot.com/2008/10/response-from-janszky-and-ljung-dr-isis.html"&gt;the authors responded&lt;/a&gt;.  On the blog.  For real. And they were kinda pissed (in the American sense of the word; I have no idea if they'd been drinking, but probably not.  After all, they're not bloggers).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communication in medical research is slow.  In general, this can be a good thing.  Before research is published in a respected journal, it should be thoroughly reviewed.  Follow up letters to the editor are necessarily few and delayed, given the nature of the medium.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogs are changing this.  More and more scientists and physicians are &lt;a href="http://researchblogging.org/"&gt;blogging about peer-reviewed research&lt;/a&gt;, and how this will affect scientific discourse is anyone's guess.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Before melamine-laced milk killed and sickened Chinese babies and led to recalls around the world, the routine spiking of milk with illicit substances was an open secret in China's dairy regions, according to the accounts of farmers and others with knowledge of the industry.

&lt;p&gt;Farmers here in Hebei province say in interviews that "protein powder" of often-uncertain origin has been employed for years as a cheap way to help the milk of undernourished cows fool dairy companies' quality checks. When the big companies caught on, some additive makers switched to toxic melamine -- which mimics protein in lab tests and can cause severe kidney damage -- to evade detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China's biggest local seller of liquid milk, Mengniu Dairy Co., and multinational food company Nestlé SA both say they were aware that Chinese farmers and traders added unauthorized substances to raw milk, but that they didn't know melamine was among them. "We knew there was adulteration" going on for many years, says Zhao Yuanhua, Mengniu's spokeswoman. Among other common milk additives: a viscous yellow liquid containing fat and a combination of preservatives and antibiotics, known as "fresh-keeping liquid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're buying pet food made in China or anything else for that matter, it's time to pay more for a product manufactured in a country like America, where we have had oversight and controls on food production for over a century.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/11/if_youre_surpsied_youre_not_pa.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/441327435" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225746174078"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-8849790698223893077">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/59cb827633ae3380</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolutionary Biology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Maynard Smith on Stephen Jay Gould</title><published>2008-11-03T20:38:00Z</published><updated>2008-11-03T21:01:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/11/maynard-smith-on-stephen-jay-gould.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/8849790698223893077/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=8849790698223893077" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Someone resurrected an old quotation by John Maynard Smith in a comment on Good Science Writers: Stephen Jay Gould.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how I replied on March 26m 2002 on the newsgroup talk.origins.

It evokes the age-old question: What Would Darwin Eat? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should note that I myself have been known to eat things in weird ways. I love peeling the chocolate sandwich part off ice cream sandwiches and eating them first. However, you have to be careful to leave a little bit so you can hold the vanilla bar without it slipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More apropos to the letter sent to Ebert, I actually like to pop a few M&amp;amp;Ms into my mouth and then peel them with my teeth. The slightly larger lump of chocolate this creates tastes better than an individual M&amp;amp;M. Try it. And I’m still ticked at Mars Snackfoods, Inc. because they don’t make the bigger M&amp;amp;Ms anymore. Those rocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe I’d better stop there. You have no desire to see me eat a chicken leg. I’ve seen devoted carnivores turn away.&lt;/p&gt;

Typically, there&amp;#39;s at least a 10:1 disparity in the amount of shelf space dedicated, and it&amp;#39;s often much worse — there have been a few bookstores where, when I ask to find the science books, the clerk will point me to a small shelf labeled &amp;quot;Pets/Nature&amp;quot;. Bleh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I got a good question on Saturday at Guelph, which also mentioned this cluelessness by too many bookstores. Could we compile a list of excellent science books, that is, books that should appeal to the lay public, have some chance of commercial success, and that we think do a good job of presenting an interesting and accurate view of science? I suspect there are a few people here who read books, and might have some opinions here — how about expressing them in the comments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;d like to accumulate is actually a couple of lists. If you went to the religion section of the local Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, you&amp;#39;d be quite surprised if the Christian bible were absent — similarly, I&amp;#39;d like a list of the &lt;i&gt;essential&lt;/i&gt; books a good bookstore ought to carry, the ones that are perennially useful and popular. This would be handy for confronting an owner and asking him why he has so many obvious omissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another list would be of commercially viable popular science books. These would be books that present good science, but ought also to be popular among readers. Bookstore owners want to make money, so doing a little pre-screening for them and helping them to make an informed decision would be productive and helpful, and maybe they'd actually listen if we showed a list like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here's the deal: nominate some books. For each one, say whether it is essential or popular. It might also be useful to assign a broad category (math, physics, chemistry, biology, geology, psychology, for instance)  to each. I'll compile them later this month and put together some simple pdfs that you can download and use at your local bookstore to try and encourage some upgrading of the stock.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/what_science_books_ought_a_boo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/441314291" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225741462205"><id gr:original-id="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=154">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1b5426d958e54d00</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Autism Policy"/><category term="Autism Science"/><category term="Critical Thinking"/><title type="html">“Let’s put on a Study!”</title><published>2008-11-03T19:44:05Z</published><updated>2008-11-03T19:44:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=154" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://photoninthedarkness.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Once again, there is a hue and cry to “do a study” about vaccines and autism, this time pushed forward by commentors on &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=256"&gt;David Gorski’s recent post &lt;/a&gt;on the “Science-Based Medicine” ‘blog. Whenever I hear people who have never tried to do &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; study - let alone a study of human &lt;em&gt;children&lt;/em&gt; - say “We need to do a study!”, I can’t help thinking of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland and their “Let’s put on a show!” musical films - ergo the title of this article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I expected, the commentors put forth many of the same arguments that haven’t worked before but this time they are doing their math, something I appreciate. So, in appreciation, I have prepared the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reason:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interest in “doing a study” seems to stem from the idea that the only way to find if vaccines are connected with autism is to study unvaccinated children and compare their autism prevalence with vaccinated children. This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; true and is - in fact - &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; even the most effective way to study the postulated connection, as I will show later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the blame for this wrong-headed fixation on “Just study the unvaccinated!” can be laid at the feet of Dan Olmsted, who claimed that the Amish don’t vaccinate and don’t have autism. Both claims - it turns out - are untrue. The Amish &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; vaccinate and they &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;have autism. Apparently, Mr. Olmsted &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=29"&gt;didn’t look &lt;/a&gt;in the right places for his information about the Amish. And if you don’t look, you never find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same argument - if you don’t look, you don’t find - has been used to argue for studying the “connection” between autism and vaccines. However, researchers &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; looked. They looked at thimerosal and autism - and found &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/115/1/200"&gt;no correlation&lt;/a&gt;. They looked at the MMR vaccine and autism - and &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/aq0470t874jwm686/"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6T1B-4D974DV-10&amp;amp;_user=10&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=10&amp;amp;md5=899fc3ee4f47a1bdedae3b8eb335d2ef"&gt;find&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=18769550"&gt;correlation&lt;/a&gt;. Now, with their backs against the wall, the vaccines-cause-autism believers have shifted from distinct vaccines or vaccine components to vague “toxins” or the even more vague “too many, too soon”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite an absolute lack of data supporting either claim (’toxins” or “too many, too soon”), the proponents have argued that “we need to do a study” of vaccines and autism. “We” (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; the taxpayers) may indeed end up “putting on a study” in response to the political pressure these groups may bring to bear. I have no illusions that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; research will ever be able to convince these people that they are &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. After all, they haven’t been swayed by any research done so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, since we’re all going to end up paying for this study, we should ask that it be done in the most effective way possible, rather than simply following the uninformed dictates of the vaccines-cause-autism believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Amish:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me dispose of one line of “reasoning” that often comes up when these “Let’s put on a study” promoters gather. It is often suggested that we “take advantage” of existing groups of people who do not vaccinate their children. Mr. Olmsted proposed the Amish, although it later turned out that the Amish &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; vaccinate their children, although not at the level seen in the population at large. Another proposed study group was a health care group in Chicago that practiced non-vaccination and also - we are told - had a low to zero autism rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with selecting “special” populations to study is that they are not comparable to the general public. The Amish - probably the most dramatic example - have a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; higher prevalence of &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; genetic disorders as a result of generations of inbreeding. They are not comparable to the US population for this reason and any results obtained from studying them would be irrelevant. I suspect the &lt;em&gt;main&lt;/em&gt; reason for wanting to study the Amish was that Mr. Olmsted “found” that they don’t have any autism - which was, as I’ve said above, &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we were to study a group like that in Chicago, the question would arise, “What &lt;em&gt;other &lt;/em&gt;differences (besides vaccination) are there?” Do they only eat organic foods? What &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; might account for any differences between them and the general population. And if &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; difference in autism prevalence were discovered, would that be &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; to satisfy the folks crying to “put on a study” or would they simply shift their sights to another group?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the only way to correctly do a study of vaccines and autism is to compare children who are matched for age, sex, geographic location, rural/urban/suburban setting, socio-economic group and race. That way, the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; differences (we hope) would be vaccination status and autism prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Numbers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we’re to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; a study (as opposed to “putting on” a study), we need to have an idea of the numbers of subjects we’ll need to test in order to come up with a statistically meaningful result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, Smith &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/114/1/187"&gt;“Children who have received no vaccines: Who are they and where do they live?”&lt;/a&gt;. This was an extensive study of vaccination practices in the US, carried out from 1995 to 2001 on over 23,000 children selected at random to be representative of the larger population. Their results were interesting and bear directly on the  desire to “put on a study” looking at the connection (or lack thereof) between vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they found was that 62.8% of their study population was “fully vaccinated” (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; had received all the vaccines on the then-current vaccination schedule - 15 total in 2001). An additional 36.9% were “undervaccinated” - although 58.5% of them (20.4% of the total sample) were missing only one vaccine. Only 0.3% of the sample - 111 children ages 19 - 35 months over five years - had not received &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to emphasize a point. The Smith &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; study only looked at children 19 - 35 months of age, which is &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; before school age, at which time undoubtedly a few more tenths of a percent of the unvaccinated were whittled away. However, this age includes the ages where children have been reported to have “regressed into autism” following vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, any study of unvaccinated &lt;em&gt;vs&lt;/em&gt; vaccinated children has to deal with the fact that the “pool” of unvaccinated children is about 0.3% (or less) of the total population. Even if we could extend the Smith &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; findings to the entire 0 - 17 year age range (”children”, by most definitions), this works out to only about 223,000 completely unvaccinated children. Given that at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the children who were unvaccinated before 35 months will have gotten at least one vaccination by their teen years, this number is sure to be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this demonstration, let’s limit the study group to younger children, both to eliminate the uncertainty about the number of unvaccinated children and to keep the diagnostic criteria somewhat comparable. After all, the criteria used to diagnose the 17 year-old autistic children were very different from those used today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about we settle on the 3 - 6 year age range? This puts them past the scheduled time for the majority of childhood vaccinations and yet cuts off before the “school vaccination mandate” years. According to the US census bureau, this age group (as of August 2008) contains 16,550,753 children. Of that number 49,652 (or less) might be completely unvaccinated (and over ten million “completely vaccinated”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sort of sample numbers do we need to “prove” the vaccine-austism question? Well, let’s make a few assumptions. The first assumption is that we will want to have a sample size large enough to be sure that we have less than a 5% chance of mistakenly saying there &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;a correlation if there isn’t (alpha error)  - and we’ll want a less than 5% chance of saying there &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; a correlation if there is one (beta error) in order to satisfy those who want to “put on a study” (normally, we’d accept a 20 - 50% chance of mistakenly saying that there is not a difference when there is one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we’ll have to stipulate what sort of difference we expect to find between the two groups. If the “fully vaccinated” group had 50% more autism than the “unvaccinated” group, would that be enough of a reason to change vaccination policies? Would a 10% difference be enough? More to the point, how &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; a difference will be small enough for the vaccine-cause-autism proponents to say “I was wrong, vaccines &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; cause autism.”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last point may be the one that actually torpedoes the study. Because if there is no number small enough to convince those who &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; the study that they are wrong, most of the reason for &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; the study vanishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say - for the sake of argument - that we decide that a 10% difference in autism prevalence is enough to convince the skeptics that vaccines &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; cause autism and that a less than 10% difference will convince the believers that vaccines &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; cause autism. [I know, the latter assumption is pure fantasy.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, plugging those numbers in - along with the current 1 in 150 autism prevalence - we find that we need over 360,000 children in &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; group to detect a 10% difference (you can try it yourself &lt;a href="http://www.dssresearch.com/toolkit/default.asp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Unfortunately, that is more than the total number of unvaccinated children in the US, so &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; not going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we get with our “sample” of 49,652 unvaccinated children? If we manage to include &lt;em&gt;each and every unvaccinated child in the US&lt;/em&gt; in the study, we could detect a 26% or more difference in autism prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s not even remotely practical to expect to get 100% of the unvaccinated children in the country into a study. How about a more practical number - say, 10% of them? That would allow us to detect a 70% or greater difference - about a three-fold difference in autism prevalence between the fully vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; a difference of this magnitude or greater were found, that would pretty effectively silence those who say that the data haven’t shown a connection between vaccines and autism. I would certainly change my opinion (from “not shown” to “strong indication”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if the results go the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; way? What if the results are “negative”, meaning that the difference is &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; than 70%? Would &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;be enough to get the vaccines-cause-autism crowd to stop protesting and stop sending death threats? I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are those who &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; that the results will be unambiguously in favor of their belief that vaccines-cause-autism. They want the study to go forward because they are &lt;em&gt;confident&lt;/em&gt; that they will be vindicated. &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/358/1/93"&gt;They are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; the people who will rant about “bias”, “flaws” and “corruption” if the data don’t go “their way”.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another other thing to consider is that a study with almost ten thousand children enrolled would be &lt;em&gt;exorbitantly&lt;/em&gt; expensive, especially as they would all have to be tested carefully for autism. Even using a very conservative figure of $150 for an evaluation, that’s over $1.5 million just for the autism testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget that research money, time and facilities are not infinite. Resources spent chasing the vaccines-cause-autism “connection” will have to come from other research areas, and the most fair way to do that would be to take them from other autism research. Thus, much time and money is spent to accomplish little…or nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And is it &lt;em&gt;likely&lt;/em&gt;  that you could get the &lt;em&gt;parents&lt;/em&gt; of 10% of the unvaccinated children in the country to enroll them in a study? Given that many of these children are unvaccinated because their parents harbor deep suspcions about doctors and “the government”, it seems unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s “run the numbers” on a more practical study - one where we are able to enroll 500 unvaccinated children and 5000 fully vaccinated controls matched for age, sex, socioeconomic group, geographic location, urban vs rural vs suburban setting and race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study - which would still be very difficult and expensive to do - would only be able to detect a more than 15-fold difference in autism prevalence between the two groups. It &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; detect as little as a 7-fold difference, but only if we were willing to accept a beta error (chance of erroneously saying there is no difference when there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a difference) of over 50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt this would “satisfy” the vaccines-cause-autism believers if the results were &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, before someone tells me - &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; - how easy it would be to study autism in unvaccinated children, first go out and try to &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; a few thousand completely unvaccinated children and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; tell me how easy it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethical Considerations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another suggestion made was to have a study where children are placed into “no vaccination” and “vaccination” groups. This, of course, would be rejected out of hand by any Institutional Review Board because the risks of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; vaccinating are well known and quite serious. On the other hand, the connection between vaccines and autism is tenuous at best. It would be unethical to expose &lt;em&gt;adults&lt;/em&gt; to a known serious risk in order to test a weakly-supported (again, at best!) &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; risk. In &lt;em&gt;children&lt;/em&gt;, it would be unthinkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another “modest proposal” was to vaccinate one group per the suggested schedule and vaccinate another group with four times the amount of vaccine. Well, at least this commentor understands the concept of “dose-response”. If - as some people argue - the &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; amount of vaccine is causing some amount of autism, then it would be reasonable to expect that &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; vaccine would lead to &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the idea of doing something with the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of causing harm to children is unlikely to pass the ethical hurdles of a real IRB. However, even if the hypothesis is &lt;em&gt;incorrect&lt;/em&gt; - even if the researchers argue that harm is &lt;em&gt;extremely unlikely&lt;/em&gt;, they would &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; be exposing children to four times the dose used during the safety trials of the vaccines, which would constitute an unreasonable risk, especially to test a hypothesis that is &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if the results are “negative”, the vaccines-cause-autism proponents could (and &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;) argue that their hypothesis is correct but that the &lt;em&gt;threshold&lt;/em&gt; for causing autism is lower than the “standard” vaccine regimen (you know, the “too many, too soon” argument). Thus, the argument for doing the study (absent the obvious ethical considerations) has largely disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Alternative:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the difficulty in doing a study of unvaccinated children is tracking them down. There is no national or even statewide database that can “spit out” the names of unvaccinated children; you’d have to track them down one by one, a process that can take years to complete, given the numbers needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the proposed study design wastes the effort used to collect the subjects based on a single variable - vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A much better study design would be to look at two age, sex, etc. matched sets of autistic and non-autistic children. Autistic children are more “visible” in the medical and educational systems than unvaccinated children (who are often “under the radar”). It would be easier (although not &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;) to recruit autistic children and non-autistic control subjects than it would be to track down thousands of unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another advantage is that the researchers could collect data on a wide variety of exposures, genetic issues and other variables that could later be “mined” to find other promising avenues of research. This in contrast to the “single issue” study looking at unvaccinated children, which can only compare issues related to vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with those advantages, the study will be “swimming upstream” a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study of autistic children in the 3 - 6 year age range would need over 683,000 children in each group to detect a 10% difference in vaccination level. It would need nearly 22,000 in each group to detect a 50% difference. With a predicted number of 110,000 autistic children in that age range, that is a sizeable fraction of all autistic children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more manageable study - one with 10,000 children in each arm (which is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; a HUGE study!) - would only be able to tell the difference between the national average of 0.3% unvaccinated in the non-autistic group and 0.1% unvaccinated in the autistic group (at the specified levels of confidence). If the difference is smaller than that, the results would be considered &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; that there is no effect of vaccination). For reference, a study with 1,000 children in each arm would show statistical significance (at our specified level of confidence) only when the autistic group was below 0.01% unvaccinated or above 1.7% unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we wouldn’t have to &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; look at unvaccinated &lt;em&gt;vs&lt;/em&gt; fully vaccinated with this study, which is a large part of its superiority. We could look at a &lt;em&gt;dose response&lt;/em&gt; of vaccination - to see if it really is “too many” - as well as the age at youngest vaccination - to see if it really is “too soon”. In fact, a few studies have already looked at those issues and found that there is no difference between the autistic and non-autistic groups. I suspect &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is the reason the folks pushing to “put on a study” want to look at vaccinated &lt;em&gt;vs&lt;/em&gt; unvaccinated - they hope that the numbers will be different (or, at least, not as definitive) the other way round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current push to “put on a study” comparing the autism prevalence in vaccinated and unvaccinated children is likely to come to political fruition long before it generates any real &lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt; interest. Anyone who has actually done a human study will recognize that the proposed study format - find a bunch of unvaccinated kids and compare their autism prevalence to the general population - has serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our political leaders eventually find it expedient to “put on a study” in a vain attempt to quiet the protests of the vaccines-cause-autism fringe, then we need to be prepared to &lt;em&gt;insist&lt;/em&gt; that it be a &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; study, not a rigged “study” pre-ordained to find the “correct” results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene pointed out that there are two possible scopings for &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; in this sentence: over &lt;em&gt;marriage between a man and a woman&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;quot;wide&amp;quot; scope) — &amp;#39;the only thing (specifically, institution) that is valid or recognized in California is marriage between a man and a woman&amp;#39; — or just over &lt;em&gt;marriage&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;quot;narrow scope&amp;quot;) — &amp;#39;the only marriage that is valid or recognized in California is marriage between a man and a woman&amp;#39;. The intended scoping is the narrow one, and everyone recognizes that (because the wide-scope reading is ridiculous in the real world), but Gene had to go through a very brief process of rejecting the wide-scope reading, which is the one he entertained first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he notes that in other cases the wide-scope reading is almost surely the intended one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Gene offered this example from a comment on a web page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only marriage between a man and a woman provides children with everything they need to grow up to be healthy, productive adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intended reading was almost surely 'the only thing (specifically, institution) that provides children with everything they need to grow up to be healthy, productive adults is marriage between a man and a woman' (wide scope), not 'the only marriage that provides children with everything they need to grow up to be healthy, productive adults is marriage between a man and a woman' (narrow scope).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more clearly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only U.S. citizens are eligible to vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is to be interpreted as 'the only people who are eligible to vote are U.S. citizens' (wide scope), not as 'the only citizens who are eligible to vote are U.S. citizens' (narrow scope).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, on to the elections. (Oh, yes, I've &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=795"&gt;absentee voted&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update and correction 11/4/08: David Beaver writes to say that this is not a matter of scope, but of &lt;small&gt;FOCUS&lt;/small&gt; (&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; is focus-sensitive), a position argued for in David I. Beaver and Brady Z. Clark, &lt;em&gt;Sense and Sensitivity: How Focus Determines Meaning&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sense-Sensitivity-Determines-Explorations-Semantics/dp/1405112638/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1225810188&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt; that came out this September. David is now mulling over how to condense a 328-page technical book for a general audience here on Language Log.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Further update 11/4/08: Aaron Dinkin discerns yet another construal for the proposed amendment: 'The only relationship between a man and a woman that is valid or recognized in California is marriage (not, e.g., dating or friendship).' That would support the idea that focus is at work here: it's characteristic of focus-sensitive items like &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; that they can be associated with a number of possible elements. "Kim only watched the game" can convey that Kim did nothing but watch the game, that Kim did nothing concerning the game but watch it (did not participate in it, for instance), or that Kim watched nothing but the game (not the commercials, for instance).

I loved the characters and their individual and collective angst, amplified by the fact that they were all “trapped” in a small Alaskan town. In a way the town was one big extended family. The plot lines were also thoughtful and at times even intellectual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My one quibble, which I just had to overlook (which is no big deal, since it was clearly fiction) was the show’s occasional flirtation with pseudoscience and mysticism. The writers dealt with it well, though, not shoving it down the audience’s throat, and it became part of the show’s charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example was the character Mike Monroe (played by Anthony Edwards of Later ER fame) who fled civilization to the small town of Cicely because of his “multiple chemical sensitivity” or environmental sensitivity. Essentially, he believed he was allergic to everything, and so had to live in a “bubble” that was sealed from the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show left it ambiguous whether or not Mike had a real hypersensitivity or his symptoms were all psychosomatic. Eventually he was encouraged to venture out into the world and was ultimately “cured” of his illness - whereby he left Cicely and joined Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a case of life imitating art which was imitating life, a women from Allentown PA was just &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/20/AR2008102001453.html"&gt;evicted from her “bubble”&lt;/a&gt; that she was using to escape her environmental sensitivity. The reason for the eviction has nothing to do with the questionable basis of her diagnosis - rather she and her husband failed to obtain proper permits and may be violating zoning laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Mike Monroe, Elizabeth Feudale-Bowes has been isolating herself in a sealed hypoallergenic room to treat her environmental sensitivity. She was diagnosed by Dr. William Rea from the Environmental Health Center in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental Sensitivity (or &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/mcs.html"&gt;multiple chemical sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; - MCS) is not recognized as a legitimate illness.  It was first proposed by Dr. Theron G. Randolph in the 1940s, who first thought that it was due to food, but later expanded the syndrome to include artificial chemicals in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most dubious diagnoses,  MCS lacks a discrete clinical picture or any pathophysiological plausibility. Those who have the diagnosis typically have fatigue, non-specific pains, depression, irritability, and confusion. These are all non-specific symptoms and do not point to a specific physiological dysfunction or cause. They are also common symptoms of psychologically based syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last half century proponents of this diagnosis have failed to achieve any scientific credibility. They have not demonstrated that MCS exists as a discrete entity, that it can be reliably diagnosed, that there are any objective markers or underlying pathophysiology. In other words, they have demonstrated nothing to suggest that MCS actually exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been some scientific studies of MCS, but the results of these studies are consistent with the hypothesis that MCS is psychological. For example, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8234918?dopt=Abstract"&gt;Staudenmeyer et al&lt;/a&gt; challenged patients with the diagnosis of MCS in a blinded fashion with various environmental challenges (the control being clean air challenges). He found no difference between clean air challenges and a variety of chemical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pattern we see repeated often. New ideas are proposed all the time in medicine, and most new ideas turn out to be wrong. Occasionally a new idea crops up that has a popular appeal (because it addresses a perceived need, like providing a diagnosis to those with non-specific symptoms) or that is backed by proponents that will not back down when the science does not go their way. These new but wrong ideas then take on a life of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents emerge who appear to have an almost religious belief in the new syndrome or treatment. They often begin treating patients according to this new belief prior to adequate scientific studies. The studies ultimately do get done, and when they are negative the result is to further marginalize acceptance of the now dubious claims. But the proponents are undeterred. Frauds and charlatans seem to be attracted to the fringe, so they come out of the woodwork looking for easy marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A medical subculture dedicated to this now-discredited notion emerges, with their own jargon, their own clinics, and their own treatments. The scientific community rejects the subculture, but in practice mostly just ignores it, and the subculture is happy to practice under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally individual practitioners may come under regulatory scrutiny - usually because some physician or organization learned about what was going on and reports them to the state. The questionable practitioners have figured out, however, how to deal with this situation. Since the science (as well as professional ethics) are against them, they make a political appeal. This bizarrely works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is exactly what Dr. William Rea did when he was reported for practicing substandard medicine. He wrote an &lt;a href="http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?p=416"&gt;open letter to his patients&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Patients:&lt;br&gt;
This letter is being sent to you so that we may provide information about a potential serious potential threat to your choice of medical care. To put it bluntly, there is currently an organized nation-wide effort to destroy the specialty of Environmental Medicine and to eliminate from practice physicians who diagnose and treat patients suffering from chemical sensitivities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have learned to press the “health care freedom” button. They will even try to get local representatives on their side to put pressure on the state board of health. They appeal to their patients who think they have been helped by the treatment (of course, this is a self-selective and unblinded group). Usually they can wiggle out of attempts at enforcing a standard of care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last decade or so they have even learned to make preemptive  strikes against regulation. They have successfully lobbied for so-called health care freedom laws in various states. These laws essentially say that the state cannot enforce the standard of care by acting against a practitioner’s license based solely what the practitioner is doing - whether or not it is science-based or meets any reasonable minimum standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now charlatans are increasingly free to line their pockets with money from desperate patients without fear of pesky regulations, or having to defend their fringe activity with science or evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also potential harm beyond financial. Patients who have symptoms that are psychologically based often focus on presumed physical causes. Their best hope of improvement is to get their focus off of physical ailments they do not have and to work on the underlying psychological issues. When a physician, however, validates their somatic delusions with a fake diagnosis, and then takes up their time and attention with a fake treatment, they are being deprived of the opportunity to pursue perhaps more effective and rational treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only hope to improve the situation is for citizens to demand that their state governments do their job and protect them against fraudulent health care. Education about the real issues is a start. Charlatans count on ignorance and apathy to ply their trade - so we can afford neither.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was well past the solar max, the time when the twisted magnetic field of the Sun is at its worst. Things were dying down. In general, the biggest and most powerful explosions of released magnetic energy do lag the actual solar max by about a year, but we were well past that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one expected that in October and November of 2003 the Sun would unleash the most violent flares ever seen in modern times. One was so huge it was reclassified more than once, upgraded to be the nastiest event ever detected. The Sun, it seemed, can still surprise us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/halloween_storms.html"&gt;NASA has put together some information on the fifth anniversary of this event&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I wrote about this extensively &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Skies-These-Ways-World/dp/0670019976/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220913560&amp;amp;sr=8-8/badastronomy"&gt;in my book&lt;/a&gt;. I learned a huge amount about the properties of the Sun, and what sort of damage it can do on Earth. It’s funny: to the eye you’d never see a flare; the Sun doesn’t get much brighter overall, so you’d hardly notice. But it can blow out transformers, melt power lines, and cause billions — yes, &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; — of dollars in damage. We’re at the minimum of the solar cycle right now, but things are starting up again. Things will peak in about 5-6 years. What will happen two years after that?&lt;/p&gt;

Now William Ayers is a respected academic, somebody who is no longer advocating violence, who is a crusader for social justice and urban educational reform within the system, and that sounds like it ought to be an interesting and worthy story. So why is the Republican party trying to brand him as a terrorist? He&amp;#39;s a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest sad twist is that he was invited to speak at a student research conference, and the &lt;a title="Nebraska Cancels William Ayers - Urban Semiotic" href="http://urbansemiotic.com/2008/10/20/nebraska-cancels-william-ayers/"&gt;craven University of Nebraska-Lincoln canceled the event&lt;/a&gt; under pressure from donors and politicians. The governor of the state called the invitation an &amp;quot;embarrassment&amp;quot; and said &amp;quot;Ayers is a well-known radical who should never have been invited to the University of Nebraska&amp;quot;; representatives and senators chimed in with similar sentiments; a regent called it &amp;quot;bad judgment&amp;quot;; donors to the university threatened to withhold further contributions. This is insane.  Ayers hasn&amp;#39;t committed a crime, and he&amp;#39;s not a danger to society — this is a fellow who clearly has a deep commitment to improving society (perhaps, to Republican eyes, that is his crime).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anybody thought to look at what Bill Ayers actually promotes? &lt;a href="http://www.billayers.org/"&gt;He has a website&lt;/a&gt;, and it's trivial to look up what he's advocating. For instance, here is a &lt;a href="http://www.beacon.org/productdetails.cfm?SKU=3269"&gt;description of his book, &lt;i&gt;Teaching Toward Feedom&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Teaching toward Freedom&lt;/i&gt;, William Ayers illuminates the hope as well as the conflict that characterizes the craft of education: how it can be used in authoritarian ways at the service of the state, the church, or a restrictive existing social order-or, as he envisions it, as a way for students to become more fully human, more engaged, more participatory, more free. Using examples from his own classroom experiences as well as from popular culture, film, and novels, Ayers redraws the lines concerning how we teach, why we teach, and the surprising things we uncover when we allow students to become visible, vocal authors of their own lives and stories. This lucid and inspiring book will help teachers at every level to realize that ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why, that sounds &lt;i&gt;admirable&lt;/i&gt;. So why are these lunatics shrieking for his head, and condemning Barack Obama for simply attending meetings as a community organizer at the same time as Bill Ayers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's obvious. The right-wing hate machine, desperate for a way to smear a candidate who has an unimpeachable history as an advocate for social justice, strained to find some dangerous association, and the worst they could come up with is a gentle, writerly academic who let the passions of his youth lead him into violent and illegal actions &lt;i&gt;40 years ago&lt;/i&gt; — actions that he considers just. They ignore his history ever since — apparently, there is no redemption unless you embrace Jesus and Republican intolerance, ala Chuck Colson — and they pretend that his words now simply don&amp;#39;t matter. They stir up the mob to hatred, and the mob calls in threats of violence against an educator, and UNL simply surrenders in cowardice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Ayers is a reason to vote against Republican demagoguery tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/whats_wrong_with_william_ayers.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/441001320" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225723348514"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/some_rites_are_not_to_be_conte.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e3f527a7254881fb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">Some rites are not to be contemplated</title><published>2008-11-03T13:32:03Z</published><updated>2008-11-03T13:32:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/440976018/some_rites_are_not_to_be_conte.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/some_rites_are_not_to_be_conte.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is there something the Catholics are keeping secret?

&lt;p&gt;It's been a long time since I've written much about the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/02/conservapedia.php"&gt;AAPS&lt;/a&gt;, of course, but refreshing your memory will be easy. It's the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/03/journal_of_american_physicians.php"&gt;ultra-libertarian wingnut medical "association"&lt;/a&gt; that routinely scrapes the bottom of the barrel, as far as pseudoscience goes, as long as that pseudoscience fits in with their schizophrenic combination of Ayn Randian "superman" libertarianism mixed with a toxic brew of anti-immigration, antivaccinationism, HIV/AIDS denialism, and social conservatism that leads them to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/10/abortion_and_breast_cancer_the_chicago_t.php"&gt;lie about the evidence&lt;/a&gt; to argue that abortions cause breast cancer or promote the particularly despicable lie that shaken baby syndrome is in reality "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/03/journal_of_american_physicians.php"&gt;vaccine injury&lt;/a&gt;." Worse, the AAPS maintains a dubious medical "journal" that claims to be "peer-reviewed," namely the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/03/journal_of_american_physicians.php"&gt;Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons&lt;/a&gt; (JPANDS), which it uses to give its crankery a veneer of respectability that sometimes fools more credulous reporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had often wondered if the AAPS could sink any lower into out right crankery, and, if so, how. Then, amazingly enough, the weekend before what is arguably the most important Presidential election in my lifetime, I find that the AAPS can indeed go lower. Indeed, it's backed some of the most amazing assertions of woo that I've ever seen, and I have to discuss them today, because it's the day before the election. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, if you believe the AAPS, Barack Obama's using his mad skills to &lt;a href="http://www.aapsonline.org/newsoftheday/0089" rel="nofollow"&gt;hypnotize the American electorate&lt;/a&gt; to do his bidding, all to further his own nefarious, socialist, terrorist, redistributionist ends!&lt;/p&gt;

This post is designed to be a FAQ for climate model questions - of which a few are already given. If you have comments or other questions, ask them as concisely as possible in the comment section and if they are of enough interest, we'll add them to the post so that we can have a resource for future discussions. (We would ask that you please focus on real questions that have real answers and, as always, avoid rhetorical excesses). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quick definitions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCM - General Circulation Model (sometimes Global Climate Model) which includes the physics of the atmosphere and often the ocean, sea ice and land surface as well. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simulation - a single experiment with a GCM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial Condition Ensemble - a set of simulations using a single GCM but with slight perturbations in the initial conditions. This is an attempt to average over chaotic behaviour in the weather.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-model Ensemble - a set of simulations from multiple models. Surprisingly, an average over these simulations gives a better match to climatological observations than any single model. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model weather - the path that any individual simulation will take has very different individual storms and wave patterns than any other simulation. The model weather is the part of the solution (usually high frequency and small scale) that is uncorrelated with another simulation in the same ensemble. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model climate - the part of the simulation that is robust and is the same in different ensemble members (usually these are long-term averages, statistics, and relationships between variables).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forcings - anything that is imposed from the outside that causes a model's climate to change. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feedbacks - changes in the model that occur in response to the initial forcing that end up adding to (for positive feedbacks) or damping (negative feedbacks) the initial response. Classic examples are the amplifying ice-albedo feedback, or the damping long-wave radiative feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Questions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the difference between a physics-based model and a statistical model?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models in statistics or in many colloquial uses of the term often imply a simple relationship that is fitted to some observations. A linear regression line through a change of temperature with time, or a sinusoidal fit to the seasonal cycle for instance. More complicated fits are also possible (neural nets for instance). These statistical models are very efficient at encapsulating existing information concisely and as long as things don't change much, they can provide reasonable predictions of future behaviour. However, they aren't much good for predictions if you know the underlying system is changing in ways that might possibly affect how your original variables will interact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physics-based models on the other hand, try to capture the real physical cause of any relationship, which hopefully are understood at a deeper level. Since those fundamentals are not likely to change in the future, the anticipation of a successful prediction is higher.  A classic example is Newton's Law of motion, F=ma, which can be used in multiple contexts to give highly accurate results completely independently of the data Newton himself had on hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate models are fundamentally physics-based, but some of the small scale physics is only known empirically (for instance, the increase of evaporation as the wind increases). Thus statistical fits to the observed data are included in the climate model formulation, but these are only used for process-level parameterisations, not for trends in time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are climate models just a fit to the trend in the global temperature data?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Much of the confusion concerning this point comes from a misunderstanding stemming from the point above. Model development actually does not use the trend data in tuning (see below). Instead, modellers work to improve the climatology of the model (the fit to the average conditions), and it's intrinsic variability (such as the frequency and amplitude of tropical variability). The resulting model is pretty much used 'as is' in hindcast experiments for the 20th Century. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why are there 'wiggles' in the output?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCMs perform calculations with timesteps of about 20 to 30 minutes so that they can capture the daily cycle and the progression of weather systems. As with weather forecasting models, the weather in a climate model is chaotic. Starting from a very similar (but not identical) state, a different simulation will ensue - with different weather, different storms, different wind patterns - i.e different wiggles. In control simulations, there are wiggles at almost all timescales - daily, monthly, yearly, decadally and longer - and modellers need to test very carefully how much of any change that happens because of a change in forcing is really associated with that forcing and how much might simply be due to the internal wiggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is robust in a climate projection and how can I tell?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since every wiggle is not necessarily significant, modellers need to assess how robust particular model results are. They do this by seeing whether the same result is seen in other simulations, with other models, whether it makes physical sense and whether there is some evidence of similar things in the observational or paleo record. If that result is seen in multiple models and multiple simulations, it is likely to be a robust consequence of the underlying assumptions, or in other words, it probably isn't due to any of the relatively arbitrary choices that mark the differences between different models. If the magnitude of the effect makes theoretical sense independent of these kinds of model, then that adds to it's credibility, and if in fact this effect matches what is seen in observations, then that adds more. Robust results are therefore those that quantitatively match in all three domains. Examples are the warming of planet as a function of increasing greenhouse gases, or the change in water vapour with temperature. All models show basically the same behaviour that is in line with basic theory and observations. Examples of non-robust results are the changes in El Niño as a result of climate forcings, or the impact on hurricanes. In both of these cases, models produce very disparate results, the theory is not yet fully developed and observations are ambiguous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;How have models changed over the years?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially (ca. 1975), GCMs were based purely on atmospheric processes - the winds, radiation, and with simplified clouds. By the mid-1980s, there were simple treatments of the upper ocean and sea ice, and clouds parameterisations started to get slightly more sophisticated. In the 1990s, fully coupled ocean-atmosphere models started to become available. This is when the first Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) was started. This has subsequently seen two further iterations, the latest (CMIP3) being the database used in support of much of the model work in the IPCC AR4. Over that time, model simulations have become demonstrably more realistic (Reichler and Kim, 2008) as resolution has increased and parameterisations have become more sophisticated. Nowadays, models also include dynamic sea ice, aerosols and atmospheric chemistry modules. Issues like excessive 'climate drift' (the tendency for a coupled model to move away from the a state resembling the actual climate) which were problematic in the early days are now much minimised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is tuning?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still a long way from being able to simulate the climate with a true first principles calculation. While many basic aspects of physics can be included (conservation of mass, energy etc.), many need to be approximated for reasons of efficiency or resolutions (i.e. the equations of motion need estimates of sub-gridscale turbulent effects, radiative transfer codes approximate the line-by-line calculations using band averaging), and still others are only known empirically (the formula for how fast clouds turn to rain for instance). With these approximations and empirical formulae, there is often a tunable parameter or two that can be varied in order to improve the match to whatever observations exist. Adjusting these  values is described as tuning and falls into two categories. First, there is the tuning in a single formula in order for that formula to best match the observed values of that specific relationship. This happens most frequently when new parameterisations are being developed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, there are tuning parameters that control aspects of the emergent system. Gravity wave drag parameters are not very constrained by data, and so are often tuned to improve the climatology of stratospheric zonal winds. The threshold relative humidity for making clouds is tuned often to get the most realistic cloud cover and global albedo. Surprisingly, there are very few of these (maybe a half dozen) that are used in adjusting the models to match the data.  It is important to note that these exercises are done with the mean climate (including the seasonal cycle and some internal variability) - and once set they are kept fixed for any perturbation experiment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;How are models evaluated?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of data that is available for model evaluation is vast, but falls into a few clear categories. First, there is the climatological average (maybe for each month or season) of key observed fields like temperature, rainfall, winds and clouds. This is the zeroth order comparison to see whether the model is getting the basics reasonably correct. Next comes the variability in these basic fields - does the model have a realistic North Atlantic Oscillation, or ENSO, or MJO. These are harder to match (and indeed many models do not yet have realistic El Niños). More subtle are comparisons of relationships in the model and in the real world. This is useful for short data records (such as those retrieves by satellite) where there is a lot of weather noise one wouldn't expect the model to capture. In those cases, looking at the relationship between temperatures and humidity, or cloudiness and aerosols can give insight into whether the model processes are realistic or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the tests of climate changes themselves: how does a model respond to the addition of aerosols in the stratosphere such as was seen in the Mt Pinatubo 'natural experiment'? How does it respond over the whole of the 20th Century, or at the Maunder Minimum, or the mid-Holocene or the Last Glacial Maximum? In each case, there is usually sufficient data available to evaluate how well the model is doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Are the models complete? That is, do they contain all the processes we know about? &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. While models contain a lot of physics, they don't contain many small-scale processes that more specialised groups (of atmospheric chemists, or coastal oceanographers for instance) might worry about a lot. Mostly this is a question of scale (model grid boxes are too large for the details to be resolved), but sometimes it's a matter of being uncertain how to include  it (for instance, the impact of ocean eddies on tracers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, many important bio-physical-chemical cycles (for the carbon fluxes, aerosols, ozone) are only just starting to be incorporated. Ice sheet and vegetation components are very much still under development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do models have global warming built in?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. If left to run on their own, the models will oscillate around a long-term mean that is the same regardless of what the initial conditions were. Given different drivers, volcanoes or CO2 say, they will warm or cool as a function of the basic physics of aerosols or the greenhouse effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I write a paper that proves that models are wrong?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much more simply than you might think since, of course, all models are indeed wrong (though some are useful - George Box). Showing a mismatch between the real world and the observational data is made much easier if you recall the signal-to-noise issue we mentioned above. As you go to smaller spatial and shorter temporal scales the amount of internal variability increases markedly and so the number of diagnostics which will be different to the expected values from the models will increase (in both directions of course). So pick a variable, restrict your analysis to a small part of the planet, and calculate some statistic over a short period of time and you're done. If the models match through some fluke, make the space smaller, and use a shorter time period and eventually they won't. Even if models get much better than they are now, this will always work - call it the RealClimate theory of persistence. Now, appropriate statistics can be used to see whether these mismatches are significant and not just the result of chance or cherry-picking, but a surprising number of papers don't bother to check such things correctly. Getting people outside the, shall we say, more 'excitable' parts of the blogosphere to pay any attention is, unfortunately, a lot harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can GCMs predict the temperature and precipitation for my home?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. There are often large variation in the temperature and precipitation statistics over short distances because the local climatic characteristics are affected by the local geography. The GCMs are designed to describe the most important lage-scale features of the climate, such as the energy flow, the circulation, and the temperature in a grid-box volume (through physical laws of themodynamics, the dynamics, and the ideal gas laws). A typical grid-box may have a horizontal area of ~100×100 km2, but the size has tended to reduce over the years as computers have increased in speed. The shape of the landscape (the details of mounatins, coastline etc.) used in the models reflect the spatial resolution, hence the model will not have sufficient detail to describe local climate variation associated with local geographical features (e.g. mountains, velleys, lakes, etc.). However, it is possible to use a GCM to derive some information about the local climate through &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/08/regional-climate-projections/"&gt;downscaling&lt;/a&gt;, as it is affected by both the local geography (a more or less given constant) as well as the large-scale atmospheric conditions. The results derived through downscaling can then be compared with local climate variables, and can be used for further (and more severe) assessments of the combination model-downscaling technique. This is however still an experimental technique.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I use a climate model myself?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! There is a project called &lt;a href="http://edgcm.columbia.edu"&gt;EdGCM&lt;/a&gt; which has a nice interface and works with Windows and lets you try out a large number of tests. ClimatePrediction.Net has a climate model that runs as a screensaver in a coordinated set of simulations. &lt;a href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/modelE/"&gt;GISS ModelE&lt;/a&gt; is available as a download for Unix-based machines and can be run on a normal desktop. &lt;a href="http://www.ccsm.ucar.edu/"&gt;NCAR CCSM&lt;/a&gt; is the US community model and is well-documented and freely available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

I didn't pursue the attribution, but now Rochelle Edinburg, a philosophy grad student at Princeton, writes to ask about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… the quote in question is attributed to Plato. However, I have been searching for any hint of the original in Plato&amp;#39;s works, and have yet to find one. Do you know where this quote originally appears? Or, for that matter, why someone would use such a poorly attributed quote in a textbook on writing style?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I haven't found anything similar in several books of quotations in English (of course, you have to guess how an Ancient Greek original might have turned up in English translation), so I've become suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have something of an answer to Edinburgh's question about the advice manuals: books for popular audiences standardly quote what they take to be "famous" sayings, often third-, tenth-, or hundredth-degree removals from the originals, if there are any. There's a huge tradition of folk quotation, almost entirely removed from scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db10.htm"&gt;the data seem to bear this out&lt;/a&gt;.  There are several hypotheses about why this is so, but not a lot of data.  Rather than engage in speculation, I'd like to wade back into the dangerous waters of real science and tell you a little about allergies. Perhaps after you've read my grossly oversimplified explication, you'll come up with your own science-based hypothesis to explain increased childhood food allergies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let's talk about what &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; going on.  The Huffington Post, always a target-rich environment for woo-hunters, has a writer named Sloan Barnett.  She is about as well-informed about health issues as Bill O'Reilly is about anger management.  Two of her recent posts address child health, and both display a stunning level of ignorance.  Her fetishization of  "green" bears no relation to actual research on childhood health.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sloan-barnett/the-epipen-the-latest-kid_b_137737.html"&gt;her ignorance&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But what really stopped me in my tracks was that children with food allergies are two to four times as likely to have related conditions such as asthma or other allergies. And guess whose very own children have nut allergies AND asthma....&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um, yeah, Sloane.  That's because food allergies, asthma, and related conditions are, er, &lt;em&gt;related&lt;/em&gt;!  Asthma, allergy, and atopy are all a type of immune dysfunction known generally as type I hypersensitivity.  Its determinants are partly genetic, partly environmental. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite many studies, no one knows why this [increase in allergy] is happening. Here's what I know. My third child, who was raised in a non-toxic home, eating only organic formula and food, recently tested allergy free. Look, I can't be certain that our new lifestyle is the reason this baby is allergy free, but it sure does make you think.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, one of the most popular theories in scientific circles is the "hygiene hypothesis" which roughly states that our cleaner and more sterile environment exposes our kids to allergens later.  If they had been exposed earlier, their immune systems may have developed a tolerance for common allergens.  This hypothesis is based on observational studies that kids raised with pets, on farms and other "dirty" places have lower rates of environmental allergies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, we don't know why we have an increase in childhood allergies, and clearly, neither does Sloane.  Her evidence is based on what she's heard and her own experiences, which is worth &lt;i&gt;bubkes&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, let's get to a little actual science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/11/allergies_of_the_first_kindtyp.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/11/allergies_of_the_first_kindtyp.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/440496843" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225679311679"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/pz_myers_finally_watches_a_cer.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e0142af2003c9c48</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment"/><title type="html">PZ Myers finally watches a certain DVD!</title><published>2008-11-03T01:30:38Z</published><updated>2008-11-03T01:30:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/440479886/pz_myers_finally_watches_a_cer.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/pz_myers_finally_watches_a_cer.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You may all recall that a certain &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/04/things_to_do_with_your_weekend.php"&gt;&lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt; movie was released in mid-April&lt;/a&gt;…a movie which I have not yet seen, but which is now available on DVD. I was just at the local gas station/grocery store/video store, and there it was, available right there on the shelf.

Here is the &lt;a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/2543431/is-richard-dawkins-still-evolving.thtml"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melanie Phillips saw the live debate and comments: &lt;blockquote&gt;This was surely remarkable. Here was the arch-apostle of atheism, whose whole case is based on the assertion that believing in a creator of the universe is no different from believing in fairies at the bottom of the garden, saying that a serious case can be made for the idea that the universe was brought into being by some kind of purposeful force.&lt;/blockquote&gt; She approached him afterwards and asked him "whether he had indeed changed his position and become more open to ideas which lay outside the scientific paradigm." She reports: "He vehemently denied this and expressed horror that he might have given this impression."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didn't see the debate. Maybe it'll be posted on the web before long. But how can we reconcile what Dawkins said in his book with this admission? In any case, I agree with Dawkins's recent admission. Glad he said it. It's a much more reasonable position to leave his previously held belief that God "almost certainly doesn't exist." But then I'm an agnostic atheist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nonetheless, I don't see why this admission does anything to support the Christian case. The Christian must come to grips with the differences between a full blown Christianity and deism. Moving from deism to Christianity is like trying to fly a plane to the moon. It cannot be done. A distant God is no different than none at all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The usage in question is the verbs &lt;em&gt;early/absentee vote&lt;/em&gt; (not &lt;em&gt;vote early/absentee&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Language Log reader Drew Ward to me a few days ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month I have been hearing formations such as “John early voted today.” (local news) or “Many more people this year have decided to early vote.” (CNN)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I also heard this trend being applied to absentee voting with a local news station following up a story on early voting with “You can also absentee vote this week.”  Whereas in the past I know I’ve always&lt;br&gt;
heard “vote absentee” or “vote by absentee ballot”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of google hits for "to early vote" and "early voted", a few for "to absentee vote" and "absentee voted". (Plus, I now see, some for "to advance vote" etc.):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To early vote":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people in Clayton County are standing in line for four hours just to early-vote." (&lt;a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/254/story/54982.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Early voted":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to absentee vote in Louisiana. Posted Sep 7th 2007 10:00AM by Mike Schleifstein (&lt;a href="http://www.bloggingneworleans.com/2007/09/07/how-to-absentee-vote-in-louisiana/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Absentee voted":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nov 1, 2008 … If you have absentee voted already stop in and say hi. (&lt;a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;amp;address=389x4350333"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A double header:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct 29, 2008 … Have you either early voted or absentee voted in the 2008 Election? Yes. No. Other (Tell us below!) (&lt;a href="http://www.wowowow.com/poll/have-you-either-early-voted-or-absentee-voted-2008-election-131063"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These formations look to me not like an unusual placement of the modifiers &lt;em&gt;early&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;absentee&lt;/em&gt;, but rather like back-formations from &lt;em&gt;early/absentee voting/voter&lt;/em&gt;.  The results seem to function as a lexical units (note the hyphenated &lt;em&gt;early-vote&lt;/em&gt; example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;em&gt;early vote&lt;/em&gt;, there's a clear advantage to having such a unit, since &lt;em&gt;vote early&lt;/em&gt; could refer to voting early on election day, while &lt;em&gt;early vote&lt;/em&gt; refers specifically to institutionalized procedures for voting before election day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=519"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on Language Log a little while ago about a somewhat different back-formation, namely &lt;em&gt;to gay marry, &lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;with the verb back-formed from &lt;/span&gt;gay marriage&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Please vote. If you have any reasons to vote for your Presidential candidate tell us here. In the meantime my plea is that everyone vote your conscience, everyone. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am struggling hard to know whom to vote for. I live in Indiana. My vote may finally count this time and I don't like anyone. Do I "waste my vote" by voting for Bob Barr the Libertarian candidate, or Ralph Nadar? Unless you're paying attention you probably didn't even know there are other choices. Does voting for these other candidates really send a message?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damn political parties. They are almost always extremist. Damn party politics. The government cannot, and I mean cannot, keep spending my (our) money like it does. The local Libertarian candidate said it plainly today: "We cannot afford it." He made a great deal of sense to me. Again: "We cannot afford it."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the balance of power has been extremist in both dominating political parties our only hope may be to reign them in with another extremist party until the third party helps brings spending in check, and spending will not be brought into check when we vote for politicians who compete with other politicians to buy our votes with things like earmarks and special interest projects. Our district Congressman, Mark Souder, a pragmatist, said he doesn't like doing it but when the other Senators are taking away Indiana's tax money for their special projects, he needs to get in there and fight for Indiana. Go figure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are in a financial crisis, an energy crisis, a health-care crisis, an infrastructure crisis, and a crisis in Iraq. The way this election is being treated it's like my former professor Strauss would say: "They think rearranging chairs on the Titanic will help." It won't. Don't bet your ass on it. I have seen politicians come and go. They always make promises, and most of them lie. That's the nature of the political beast. Neither Obama nor McCain can deliver what they have promised. Mark my words. They cannot do it. Even if they try, when Congress doesn't go fully along with what they hope to achieve they will blame Congress. That's what will happen. Again, mark my words. That has always been the excuse for most any President who doesn't deliver on his promises. So on the campaign trail they can promise us the sky! Just don't say what President Bush (Senior) said. He said, "No new taxes" and then later signed a bill with additional taxes. His hand got caught in the cookie jar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it truly a wasted vote to vote for a candidate who has little or no hope to win an election? Well, not if enough people vote their conscience. Is it possible to get people to vote their consciences? I don't know. But that's my plea. Don't vote for what the political parties throw out on the table, as if those are your only two choices. Of course you may want to. But vote your conscience. Our biggest problem is spending. We are spending money like there's no tommorrow. If we continue to do this there will be no tommorrow. Send them all a message loud and clear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://web.mac.com/arnold_zwicky/NewYorkerObscenicons.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/weekinreview/02liptak.html"&gt;a column&lt;/a&gt; by Adam Liptak in the Week in Review section of today's &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;: "Must It Always Be About Sex?", about the word &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt;, which the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; is committed to avoiding — so that if Liptak is going to report on a current U.S. Supreme Court case about this word, he has to do some deft side-stepping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The piece begins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court specializes in law, not lexicography. But it will soon have to consider the meaning of that most versatile of four-letter words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oxford English Dictionary’s three core entries on the word — noun, verb and interjection — are about six times as long as this article. That doesn’t count about 30 derivations and compounds, all colorful and many recent. The nimble word, the dictionary tells us, can help express that a person is incompetent; that another is not be meddled with; that a situation has been botched; that one does not have the slightest clue; and, in a recent addition, that someone has enough money to be able to quit an unpleasant job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the word I mean. [first avoidance]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central question in the case of &lt;a title="More articles about the Federal Communications Commission." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/federal_communications_commission/index.html?inline=nyt-org"&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; v. Fox Television Stations, to be argued Tuesday, is whether every permutation of the word evokes sex and thus runs afoul of indecency regulations, which prohibit the broadcasting of material that “depicts or describes sexual or excretory activities or organs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given its core meaning,” the commission told the court, “any use of the word has a sexual connotation even if the word is not used literally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, when the pop star Bono emphasized his glee at receiving a Golden Globe award in 2003 by saying his victory was “really, really” — insert a form of the word here [second avoidance] — “brilliant,” the commission contended there was a sexual element. So too when Cher, on another awards show, used the word to propose something that ought to be done to her critics [third avoidance].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there was sex in the air, the commission said, when Nicole Richie, at a third awards show, veered from these scripted comments: “Have you ever tried to get cow manure out of a Prada purse? It’s not so freaking simple.” Ms. Richie did not say “manure,” and she did not say “freaking.” [fourth avoidance, plus an avoidance of &lt;em&gt;shit&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bono, Cher and Ms. Richie all made sexual references, and all were indecent, the commission says. “It hardly seems debatable,” the commission wrote in 2006, “that the word’s power to ‘intensify’ and offend derives from its implicit sexual meaning” as “one of the most vulgar, graphic and explicit words for sexual activity in the English language.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court in New York disagreed with the commission, and so does &lt;em&gt;OED&lt;/em&gt; lexicographer Jesse Sheidlower, who concludes a discussion of the matter with the blunt “The outrage that the F.C.C. pretends to feel is false." (There is of course a remote possibility that the commissioners, or their staffs, hold to an extreme version of the Etymological Fallacy: an original, or at least significantly earlier, meaning, will persist forever and overshadow all other uses.

Testifying were Paul Souhrada, an editor of the &lt;em&gt;Columbus Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; and the parent of a student in Freshwater’s class; Souhrada’s son Simon; Richard Cunningham, chairman of the high school science department; Katie Beach, a middle school intervention specialist; Kerri Mahan, a middle school special education teacher; and Katherine Button, a former student in Freshwater’s 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important note&lt;/strong&gt;: I did not get to the hearing in time to get a seat for the morning session.  My summary of the morning (Paul and Simon Souhrada, Cunningham, and Beach) is based on an hour-long interview later that day with two people who were at the morning session and who took notes.  So it’s second-hand information to me and third-hand to you.  I did have a seat for the afternoon session (Mahan and Button).  For another view on that morning’s testimony see the &lt;a href="http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2008/10/31/Freshwater01.html?sid=101" rel="external "&gt;Columbus Dispatch story&lt;/a&gt;.  I’ve used that story and &lt;a href="http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/08/11/01/former-freshwater-students-testify" rel="external "&gt;the Mount Vernon News story&lt;/a&gt; as additional sources for the Friday morning session.  Reporters Dean Narcisco (&lt;em&gt;Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;) and Pam Schehl (&lt;em&gt;News&lt;/em&gt;) were at the morning session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More below the fold.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Souhrada testimony&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Souhrada is the parent of a Mt. Vernon High School student who had Freshwater for 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science in 2005-2006.  Souhrada testified that he was shocked by a handout his son brought home from Freshwater’s class titled “Darwin’s Theory of Evolution: The Premise and the Problem” during the 2005-2006 school year.  He had several discussions with his son about that and other issues the son brought home from Freshwater’s class.  According to an April 19, 2008, &lt;a href="http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2008/04/19/protest.ART_ART_04-19-08_B1_QU9VKT7.html?sid=101" rel="external "&gt;story in the &lt;em&gt;Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Freshwater was instructed to cease using that handout in 2006 when a parent complained about it.  Souradha testified that he complained to then-Superintendent Jeff Maley about the handout that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source of the handout was apparently &lt;a href="http://www.allaboutgod.com/cgi-bin/search.cgi?zoom_sort=0&amp;amp;zoom_query=Darwin+premise" rel="external "&gt;All About God Ministries&lt;/a&gt;.  I’m informed that the piece has been modified since 2006 but that the current form, linked &lt;a href="http://www.allaboutscience.org/darwins-theory-of-evolution.htm" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, is similar to that used by Freshwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no cross examination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simon Souhrada testimony&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, Simon is a junior at Mt. Vernon high school and had Freshwater for 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science in 2005-2006.  He testified that Freshwater also burned his arm with a cross using the Tesla coil but that he didn’t report it to his parents.  He said that the mark was visible for two or three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon testified that Freshwater was a “solid teacher” until he got to evolution.  He said Freshwater taught that there are problems with carbon dating and that he started using handouts like the “Premise” handout.  Simon testified that he did not recall Freshwater using the phrases “intelligent design” or “creationism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon testified that he overheard Freshwater tell some other students that “Catholics aren’t Christians.”  As the &lt;em&gt;Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; story linked above reports, when Hamilton asked on cross examination why Simon remembered that phrase four years later, Simon replied that he is Catholic.  Asked if he was offended by it, Simon replied that he isn’t easily offended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Cunningham testimony&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dick Cunningham was chairman of the high school science department over the relevant period, 2002-3 to 2007-8.  He testified that he investigated the source of the “Premise” handout by using a web tool for teachers to detect plagiarism, and found a 100% match with the &lt;em&gt;All About God Ministries&lt;/em&gt; version referred to above.  He also noted that Freshwater’s ‘dragon’ handout also appeared to be from that site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cunningham testified that he met with Freshwater, Schutte, and Mr. Koons (middle school principal) in 2002-2003 when the district was aligning its curriculum with the new state standards.  They apparently scheduled another meeting for April 2003, but by then Freshwater had proposed the Intelligent Design Network’s “Objective Origins Policy” to the science curriculum committee and it’s not clear if that meeting occurred.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cunningham testified that a “theory” in science is not guesswork, and that there are no viable alternatives to the modern theory of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cross examination Cunningham conceded that he was not good about handing in lesson plans, that he had not observed Freshwater actually teaching, and that he has no information that Freshwater explicitly taught creationism or intelligent design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton confronted Cunningham with an email from Cunningham to (someone) inquiring about his reimbursement for attending a conference/workshop on the topic “The Earth is Flat.”  Hamilton inquired whether that was an alternative theory, and what was wrong with Freshwater having materials about alternative theories in his classroom.  Cunningham responded that the conference was about technology and its effect in connecting people (it was based on Tom Friedman’s book of the same title).  Hamilton asked Cunningham “What shape is the earth?”  Cunningham replied “Round.”  On redirect Cunningham clarified the nature of the conference.  Millstone asked if Hamilton’s reference to “The Earth is Flat” wasn’t just a red herring.  On objection from Hamilton the remark was struck from the record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Katie Beach testimony&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katie Beach is a special needs intervention specialist (formerly called tutors) and worked with special needs students in Freshwater’s classroom for most of the 2007-2008 academic year.  She testified that in his science class Freshwater referred to believing the Bible and that it is contradictory to what he teaches.  She testified that Freshwater described hydrosphere theory in class and that in that context he referred to a flood and a boat, though she didn’t recall whether Freshwater specifically mentioned Noah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; story linked above, she testified that Freshwater also told students to refer to their Bible for additional science research and that the Big Bang theory couldn’t explain how a complex world could exist.  With reference to Big Bang theory, she testified that Freshwater told students to refer to the Bible for an alternative theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that Freshwater told students that a brontosaurus could not have existed since its brain would explode due to problems – blood pressure? – associated with the length of its neck.  (That’s a new one on me – I’ve never run into that claim and couldn’t find it in a fast web search.  I’d welcome more info on the claim.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that Freshwater used purported dating anomalies of debris from the Mt. St. Helen eruption to discredit scientific dating methods. (Recall that was probably a reference to &lt;a href="http://www.noanswersingenesis.org.au/mt_st_helens_dacite_kh.htm" rel="external "&gt;Steve Austin’s mis-sampling&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beach testified that she left the room when Freshwater was discussing Easter, since she thought it was inappropriate.  She testified that she promptly enforced the new permission slip policy with her special needs students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kerri Mahan testimony&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerri Mahan was a special education teacher in 2007-2008 who worked an hour a day in Freshwater’s classroom.  She’s now a math teacher.  Mt. Vernon uses an inclusion approach to special needs education where the students are placed in ‘regular’ classes and special ed teachers work with them in the context of those ‘regular’ classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mahan testified that she saw the religious materials in Freshwater’s classroom, including religious-themed posters, the stickers on cabinet doors with Bible verses, and bibles in boxes in the back of the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that Freshwater used the four handouts hinting at ID/creationism identified in the investigator’s report and in prior testimony from students.  She testified that there was a class debate about evolution and creationism that lasted the best part of a class period.  She said that hydrosphere theory was taught, and described it in the same general terms as students had previously used in testimony.  She doesn’t recall whether Freshwater related it to a flood.  She testified that Freshwater suggested that dinosaurs and humans lived together on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She couldn’t remember if Freshwater discussed alternatives to Big Bang theory, but that he suggested that radio carbon dating may be faulty, and that its validity is harder to establish as things get older.  (Note, by the way, the phrase used throughout the hearing by everyone has been “carbon dating,” not “radiometric dating.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mahan remembered an extra-credit assignment concerning how the date of Easter is determined, but did not remember a discussion of the meaning of Easter.  She remembered Freshwater teaching the periodic table of the elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about a series of videos, Mahan did not remember whether videos on the Loch Ness monster, Mt. St. Helen’s, or Kent Hovind were shown, but she did specifically remember “The Watchmaker” being shown in class.  Recall that &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/10/freshwater-hear-1.html" rel=""&gt;Zachary Dennis testified&lt;/a&gt; to the effect that it was shown in class, but Freshwater testified (same link) that it was shown only in FCA at his daughter’s suggestion.  Mahan’s testimony corroborates that of Zachary and contradicts Freshwater’s testimony in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kids4truth.com/screensavers.htm" rel="external "&gt;More on the source of The Watchmaker&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce that we’ve added a new Dynamation to our site! This dyna focuses on our Creator through a poetic story and message that we believe will encourage believers and start the gears turning in minds turned from God. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mahan cross examination&lt;/strong&gt;:  Hamilton elected to forgo cross since Mahan will be brought back when Freshwater presents his case in chief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Katherine Button direct examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate Button (as she prefers to be called) is a student at Ohio Dominican University, the daughter of Elle Button, a middle school science teacher in the Mt. Vernon schools, and had Freshwater for 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science in 2002-2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Button testified that Freshwater’s class was very scattered, jumping from topic to topic.  She said he often read to the class from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;amp;field-keywords=%22Chicken+soup+for+the+teenage+soul%22&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0" rel="external "&gt;Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul&lt;/a&gt; and showed videos of Freshwater’s year of missionary work in China and pictures and talk of his smoke jumping days in Idaho.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said that Freshwater mentioned intelligent design.  (Recall that 2002-2003 was the year Freshwater made his “Objective Origins Policy” proposal to the school.)  She testified that Freshwater told them there was new evidence that dinosaurs were still around when humans were on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She recognized the ‘Giraffe’ and Dinosaur Extinction handouts as those she had given to her mother, having brought them home from Freshwater’s class.  There were strikeouts on one of the handouts, and Button testified that in the original she could still read “biblical” through a strikeout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With reference to carbon dating, Button testified that Freshwater said it wasn’t really a [blank - missed a word] science and students shouldn’t really trust or believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked by Millstone if Freshwater taught that evolution wasn’t really a scientific theory, she answered that he did, that he said “it couldn’t be proven wrong”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kate Button cross examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On cross examination, Button was asked if she took the handouts home to her mother during the school year.  She replied that she had done so, often the same day they were handed out.  Asked what her mother said about them, Button replied that there was little or no discussion, that her mother didn’t talk about other teachers at home.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked whether Freshwater used “creation” in class she replied that he did, and she also affirmed that he used the phrase “intelligent design.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some blur concerning with the several handouts associated with Kate and Elle Button.  In 2002-2003 Freshwater apparently also gave Elle Button, the teacher, copies of his handouts after the school day, sometimes sent via Kate.  It wasn’t clear if they were the same handouts.  Kate mentioned, for example, that on her version of one handout “biblical” was visible through a manual strikeout on the paper, and Kate had noted in the margin “Does God exist?”  She couldn’t remember the reason she made that notation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked what her grade was from Freshwater.  She replied that she got a A or a B, and that she didn’t pay much attention to grades.  Asked what she paid attention to, she replied “What I learn.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally in cross examination Button testified that her mother had disapproved of her coming forward to testify, on the ground that it might elicit community disapproval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked on redirect why she came forward in spite of her mother’s disapproval, Button said it was something she had wanted to do since 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recross examination was deferred, and the hearing was adjourned for the day, month, and year.  It will resume on January 6, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later (if I feel &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; ambitious) I may write a summary that attempts to assess the state of testimony at this point.  Commenters are welcome to post their versions of such a summary.

From Boulder it’s less than an hour’s flight, so I spent more time in the car than in the air. In fact, I did my business so quickly in Albuquerque that I turned around and flew home, spending about the same time in the air as I did on the ground there. Weird. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the way there, the pilot announced that we could see Pikes Peak from the starboard side. I leaned over to the window, and it took me a moment to find it; first, the Rockies were displayed all around me, and second, we nearly above the mountain so the view was flattened considerably. Still, very cool view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/2995787517/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3149/2995787517_647f57a4f3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a few moments later, the perspective changed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/2996628522/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3213/2996628522_d4037d43ef.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rockies are spectacular, and oddly I can’t see them well from my house; the foothills (smaller but closer mountains) block them. I actually need to head East, &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from the mountains, to see the bigger peaks; perspective drops the foothills faster than the farther but much larger mountains. By the time I’m about 8 km east the taller peaks are easy to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am always astonished to see the mountains; I’ve lived my whole life close to one coast or another; even in the Appalachian mountains the hills are far older, more eroded, smoother, and lower. Standing at the base of the Boulder Flatirons, with geology spread around you as obvious as the smell of pine and the sight of a magpie, the deep, deep history of the Earth is hard to deny. The Earth is &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt;. Our time here is short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no deep insight into this. I just think it’s remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225654026941"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-38354358808611638">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/728d33ee74f0d0ba</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="My World" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">A New Customer for Tim Hortons</title><published>2008-11-02T19:23:00Z</published><updated>2008-11-02T19:32:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/11/new-customer-for-tim-hortons.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/38354358808611638/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=38354358808611638" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> PZ Myers has posted a video of his daughter Skatje having breakfast at Tim Hortons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the first step toward becoming Canadian.

Vernon City Board of Education were on October 30 and 31.  Once again I’ll summarize rather than try to present a sequential account of questions and answers.  This post is Day 5; the next will be Day 6.  I hope to have Day 6 written and posted sometime tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous posts on the hearing:  &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/10/freshwater-hear.html" rel=""&gt;Days 1 &amp;amp; 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/10/freshwater-hear-1.html" rel=""&gt;Day 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/10/day-4-science-c.html" rel=""&gt;Day 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See also the coverage of Day 5 in the &lt;a href="http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/08/10/31/medical-expert-testifies-at-hearing" rel="external "&gt;Mount Vernon News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 5 saw the completion of cross examination of Bill White, Principal of the middle school in 2007-2008, and the testimony of Kathy Kasler, the high school Principal; David Levy, M.D., an expert witness; and Bonnie Schutte, a high school science teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill White, continuation of cross examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelly Hamilton, Freshwater’s attorney, mainly pressed on two lines in this last segment of his cross examination, compliance with the master contract and Debe Strouse’s role as an observer in Freshwater’s class, and Hamilton’s strained interpretation of the effect prong of the Lemon test.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked about Debe Strouse, who was the observer assigned by the administration to monitor Freshwater’s classroom late in the 2007-2008 school year, from sometime in April to the end of the school year.  He asked why she was in Freshwater’s classoom (“To monitor”), what she was looking for (“Everything that went on”) and to whom she reported (White).  He asked if Freshwater had the opportunity to sign off on her reports – the master contract specifies that teachers be permitted to sign off on reports of evaluators and enter rejoinders if they wish.  White’s answer was that Freshwater had not been asked to sign off because this was not part of the evaluation process specified in the contract.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked whether he thought any falsehoods had been alleged against Freshwater (No), whether Freshwater had Constitutional rights in the classroom (Yes), and whether White thought Freshwater got those rights (Yes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton returned to the promotion of religion issue, asking whether Freshwater’s reputation as a “spiritual” man influenced the perception that the poster with a Bible verse showing Bush and Powell praying was a religious display.  White denied that.  Hamilton asked how the book “Jesus of Nazareth” (checked out along with a Bible from the library in mid-April 2008 and placed on a science table in Freshwater’s classroom) constituted a promotion or denigration of religion.  White answered that Jesus is an important historical figure in Christianity.  Hamilton went on to ask whether an item displayed in a classroom would be a “religious” item only if Freshwater explicitly put a religious interpretation on it.  I think White answered “No,” though it was inaudible and I’m not sure.  Hamilton asked whether Freshwater’s activities outside school interfered with his activities inside the classroom.  White didn’t know.  Asked how Freshwater manifested his “spiritual” character, White replied “He was always nice.”  That evoked followups relating to whether religious people can display not-nice behavior and non-religious people can display nice behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked a series of questions about White’s knowledge of the independent investigation.  White denied most knowledge except insofar as he was interviewed as part of the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Hamilton asked whether White could have involuntarily transferred Freshwater had he wished to do so.  White agreed he could have, but did not.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White redirect examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In David Millstone’s redirect he asked whether Debe Strouse was in the classroom do to an evaluation under the terms of the contract, and White answered she was not.   Millstone asked whose responsibility it was to resolve conflicts between one’s role as a parent and one’s role as a teacher when one’s child is in the school (referring to Freshwater’s daughter’s participation in FCA).  White replied it was the teacher’s responsibility.  Finally, Millstone asked whether if you see “Bible” on a book you know it’s a religious item.  White answered that you do know that.  This refers to several occasions on which Hamilton had witnesses (Superintendent Short and White) look over Freshwater’s Bible to see whether it mentioned “Christianity” on its cover. (It doesn’t – it’s titled “The Living Bible”).  Hamilton seems to be implicitly arguing that there are students in rural central Ohio who are so stupid they wouldn’t know that a Bible is a religious document without being explicitly told that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White recross&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On recross Hamilton asked if Freshwater’s apparent passion for religious activities and topics (which White had commented on earlier in his testimony) was really a passion for following the rules.  White replied that it was not, using as examples Freshwater’s eagerness for FCA activities and his in-school advocacy of (and having a poster in his classroom about) a Will Graham evangelical event in the area in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ended White’s testimony.  The next witness was Kathy Kasler, the high school Principal in 2007-2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kathy Kasler direct examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On direct examination Kasler testified that she had numerous complaints from high school science teachers about the students they were getting from Freshwater’s 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade class.  Asked about the content of the teachers’ complaints, she listed teaching things not in the standards, having to reteach some material to correct student misconceptions, and hearing comments from students expressing doubt about various scientific concepts like carbon dating and the age of the earth from Freshwater’s students.  The first complaints she was aware of came in 2002, when the district was beginning to align its curriculum with the new state science standards.  It was suggested that there be a meeting between the then middle school Principal, Freshwater, and some high school science teachers to “straighten things out.”  It’s not clear that meeting ever occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked whether she got complaints from high school teachers after 2002-2003, she replied that she did, and the complaints had expanded to include Freshwater having students memorize the periodic table (there’s no chemistry in the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade standards), that students commented that they shouldn’t believe everything they hear about evolution, and that science isn’t always accurate.  Asked whether she got written complaints from high school teachers, Kasler responded that she did, citing email from Bonnie Schutte, a high school science teacher who teaches 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kasler was presented with an email from Bonnie Schutte to her in August 2007.  Every year Schutte gives a short questionnaire to her incoming 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade students to gauge where they are with respect to their science knowledge and interests.  Based on responses to several questions by Freshwater’s students she has provided copies of those questionnaires to Kasler for years and has emailed her concerns to Kasler.  Asked whether she had heard similar concerns from other high school science teachers about Freshwater’s students, she replied that she had but they were not in written form.  Asked whether she had heard similar complaints about students from other 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science classes, she replied that she had not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked what she did about the complaints, Kasler said she informed the relevant administrators, the several Principals (over the years) of the Middle School, of the concerns.  Asked whether she took her concerns to the Superintendent and/or the Board of Education, she replied she had not.  Freshwater, she said, was not her employee but that of the Middle School Principals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the independent investigators’ report it was mentioned that Kasler had requested that her daughter not have Freshwater as her 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science teacher.  Asked why she did so, she replied that there were concerns about the material he was teaching, and that her husband had threatened to call the ACLU if the daughter was taught what he was hearing from Kasler that Freshwater taught.  So in part to preserve domestic tranquility, Kasler testified that she requested that her daughter not have Freshwater for 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kasler cross examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cross examination Hamilton first established that Kasler had never sat in on Freshwater’s classes.  Asked again what she did about the complaints she received, she replied again that she passed the concerns on to the relevant administrators at the Middle School.  Asked if it was in writing, she replied that it was not, and that she called the other administrators.  Asked if she knew what action they took she replied that she did not.  Asked why she didn’t go to the Board of Education about it, she replied “I followed protocol.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning the request that her own daughter not have Freshwater for 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science, she was asked how she protected other students.  She replied again that she passed on the concerns to the relevant administrators.  Asked whether there was a school policy prohibiting parents requesting teacher changes, she replied that there was not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton then moved to the 20 or so surveys from Schutte’s classes that were included in the investigators’ report and testified about in direct examination.  Asked whether some mentioned creationism, Kasler replied that they did.  Asked whether the questionnaires could reflect what students learned at home or in the community, I didn’t catch Kasler’s answer.  Asked whether the design of the questionnaires permitted statistically isolating relevant variables like information from other sources besides Freshwater’s class, she replied it did not.  Asked whether other high school science teachers used similar surveys, Kasler replied that they did not, though she received similar complaints from them based on students’ verbal comments in classes.  Asked how many such surveys she had (Schutte gave her copies through the years), she replied around 120 from 2002 through 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kasler testified that teachers can teach beyond the standards if it’s consistent with the Board-adopted curriculum.  Other teachers who do so use Board-adopted and approved curricula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kasler was asked about a building tour she had done with a new member of the Board of Education, Sharon Fair, in the Spring of 2008.  In an office shared by two (several?) coaches they saw a religious-themed poster.  At the suggestion of Ms. Fair, Kasler concealed/removed the poster (it wasn’t clear which) and later advised the coach to whom it belonged to remove it.  The coach did so without demurral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to a Millstone objection to a line of questions concerning Kasler’s handling of other situations not related to the Freshwater affair, Hamilton argued that he was trying to show that Kasler is a decisive administrator who takes action when she deems it necessary and that she didn’t hesitate to put things in writing.  Since she didn’t take decisive action in the case of Freshwater and didn’t put things in writing, she must not have thought it was serious.  In response to the question that was generated after the objection was overruled, Kasler said again that she had notified relevant administrators and “He’s not my staff.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kasler testified that she had heard concerns about Freshwater’s teaching from Dick Cunningham, chairman of the high school science department, in 2002-2003 during preparations for the new Ohio Graduation Test while the local curriculum was being aligned with the new state standards and indicators.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kasler was asked whether there were teachers with religious displays in their classrooms in the high school.  She testified that she wasn’t aware of any, and that she wasn’t aware of any teachers at the high school with Bibles on their desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kasler redirect examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In redirect, Millstone asked why the soccer coach’s poster was removed.  Kasler replied it was at the request of the Board Member who saw it during the building tour.  She thought it was inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. David Levy, expert witness, direct examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to testify was Dr. David Levy, Chairman of emergency medicine at St. Elizabeth Health Center in Youngstown.  The main thrust of Levy’s testimony was that a Tesla coil of the sort used in Freshwater’s classroom is a high-voltage device and the fact that it generated an RF signal is medically relevant.  With an electrical burn, Levy testified, visible surface damage can be just the tip of the iceberg, that there can be subdermal damage not immediately apparent given the device allegedly used in Freshwater’s classroom.  He testified that the specific device used, the BD10A, has the potential to cause significant damage, particularly in children whose bodies have lower electrical resistance.  Asked whether there is a risk to the heart of a non-pacemaker wearing person, Levy replied that there is, that it could induce cardiac arrhythmia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shown the pictures on the marks on the arm earlier entered into evidence, Levy testified that his original reaction is that they are pictures of a second-degree burn, and that the marks are consistent with a BD10A having been used on the arm in the described manner, 2 passes in each direction, 10-12 hours preceding when the pictures were taken.  Levy testified that it was  his opinion that it was an electrical burn, and that the appearance would not have been significantly affected (nor would his opinion be affected) by knowing that the boy participated in hockey practice with goalie’s equipment between the occurrence of the burn and the taking of the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Levy cross examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On cross Hamilton asked whether a Tesla coil has the same voltage as a defibrillator.  Levy answered that defibrillators have variable settings ranging up to 300 joules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about the likelihood of subdermal damage, Levy replied that it depended on four variables, the duration of contact with the source, the electrical resistance of the particular person, the ratio of contact (that is, the area of contact), and the voltage of the source.  They jointly determine the current flow.  Asked to estimate the duration of contact implied by the pictures Levy replied it couldn’t be estimated without knowing the values of the variables mentioned.  Asked whether a couple of seconds of contact could produce the appearance of the injury in the pictures, Levy responded that it could.  Asked how long a contact would have to be to produce blistering, Levy replied it could be as little as 5 seconds.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton spent a few questions on whether the pictures could be faked.  Levy’s response was that the injury in the pictures had the appearance of a burn.  Hamilton even asked whether someone could use a marker to create the appearance.  Levy agreed that it might be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levy agreed that the BD10A was a low amperage device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked how one medically determines whether there is subdermal damage.  Levy replied that history and the mechanism of injury are important, and that one can look for changes in blood myoglobin levels, cataracts, and ECG indications.  Asked how long it might be to manifest symptoms of subdermal damages, Levy said it could be up to 3-4 weeks.  Levy also testified that marks from the depicted injury could last 3-4 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levy conceded that diagnosing the extent of damage was very difficult from pictures, and in response to a direct question replied that his opinions depend on the veracity of the pictures.  He testified that the injury might be exacerbated by the goalie pads the boy was said to use between the time of the injury and the time the pictures were taken.  (Note here that I may have erred in reporting previously that the mother took pictures between school dismissal and the hockey practice.  She informed me later that the pictures were actually taken after the boy got home from hockey practice, and that’s what she thought she’d testified.  She is probably right: My notes get fragmentary once in a while.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked whether Levy was being paid to testify.  Levy replied that he was but he didn’t know how much because it was a favor to a friend, another physician who had originally been asked to testify but had a conflict.  A sustained objection ended this line of questioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a mandatory reporter (in Ohio, health professionals, among others including school personnel, are legally required to report any possible instance of child abuse to Children’s Services), Levy’s opinion is that this injury as it appeared in the pictures was reportable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Levy redirect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone asked whether a low amperage/high frequency device has implications for cardiac risk, and Levy replied that it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonnie Schutte direct examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to testify was Bonnie Schutte, a high school science teacher who receives students from all the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science classes in her 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of Schutte’s direct examination focused on the questionnaire she has used for half a dozen years on the first day of class in 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science.  She asks a variety of questions, including questions about what interested them most about their 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science class and what the most important concept they learned in 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science is.  Note that she refers specifically to the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science class in those questions.  That will become relevant later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone walked Schutte through roughly 20 such questionnaires of Freshwater’s former students from her 2005-2006 class, all of which had been given to the independent investigators and were included as an attachment to the investigation report.  She identified a number of problematic responses, including&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* “Science is a lot of theory and guesswork”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* “Evolution follows opinion and it’s not fact”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * “Enjoyed creation of the universe” and “it’s a very open subject”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* “Evolution and why that isn’t probable”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* “Dates scientists put on things aren’t always accurate”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* “Evolution because we learned about it and that it can or can’t be true”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* “Most important concept was the different views on evolution”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* “different looks on evolution”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* “debating about creation and evolution”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* “Evolution and religions.  I find such debates interesting”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* “God or Big Bang”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also a number of mentions of memorizing the periodic table of elements in Freshwater’s class, which Schutte testified is not in the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science standards and interfered with her subsequent teaching of chemistry to the state standards and indicators in 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schutte testified that verbal comments from students confirmed the impressions produced by the written comments.  She testified that the anomalous questionnaire responses came only from Freshwater’s students and not from students of other 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schutte testified that there are genuine controversies within evolution, for example the controversy about punctuated equilibrium vs. gradualism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schutte cross examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cross examination Hamilton mainly focused on two issues, whether a teacher can teach beyond the standards and whether the students might have learned the problematic responses on the questionnaires from home or the community rather than in Freshwater’s science class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, though, Hamilton had learned that Schutte’s husband had been in the hearing room for the last several days, and asked what he had told her about the questions Hamilton might ask.  She replied he’d told her that Hamilton was a tough questioner, but to think about the mililtary people in Iraq and how much tougher they had it, but that he had not described any of the specific questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again we walked through all 20 or so questionnaires.   With respect to Hamilton’s questions on students’ responses about the periodic table and why that was problematic, Schutte’s response that it was not in the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade standards, that Freshwater teaching it as he did – memorization – interfered with her teaching to her own standards and indicators in chemistry since it gave those students the impression that they knew chemistry when they didn’t and put them in a place where teaching chemistry to them was more difficult.  On the Nth iteration of Hamilton’s query about the appropriateness of Freshwater having his students memorize the periodic table, she replied “It’s like having students memorize the dictionary, saying ‘Wasn’t that fun’ and then saying ‘OK, now let’s write.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked a number of times by Hamilton whether students’ responses about creationism and evolution could have been based on what they had learned at home or in the community about evolution and science, Schutte slowly and clearly read the question to Hamilton, emphasizing the phrase “&lt;em&gt;in your 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science class&lt;/em&gt;.”  She said she assumed that students were answering the question as asked.  Note below that on redirect Schutte testified that she got those sorts of problematic answers only from students coming from Freshwater’s class and not from students from other 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the question of whether teachers can teach beyond the standards for their grade/class, Schutte reiterated a number of times that they should teach their own indicators first, and then they could go beyond them.  Asked how teachers know that and whether there was written Board policy requiring it, Schutte responded that teacher training in general implied it, and that the district’s emphasis on standards and indicators following the adoption of the new state standards and indicators in 2002-2003 and the addition of the Ohio Graduation Test to the educational scheme in Ohio in that period were strong messages that teachers should teach to the standards and indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about a student named (I think) Dustin Bross, Schutte related how she took him to Dick Cunningham, chairman of the high school science department, so Bross could tell Cunningham about Freshwater having referred Bross to a creationist web site about how scientists supposedly work.  She testified the material to which Bross was referred was an example of quote mining (though she didn’t use that phrase).  She was asked if she ever put her hands on Bross, and she replied that she didn’t recall doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schutte redirect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On redirect Schutte was asked if she got similar problematic responses about creationism and the Big Bang from students from other 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science classes.  She responded that she did not, but only from Freshwater’s students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schutte recross&lt;/strong&gt; – Hamilton had no recross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus endeth the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Day.  My post on Day 6 should be up sometime tonight.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;For me, this team has to rank up there with the Flyers' Stanley Cup-winning teams for sheer beloved-osity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminded me of a question from a reader that arrived in my inbox the same day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I wonder if you know of any explanation for why the final -ed is made into a syllable in some words used as adjectives, such as blessed, beloved, learned, and dogged, though when these words are used as verbs, the final -ed is not pronounced as a syllable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer: liturgical habit protected a few words from a sound change, half a millennium ago (and also, "dogged" is not derived from the verb dog). A longer answer is after the jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Let's start with the OED entry for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-ed&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which tells us that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;the formative of the pa. pple. of wk. vbs., had in OE. the forms &lt;em&gt;-ed, -ad, -od (-ud),&lt;/em&gt; where the vowel represents (though not with uniform consistency) the thematic suffix characteristic of the class to which the vb. belongs; the ppl. suffix proper being -d […] In some OE. vbs. the suffix is added immediately to the root-syllable, and therefore appears without preceding vowel as -d, or after a voiceless cons. as -t; e.g. in &lt;em&gt;seald&lt;/em&gt; SOLD, f. &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;ȩ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;llan&lt;/em&gt; to SELL, &lt;em&gt;boh&lt;/em&gt;t BOUGHT, f. &lt;em&gt;bycʒan&lt;/em&gt; to BUY. In ME. the several vowelled forms of the suffix (where they were not contracted) were levelled to &lt;em&gt;-ed (-id, -yd)&lt;/em&gt;, and this &lt;em&gt;-ed&lt;/em&gt; is in most cases still retained in writing, although the pronunc. is now normally vowelless (d), or after voiceless cons. (t), as in &lt;em&gt;robed (rəʊbd), hoped (h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ə&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ʊpt)&lt;/em&gt;. The full pronunc. (ɪd) regularly occurs in ordinary speech only in the endings &lt;em&gt;-ted, -ded&lt;/em&gt;; but it is frequently required by the metre of verse, and is still often used in the public reading of the Bible and the Liturgy. A few words, such as &lt;em&gt;blessed, cursed, beloved,&lt;/em&gt; which are familiar chiefly in religious use, have escaped the general tendency to contraction when used as adjs.; and the adjectival use of &lt;em&gt;learned&lt;/em&gt; is distinguished by its pronunc. (ˈlɜːnɪd) from its use as simple pple. (lɜːnd).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vowels of some other past participles, such as "&lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/69/A0206900.html"&gt;alleged&lt;/a&gt;", may have been preserved by that other liturgical profession, the law. And other cases, such as ragged and dogged, were never past participles at all, but are instead descended from OE &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;-ede&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which the OED says (in its entry for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-ed&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;is appended to ns. in order to form adjs. connoting the possession or the presence of the attribute or thing expressed by the n. […] The suffix is now added without restriction to any n. from which it is desired to form an adj. with the sense ‘possessing, provided with, characterized by’ (something); e.g. in &lt;em&gt;toothed, booted, wooded, moneyed, cultured, diseased, jaundiced&lt;/em&gt;, etc., and in parasynthetic derivatives, as &lt;em&gt;dark-eyed, seven-hilled, leather-aproned,&lt;/em&gt; etc. In &lt;em&gt;bigoted, crabbed, dogged,&lt;/em&gt; the suffix has a vaguer meaning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;-ed&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;words are pronounced just as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;-ed&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; words are, but a few retain the [ɪd] pronunciation sometimes or always, perhaps because of artificial archaism associated with poetic usage. This artificiality was resented by some prominent 18th and 19th century scholars, whose peeves are recorded as the OED's only citations for -ed&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1779&lt;/strong&gt; JOHNSON &lt;em&gt;Gray Wks.&lt;/em&gt; IV. 302 There has of late arisen a practice of giving to adjectives derived from substantives, the termination of participles: such as the ‘cultured’ plain..but I was sorry to see in the lines of a scholar like Gray, the ‘honied’ spring.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1832&lt;/strong&gt; COLERIDGE &lt;em&gt;Table-T.&lt;/em&gt; (1836) 171, I regret to see that vile and barbarous vocable talented..The formation of a participle passive from a noun is a licence that nothing but a very peculiar felicity can excuse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several kinds of evidence about when the vowels were lost. One sort of evidence comes from syllable-counting in metered verse. Thus Chaucer's &lt;a href="http://www.bremesoftware.com/Chaucer/index.htm"&gt;Canterbury Tales&lt;/a&gt;, which is written in (mostly) ten-syllable lines, famously starts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Whan that Aprill, with his shoures soote&lt;br&gt;
The droghte of March hath perced to the roote&lt;br&gt;
And bathed every veyne in swich licour,&lt;br&gt;
Of which vertu engendred is the flour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or in modernized spelling, with the syllabic status of the -ed endings emphasized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;When that April with its showers sweet&lt;br&gt;
The drought of March has piercèd to the root&lt;br&gt;
And bathèd every vein in such liquor&lt;br&gt;
Of which virtue engendered is the flower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit later, the poet promises&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;To telle yow al the condicioun&lt;br&gt;
Of ech of hem, so as it semed me -&lt;br&gt;
And whiche they weren and of what degree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, the meter of the middle line tells us that Chaucer's version of "seemed" had two syllables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"of each of them so as it seemèd me"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than three centuries later, for Shakespeare, similar words are almost all one syllable shorter, pronounced (in this respect) in the modern fashion. Usually, though not always, he also spells these words in a way that makes the vowel loss clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's compare the same three words we just examined in Chaucer. In one of his sonnets, Shakespeare calls his heart "A closet neuer pearst with christall eyes", and in &lt;em&gt;A Midsummer Night's Dream&lt;/em&gt;, one of the clowns is "Pierst through the heart with your stearne cruelty".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Titus Andronicus&lt;/em&gt;, we're told "So pale did shine the Moone on Priamus / VVhen he by night lay bathd in Maiden blood".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in Venus and Adonis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;No floure was nigh, no grasse, hearb, leaf, or weed,&lt;br&gt;
But stole his blood, and seemd with him to bleed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all these cases, both the spelling and the meter make the change clear. The spelling is still variable at that time, of course. Thus in his poem "A Lover's Complaint", we find&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;47  Found yet moe letters sadly penn'd in blood,&lt;br&gt;
48  With sleided silk feat and affectedly&lt;br&gt;
49  Enswathed, and seal'd to curious secrecy.&lt;br&gt;
50  These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,&lt;br&gt;
51  And often kiss'd, and often 'gan to tear &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line 50, "bathed" must be monosyllabic to fit the meter, but it's written with an 'e'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we also find in Shakespeare the seeds of the modern exceptions to the vowel loss, e.g. in The Rape of Lucrece we have the monosyllabic preterite "learned" in line 630&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;VVhen patternd by thy fault fowle sin may say,&lt;br&gt;
He learnd to sin, and thou didst teach the way. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the two-syllable adjectival past participle in line 811:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Yea the illiterate that know not how.&lt;br&gt;
To cipher what is writ in learned bookes,&lt;br&gt;
VVill cote my lothsome trespasse in my lookes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the difference expressed e.g. in the AHD's &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/8/L0090800.html"&gt;entry&lt;/a&gt;, which associates the pronunciation  [ˈlɚ.nɪd] with senses 1 and 2, and  [ˈlɚnd] with sense 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;1. Possessing or demonstrating profound, often systematic knowledge; erudite.&lt;br&gt;
2. Directed toward scholars: a learned journal.&lt;br&gt;
3. Acquired by learning or experience: learned behavior; a learned response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we find a two-syllable "ragged" in the first line of one of the sonnets:&lt;/p&gt;

(While you're at it, you should consider linking to Farley's equally useful &lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net"&gt;What's the Harm?&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm writing you because your site is one of the top ranked sites (according to Google) which hyperlinks to the site Stop Sylvia Browne. As you know, Robert Lancaster has done a fantastic service to the community by creating and maintaining this site over the last two years.  Robert is currently in the hospital recovering from a stroke that he had in August.

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the renewal for the domain name "stopsylviabrowne.com" came due during the first weeks after Robert's stroke, and it expired.  A domain squatter noticed this fact, and snatched up the domain before anyone noticed.  So now that domain contains non-skeptical content that we should not be endorsing via hyperlink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need everyone who is currently linking to the old domain to change their links to a different domain which is &lt;a href="http://stopsylvia.com"&gt;STOPSYLVIA.COM&lt;/a&gt;. This new name is up and running now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE!&lt;/strong&gt;  If you have already changed your link to point to a .NET or .US domain, we need you to change it to STOPSYLVIA.COM.  It is important for Google ranking that we all link to the same URL for the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also vitally important that we remove as many links to the old domain, and change these links to point to the new domain.  If your blog or content management software allows it, please revise any and all old posts you can. (Most blogs will let you revise old posts).  This will simultaneously boost Robert's site visibility and penalize the current owner of the old domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need more details on precisely what you should be doing, feel free to read my explanation here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptools.wordpress.com/2008/11/01/skeptics-load-your-google-bombs/"&gt;http://skeptools.wordpress.com/2008/11/01/skeptics-load-your-google-bombs/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explain exactly how and why Google-bombing works and give you some specific tips on how to compose your hyperlinks to have a maximum effect. Note for instance that you SHOULD include "Sylvia Browne" in the hyperlink, but you SHOULD NOT include the word "Stop".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thank you for your attention to this, and I'm sure Robert and Susan Lancaster thank you too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--Tim Farley&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
P.S. To see precisely which of your pages link to Stop Sylvia Browne, you can use the same Google search which I used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=link%3Astopsylviabrowne.com"&gt;http://www.google.com/search?q=link%3Astopsylviabrowne.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done! And I wish Robert as complete a recovery from his stroke as possible. Strokes can be devastating, and I hope he's able to return to the running of his most excellent (and needed) skeptical website.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, It wasn't a very good simulation of much of anything, and as a game it has only been a partial success, with some parts being quite entertaining and others deserving a resounding "meh". (Disclaimer: I have the game, but haven't bothered to install it yet; I've let &lt;a href="http://skatje.com/"&gt;Skatje&lt;/a&gt; play it for me, and I've read the reviews, and suffered a noticeable loss of enthusiasm from that exposure.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there is a revealing &lt;a title="We Found Who to Tar and Feather!" href="http://forum.spore.com/jforum/posts/list/8555.page;jsessionid=5E18EDA69A5B21F41A40CB066DA3C5F0.240061"&gt;inside view of the &lt;i&gt;Spore&lt;/i&gt; development process&lt;/a&gt;, with some tantalizing hints of some really great stuff that was implemented in early versions of the game, that never made it to release. Here's the problem: the developers divided into two competing/complementary teams with radically different goals, a "cute team" and a "science team". Guess who won?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was Spore's central problem: Could the game be both scientifically accurate and fun? The prototyping teams were becoming lost in their scientific interests. Chaim Gingold, a team member who started as an intern and went on to help design the game's content creation tools, recalls a summer spent playing with pattern language and cellular automata: "It was just about being engaged with the universe as a set of systems, and being able to build toys that manifested our fascination with these systems and our love for them." But from within this explosion of experimental enthusiasm came an unexpected warning voice. Spore's resident uber-geek and artificial intelligence expert Chris Hecker was having strong misgivings about how appealing all this hard science would be to the wider world. "I was the founding member of the 'cute' team," he says with pride. "Ocean [Quigley, Spore's art director] and Will were really the founding members of the 'science' team. Ocean would make the cell game look exactly like a petri dish with all these to-scale animals and Will would say, 'That's the greatest thing I've ever seen!' and some of us were thinking, 'I'm not sure about that.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(That, by the way, is from the Seed magazine article on the game. You've probably already seen it since you all &lt;a href="https://secure.palmcoastd.com/pcd/document?iid=0957YI689CD"&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt;, right?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the annoying mantra of far too many people, from Barbie to Chris Hecker: &amp;quot;science is hard&amp;quot;. Yes, it is…and that&amp;#39;s what makes it fun! Games are also hard, if they&amp;#39;re any good — you often have to master difficult moves, arcane strategy, work fast or plan far ahead, or solve tricky puzzles, and that&amp;#39;s why we &lt;i&gt;choose&lt;/i&gt; to play them, that's the &lt;i&gt;appeal&lt;/i&gt;. What I was looking for in &lt;i&gt;Spore&lt;/i&gt; was for someone to take a look with a gamer's eyes at the process of science and extract from it the puzzle-solving essence and make it approachable and entertaining; instead, they seem to have given up on the science and instead created animated plush dolls for amusement's sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a real shame. There is a little hope in an unlikely suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that Maxis announces that it intends to rectify this odd deviation from their plan through expansion packs, including a complete overhaul of the Cell Stage and Creature Stage, at minimum. The forced linear progression of the game and forced evolution should also be removed from the Cell and Creature Stages, as it is not faithful to the freedom of the advertised product. (Evolution to a better brain should be optional, at least in the Creature Stage, as it was in the earlier videos.) I do not believe that we have a right to demand it be free, as the development costs of this game are already astronomical. This may have not been as much of a problem if they hadn't been spending the past few years removing content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody at Maxis should have encouraged everyone to embrace the science. It could have been great. I don&amp;#39;t know why they didn&amp;#39;t, but I suspect that a bean counter somewhere noted that it never hurts to underestimate the intelligence of the buying public…and decided to embrace the lowest common denominator instead of aspiring to greatness.&lt;/p&gt;

She is on a misguided crusade against vaccines, fueled by her arrogant ignorance. She believes that her son is a special “indigo child”, the next step in human spiritual evolution. No wait. Scratch that - he has autism, and McCarthy believes this must have been done to him by vaccines. No wait again - he has now been cured by quack therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy suffers from a severe case of the arrogance of ignorance - she does not even have the common sense or humility to realize how ignorant she is. She believes that her “mommy instinct” is more reliable than scientific evidence, and that her degree from “Google Universtiy” makes her more qualified than trained experts who have spent a career studying autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am long past any sympathy for her or granting her any benefit of the doubt. She is nothing but a pretty bully, exploiting her dubious fame (and now the real fame of her boyfriend, Jim Carrey) to promote harmful nonsense. She is doing this because she does not seem capable of entertaining the idea that perhaps she might be wrong. She does not seem to care how much harm she does. She has expressed pride in the fact that her position is backed up by an angry mob, and she has a habit of shouting down any scientist who has the misfortune of sitting across from her on an interview show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason anyone is taking seriously this former booger-eating, Playboy playmate, mother of an “Indigo child” is because there is a pre-existing anti-vaccine cult and they have seized upon her as a celebrity front-person. Like it or not, McCarthy has made herself the focal point of a cult-like group of anti-vaccine ideologues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cult has historically been all anti-vaccine all the time, and they drift from issue to issue - anything they can pin on vaccines. In the last decade the focus has been on the claim that vaccines are associated with autism. Unfortunately for their anti-vaccine cause, the scientific evidence strongly shows that there is &lt;a href="http://csicop.org/si/2007-06/novella.html"&gt;no association between vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies in multiple countries have shown no association between vaccines and autism or thimerosal (a mercury-based preservative) and autism, removal of thimerosal from vaccines did not decrease the autism rate (as anti-vaccinationists predicted), autism is increasingly understood as a complex of genetic disorders, early signs of autism manifest younger than the bulk of the vaccine schedule, and pre-natal vaccines do not correlate with autism. Scientifically, there’s no controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet McCarthy and her cult plug away, preferring their gut feelings to all this scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media has largely been gullible and accepting toward McCarthy, giving her a venue to spread her nonsense. There have been some good articles written by competent science journalists, but the TV media has been a disaster. The Queen of Woo, Oprah Winfrey, has given McCarthy her biggest venue, but so has Larry King and most of the morning shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mainstream scientific community has tried to do damage control, but honestly most scientists and officials have no idea how to deal with angry conspiracy-fueled grassroots criticism. The CDC has all but played into the hands of the anti-vaccine crowd with their confusing rhetoric. Only Paul Offit, a pediatric ID specialist, has taken on the anti-vaccine movement head on. (We will be interviewing him next week on the SGU about his new book, Autism’s False Prophets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately skeptical activists have taken up some of the media slack. Using our new web 2.0 powers, we have pushed back against McCarthy and her ilk, providing resources and information to parents and traditional media that would otherwise not be there. Skeptical science bloggers, like myself, Orac, various authors at Science-Based Medicine - even astronomer Phil Plait and many others, have exposed McCarthy’s foibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there is also a new website called &lt;a href="http://www.site.stopjenny.com/Home.html"&gt;stopjenny.com&lt;/a&gt; - started by skeptics who wanted to get involved. The site is already full of useful information and links. It still needs a lot of work- such single issues websites should strive to be as thorough a resource as possible. This is a huge and complex issue, and organizing it all on one site is a herculean task. They need to reach out a bit more (hint!) and tap into those who have been writing about this issue for years. I would also like to see a news/media-watchdog page keeping up to date on McCarthy’s media appearances and utterances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one problem with this site is that, ironically, it focuses on Jenny McCarthy. StopSylviaBrown (now StopSylvia) makes sense - the issue is primarily about one charlatan. But Jenny McCarthy is about the deeper issue of the vaccines and autism controversy - she is just a figure head. This needs to be made more clear, rather than giving undue attention to one crank. But all things considered, the site is off to a great start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International League of Skeptics - a group of SGU listeners who have also taken up the banner of skeptical activisim, are also planning a Youtube video about McCarthy. They seem to recognize that they are dealing with a complex topic, but they are plugging ahead. I wish them luck in this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we are seeing is the spreading of the skeptical movement to the masses. This is a great thing - we need more activists doing more projects. My only word of caution is that often skepticism deals with very complex or technical topics, and the details matter. While the lateral spread of activity is great, it could benefit from some vertical integration as well. In other words, the skeptical activists need to tap into relevant experts and take the time to do due diligence. This is especially true of medical issues where people might actually make health decisions based upon the information provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More quantity is great, but we have to keep pushing the quality of skepticism high as well. Message boards and blogs are good tools for collaboration among skeptics so we can pool our expertise and keep the quality of our output as high as possible. But I think we also need to explore new ways of collaboration. There is just so much to do, and while we are growing we are still a relatively small movement. This means we need to make maximally efficient use of our time and energy. I’m open to suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think that collectively focusing our efforts on a few high-profile issues is generally a good idea. The anti-vaccine, autism fear-mongering, Jenny McCarthy anti-scientific idiocy is a good and worthy target. The other side is getting some traction and vaccine rates are actually dropping, leading to measles outbreaks and perhaps more to come. This is a great target issue for skeptics, and we should begin the pig pile.&lt;/p&gt;

I am glad to be a part of such an important conversation.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess I'll start with how I got here. By "here" I mean writing as an atheist. When I was in High School I read in some scholarly book that Moses was not a real person. That really shocked me. I always had a sense that the Bible wasn't really "true" and yet there was nothing specific I could really point to to prove that. The existence or non-existence of Moses was the first really clear issue I discovered as a young person that liberated me from the grip of the fundamentalist worldview: If Moses was not a real person, then it is impossible that he could have written Genesis. Since the people at church adamantly assert that Moses did in fact write the book of Genesis (and he was given the literal ten commandments on stone tablets by God at Sinai etc etc), then if Moses was not a real person, the people at church are profoundly mistaken. This issue opened my mind to the idea of biblical scholarship, i.e. that there are ways of reading the bible that go beyond fundamentalist and evangelical readings. I discovered, once I read more deeply, that practically no legitimate biblical scholar believes that Moses was a real person. For me, that realization started me down the path of outright rejection of christianity. If the people named in the Bible stories are not real people, as I was taught to believe they were, then the Bible simply cannot be literally true in the way the people at church said it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be sure, it isn't as if my realization that the Bible contains "Myth" is the reason I assert that there is no god, i.e. that I am an atheist, but I started down the path to atheism by first making a good faith effort to reconcile the christianity I was hearing about at church with Biblical Scholarship. I tried to reconcile myself to the idea that there is no such real person as Moses, that Paul probably did not actually write, in the way that I am sitting here writing, the book of Romans, that the book of Isaiah as printed in the Bible is in fact a later version of the original book, etc. etc. My path to atheism began by losing my faith in the authority of the Bible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What ultimately led me to a rock solid atheism was what I would call, on the one hand, a geographical complaint and, on the other hand, a sociological realization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for the sociological realization... The overall idea is that there really isn't anything that a Christian can do that an atheist or a Pagan a Muslim cannot do. There is no special power that attaches to the Christian as a result of faith. This realization utterly destroyed my understanding of The Holy Spirit. Let me try to explain what I mean.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was raised to believe that God lives in me. The Holy Spirit, by virtue of faith in God, somehow changes my life, gives it meaning, in a way that I would not experience if I did not have faith. In the book of Acts, this function of the Holy Spirit is very dramatic and immediate in the lives of the faithful: people speak in tongues and prophesy and do miracles and suchlike. Of course, we today do not do such things, but even so the Holy Spirit is supposed to give our lives a special quality that other people's lives do not have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I call the ideas I have in mind here "a sociological realization" because I came to see that there really isn't anything different about life where I am from than life anywhere else in the world. If we were all christians, and everybody else in the world were Pagans, and Buddhists, and Muslims, and atheists, and pornographers, and sinners and suchlike, shouldn't there be some obvious difference in our lives compared to theirs?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I grew up in a small town in Kansas. Growing up in Kansas I was led to believe that the world was a wretched miserable place where Heathens lived in shanties and God had bestowed his grace upon us, which was demonstrated by the fact that we were free and had the highest standard of living in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then, I had the opportunity to visit Japan. Twice. I lived in England. I lived in France. In none of those places were people particularly interested in Christianity. Their standard of living, as I saw it, was in fact markedly superior to the standard of living in small town Kansas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take Japan for example. In the small town where I grew up there is an oil refinery, a prison, a wal-mart and a strip of fast food restaurants. Almost everybody works at one of those places. I was really shocked, having grown up in such a place, to see Tokyo for the first time. It absolutely boggled my mind that compared with Tokyo the people at church in the small town I grew up in believed that they were "free" and materially more successful than people in other places in the world. Whatever you mean by "free", the christians in Kansas are not more free in any salient way than the people of Tokyo, Japan. I doubt very seriously that the people of Kansas would argue that the proof of their special relationship with God is that they enjoy a freedom unknown to others in the world if they ever actually saw places like Tokyo. I was bowled over by the fact that generally speaking people in Japan are not even in the least bit interested in becoming christians. The blessings god had bestowed on the truly faithful people of Kansas were shabby and unimpressive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the overall sociological realization went deeper. I fell in love with a woman whose parents were Muslim. They were urbane, happy, cosmopolitan people. I started to wonder what my life would be like if I converted to Islam. I put a lot of time into studying Islam. I realized that everything that was promised to me if I got baptised into Christianity (with a literal immersion in water) was also promised to me by the Muslims if I converted to Islam. Began to ask myself whether the Christian life differed in any meaningful way from the life of a devout Muslim. I had to conclude that in reality, there would be no difference. Either way I would pray, I would go to church (or mosque), I would have devout friends and buy devout books, do charitable deeds, etc. etc. Of course, the Christians would say that maybe there would be no difference anyone could actually point to in my life if I became a Muslim, but the key difference would be that I would go straight to hell since I had rejected Jesus. But then the Muslims would say that I was going straight to hell because I had rejected Islam. I began to really wonder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then I made the leap. What difference in actual reality would it make if I converted to Hinduism and started to worship the god Ram? I have never heard any Hindu threaten me with Hell. Overall, as a Hindu I would still attend religious services, and have friends and live a devout life and make charitable contributions and on and on. God has really done nothing to distinguish the Christian life from any other life. Christianity is in fact a ludicrous chauvanism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was these sorts of sociological issues that really destroyed any thought that Jesus is god. The final nail in the coffin came when I learned, through sincere study, that no serious scholar of christianity really believes in Hell anymore. I realized that in terms of how life is lived, and what is possible to one in life as a result of one's choices, there is absolutely no real difference in the lives Christians live and the lives everybody else lives. And, no, you are not going to hell even if you do become a Pagan or an atheist. It just doesn't matter if you are a christian or not. Everything is available to you: happiness, kindness, hope, compassion, friendship, love, etc. etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So then there is the geographical complaint, which is harder to explain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess it starts with Kansas again. I was raised by fundamentalists in a small town in Kansas. The really do believe that they are among the 144,000 people who will be saved by Jesus in The Final Days, which are probably upon us even now. I was raised to think this way too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I realized is that it is extremely unlikely that such important knowledge about the circumstances of the Universe and how one should relate oneself to God is known by people in a small town in Kansas. The people I grew up with and who go to church at the church I grew up in could not tell you even the first thing about something like the P vs NP problem in mathematics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went to college and in college I studied mathematics. From a fundamentalist point of view that probably ruined me, but I learned through my studies how good ideas get transmitted among intelligent, thoughful people who actually care about the truth of what they are saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mention the P vs NP problem in this context because most trained people in mathematics who know anything about it would tell you that this problem is probably the outstanding mathematical problem of our time. There are literally thousands of people who have given tens of thousands of hours of their time to discussing the P vs NP problem as carefully as possible. To even get to the point where you might make a tiny contribution to that discussion in print you would have to study mathematics for years. Where, I ask you, are people discussing this problem? Who is paying for it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The P vs NP problem is being studied and discussed all over the world at some of the best universities on the planet. Governments all over the world will pay a qualified researcher actual money to advance the discussion of the the problem. A proposal to do funded research in this area will be vetted by a team of highly specialized professionals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mention all of that because I was exposed to that culture when I started studying mathematics at university.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, it is simply ludicrous that the only thing you really need to know about life is in the Bible and in the possession of a bunch of fundamentalist christians in a small town in Kansas. It is simply ludicrous that the Truth about the fundamental situation of The Universe could be explained in a single sermon to a bunch of people in a small town in Kansas who have no specialist knowledge. And yet that sort of idea is precisely what evangelicals and fundamentalists propose, taking their cue from Paul's gospel preaching as recorded in the book of Acts. The only thing you really need to know is that Jesus was the Son of God and he died for your sins and you will live eternally if you accept Him into your life. OK. Thanks for the information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess I mean to say that if the sort of knowledge that christians claim to have had any reality to it, sincere intellectuals striving to understand the universe would take more of an interest in it. Mathematicians, Physicists, Linguists, etc. all researchers would push aside their scholarly tomes and turn their attention to The Bible, which after all contains the answer to ever question you might have in life!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in fact we have had two thousand years of scholarly engagement with the Bible and the truth is that there is nothing particularly special about the knowledge contained therein. You cannot build an internal combustion engine based on anything you read in that book. You cannot get the answer to the P vs NP problem from anything you read in that book. In fact, you can spend the rest of your life reading that book and you are still going to have to get a job, buy all the things that everybody else has to buy and save your money for retirement just like anybody else. So what is so special about the knowledge contained in this book? Nothing, which is precisely why you can glean everything that can be gleaned from it without ever leaving the state of Kansas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If there was something special contained within the pages of this book, The Bible, sincere scholars all over the world would be gnashing their teeth for an opportunity to read it, to study it, to expound upon it. Nothing could stop the flood of people applying for grants to do research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But after two thousand years of familiarity with Christianity, we know. You can give this book, The Bible, to people in Kansas and they are going to live and behave in no way distinguishable from anybody else. They are going to shop and work and socialize. Nothing special is going to happen at all. The Bible is so diluted in its message and content that it can be dispersed over the widest possible area and have no effect whatsoever. It is intellectually inert. The world would indeed be a totally different place, however, if the fundamental research motivating inquiry in the P vs NP problem ever became "common knowledge".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I already know that any decent fundamentalist christian is going to respond to that sort of thinking by saying that god has made the intellectually proud of this world foolish by giving the gift of salvation to those people who are like children, innocent and uneducated. I guess I am saying that if "the gift of salvation" was actually meaningful in any tangible respect at all, it would be snatched from the fingers of the innocent in a heartbeat. It's not something you would ever hear about in a small town in Kansas. Like the P vs NP problem. Anyway, that is my experience of life and my experience of things that are important in life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;A while ago my Stanford colleague Tom Wasow sent me an article from the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/em&gt; that quoted a dean at a prestigious Eastern university: "Any junior scholar who pays attention to teaching at the expense of research ain't going to get tenure." That &lt;em&gt;ain't&lt;/em&gt; was a nice touch: it made it clear that the dean&amp;#39;s conclusion wasn&amp;#39;t based on expert knowledge or some recent committee report — it was something that should be clear to anyone with an ounce of sense.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;That's the message that &lt;em&gt;ain't&lt;/em&gt; conveys in all those common expressions like &amp;quot;It ain&amp;#39;t over till the fat lady sings&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;If it ain&amp;#39;t broke don&amp;#39;t fix it&amp;quot; –&lt;em&gt;ain't&lt;/em&gt; tells you that you're dealing with a nitty-gritty verity that you don't need a college education to understand.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about this use of &lt;em&gt;ain't&lt;/em&gt; is that it pops up in contexts where an educated speaker would be unlikely to use a run-of-the-mill nonstandard form like "He done it" or "They didn't get none." In fact you hear this evidential &lt;em&gt;ain't&lt;/em&gt; a lot from political figures in speeches and interviews, and not just in idioms like "it ain't over till it's over" and "say it ain't so":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;And so, kind of Psychology 101 ain't working. It's just not working. I understand the issues, I clearly see the problems, and I'm going to use the NIE to continue to rally the international community for the sake of peace. &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/12/20071204-4.html"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; I think, again, that we've got to do the best job we can of trying to facilitate some kind of an agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians and getting back to Tenet and Mitchell. It ain't easy. It's one of the toughest, most difficult, impractical problems I've ever seen. &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/vicepresident/news-speeches/speeches/vp20020324-2.html"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; Well, when a politician gets corporate contributions and then writes an earmark for that corporation, which is not competed or any other virtue that I know of, that's not illegal, either. OK? But it ain't right. &lt;a href="http://kudlowsmoneypolitics.blogspot.com/2008/04/transcript-mccain-interview.html"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; This ain’t your father’s Republican Party, by the way.  This is a different Republican Party.&lt;a href="http://www.delawareliberal.net/2008/09/05/biden-goes-nuclear/"&gt; Joe Biden &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It ain't gonna happen. &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/05/20060524-2.html"&gt;Tony Snow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that this usage accounts for the great majority of the occurrences of &lt;em&gt;ain't&lt;/em&gt; that you see in print and other relatively formal contexts, outside of direct quotations of nonstandard speech. That may be one reason why the word is likely to remain in the penumbra of standard English, despite its phonological naturalness as a contraction. If &lt;em&gt;ain't &lt;/em&gt;ever became respectable (as it nearly did in the nineteenth century), educated speakers would no longer be able to use it to deliver themselves of a homey-sounding truth. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoff Nunberg</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225584150136"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/11/01/cassini-hi-reses-enceladus/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fad235dce6f81960</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><title type="html">Cassini hi-reses Enceladus</title><published>2008-11-02T00:02:00Z</published><updated>2008-11-02T00:02:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/11/01/cassini-hi-reses-enceladus/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have to go to a birthday party (srsly) so I can’t put my usual spin on this, but yesterday Cassini swept over the south pole of Saturn’s icy moon Enceladus, snapping away at the active regions of geysering there.

Hoffmeier uses to deny that the Moses story in Exodus 2 could  have been composed in the post-exilic era.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The six words (TEBATH, GOME’, ZAPHETH, SUPH, HAYE’OR, and SAPHAH) are listed and discussed on pp. 138-140 of Dr. Hoffmeier’s &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Israel in Egypt&lt;/span&gt;.  These six words also will show how poorly Mr. Steve Hays reads scholarly materials, and how uncritically he reads Dr. Hoffmeier. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Let’s begin with the claim Dr. Hoffmeier made about these six loanwords (&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Israel in Egypt&lt;/span&gt;, p. 140):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Furthermore, it seems unlikely that a scribe during the&lt;br&gt; late Judean monarchy or the exilic period (or later)&lt;br&gt; would have been familiar with these Egyptian terms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we use more precise dates for “the late Judean monarchy or the exilic period (or later),” then Dr. Hoffmeier is claiming that scribes would not be familiar with these words in the years ca. 600?-400 BCE (or later).   I have a question mark at 600 BCE because Dr. Hoffmeier is ambiguous about the dates he assigns to the “late Judean monarchy.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If we can demonstrate that scribes are, or could be, familiar with these Egyptian loanwords during that time or later, then we cannot preclude the composition of the Moses story ca. 600-400BCE (or later).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In any case, I already have proven definitively that at least one of these words, GOME’, occurs in Jewish Aramaic papyri dating to around 441 BCE. Apparently, Triablogue misses the implication of my falsification of Hoffmeier’s claim because Mr. Hays declares (&lt;a href="http://triablogue.blogspot.com/2008/09/atheism-au-chocolat.html"&gt;Au Cholocat&lt;/a&gt;):  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Now Hoffmeier cited no fewer than six Egyptian &lt;br&gt; loanwords. For Avalos to question one out of six doesn’t &lt;br&gt; get him where he needs to go. Avalos needs “actual evidence” &lt;br&gt; for the late occurrence of each and every loanword.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, note that Hoffmeier does not claim precisely that these words don’t OCCUR in later periods---that is Hays’ interpretation of Hoffmeier’s claim. Hoffmeier claims only that scribes (presumably Hebrew or Jewish ones) would not have been FAMILIAR with the Egyptian terms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Note also how Hays evades the comprehensiveness of Dr. Hoffmeier’s comments about these so-called Egyptian loanwords. Dr. Hoffmeier said “these Egyptian terms,” and so that would include &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;gome&lt;/span&gt;’.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any case, Dr. Hoffmeier’s statement is false. By using the phrase, “these Egyptian terms,” Hoffmeier included all of the Egyptian loanwords in a set defined as “unlikely” to be familiar to scribes in the  “late Judean monarchy or the exilic period (or later).” Therefore, finding one word in a late Judean or post-exilic text falsifies the statement about the entire set.  Let’s use more symbolic logic, so that Mr. Hays can understand it better:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-X states that elements A, B, C, D, E, and F are ALL in Set Y.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Even if only A is not in Set Y, then the statement by X is false.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This would be no less erroneous than if I said that Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton were ALL presidents after 1970.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In the same way, Dr. Hoffmeier’s statement is false. Dr. Hoffmeier should clarify, and say that &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;“one of,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;“some of”&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;“most of”&lt;/span&gt; these words would not be familiar to the scribes of the late Judean monarcy or post-exilic period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But, let’s look at the words one-by-one and see if it is unlikely they would be familiar to scribes at the time Dr. Hoffmeier claims (ca. 600?-400 BCE or later). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;1. TEBATH (“basket” in Exodus 2:3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; The fact that this word was understood by later scribes is evidenced by the Targum of Onkelos. This Aramaic translation uses the word TEBUTHAH, which is cognate with the Hebrew word.  The Targum of Onkelos dates from early Christian times or later. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Jews who translated the Septuagint used THIBIS or THEBE, which the translator expected readers to understand.   Hoffmeier  (&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Israel in Egypt&lt;/span&gt;, p. 205) dates the Septuagint to the third century BCE, and more precisely to the time of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (ca. 309-246 BCE).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Note that Hoffmeier (&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Israel in Egyp&lt;/span&gt;t, 138) admits that the word survives into Egyptian Arabic, which is a relatively modern form of Arabic. Thus, knowledge of that word has not disappeared at all. Nor did people need to borrow it directly from Egyptian if it was being transmitted in other Semitic languages that eventually led to Arabic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this and the other cases, Hays seems to overlook the biggest problem of all for Hoffmeier’s claim: the vocalized Masoretic Hebrew text is of Medieval date, and it preserved the earlier vocalization of the Egyptian (or at least the vocalizations given by Hoffmeier). So, why does Hoffmeier claim that scribes would not be familiar with the word after the exilic period when the word occurs in Medieval Hebrew manuscripts? What scribes copied those words into the Medieval era?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;2. GOME’ (“papyrus”)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; I have already shown (&lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/09/unholy-mosesconservative-scholars.html"&gt;Unholy Moses&lt;/a&gt;) that this term was familiar to Jewish scribes at Elephantine from around 441 BCE.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;3. ZAPHETH (“[bitumen] pitch”)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Dr. Hoffmeier says this (&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Israel in Egypt&lt;/span&gt;, p. 139):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;The word...appears only in Exodus 2:3 and Isaiah 34:9 in the&lt;br&gt;Hebrew Bible, and cognates are restricted to Syriac&lt;br&gt;and Arabic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operative phrase here is &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;“in the Hebrew Bible,”&lt;/span&gt; for surely Dr. Hoffmeier should know that this Hebrew word occurs in LATER Hebrew books OUTSIDE THE HEBREW BIBLE. Perhaps that is why Hoffmeier said “only in Exodus 2:3 and Isaiah 34:9 in the Hebrew Bible.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Indeed, the word occurs in the apocryphal work known as Ecclesiasticus or The Wisdom of Ben Sirach 13:1. More devastating to Dr. Hoffmeier’s claim is that the word occurs in manuscripts of Sirach from the famous Cairo Geniza (a Geniza serves as storage for discarded manuscripts) from the Medieval period! This falsifies the claim that scribes would not be familiar with this word after the exilic period “or later.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For my Hebrew edition of Sirach, I use Herman L. Strack, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Die Sprüche Jesus’, des Sohnes Sirachs&lt;/span&gt; (Leipzig: A. Deichert’sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1903), p. 14.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The fact that Sirach used this word is apparent to anyone that consults a simple Hebrew lexicon such as that of Koehler/Baumgartner. Mr. Hays simply does little basic homework.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;4. SUPH (“reeds”).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; This word has been discussed and debated, and it is not clear that the word always means “reeds” or not.  But more devastating to Dr. Hoffmeier’s case is his reliance on William Ward (“The Semitic Bicosonantal Root SP and the Common Origin of Egyptian CWF and Hebrew SÛP: 'Marsh Plant,'” &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Vetus Testamentum&lt;/span&gt; 24, no. 3 [July, 1974]:339-349).  Hoffmeier says (I&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;srael in Egyp&lt;/span&gt;t, 214):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;If the word &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;sup&lt;/span&gt; is related to the Egyptian &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;twf(y)&lt;/span&gt;—and I think this is virtually certain in light of Ward’s rigorous linguistic&lt;br&gt; investigation of the word...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But did Mr. Hays read Ward’s study? Probably not.  Ward’s study makes it clear that the word in Hebrew IS NOT A BORROWING FROM EGYPTIAN.  Rather, Ward shows that the Hebrew word was borrowed from Canaanite (Phoenician, more specifically).  As Ward (p. 349) phrases it:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Finally, the Hebrew &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;sûp&lt;/span&gt; would have been borrowed from Canaanite at a later time, after the shift from aw &amp;gt; ô &amp;gt; û had taken place in Phoenician.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps Dr. Hoffmeier’s misleading phraseology (“&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;sûp&lt;/span&gt; is related to Egyptian &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;cwf(y&lt;/span&gt;)”) led an amateur such as Hays to believe that &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;“related to”&lt;/span&gt; means &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;“borrowed from.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Dr. Hoffmeier should have said that Ward explicitly denies that Hebrew borrowed the word from the Egyptian language. Thus, SUPH does not belong in a list of “Egyptian loanwords.” In fact, Ward shows that the Egyptian word was also borrowed from Canaanite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But, even if  SUPH were an Egyptian loanword in Exodus 2:3ff, it can be demonstrated that scribes after 400 BCE did know this word. The evidence comes from the Septuagint, the Greek translation(s) of the Bible. The Septuagint translators rendered SUPH as &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;papyros&lt;/span&gt; (“papyrus reed”) in Isaiah 19:6. The Septuagint uses HELOS (“marsh”) in Exodus 2:3, which also shows that they knew what the word meant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In other words, the Jewish scribes translated SUPH pretty much as Dr. Hoffmeier says it should be. So how could the Jewish scribes of the third century BCE translate this term correctly if, as Dr. Hoffmeier claims, it was unlikely that a scribe working later than the exilic period “would have been familiar with these Egyptian terms”?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;5. HAYE'OR (‘the river”)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;If one looks at Hoffmeier’s own discussion (p. 139), one learns  that the Hebrew word (YE’OR) for Nile survives as IOR in Coptic, a language whose beginnings are usually dated to the second century BCE. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But note that this Coptic word, IOR, does not have the –t-that was found earlier in that Egyptian word. Therefore, the Coptic IOR is closer to the way the Hebrew spells it (&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;ye’or&lt;/span&gt;---also’ without the earlier –t-). So while the word without the –t- may be as early as the Egyptian 18th Dynasty, the Coptic texts demonstrate that the word without the –t- could be known to later writers (Coptic uses a Greek-adapted alphabet).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note that the word without a –t- was used in Akkadian (&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;ia’uru&lt;/span&gt;) and so it does not preclude its use in an Akkadian story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As usual, Hays is not a sufficiently good linguist to notice things like these, and so he just happily regurgitates what Dr. Hoffmeier tells him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;6. SAPHAH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Dr. Hoffmeier clearly is hyperbolizing about the value of this word for dating Exodus before the late Judean monarchy.  First, and as Hoffmeier himself admits, this is a well-known SEMITIC word (NOT an Egyptian loanword). Note Hoffmeier’s statement (&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Israel in Egyp&lt;/span&gt;t, 139): &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;“it was part of the inherited Semitic stratum of the Egyptian language.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Hays should have noticed this because Hoffmeier says it in plain English that saphah is Semitic.   Thus, there is no need for Egyptians to loan this word to the Hebrews, as it could have been transmitted through the Semitic family of languages. The word does not belong in a list of “Egyptian” loanwords or “elements.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Dr. Hoffmeier tries to tie the expression SEPHAT HA-YE’OR (“edge of the river”) specifically to an Egyptian context, but the fact is that the same expression (construct of SAPHAH + YE’OR) occurs in Daniel 12:5, which is set in a MESOPOTAMIAN CONTEXT. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; One would think that Mr. Hays would at least check his Bible every once in a while.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Of the six so-called Egyptian loanwords or “elements,” two are no such thing. SUPH is probably borrowed from Canaanite (Phoenician) and SAHPAH is a Semitic word. More importantly, we have shown that ALL these words were known to scribes after the exilic period (or later).  At least two can be used in a Mesopotamian context even in the Bible. More importantly, this research demonstrates that we cannot preclude composition of a Moses story in the exilic or post-exilic period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr. Steve Hays shows again that he does not possess the linguistic equipment to evaluate much of ANYTHING Dr. Hoffmeier or other scholars tell him about such issues. More importantly, Mr. Hays shows that he cannot even read what is said to him in plain English by Dr. Hoffmeier (as in the case of SAPHAH).  He does not bother to check the basic biblical resources that reveal some of the weaknesses in scholars he trusts.  I welcome either Mr. Hays or Dr. Hoffmeier to refute my evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTE: Throughout my essay I use rough approximations of the vocalizations and orthography of Semitic and Egyptian words because my computer program does not have the capability to insert the proper diacritics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian lunar probe Chandrayaan-1 is slowly making its way to the Moon; it’ll be another week before it gets there. In the meantime, the ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) has been testing the cameras by taking images of the Earth. &lt;a href="http://isro.org/pressrelease/Oct31_2008.htm"&gt;The picture shown here (click to embiggen) is very cool&lt;/a&gt;. It shows the southern coast of Australia, and I think it’s south-up, despite the map they show [&lt;em&gt;Update: &lt;a href="http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001721/"&gt;Emily figured this out&lt;/a&gt;: the image has been flipped horizontally due to operator error!&lt;/em&gt;]. You can clearly see water above the land mass, and I think that’s the ocean south of Australia. The resolution is nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That picture was taken on October 29 when the probe was 70,000 km above the surface of the Earth; nearly twice as high as weather satellites. Obviously, when it arrives at the Moon and drops into its &lt;em&gt;100 km&lt;/em&gt; orbit, the images it gets will be fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225556254504"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=791">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/778ec76a9902c89a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="WTF"/><title type="html">A party run amok by Sarah and Joe?</title><published>2008-11-01T16:11:10Z</published><updated>2008-11-01T16:11:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=791" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was interested in this &lt;a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/10/24034.php#comment-779454"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; by BeachSaint on Matt Yglesias' post "&lt;a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/10/24034.php"&gt;Duberstein for Obama&lt;/a&gt;":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Someone should check the seismic activity in the Simi Valley between now and election day because Ronald Reagan must be rolling over in his grave over the antics of the McCain Campaign.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I am a registered Republican who has received extensive campaign training from the national committee. I am ProObama, ProLife. I’m not sure how much longer I can remain registered in a party run amok by the likes of Sarah Palin, Joe-the-Plumber and the other uneducated members of the radical right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought that the phrase &amp;quot;a party run amok by the likes of Sarah Palin [and] Joe-the-Plumber&amp;quot; was a passive of a causative: Sarah and Joe ran the party amok, i.e. caused the party to run amok, and so the party was run amok by them. (N.B. No political commentary is intended here — this is linguistics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But … Well, before going further into this analysis, let&amp;#39;s back up on &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;amok&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The OED's etymology for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;amok&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[ad. Malay &lt;em&gt;amoq&lt;/em&gt; adj., ‘engaging furiously in battle, attacking with desperate resolution, rushing in a state of frenzy to the commission of indiscriminate murder… Applied to any animal in a state of vicious rage’; Marsden &lt;em&gt;Malay Dict.&lt;/em&gt;] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More about the cultural background and history of the concept can be found in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amok"&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;. With respect to the linguistic history, the word was originally borrowed as an adjective or noun, in the Portuguese form "amuco":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;c1516&lt;/strong&gt; BARBOSA transl. by Ld. Stanley (Hakl. Soc. 1866) 194 There are some of them [the Javanese] who..go out into the streets, and kill as many persons as they meet..These are called Amuco.]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1663&lt;/strong&gt; H. COGAN &lt;em&gt;Pinto's Trav.&lt;/em&gt; I. 199 That all those which were able to bear arms should make themselves Amoucos, that is to say, men resolved either to dye, or vanquish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idiom "run amok" was then just the quasi-productive use of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with an adjective, as in "run wild" or "run rampant":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1772&lt;/strong&gt; COOK &lt;em&gt;Voy.&lt;/em&gt; (1790) I. 288 To run amock is to get drunk with opium.. to sally forth from the house, kill the person or persons supposed to have injured the Amock, and any other person that attempts to impede his passage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note that this sort of combination, like "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=764"&gt;go &amp;lt;adjective&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;", has apparently always been semi-productive, more in the style of derivational morphology than syntax.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amok&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has also sometimes been borrowed as a verb, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1866&lt;/strong&gt; C. BROOKE &lt;em&gt;Saráwak&lt;/em&gt; I. 29 On our return to Saráwak, we found a boy only sixteen years old had amoked in the town. Ibid. 27 Such causes in most instances lead to the Malay amoking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some have apparently taken the expression to be something like "a-muck", as in "a-slant", "a-board", and so on, licensing the independent use of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;muck&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1687&lt;/strong&gt; DRYDEN &lt;em&gt;Hind&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; P. III. 1188 And runs an Indian muck at all he meets.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1824&lt;/strong&gt; BYRON &lt;em&gt;Juan&lt;/em&gt; X. lxix, Thy waiters running mucks at every bell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, back to BeachSaint&amp;#39;s comment (&amp;quot;… a party run amok by the likes of Sarah Palin …&amp;quot;). The problem with my first idea, that this was a passive-causative construction, is that there are only a handful of causative examples like this one on the web:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;he is so shy! this intimidation gonna run him amok &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are thousands of apparently passive examples. Some seem to be malapropisms (well, at least substitution-equivalents…) for &amp;quot;overrun&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I know eugene remmy, he wouldn't let his place be run amok by the likes of pocket change (would he?).&lt;br&gt;
Pakistan is run amok by radical Deobandis who have taken over every aspect of Pakistani society …&lt;br&gt;
Downtown is run amok by gangs and prostitutes.&lt;br&gt;
The next morning as we prepared to leave, I stood looking over my father's lake and knowing that very soon it would freeze solid as granite and be run amok with snowmobiles and cars doing donuts in the snow.&lt;br&gt;
Without America, the world would be run amok with terrorists and dictators.&lt;br&gt;
This place was run amok by package tourists and the road to the hut was the most busy we were to see the whole trip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others seem to mean something like "run into the ground" or "run to ruin":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Thomas A. Szyszkiewicz gives a positive report of him and his rebuilding of his current diocese that was run amok by the previous Bishop.&lt;br&gt;
Our government was asleep at the wheel when the average citizen was run amok by the predatory lending practices of some institutions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note that in these cases, if anyone was &amp;quot;amok&amp;quot; it was the referent of the head of the by-phrase, i.e. the previous Bishop or the predatory lending practices. The subject of &amp;quot;run amok by&amp;quot; — the current diocese or the average citizen — were harmed by these unregulated bad actions. So they can&amp;#39;t be passive causatives, since the previous Bishop didn&amp;#39;t cause the diocese to run amok, but rather ran amok in such a way as to damage the diocese. However, English doesn&amp;#39;t normally distribute thematic roles that way in construction like this, does it?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still other examples seem to be mean something like &amp;quot;runing wild&amp;quot; — some of these may be just typographical errors where &amp;quot;-ing&amp;quot; has been left out (though at least the first of these seems more perfective than progressive):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Squash were run amok, to the point that they were overripe and spoiling in the rows in places.&lt;br&gt;
In several areas that last Wednesday night were run amok with riots, the watchful presence of troops is still evident.&lt;br&gt;
At that time regulation and government were run amok and Reagan was the right man for the job.&lt;br&gt;
Mr. Gilmore is worried about the future of Wall Street…too bad he was not worried a few years back when the robber-barons were run amok.&lt;br&gt;
Hundreds of people were watching from the pits, and before he flew, side bets were run amok. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are other examples that I'm not entirely sure how to classify:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;There's more and more development than ever, and if we have open space, it can't be run amok over.&lt;br&gt;
if every copy of Manhunt, GTA etc was to send signals to people saying go on a killing spree wouldnt the country be run amok of anarchists&lt;br&gt;
Warmth spread throughout her skin, literally feeling her skin glowing as her body continued to be ran amok with spasms.&lt;br&gt;
This is not to say that molecular biology was run amok by not having a definition; to the contrary, our collective understanding of genes grew rapidly …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And BeachSaint&amp;#39;s phrase remains one of those that resist easy categorization. It might be a substitution of &amp;quot;run amok&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;overrun&amp;quot;  (&amp;quot;… a party overrun by the likes of Sarah Palin and Joe-the-Plumber …&amp;quot;). But there&amp;#39;s surely also a hint of &amp;quot;run to ruin&amp;quot;, and a bit of &amp;quot;caused to run amok&amp;quot; as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decade began its very first year with his &lt;a href="http://www.hdot.org"&gt;crushing defeat in the libel lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; he instigated against Holocaust historian Professor &lt;a href="http://lipstadt.blogspot.com/"&gt;Deborah Lipstadt&lt;/a&gt;, a defeat so resounding that it accomplished exactly the opposite of what he had intended: It ended with the judge concluding that he was, in fact, an "active" Holocaust denier (not just a Holocaust denier but an &lt;em&gt;active&lt;/em&gt; Holocaust denier) Unfortunately, it cost Prof. Lipstadt and supporters a couple of million dollars and a couple of years of her time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, disgraced and technically bankrupt, Irving wandered among the pathetic white supremacists who would still listen to him speak and buy his books, holding the white power ranger equivalent of mutual reach-arounds about how persecuted they are, how misunderstood Hitler was, and how nefarious Jews were. His confidence, such as it was, grew until he overreached and actually agreed to speak to a band of admirers in Austria. Unfortunately for Irving, Austria has very strict laws against glorifying the Nazi regime or denying the Holocaust, and Irving had already had a warrant out for his arrest from the late 1980s for doing just that. Irving was arrested, thrown in jail, and eventually sentenced to three years in prison. I will not reiterate my position in detail about laws in Austria, Germany, and other nations in Europe that outlaw Holocaust denial. Suffice it to say I view them as an &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2006/02/david-irving-on-trial.html"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/02/shooting_free_speech_in_the_fo.php"&gt;assault on free speech&lt;/a&gt;. But you can't argue that they made for a bad year for Irving, who spent most of 2006 in an Austrian prison before being released early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, Irving's been going back to what he does best: Giving talks to pathetic bands of white power rangers. Unfortunately, his cachet among the white monobrow set has been greatly diminished because during his trial in Austria he "recanted" some of his Holocaust denial, but after his conviction he quickly &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/02/the_more_things_change_the_mor.php"&gt;reverted to form&lt;/a&gt; and still manages to attract followers, claiming his recantation was done "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/12/the_david_irving_bet.php"&gt;under duress&lt;/a&gt;." Most recently, he was seen at the University of Oregon &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/06/i_hope_youve_washed_the_slime_off_univer.php"&gt;giving a speech to the Pacifica Forum&lt;/a&gt;. In general, Irving has been giving speeches that whose attendees are &lt;a href="http://www.focal.org/speaks/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;carefully screened through his website&lt;/a&gt; and phone system to try to keep anyone from interfering with the neo-Nazi lovefests that they inevitably become. Alternatively, occasionally naive students open-minded to the point of their brains falling out invite him to mainstream venues, such as the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/david_irving_free_speech_and_holocaust_d.php"&gt;Oxford Union&lt;/a&gt;, and thereby &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/for_another_view_on_the_david_irving_fia.php"&gt;bring embarrassment&lt;/a&gt; upon themselves. Occasionally, he'll be interviewed by the press and say that Jews &lt;a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/804622.html"&gt;should "ask themselves" why they are so hated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all that wandering must be tiring for David Irving, don't you think? All that slinking around to get to his talks and avoid protestors is very draining. Irving could use a home where he could be famous but not have to travel so much. He could use a few months without a major trip. He almost found the solution, too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1033029.html"&gt;Celebrity Big Brother&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

A marionnaddict.  A foam junkie. I think Jim Henson may have been one of the greatest men to ever walk this planet and I mourn his untimely passing to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not often that my passion for puppetry and my passion for skepticism meet. Ok, let’s face it, it never happens. Or almost never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am lucky enough to live in Atlanta, Georgia, home to the &lt;a href="http://puppet.org/"&gt;Center for Puppetry Arts&lt;/a&gt;.  The center is a combination museum, theater, and educational facility. They do shows weekly for adults and kids and have a variety of workshops on puppetry.  I’ve been a center member for years and I can’t say enough good things about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/beakman.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/beakman-202x300.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A few years ago, I caught a show by Paul Zaloom at the Center.  You might remember Zaloom from the kid’s show &lt;a href="http://www.beakmansworldtv.com/"&gt;Beakman’s World&lt;/a&gt; back in the 80s.  I grew up watching Beakman and it was the first show I’d ever seen that talked about science and the real world. It was also funny as hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaloom isn’t doing as much kids stuff anymore but he is still doing puppetry.  The show I saw a few years ago was a ‘found art’ show. It was rated R and there were huge signs all over the theater warning that it was NOT a kids show. They were right. Zaloom’s work today is a combination of political satire, activism and education, with a touch of the surreal and good old fashioned goofy for good measure. (Plus vagina jokes.) A few months ago, I got to see more of Zaloom’s work, a shadow puppet show called The Mother of All Enemies, which centers around a:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“queer-secular humanist-Quaker-Buddhist-agnostic Arab immigrant artist, who somehow outfoxes a horde of pursuing adversaries made up of Homeland Security, Al Qaeda, the Statue of Liberty, the Christian Ex-Gay Movement, Minutemen vigilantes, and Israeli and Syrian agents”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to do that in quotes because there’s no way to paraphrase that description and still do it justice.  The show is just as strange and fabulous as you would expect. I also signed up for a workshop with Zaloom, where I got to test my imagination in creating ‘found art’ puppetry.  I’m sure none of you will be surprised to hear that I had a hard time letting go as much as you really need to access the creativeness to turn a coat hanger into an anti-abortionist but I did ok.  I also got to talk to Zaloom a little and he was cool enough to give me an interview for Skepchick - check it out below the fold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your first experience with entertainment was with puppetry and adult theater with a political bent.  What made you decide to target a younger audience with Beakman’s World?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Zaloom: I didn’t decide to target anyone. About five years before I got the job, I met a crazy, hyper New Yoika named Jay Dubin through the Quaker summer camp old boy network. We pitched my puppetry to HBO, to no avail. Five years later, he called me and said he was directing a kids’ show and thought I would be perfect for the lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I auditioned for the part because they had a hard time finding a weirdo in Hollywood, a real oddball. They found a lot of what they called, “sit com dads”. I ended up spilling some water during the screen test by mistake, and then I ad-libbed some nonsense, splashing around in it, and that sealed the deal. Besides, they were desperate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love playing for children; they laugh at different things, and those things are not obvious. I love trying to figure out what they will find amusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How much were you involved in the creative process of Beakman’s World? Did you get to drive a lot of the content or was it mostly done by writers and you were the face of it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I was hired, I volunteered to help conceive the show; I didn’t get paid or credit for this work. I just thought it would be fun to be in on the whole thing from the ground up. So a lot of the creation of the original ideas and the formats were things I participated in; it took a few months, but I was happy to do it. I mean, I’ve worked all my life for little or no money, so there was no reason to stop. And once I started performing, I got paid pretty well. But I don’t get paid for re-runs. Everyone thinks I’m rich because I’m on TV, but I don’t get paid for those second run appearances. Just want to set the record straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writers, who were great, wrote the shows, and once a week, we would read the scripts. We ended up adding lots of visual gags on the stage while we rehearsed and shot. We were always looking for ways to make it funnier and weirder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do you think are the key components of making science interesting to kids?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humor, joy, fun, and respect and love for children. Making a connection between science and the world that children inhabit. Making them laugh, and then making them think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you think there are other shows that have taken up Beakman’s mantle since it ended?  Which ones do you like?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea. I don’t watch television. It makes me uncomfortable. I loved Ren and Stimpy, though, but that was ages ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How did you introduce your daughter (and now, your grandkids) to science?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PZ: Well, she watched the show. And I would take her for walks and teach her stuff about science, mainly the natural sciences, because that’s where my interest lies. She used to call me, “Nature Dad”, when I went off on some rant about impact attenuators on the highway or beaver dams. Once in the subway, I asked her what she thought some guy was doing standing on the stairs looking at the turnstiles. He was barely visible, just his head. I knew what was going on; I lived in New York for years. Just as she said she didn’t know, a couple of kids hopped the turnstiles, and the plainclothes cop ran from the stairs as guys in blue came from every direction. So it helps to pay attention, and I wanted to impart that to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have advice for people who want to inspire their kids with science?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply engage your children with things that excite you or her or the both of you. If you are excited and interested in something, there’s a good chance she will be, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What inspires you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tons of things. Paintings, actually: German Expressionist paintings, Kustom Kulture, Dada…shadows I see on the way home from the gym. Patterns I see in the asphalt when I am crossing the street. African art in Kansas City at the Nelson Atkins. The Menil in Houston. Too numerous to mention. Daumier! Kandinsky? Charlie Krafft! Peter Schumann! Art is a huge inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You continue to bring humor to serious political and social topics with your adult puppetry shows. Have you had any negative responses to your show?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, there’s always someone who thinks you suck. I’ve gotten great reviews and horrible reviews. Most people won’t tell you to your face that you suck. But they have no problem posting some trash about you. I read all kinds of crap about Beakman on line that was total bullshit. But I don’t care. You have to let it all roll off your back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tell me about the shows you did in Israel and the response you received there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did The Mother of All Enemies in Tel Aviv at a puppet festival. The show went over really well, and I was invited to do a show on a woman’s apartment roof in Jerusalem. I didn’t want to do it, but when my boyfriend Greg and I got to Jerusalem, there was a bulldozer attack right near where we were. It was pretty disturbing, seeing all the troops and cops and Arabs up against the wall. So we decided I would do the show on the roof. It went over really well, which is funny, considering the fact that I am half Arab, and the Israelis clearly do not like Arabs (and vice versa). It’s an amazing country; we met tons of terrific people, Arabs and Jews, but both sides are ultimately totally crazy, and they are all hell-bent on screwing everything up that they touch. Sorry to say. You should see the yarmulkes that I bought with tanks and guns and other weapons on them. Both sides really like their guns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are an open atheist and openly gay.  Which (if any) do you get more flack for? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t gotten flack for being gay, except for the odd asshole yelling something at me from a car on Santa Monica Boulevard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m actually an agnostic; atheism is too much like a religion for me. I don’t know much; I’m just a little organism in a very very big realm. I have inklings of what might be going on, and I try to remember to pursue the consciousness that I think is the place I want to be. But I don’t believe in the existence or the non existence of god, and I don’t really care, anyway. There are much more important things to think about, like being good and decent and kind and honest and happy as hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you had issues where people come to your adult show and think it’s going to be Beakman? (I know it happened in Atlanta to some degree, in spite of all the warning signs!)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I am aware. I don’t remember that I “am” Beakman. It’s such a small part of my life that I usually forget. But I loved doing the part, and it was fun as hell. Many people have expectations of me that I don’t meet that come from the TV show. I hate to disappoint them, but I’m me, and there’s not much I’m gonna do about that at my advanced age ha ha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you think you’ll go back to doing shows for kids?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just did a live toy theater show for children with puppeteer Lynn Jeffries at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in L.A. It was great fun, but I don’t think I can make a living doing such a show for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s next?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Touring (see below). Learning ventriloquism. Making some cantastoria (story telling with pictures). Maybe a marionette show. Scotland in February. Bread and Puppet in August. Lots in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where can people see your work now? Are you still touring?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m touring a number of things right now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Abecedarium, a jumbo toy theater show for adults&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Mother of All Enemies, a shadow puppet show about an Arab/Quaker/queer/agnostic/secular humanist/artist/ weirdo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Beakman Live! show, featuring a series of live science demos, for family audiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no associated news stories, so far, about vocal organs or communication skills, though commenters on several web forums have made suggestions about demonic possession and (from those who listen more carefully) the possible dangers of keeping vocal mimics as house pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Some &lt;a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2iFmsVSyV4gC&amp;amp;pg=PA60&amp;amp;vq=%22starling+song%22&amp;amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;amp;cad=1_1#PPA83,M1"&gt;background&lt;/a&gt; on starling vocalizations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some interesting references (with links and abstracts) about the (still very puzzling) phenomenon of vocal mimicry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Laura Kelley, Rebecca Coe, Joah Madden, and Susan Healy, "&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.04.012"&gt;Vocal mimicry in songbirds&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Animal Behavior &lt;/em&gt;76(3):521-528, 2008.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Baylis (1982, Acoustic Communication in Birds, Academic Press) decried the serious lack of experimental verification for the various hypotheses proposed to explain vocal mimicry in songbirds. With few exceptions, our understanding of the function and acquisition of this fascinating behaviour seems to have scarcely progressed. We examine the proposed functional explanations and supporting evidence, and summarize advances made since Baylis's (1982) review. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence to support any of the functional hypotheses but, rather, that almost all of the data concerning song mimicry are consistent with the learning mistakes hypothesis, whereby birds learn simple and common sounds, frequently using them in inappropriate contexts. Additionally, many apparently mimicked sounds are calls, not songs, which themselves may not be learned by the models. It is plausible that many examples of call mimicry are, in fact, due to evolutionary convergence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Martha Leah Chaiken and Jörg Böhner, "&lt;a href="http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1650%2F0010-5422(2007)109%5B968%3ASLAIIT%5D2.0.CO%3B2"&gt;Song learning after isolation in the open-ended learner the European Starling: Dissociation of imitation and syntactic development&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;The Condor&lt;/em&gt; 109(4) 2007.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;We performed two studies to test whether the ability of open-ended learners to acquire new songs as adults depends on their having learned normal songs as juveniles. European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were kept in isolation for their first year. In the first study the birds were housed in a group with a wild-caught adult male following isolation. The subjects imitated each other but not the wild male and failed to develop normal phonology or syntax. In the second study each yearling was housed individually with a wild-caught adult male following isolation. These subjects developed good phonology and syntax but copied few or no song motifs from the wild adults. Taken together, the two studies indicate that starlings are capable of imitating new motifs and of acquiring species-typical phonology and syntax after a year of isolation. The contrasting results of the two studies suggest that imitation and the development of syntax are independent processes subject to different influences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;László Zsolt Garamszegi et al., "&lt;a href="http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/18/6/1001"&gt;A comparative study of the function of heterospecific vocal mimicry in European passerines&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Behavioral Ecology&lt;/em&gt; 18(6):1001-1009, 2007.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Although heterospecific vocal imitation is well documented in passerines, the evolutionary correlates of this phenomenon are poorly known. Here, we studied interspecific variation in vocal mimicry in a comparative study of 241 European songbirds. We tested whether vocal mimicry is a mode of repertoire acquisition or whether it resulted from imperfect song learning. We also investigated the effect of the degree of contact with the vocal environment (with species having larger ranges, abundance, or being long lived having a higher degree of mimicry) and a possible link with cognitive capacity (an overall larger brain in species with mimicry). Finally, we determined the potential evolutionary role of vocal mimicry in different interspecific contexts, predicting that mimicry may affect the intensity of brood parasitism, predation, or degree of hybridization. While controlling for research effort and phylogenetic relationships among taxa, we found that effect sizes for intersong interval, brain size, breeding dispersal, abundance, age-dependent expression of repertoires, and predation risk reached a level that may indicate evolutionary importance. Vocal mimicry seems to be a consequence of song continuity rather than song complexity, may partially have some cognitive component but may also be dependent on the vocal environment, and may attract the attention of predators. However, estimates of sexual selection and interspecific contacts due to brood parasitism and hybridization varied independently of vocal mimicry. Therefore, mimicry may have no function in female choice for complex songs and may be weakly selected via interspecific associations. These findings provide little evidence for vocal mimicry having evolved to serve important functions in most birds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Eben Goodale and Sarath W Kotagama, "&lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1560225"&gt;Context-dependent vocal mimicry in a passerine bird&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Proc Biol Sci.&lt;/em&gt; 273(1588):875–880, 2006.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;How do birds select the sounds they mimic, and in what contexts do they use vocal mimicry? Some birds show a preference for mimicking other species' alarm notes, especially in situations when they appear to be alarmed. Yet no study has demonstrated that birds change the call types they mimic with changing contexts. We found that greater racket-tailed drongos (Dicrurus paradiseus) in the rainforest of Sri Lanka mimic the calls of predators and the alarm-associated calls of other species more often than would be expected from the frequency of these sounds in the acoustic environment. Drongos include this alarm-associated mimicry in their own alarm vocalizations, while incorporating other species' songs and contact calls in their own songs. Drongos show an additional level of context specificity by mimicking other species' ground predator-specific call types when mobbing. We suggest that drongos learn other species' calls and their contexts while interacting with these species in mixed flocks. The drongos' behaviour demonstrates that alarm-associated calls can have learned components, and that birds can learn the appropriate usage of calls that encode different types of information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Kazuo Okanoya, "&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2007.03.011"&gt;Language evolution and an emergent property&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology&lt;/em&gt;, 17(2):271-276, 2007.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Much debate has been stimulated by the recent hypothesis that human language consists of a faculty that is shared with non-human animals (faculty of language in a broad sense; FLB) and a faculty that is specific to human language (faculty of language in a narrow sense; FLN). This hypothesis has encouraged a tendency to emphasize one component of FLN: the cognitive operation of recursion. In consequence, non-syntactical, yet unique, aspects of human language have been neglected. One of these properties consists of vocal learning that enables an abundance of learned syllables. I suggest that FLN is not an independent faculty, but an ‘emergent’ property, arising from interactions between several other non-syntactical subfaculties of FLB, including vocal learning ability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225545161074"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/the_bad_faith_awards_for_2008.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ace2322b5a8554ae</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">The Bad Faith Awards for 2008 nominations are trickling in</title><published>2008-11-01T14:05:56Z</published><updated>2008-11-01T14:05:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/439034750/the_bad_faith_awards_for_2008.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/the_bad_faith_awards_for_2008.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The New Humanist has a yearly anti-award event, the Bad Faith Awards, given to the "most scurrilous enemy of reason" for the year.

&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the list, Brian Dunning chose Montel Williams and, in his explanation of this choice, mentioned that Hal Bidlack wrote an open letter to Montel regarding Sylvia Browne.  I had never heard of this letter so I wanted to read more.  I did a quick search on Google and found the Google linked to it on the StopSylviaBrowne site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said the link was not found.  Robert Lancaster has always made his site easy to navigate so I figured I could get to it somehow through the main page.  So I went to my bookmarks and clicked on the site.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the expected SSB logo had been replaced with a new design. I thought it was odd, but continued to look around.  It didn’t take me long to realize that this wasn’t a redesign of the site, this was simply NOT Stop Sylvia Browne.  It was a believer’s version of it.  And I was on the correct domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was shocked.  So I quickly went to the JREF forum to see what was going on.  It seems the site had been this way since Tuesday.  There was a lot of speculation going on about hacking, illegal domain transfers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, our fears were confirmed.  The domain registration has expired and had been legally auctioned off by its registrar, GoDaddy.  It is now in possession of someone associated with a psychic business and website.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert’s wife wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, Folks, apparently I paid for the “hosting” but not the domain name. Notifications were sent to Robert’s email, which I have not had access to. I was told a mailing went out as well, but I never got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The domain was sold - legally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many people currently trying to find a way to get the domain back for Robert, and if that fails, the site will move to a new domain with no information loss.  As some point out though, this will affect its google ranking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Lancaster, the webmaster of StopSylviaBrowne, has done some tremendous work with this site and has become a sort of celebrity among skeptics. The site has been a constant source of information for myself and many others.  It exposed the type of person Sylvia Browne really is.  It has also helped many people see the truth about Sylvia Browne as evidenced in the emails he occasionaly publishes.  One thing’s for sure, this will not affect Robert’s or the skeptical community’s resolve to Stop Sylvia Browne.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mike Lacelle</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225535533520"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-3647346194884828719">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/33ec1c724e7752b1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">A Critique of William Lane Craig&amp;#39;s Use of Hilbert&amp;#39;s Hotel</title><published>2008-11-01T09:50:00Z</published><updated>2008-11-01T10:06:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/438923026/critique-of-william-lane-craigs-use-of.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/3647346194884828719/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=3647346194884828719" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/11/critique-of-william-lane-craigs-use-of.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">This critique was written by &lt;a href="http://atheologica.blogspot.com:80/2008/10/critique-of-william-lane-craigs-use-of.html"&gt;Principia Atheologica&lt;/a&gt; based on &lt;a href="http://exapologist.blogspot.com/2008/10/undercutting-defeater-for-craigs.html"&gt;exapologist's&lt;/a&gt; critique of Craig's Tristram Shandy paradox, which supposedly demonstrates the impossibility of an actual infinite.&lt;div&gt;

The situation arises when someone with little or no knowledge of the native language, typically an anthropologist, elicits information such as place names and writes down whatever the response is. When a linguist familiar with the language later reviews these records, some place name will prove to be uninterpretable until the linguist realizes that what has been recorded, usually in a garbled form, is the response "I don't know". There are various stories of this type in linguistic folklore, and I have encountered this myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across a variant of this in the census of a Carrier village carried out by Oblate priests, none of whom had much command of the language, in the 1870s. Several women are recorded as having been named &lt;i&gt;tsandelh&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The field of books offering to help people improve their writing on the job or at school is crowded, and some of them seem to sell well. But their treatments of English grammar are almost all seriously flawed and not especially helpful. &lt;em&gt;Write Right!&lt;/em&gt; is better than some of its competitors, but it really starts out on the wrong foot, in its discussion of what nouns are and how you can tell which words are nouns. (Like most of these advice books, &lt;em&gt;Write Right!&lt;/em&gt; begins with the parts of speech, nouns first.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, I'll tack on a wonderful bit about English "subjunctives" that readers couldn't possibly understand unless they already knew what the passage was talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The main show. Venolia starts out (page 4) with a somewhat more complex version of the usual semantic definition ("person, place, or thing") of &lt;em&gt;noun&lt;/em&gt;, offers two examples, and then suggests a formal test for nounhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noun&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;n.&lt;/em&gt;, a word that names a person, place, thing, quality, or act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;wise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt; talk because they have something to say; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;fools&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt; because they have to say something.&lt;/em&gt; — Plato&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can put &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; in front of a word, it's a noun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh dear. In this posting, I&amp;#39;ll pass on the semantic definition of categories — there&amp;#39;s an important connection between category membership and semantics, but denotata do not &lt;small&gt;DEFINE&lt;/small&gt; category membership — and focus on the first example (&lt;em&gt;wise&lt;/em&gt;) and the test for nounhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wise&lt;/em&gt; in "The wise talk because they have something to say" is &lt;small&gt;NOT&lt;/small&gt; a noun; it's an adjective, in a NP (&lt;em&gt;the wise&lt;/em&gt;) that has no overt noun head. This NP is an instance of an odd construction in English that licenses &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; + Adj as an NP with generic reference — most commonly as a generic plural referring to human beings, so that it can be roughly glossed as &amp;#39;Adj people&amp;#39;. Other examples: the soap opera &amp;quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&amp;quot;, the Robin Hood slogan &amp;quot;steal from the rich and give to the poor&amp;quot;, and a headline from yesterday&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; (p. 1): The Decided Go In Droves To Vote Early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that &lt;em&gt;wise&lt;/em&gt; is an adjective in Venolia's example by observing (among other things) that it takes degree modifiers of adjectives, like &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; ("The very wise talk only when they have something to say") and that it has comparative and superlative forms ("The wisest talk only when they have something to say"). Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;wise&lt;/em&gt; doesn't allow adjective modifiers (appropriate for nouns), even when these could in principle make sense: &lt;em&gt;the intelligent wise&lt;/em&gt; cannot be used to convey 'wise people who are intelligent'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Of course, dictionaries don't list words like &lt;em&gt;wise&lt;/em&gt; as nouns — not even words that are fairly common in this construction, like &lt;em&gt;rich&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;poor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;young&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of interesting details about the &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; + Adj construction (some of them treated in scholarly reference grammars), but here it's enough for me to point out that Venolia begins her presentation of the parts of speech with an example that's just flat wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe she took her own test for nounhood — ability to follow &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; — at face value. Or maybe she figured that the subject &lt;em&gt;the wise&lt;/em&gt; has to have a noun in it, and &lt;em&gt;wise&lt;/em&gt; is the only real candidate for the job. (She treats subjectless imperative sentences, like &lt;em&gt;Give me your lupines&lt;/em&gt;, as having an "understood subject" in them, so the way would have been open to her to say that &lt;em&gt;the wise&lt;/em&gt; has an "understood noun" in it. But that would make the Plato quote a very poor choice to illustrate nouns.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the test. You can see what Venolia had in mind here, but a reader who takes the test seriously will quickly get into hot water: &lt;em&gt;the wise man&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; right before &lt;em&gt;wise&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;the very wise man&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; right before &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;, but that doesn't mean that &lt;em&gt;wise&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; are nouns. Occurrence with determiners is in fact a test for nouns (ceteris paribus), but "occurrence" has to be understood in a more abstract way than immediate adjacency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus: the subjunctive mood. Venolia tells us that this mood "conveys situations that are hypothetical, doubtful, or even contrary to fact" and quotes the &lt;em&gt;New York Public Library Writer's Guide&lt;/em&gt; description of the subjunctive, which she calls "helpful" ("whimsical" and "confused" would have been my choices):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subjunctive mood can seem like speaking English in a slightly different universe, where the basic rules of tense are reversed: Present tense is used for past, past is used for present, and &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; is used for &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get anywhere in understanding this description, you have to know that there's a tradition for treating English as having one "subjunctive mood", with two tenses: a "present subjunctive" ("I insist that Kim be the speaker" and "I insist that Kim speak") and a "past subjunctive" ("I wish that Kim were the speaker" and "I wish that Kim spoke more often"). The terminology is opaque and misleading: the tense labels "present" and "past" as used here bear little visible relationship to such labels used for indicative forms, and the connection between the two sorts of subjunctives is obscure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, the "present subjunctive" is not used for past events, or the "past subjunctive" for present events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been over the ground of the "subjunctives" of English several times, but here's an extremely short version, with a lot of the complexities left out. First, in a few contexts, in particular in the complements of certain verbs (like &lt;em&gt;insist&lt;/em&gt;), English uses base-form VPs (&lt;em&gt;be the speaker&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;speak&lt;/em&gt; in the examples above); the base form of the verb &lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt; is &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt;, and for all other verbs (for instance, &lt;em&gt;speak&lt;/em&gt;), the base form is identical to the non-3sg present form. (Base-form VPs are used in a number of other constructions, for instance, in imperatives, in the complements of modal auxiliaries, and in infinitives marked with &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, in a different set of constructions (many associated with counterfactual semantics), English has an inflectional form that is identical to the past form for all verbs except &lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt;, for which the form is &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; (even with 3sg subjects): &lt;em&gt;spoke more often&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;were the speaker&lt;/em&gt; above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the forms in these two cases overlap with tensed forms, but they aren't in fact expressions of tense. Instead, they stand outside the tense system of English. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Arnold Zwicky</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225479653600"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3912">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f9fc01702922e8e8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition, 10.31</title><published>2008-10-31T19:00:16Z</published><updated>2008-10-31T19:00:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3912" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f1beafebbab2576c2ae4319408c7858f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy Halloween everyone!  Here’s a question appropriate to the holiday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The freedom of choice is something they- they don't understand, I uh&lt;br&gt;
am saddened at times uh about physicians in Congress –&lt;br&gt;
you know we have more now than ever,&lt;br&gt;
uh but if you look carefully they're not exactly the greatest champion&lt;br&gt;
uh of free market medicine and tend to&lt;br&gt;
capitulate and go along and&lt;br&gt;
go along with the AMA and think that the only thing that we can do&lt;br&gt;
now is it ((th- in place)) of why- what don't- why don't we just work hard and make sure you&lt;br&gt;
the physicians get a higher fee.&lt;br&gt;
Well uh if- if that's our solution uh to our problems today you can expect that uh free market medicine is not going to be revived.&lt;br&gt;
In a way, the &lt;strong&gt;remnant &lt;/strong&gt;of the physicians in this country really&lt;br&gt;
uh are in this organization&lt;br&gt;
and uh&lt;br&gt;
the- the &lt;strong&gt;remnant&lt;/strong&gt; is pretty important, those remaining believers have to set the examples&lt;br&gt;
and that's what uh so many of you do uh&lt;br&gt;
not only in spirit but as well as in uh practicality by not&lt;br&gt;
uh by not participating.&lt;br&gt;
it- I was uh amazed in the sov- uh how it worked in the Soviet Union, and Solzhenitsyn talked about this&lt;br&gt;
that there was still free market care in the Soviet system,&lt;br&gt;
and uh and that was for the politicians&lt;br&gt;
instead of the politicians getting pushed to the bottom of the ladder&lt;br&gt;
and making accept government medicine they always provided that one doctor, protected this doctor here or there,&lt;br&gt;
so the politician that could walk in&lt;br&gt;
and have uh more personalized uh uh private care.&lt;br&gt;
but uh even in a system as wicked as the soviet system&lt;br&gt;
there- there was a- a great &lt;strong&gt;remnant&lt;/strong&gt; uh and uh&lt;br&gt;
I was- I'm always amazed that you meet people coming out of Russia&lt;br&gt;
and- and the soviet system after the collapse –&lt;br&gt;
well educated, knew the English language,&lt;br&gt;
uh knew the classics and uh you know sometimes the underground education system in the soviet&lt;br&gt;
union was even uh a bit superior to the some of the public education in this country&lt;br&gt;
So uh th- this is why uh our efforts&lt;br&gt;
uh in AAPS is so crucial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference here is not to the odd-sized pieces of cloth and carpet that some of us used to buy to save money, but to the biblical concept of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remnant_(Bible)"&gt;remnant&lt;/a&gt;, defined by the OED as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;A small remaining number of persons. Also &lt;em&gt;spec.&lt;/em&gt;, in allusion to Isa. x. 22, a small number of Jews that survives persecution, in whom future hope is vested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;1630 PRYNNE Anti-Armin. 128 They are but a Remnant, a seede, a little flocke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The context in &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=29&amp;amp;chapter=10&amp;amp;version=9"&gt;Isaiah X&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;16: Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.&lt;br&gt;
17: And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;&lt;br&gt;
18: And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth.&lt;br&gt;
19: And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.&lt;br&gt;
20: And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.&lt;br&gt;
21: The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.&lt;br&gt;
22: For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.&lt;br&gt;
23: For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or for a grimmer translation of verse 22, in the &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2010%20;&amp;amp;version=76;"&gt;New International Reader's Version&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Israel, your people might be as many as the grains of sand by the sea.&lt;br&gt;
But only a few of them will return.&lt;br&gt;
The Lord has handed down a death sentence.&lt;br&gt;
He will destroy his people.&lt;br&gt;
What he does is right. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I awoke from my trance, I realized that this is a really striking metaphor: physicians who refuse to accept Medicare are like the few Israelites who remained after the Assyrian conquests and massacres. Even more surprisingly, so were the doctors who treated corrupt Russian communist leaders as private patients in soviet times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some other implications of this metaphor that I'd love to discuss with Dr. Paul some day: for example, in what sense does he feel that the "consumption decreed" on free-market medicine "shall overflow with righteousness"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, Dr. Paul is already well positioned to qualify as a small seed of future hope for the causes that he champions: in the same speech, he explains proudly that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;somebody did a study not too long ago&lt;br&gt;
and he did this as a research study and he looked at all the votes between uh&lt;br&gt;
year two thousand and two thousand four&lt;br&gt;
and uh found out that uh&lt;br&gt;
uh there were a hundred and twenty six times that I voted all by myself!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he quotes Samuel Adams, as libertarian conservatives are fond of doing these days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;and uh Samuel Adams said it- it does not uh take a majority to prevail&lt;br&gt;
but rather an irate, tireless minority&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some day we should take up the topic of &amp;quot;remnant syndrome&amp;quot; among intellectuals. It&amp;#39;s noble to be one of the beleaguered few who see the truth — and the larger the group who agree with you, the nobler your isolation. Or something like that. Linguists, who are genuinely a beleaguered few these days, are by no means immune to such motivations, which of course often operate recursively within successively smaller social circles, whether religious, political, or philosophical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, if the current polls are anything like accurate, Nov. 5 will see some main-stream Republicans feeling that "They are but a Remnant, a seede, a little flocke", and (I suspect) not feeling nearly as comfortable in that role as Dr. Paul is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225477888835"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/31/vote-3/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e782c31645aa085b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Vote</title><published>2008-10-31T18:31:25Z</published><updated>2008-10-31T18:31:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/31/vote-3/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/10/ivoted.jpg" alt="I voted"&gt;I just got back from voting. I don’t know if it’s too late where my American readers live, but if it’s not, I suggest getting out there and doing it. The lines will be a lot shorter; Tuesday promises to have record voter turnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was actually excited to vote today. I was fired up. It was great to see the early voter polling place full (though not too full; I’m not so good at waiting in lines). There were so many different types of people: old, young, men, women, various ethnicities (including one woman wearing a burqa-like covering, though her whole face was exposed; it occurred to me that here it’s considered extremely modest, but in some countries — where voting isn’t quite the same as here — it would be considered the height of sacrilege). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two (very) pregnant — hope for the future. There were men with ponytails (it’s Boulder, after all) and a big guy dressed like a farmer. Some people were in costumes for the holiday, but most came in off the street to get their voice heard early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked out of there feeling happy. Uplifted. Empowered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, it sounds corny. But I have hope. We’ll see what’s what on Tuesday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, exercise your obligation, your duty, as a citizen of a country that remains bound by the Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew there was a creationist connection to Halloween. &lt;a href="http://www.beaconbroadside.com/broadside/2008/10/zombie-jamboree.html"&gt;Glenn Branch figured it out&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the distinguished philosopher Philip Kitcher recently addressed the creationist movement in his Living With Darwin, he judiciously assessed creationism in its latest incarnation as historically respectable but currently bankrupt, and proposed to describe it as "dead" science. "In light of its shambling tenacity," I replied, "'zombie science' is perhaps a preferable label." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virtual juxtaposition of Halloween and election day affords me the irresistable opportunity to write about…election superstitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the critical state of our nation and the importance of the upcoming election, it is understandable that people from all walks of life may be engaging in superstitious activity.  Thanks to &lt;a href="http://blogs.psychologytoday.com/authors/matthew-hutson"&gt;Matt Hutson&lt;/a&gt;, from Psychology Today for emailing me this interesting post about &lt;a href="http://blogs.psychologytoday.com/blog/brainstorm/200810/election-superstitions"&gt;7 election superstitions&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, did you know that &lt;a href="http://video1.washingtontimes.com/joecurl/2008/04/mccain_triskaidekaphobic_1.html"&gt;John McCain and most of his staff are extremely superstitious&lt;/a&gt;?  McCain carries a lucky penny, a lucky nickel, a lucky quarter, a lucky compass, and a lucky feather.  And that’s after he cut back on superstitious paraphenalia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it looks like Obama is going to win, but some who desire that outcome are less likely to &lt;i&gt;say&lt;/i&gt; it.  Because they’re afraid of jinxing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barack Hussein Obama.  Saddam Hussein.  Osama Bin Laden.  Studies have shown names matter.  In one study, affixing a “poison” label to a bottle of sugar water caused people to avoid drinking it, even when they knew it was only water.  People often reject baby names if they don’t like someone with the same name.   And poor Obama has been “cursed” with names that have negative connotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hutson also suggests that some people feel voting for Obama will “even the karmic playing field”, as if voting in a black president will constitute racial reparations.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crux of superstition is that it gives us the illusion of control over events that are important to us, but outside our circle of influence.  Humans are hard-wired to notice patterns and assign causal connections.  Doing a simple cost/benefit analysis, it is less harmful to perform a futile supersitious act than to miss a valuable one.  Hence, rabbit feet.&lt;/p&gt;

The one thing I regret about this is that I won't be indulging in my favorite guilty pleasure for this time of year: watching an old horror movie or two. I'll just reminisce here for a few minutes over my favorites. Don't expect profundity, I admit up front that my taste is indiscriminate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the Hammer films — I happened to hit adolescence just as there was this renaissance of British horror, so these caught me at an impressionable age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Abominable Dr Phibes&lt;/i&gt;. Vincent Price at his cheesiest. Vincent was splendid in lots of movies: &lt;i&gt;The House of Wax&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;House of Usher&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Witchfinder General&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Raven&lt;/i&gt;. And &lt;i&gt;The Raven&lt;/i&gt; starred Peter Lorre and Boris Karloff as well!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cat People&lt;/i&gt;, both the Val Lewton original and the remake with Nastassja Kinski. It's one of those movies that tangled sex and horror together wonderfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of sex and horror…&lt;i&gt;The Lair of the White Worm&lt;/i&gt;. Amanda Donohoe is my kind of woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Wicker Man&lt;/i&gt;. Not the awful recent remake, but the creepy one with Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Quatermass and the Pit&lt;/i&gt; aka &lt;i&gt;Five Million Years to Earth&lt;/i&gt;. Who cares that it had cheap special effects — intelligent writing always wins out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheesy Japanese rubber suit flicks. These are ridiculous and weird, which is the appeal. I can snarf 'em down like popcorn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mad scientist movies, for some unfathomable reason, appeal deeply to me. From Colin Clive tho Jeffrey Combs, if it's got a deranged maniac with a gift for violating the laws of god and man, I will identify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few movies that can only be described as surreal which are wonderfully disquieting: &lt;i&gt;Eraserhead&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tetsuo&lt;/i&gt; come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t been too impressed with more modern horror — grisly gore just bores me — but one recent movie that I thought was well done was &lt;i&gt;El Orfanato&lt;/i&gt;. If I were staying home tonight, that's the one I'd be watching while handing out candy to the kiddies at the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

The rush to lock a young mind into a god complex is the main goal of all denominations, sects and cults. The old Catholic maxim “Given be a child to the age of twelve and I’ll give you a Catholic for life.” can also be seen in fervent missionary movements especially in the LDS Mormons, who, like the Blues Brothers Jake and Elroy, are “on a mission from God”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those who have remained religious have commented here at DC representing one of two Positions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Deist and Theist Position&lt;/strong&gt;: Easiest to defend since there is no religion or cult attached to it and this position draws in many agnostics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without a Bible, there are very little, if any dogmas or doctrines to defend, and, thus very little emotionalism (if any) is found here. All one need do here is take a past event and say, “It’s of god!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A good Comparison would be: “A cat died. God killed it.” When this cat lived and how it died are not relevant to this apologetic defense. The debate is simply, “It’s of god". (An example here is our agnostic commenter Charlie.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Biblical Religionist Position&lt;/strong&gt;: This apologetic defense is associated with an established belief usually either Judaism or Christianity. Unlike the Deist or Theist position, some form of salvation is involved in that since God is now personal and has a plan for all his creation (especially humans), thus he demands morals and ethics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These apologists usually feel empowered by the Holy Spirit and debate believing that religious truth is singular and orthodox. This position has an evangelical goals in mind, usually viewing Jesus as a personal savior and God as a “Heavenly Father”. (An example here is our fundamentalist commenter Rick.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, no matter how much time John, Evan, or Lee puts into writing a very logical argument, the apologetics that defends this illusive God are still just as un-phased as the magical and religious Ouija Board which spells out the future and the unseen world for its believers despite logical fact against it for the last 120 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, just how would an atheist defend God? Easy!  An ancient nonfunctioning entity is so illusive, it simply defies logic.  As such, any illogical mental construct that is pro god is good to go!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simply remove the Bible and the Biblical Religionist position becomes the Deist / Theist position. Remove the illusive term “god’ and the Ouija Board now has all the answers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It’s a quick way to demonstrate the power of our face-recognition ability, which still outstrips that of supercomputers. I use it to make the point that our brains are exceptional at pattern recognition, which also helps us understand one of our major cognitive weaknesses - hyperactive pattern recognition, or seeing patterns where they do not really exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists are also interested in face-recognition, and other pattern-recognition, that occurs in the human brain.  R. Quian Quiroga from the University of Leicester has published a number of studies exploring this ability. His latest research reveals what the press has dubbed “The &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/3276569/Jennifer-Aniston-neuron-shows-how-we-react-to-celebrity-faces.html"&gt;Jennifer Aniston neuron&lt;/a&gt;.” Quiroga recorded the activity in the visual cortex of using micro-electrodes of subjects viewing the faces of familiar stars, like Aniston, Tom Cruise or Halle Berry. He found that each familiar face seems to be encoded in a single neuron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding is a bit surprising as it was previously thought that visual memories such as this would be stored in a network of neurons. Rather, our brains assign a single neuron to remember a single familiar face, and that neuron will fire whenever that face is viewed - in any condition and from any angle. &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/105/9/3599.abstract?ck=nck"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; from Quiroga looking at medial temporal lobe responses to familiar faces and object found that the response of the memory neuron is an all-or-none response, and that it can be fired even by stimulation as brief as 33 miliseconds (thousandths of a second).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all-or-nothing finding is not surprising at all - the nervous system generally functions that way. You cannot partially fire a neuron (although the rate at which a neuron fires can alter). It also matches our common subjective experience, when trying to recognize someone the answer may seem to just click into place - recognition comes suddenly with all the attendant information in tow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does a single neuron store so much information? Well, those single neurons do not exist in isolation - on average they make over a thousand synapses (connections) with other neurons. Those synapses can be excitatory or inhibitory, and they can vary in strength. So while a single neuron may be the location where the memory of a specific face, for example, is stored, the abstract information about that face is likely stored in the pattern of synapses made by that neuron. Individual neurons may be part of many such groupings, reflecting the brain’s massively parrallel structure. This also explains the brain’s pattern recognition ability, as overlapping networks of neurons will allow one image to remind us of another image because they share neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the role of these single master neurons, acting like the “address” of a memory, is an important incremental step in our progressive understanding of how the brain works. This research also shows that our technology is starting to get down to the resolution, both in time and space, at which the brain is functioning. At least we are getting down to the single neuron level. There is still a finer level of detail in all the synapses being made by those neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This journal does not have a vote, and does not claim any particular standing from which to instruct those who do. But if it did, it would cast its vote for Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politics impacts science. From which research emphases get funded to which school board member to vote for, science and politics often cross paths. PT’s supporters come from all walks of life and bring to the pro-evolution discussion opinions on other matters that span everything from conservative to liberal. To the extent possible, PT tries to avoid overtly being political, partly because we don’t want to needlessly alienate those supporters, but mainly because it’s beyond the charter of this website and that there are many other blogs that serve that purpose better than ours. Occasionally, though, this blog encounters a crossroads between science and politics, entailing posts that necessarily make political statements. This is one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this election, there is a difference between the candidates running for president. Palin is a creationist of the first water. Her disbelief that money spent in support of autism research was going to labs in France that used fruit fly models, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/sarah_palin_ignorant_and_antis.php" rel="external "&gt;reported at Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;, speaks volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least from the standpoint of science advocacy and at least to this PT contributor, the decision during this election appears straightforward. &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v455/n7217/full/4551149a.html" rel="external "&gt;Nature’s endorsement&lt;/a&gt; is timely and appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that I've been completely neglecting my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/the_woo_aggregator.php"&gt;Academic Woo Aggregator&lt;/a&gt;. You remember my Academic Woo Aggregator, don't you? It was my attempt to compile a near-definitive list of academic medical centers that had "integrated" woo into their divisions or departments of "integrative medicine" (i.e., departments of academic-sounding quackery). Perusing it, I now realize that it's been over five months since I did a significant update to it. You just know that, given the rate of infiltration of unscientific medical practices into medical academia as seemingly respectable treatment modalities that there must be at least several new additions to this role of shame. Alas, even today, having been shamed myself by the realization of my failure to keep the list updated, I'm not going to do the full update and revamping that the Woo Aggregator cries out for. However, that doesn't mean I can't do a piecemeal addition here and there. That doesn't mean I can't point out new additions to the Woo Aggregator as they pop up, even if it takes me a while to find the time to give it the facelift it needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't mean I can't call out hospitals like Beth Israel when they fall into woo, especially when they &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/nyregion/30yoga.html"&gt;do it in a big way for cancer patients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/beth_israel_joins_the_academic_woo_aggre.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/beth_israel_joins_the_academic_woo_aggre.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/438078895" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225462622330"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/the-virtual-nagging-wife-diet/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bdcada06d6363592</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="commitment device"/><title type="html">The Virtual Nagging Wife Diet</title><published>2008-10-31T13:32:06Z</published><updated>2008-10-31T13:32:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/jYCpeosPJbE/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/the-virtual-nagging-wife-diet/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">We've written about commitment devices before: tools that hold you to your promises, like putting a replica glob of human fat on your kitchen counter to remind you to keep to your diet, or signing a contract to have yourself fined each time you smoke a cigarette.

&lt;p&gt;Happy Halloween everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is everyone doing today? I’m sure some of you will have costume parties to go to or maybe you’ll carve pumpkins and go trick or treating with your kids. I’m sure some will sadly do nothing because they’re just not into it or they’re in a country where the holiday is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past 3 years my partners and I designed, built and ran a Haunted Corn Maze at Larson’e Farm in Brookfield Connecticut. This means that my primary Halloween season activities involved all the tasks necessary to scare 6000 people over the course of 10 weekend nights. It was grueling. It took about a month to set the haunt up. The days we were open I would typically arrive at 11am and leave around 1am. During that time I would rarely stop moving. I wore a pedometer one time and I took 30,000 steps that day. Sometimes at 10pm I would realize I forgot to eat dinner. This is called the corn maze diet since my partners and I would usually lose almost 10 pounds during September and October. One day I’ll write a weight-loss book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong though. As tough as the work is I loved doing it. What other job is there where one of your goals is to literally make people piss in their pants? (we had 10 confirmed occurrences last year)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we couldn’t do the Haunt. I was bummed for a while but then I got excited because it meant I could do what I used to in October. That means I could turn my basement into  a haunt, throw a party, and scare the trick-or-treaters on Halloween.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme was a no-brainer…Pirates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We threw the party last weekend and it was a ton of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanna see some pics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my finished shipwreck scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogimages/halloween1.jpg" alt="" width="541" height="359"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t the wood look great in that top picture? There are ways to distress wood to make it look old but that takes time and talent. I took a shortcut of sorts and used pallet wood that has been weathering outside for about a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No self-respecting Pirate party would be complete without a treasure hoard, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the one I put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogimages/halloween3.jpg" alt="" width="541" height="359"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must say I’m proud of this display. There’s about 12,000 fake gold coins there. That sounds like a lot but you’d be surprised how quickly they get used up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my pirate torture area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of torture, I’ll torture you with just one more vacation slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is two drunken Pirates. I’m the one on the left.&lt;/p&gt;

American Apparel, rings true (the opinion is unpublished, and I haven't obtained a copy yet).  Charney is the founder of American Apparel, and has been the focus of several sexual harassment suits over the years for allegedly maintaining a sexually-charged work atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over at Conde Nast, Karen Donovan &lt;a href="http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/top-5/2008/10/30/American-Apparel-Arbitration"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Female employees have filed three sexual harassment lawsuits against Charney. The last active suit was settled earlier this year, but details about it had not been disclosed until a California appellate court released a decision this week.

&lt;p&gt;The decision, however,  also describes a bizarre piece of theater concocted as part of the settlement proposal. In exchange for paying the former employee $1.3 million, she and her lawyers agreed to a sham "arbitration." A retired judge picked by American Apparel would agree to stipulated facts and make a finding in the company's favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appellate decision lays out the sham arbitration of the settlement. It stipulated that the arbitrator would absolve Charney of the sexual harassment claims...[on First Amendment grounds]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charney, to be sure, is all for the First Amendment. So much so that the settlement would have included this press release to be issued: "The arbitrator ruled that the marketing materials, sexual speech and much of the conduct about which Nelson complained are protected under the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech and would not form the basis for any claim."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow!  We all knew that arbitration runs the risk of being tilted toward business interests, but to agree in advance to have an entirely artificial arbitration process in order to whitewash an executive's behavior?  That's priceless.  What would one call this?  AstroArbitration?  It makes a mockery of a &lt;a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/media/pdfs/Bland070612.pdf"&gt;mockery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the arbitrators have any ethics, they'll quickly adopt rules finding that such arrangements are unethical.  We'll see.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/artificial_arbitration_at_amer.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/437948139" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225452918304"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/friday_cephalopod_three_eerie.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5f84ab8b951f5982</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cephalopods"/><title type="html">Friday Cephalopod: Three eerie green embryos</title><published>2008-10-31T11:25:29Z</published><updated>2008-10-31T11:25:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/437910510/friday_cephalopod_three_eerie.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/friday_cephalopod_three_eerie.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="loligo.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/30/loligo.jpg" width="425" height="253"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Loligo pealei&lt;/i&gt; embryos&lt;/div&gt;

Nowhere is this truer than "documentary" channels like Discovery, History, or Travel. I mean, the shitty, shitty horror films on Sci-Fi and Spike are one thing, as they're fiction. The glut of nonsense paranormal documentaries on the supposedly fact-based channels is far more offensive to my skeptical sensibilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other day we watched one on the Discovery Channel on spontaneous human combustion, which the cool kids apparently call SHC. It was, in a word, ridiculous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, let's start with their "expert" on SHC, a guy called Larry Arnold. I recognized him from the last show I watched on spontaneous combustion years ago, which was on the History channel (probably around Halloween). I remember thinking, at the time, "Wow. No matter how expensive his suit is, he still looks like a wingnut." This new show has done nothing to dispel me of that notion. I submit, as evidence, the following photo of Mr. Arnold, to whom I shall henceforth refer as "Chuckles."&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SQq21Fy4vKI/AAAAAAAAAf8/zWFFajoXhi8/s1600-h/Larry+Anrold.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:228px;height:320px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SQq21Fy4vKI/AAAAAAAAAf8/zWFFajoXhi8/s400/Larry+Anrold.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chuckles here is apparently the world's leading "expert" on SHC, which is to say that he has newspaper clippings and an intimate knowledge of the four or five famous cases of SHC, like Helen Conway (we'll get to her in a minute), and he has written books about it and made money preaching the scientifically untenable idea that people can randomly burst into flame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They also brought in another "expert," a retired fire chief who once walked in on one of the purported cases of SHC. This caused me to exclaim "I hate it when they bring in these goddamned fake experts," because I do. A fire chief is concerned with putting out fires. He is not a scientist. He is not a combustion expert. He need not necessarily even be a very smart guy. I am not belittling him or his job (though I think there's a case to be made that people who spend 95% of their time tossing a football and getting paid for it aren't all necessarily "heroes"), just pointing out that he's not an expert on fire. He's a fire chief. His expertise is not relevant. It's like asking the manager of a restaurant to host a cooking show; sure, he &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; know something about cooking, but he isn't a chef. He works at Applebee's.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whenever the fire chief was interviewed, the show was an extended appeal to ignorance; he couldn't understand how a body could burn like that (his case was a reclining body that burned to ash but left both legs and part of one arm untouched), so he was inclined to give credence to Chuckles' "theories."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When they were interviewing Chuckles, however, any semblance of sense went right out the window. For Chuckles, it was part appeal to ignorance, and part complete loonery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See, Chuckles has explained the "mystery" of SHC by positing (I shit you not) a &lt;i&gt;new subatomic particle&lt;/i&gt; (hence the title of the post). He calls it the "pyrotron." According to Chuckles, the pyrotron exists in the bodies of all humans. When a couple of pyrotrons collide, they set off, and I quote, "A personal Hiroshima."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So Chuckles, whose only claim to fame is that he's read, over and over again, purported cases of SHC, thinks he can posit the existence of a new subatomic particle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then, as I said during the show, "At least it's testable..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, that doesn't make it in the least bit plausible. It's a completely ridiculous idea, a far more fanciful explanation than the "phenomenon" requires. The show talked a great deal about the "wick effect," wherein the fat on the body exacerbated the combustion, kind of like a grease fire, and rocketed up the temperature. Joe Nickell, the Southern Gentleman Skeptic, talked about that in his bits, and I was glad that they seemed to give him more than the usual "token skeptic" airtime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, Chuckles would claim that the wick effect doesn't work because, remember, this human combustion was &lt;i&gt;spontaneous&lt;/i&gt;. Except it wasn't; Nickell pointed out that in each of these cases, the victim was either old, on meds, or both, and was smoking (or very likely could have been smoking).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Helen Conway was certainly smoking at the time of death; in fact, the reason nobody was around the put out the fire was that she was about to run out of smokes and so she sent her daughter out to get her a new pack. When her daughter got back (supposedly only twenty or so minutes later), her mother was a pile of ashes in her chair, except for her legs which were untouched.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of Chuckles' worst traits is that he takes all eyewitness testimony at face value, trait shared by many a consummate woo. He more than once said stuff like "If you doubt [such and such a story], then you're calling that person a liar." This was his reaction when questioned about the validity of Daughter Conway's twenty minute trip to the store.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;False dichotomy much? No, I am not. Not necessarily. I could very well be calling the person mistaken. Humans make lots of mistakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what if I was calling the person a liar? So what? That it might impugn someone's honor doesn't mean it is not a true statement. Chuckles clearly thought it was more important to believe people because the alternate is mean than to question them in a search for the truth. Sorry, but personal honor has no place in science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I find it far more likely that Daughter Conway was mistaken about the amount of time she was gone or that she was lying so as not to appear negligent when her mother burned to death than that her mother poofed into ash and limbs in twenty minutes. But, as the pyrotron clearly shows us, Chuckles has no respect for parsimony.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, SHC folks like Chuckles love to say "But nothing else in the room burned!" and this is always a lie. Helen Conway's chair was very well roasted. In one of the cases, the narrator would say something like "But how does this explain why nothing else in the room was burned?" while the camera panned across a picture of ashes and limbs and a &lt;i&gt;melted television&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What strikes me as interesting about the "But nothing else burned!" claim is how irrelevant it is in the grand scheme of things. Fires happen all around the world on a daily basis, and the vast, vast majority of them are regular old textbook fires: something catches, shit lights up, people either escape or die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some infinitesimal fraction of them ends with a pile of ash and limbs and is called spontaneous human combustion, and one lone wingnut with a truly righteous Kenny Loggins mullet decides that it is such an important anomaly that he must invent a new subatomic particle and dedicate his life to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But isn't that really just a statistical outlier? A probable improbability? With the sheer number of fires that happen year in and year out, some of them are bound to be kind of weird. A handful of them involve people burning very thoroughly over part of their bodies while their limbs remain and their house doesn't go up. So what? Yeah, it's odd, but does it require a new subatomic particle, or just a basic understanding of probability?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the house goes up after a person catches fire, Chuckles doesn't consider it SHC. Why not? Is the pyrotron incapable of igniting the rest of the house? How many people burned to ashes inside houses that &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; burn down around them? Those don't count, though, because Chuckles has restricted himself to a very narrow definition of his phenomenon of choice. If the house burns, too, it isn't SHC. If some of the things around the victim burn, it is SHC and we'll pretend that they didn't. He's essentially created a phenomenon by fiat by ignoring other cases where he might find pyrotron potential.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What all this really means, of course, is that Chuckles is full of shit. And the show, to its defense, pretty well spelled that out. Not only did Nickell hold his own (he called Chuckles out for shifting the burden of proof), they spent the last quarter of the show with a forensic anthropologist and combustion expert who has burned dozens of reclining corpses and they &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; looked like the victims of SHC: untouched limbs surrounding a pile of ash and bone shards. The limbs tend not to burn because they have much less body fat than the torso. They also did an experiment where they burned a dead pig in a room, and most of the rest of the room did not catch fire; when the pig had burnt itself out, only the things close to him had been singed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So Chuckles is, as I said, full of shit. His dumbass-sounding new particle is completely unnecessary to explain his phenomenon; it just takes a source of ignition (cigarettes do burn, after all), a comatose person (old people on sleeping pills tend to go comatose), a length of time, and a little luck. Creepy, yes, but nothing really weird or unnatural about it. Perfectly explicable with a little real scientific investigation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toward the end, the fire chief, who showed that he was actually a smart guy, was shown the results of the burn studies and had his mind changed. He filled the hole in his knowledge with some science, and came to a new conclusion. That's good stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But they ended the show by giving Chuckles the last word, and it was a doozy. "Maybe someday, in the next century," he said (or something very like it; I'm paraphrasing here), "somebody will explain SHC. Until then, it will remain a mystery."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ah, yet another consummate woo trait: pretending there are mysteries where there are none. What's even worse about this trait is that the woos who use it have &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; "solved" the mystery in their own minds, and yet they still refer to the "mystery" that needs "more investigation." He said that the pyrotron causes SHC; didn't he just solve it? So why does he still call it a mystery? He's not even intelligible on his own terms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But worse than that is Chuckles flat-out denial of any explanation that isn't his own. That bodies just sometimes burn that way isn't flashy enough for him. It's too boring, and besides that, he didn't come up with it. It can't be right because his subjective view of the phenomenon is that it is totally weird, therefore it must have a totally weird explanation; he fails to recognize that his opinion of X as "weird" has nothing to do with X and everything to do with him, and this leads him to reject explanations that he doesn't view as "weird" enough to go with the "weird" phenomenon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry, Chuckles, but you lose. And you're an idiot. And you need a haircut.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spontaneous Human Combustion? Honestly? Are you only clinging to this out of self-pride after all these years? Because it's really, &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; goddamned silly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225434549062"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6c984dc82e76883c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Calls from Beyond</title><published>2008-10-31T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2008-10-31T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/horrors/ghosts/deadcall.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">A man's cell phone placed calls to his loved ones after his demise.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225433204691"><id gr:original-id="tag:typepad.com,2003:post-57808485">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/32f168bdcc1399dc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Paranormal and New Age" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Stop Sylvia Browne" scheme="http://sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><title type="html">Stop Sylvia Browne Stopped</title><published>2008-10-31T05:13:20Z</published><updated>2008-11-23T04:58:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/10/stop-sylvia-browne-stopped.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/10/stop-sylvia-browne-stopped.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" xml:lang="en-US" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stop Sylvia Browne website appears to have been taken over by someone selling psychic services. For now, no one is sure exactly how this happened, except that it is possible the domain registration expired (expiry date was August 21), and so the registrar (Go Daddy) put the domain up for auction. For example, see the &lt;a href="http://www.digiproxy.org/?__new_url=aHR0cHM6Ly9hdWN0aW9ucy5nb2RhZGR5LmNvbS90cnBJdGVtTGlzdGluZy5hc3B4P21paWQ9MTY2MzgwMDU="&gt;stopsylviabrowne.com auction&lt;/a&gt; page, and &lt;a href="http://help.godaddy.com/topic/613/article/608"&gt;Go Daddy’s policy&lt;/a&gt; for handling domains that are not renewed: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the 25th day following your domain registration&amp;#39;s expiration date, we place your domain for auction on the Domain Name Aftermarket (TDNAM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e2010535cc7ac2970c-pi" style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Go Daddy Auctions" border="0" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e2010535cc7ac2970c-800wi" title="Go Daddy Auctions"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 That would make the auction start date September 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. The close date would therefore appear to be ten days later.  Admittedly though, things are a little unclear. Anyway, it seems likely someone took advantage of Rob Lancaster’s current serious illness to take over his site.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a great shame. Some skeptics are working with Go Daddy to try to get the domain back (read the discussion over on &lt;a href="http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=127491"&gt;JREF&lt;/a&gt;), but it doesn’t look good. Clearly, Robert would be able to restart the site with another domain name, when he gets well (the website data will not have been lost). But until then I’m removing the link to the site. More importantly, I think we all would wish Robert a speedy recovery from his illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 1, 2008 - Edited to add:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; Stop Sylvia site has been reborn at a new location - click &lt;a href="http://stopsylvia.com/"&gt;Sylvia Browne &lt;/a&gt;to see the new site with all the old good stuff.  All skeptical bloggers and owners of skeptical websites are being asked to change their links to the new url.

I half expect the heavens to open and reveal the Second Coming. What could provoke such incredulity in me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WorldNetDaily has published an article that is &lt;a href="http://worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;amp;pageId=79420"&gt;science-based and makes sense&lt;/a&gt;. A sample:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Much more disturbingly, McCarthy attacked Peet for daring to disagree with her. "She has a lot of [nerve] to come forward and be on that side," Fox quoted [Jenny] McCarthy as saying, "because there is an angry mob on my side, and I like the fact that I can say she's completely wrong."

&lt;p&gt;McCarthy delights in the fact that the force of her opinion comes, not from copious amounts of research, not from firm and reproducible medical and technological evidence, and not even from reasonable and logical speculation, but from legions of irrational and rabidly superstitious parents who simply know that they're right, regardless of what may be true. Question them, and they will shout you down, insult you and condemn you ... all because you dared to oppose their ridiculous and dangerous campaign on the grounds that medical science proves exactly the opposite of what they claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See what I mean? This is even more startling a development than if Sarah Palin suddenly had a moment of revelation and realized that she's utterly unqualified to be President or Vice President. Or maybe Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com suddenly realizing that he's been supporting quackery all these years and suddenly endorsing &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/"&gt;Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, when WorldNetDaily starts making far more sense than you do, you've got a problem. Too bad J. B. Handley, Jenny McCarthy, and their merry band of antivaccinationists are too dense ever to realize that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/is_the_earth_still_circling_the_sun.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/437686100" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225431987265"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/a_pox_on_them_all.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a18da68ebf009ad4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">A pox on them all</title><published>2008-10-31T06:06:59Z</published><updated>2008-10-31T06:06:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/437709463/a_pox_on_them_all.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/a_pox_on_them_all.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; regret ever recommending Kay Hagan. That race has taken a turn from a  vivid example of anti-atheist bigotry on Dole's side, to one where all sides are taking turns bashing the godless to wash off the taint of association with us subhumans with no faith. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2008/10/my_godless_money_take_it_or_le.php"&gt;Greg Laden has a couple of examples of the way the media is sliming us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kay Hagan herself has a counter-ad that closes with an admonition against "making false witness against fellow Christians". Well, gosh, that's mighty white of her. Wouldn't it have been enough to leave off those last three words? Or was that the really important clause?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there's this &lt;i&gt;awful&lt;/i&gt; chatter between Wolf Blitzer, Donna Brazile, and Bill Bennett…I guess there were no atheists in the neighborhood to sit on the panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blitzers starts by asking if Hagan made "a mistake going to that fundraiser at the home of a woman who professes that there is no god?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donna Brazile answers that it's OK to do that because "that's how you convert 'em", while claiming that there is strong evidence for god. Wrong, Donna. The way you could convert us is by actually presenting that evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he asks Sinful Bill (why is he still appearing on these shows, anyway?), "Is it a problem to associate with atheists?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bennett has to wonder, &amp;quot;god knows why people have fundraisers with people like this&amp;quot;…and then says that yes, it is a problem, because it&amp;#39;s just like the association game (with terrorists!) that has tagged Barack Obama. Right. Accusing people of associating with atheists is just like accusing them of hanging out with terrorists, because, after all, Ellen Johnson is quite capable of ripping a man&amp;#39;s throat out with her teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come on, Blitzer — is this how you analyze the news now, by putting a couple of god-walloping morons on the stage and asking them to echo their prejudices?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/a_pox_on_them_all.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/437709463" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225422712401"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/30/ten-things-you-dont-know-about-black-holes/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/89d5f91c54c746b9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="DeathfromtheSkies!"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Ten things you don’t know about black holes</title><published>2008-10-31T02:48:35Z</published><updated>2008-10-31T02:48:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/30/ten-things-you-dont-know-about-black-holes/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well, they’re black, and they’re like bottomless holes.

&lt;p&gt;Ah, black holes. The ultimate shiver-inducer of the cosmos, out-jawing sharks, out-ooking spiders, out-scaring… um, something scary. But we’re fascinated by ‘em, have no doubt — even if we don’t understand a whole lot about them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/2988079124/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2247/2988079124_e5e7c5beee_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, that’s why I’m here. Allow me to be your tour guide to infinity. Or the inverse of it, I suppose. Since it’s Halloween this seems appropriate… and my book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Skies-These-Ways-World/dp/0670019976/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220913560&amp;amp;sr=8-8/badastronomy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; just came out, and there’s &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of ways a black hole can destroy the Earth. Mwuhahahaha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So below I present ten facts about black holes — the third in my series of Ten Things You Don’t Know (the first was on &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/03/12/ten-things-you-dont-know-about-the-milky-way-galaxy/"&gt;the Milky Way&lt;/a&gt;; the second about &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/09/08/ten-things-you-dont-know-about-the-earth/"&gt;the Earth&lt;/a&gt;). Regular readers will know a few of these since I’ve talked about them before, but I’m hoping you don’t know all of these. And if you do, then feel free to leave a comment preening about your superior intellect. Mind you, this list is nowhere near complete: I could have picked probably 50 things that are weird about black holes. But I like these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="50%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) It’s not their mass, it’s their size that makes them so strong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, first, a really quick primer on black holes. Bear with me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common way for a black hole to form is in the core of a massive star. The core runs out of fuel, and collapses. This sets off a shockwave, blowing up outer layers of the star, causing a supernova. So the star’s heart collapses while the rest of it explodes outwards (this is the Cliff’s notes version; for more details on the process — which is way cool, so you should read it — &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bitesize/sn87a_explosion.html"&gt;check out my description of it&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the core collapses, its gravity increases. At some point, if the core is massive enough (about 3 times the mass of the Sun), the gravity gets so strong that right at the surface of the collapsing core the escape velocity increases to the speed of light. That means that nothing can escape the gravity of this object, not even light. So it’s black. And since nothing can escape, well, read the quotation at the top of the page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The region around the black hole itself where the escape velocity equals the speed of light is called the &lt;em&gt;event horizon&lt;/em&gt;. Any event that happens inside it is forever invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so now you know what one is, and how they form. Now, I could explain why they have such strong gravity, but you know what? &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/07/22/why-do-black-holes-have-such-strong-gravity/"&gt;I’d rather let this guy do it&lt;/a&gt;. I hear he’s good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/l2VcJy8dPUM%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you go. Sure, the mass is important, but sometimes it’s the little things that count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="50%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) They’re not infinitely small.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So OK, they’re small, but how small are they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was writing about black holes in my previous job, and we got in a fun discussion over just what we meant by black hole: did we mean the object itself that collapses down to a mathematical point, or the event horizon surrounding it? I said the event horizon, but my boss said it was the object. I decided she had a point (HAHAHAHAHA! A &amp;quot;point&amp;quot;! Man, I kill me), and made sure that when I wrote about the event horizon versus the black hole itself I was making myself clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said above, to the collapsing core, its clock keeps ticking, so it sees itself collapsing all the way down to a point, even if the event horizon has some finite size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens to the core? The actual mass that collapsed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out here, we’ll never know for sure. We can’t see in, and it sure enough isn’t gonna send any info &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt;. But our math in these situations is pretty good, and we can at least apply them to the collapsing core, even when it’s smaller than the event horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will continue to collapse, and the gravity increases. Smaller, smaller… and when I was a kid I always read that it collapses all the way down to a geometric dot, an object with no dimensions at all. That really bugged me, as you can imagine… as well it should. Because it’s wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, the collapsing core will be smaller than an atom, smaller than a nucleus, smaller than an electron.  It’ll eventually reach a size called the &lt;em&gt;Planck Length&lt;/em&gt;, a unit so small that quantum mechanics rules it with an iron fist. A &lt;a href="http://www.physlink.com/Education/AskExperts/ae644.cfm"&gt;Planck Length&lt;/a&gt; is a kind of quantum size limit: if an object gets smaller than this, we literally cannot know much about it with any certainty. The actual physics is complicated, but pretty much when the collapsing core hits this size, even if we could somehow pierce the event horizon, we couldn’t measure its real size. In fact, the term &amp;quot;real size&amp;quot; doesn’t really mean anything at this kind of scale. If the Universe itself prevents you from measuring it, you might as well say the term has no meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how small is a Planck Length? Teeny tiny: about 10&lt;sup&gt;-35&lt;/sup&gt; meters. That’s one one-hundred quintillionth the size of a proton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if someone says a black hole has zero size, you can be all geeky and technical and say, not really, but meh. Close enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="50%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) They’re spheres. And they’re definitely not funnel shaped.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gravity you feel from an object depends on two things: the object’s mass, and your distance from that object. This means that anyone at a given distance from a massive object — say, a million kilometers — would feel the same force of gravity from it. That distance defines a sphere around an object: anyone on that sphere’s surface would feel the same gravity from the object at the center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of an event horizon of a black hole depends on the gravity, so really the event horizon is a sphere surrounding the black hole. From the outside, if you could figure out how to see the event horizon in the first place, it would look like a pitch black sphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/2988127704/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3169/2988127704_3c3bbf1963.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Some people think of black holes as being circles, or worse, funnel-shaped. The funnel thing is a misconception from people trying to explain gravity as a bending in space, and they simplify things by collapsing 3D space into 2D; they say the space is like a bed sheet, and objects with mass bend space the same way that a massive object (a bowling ball, say) will warp a bed sheet. But space is not 2D, it’s 3D (even 4D if you include time) and so this explanation can confuse people about the actual shape of a black hole event horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had kids ask me what happens if you approach a black hole from underneath! They sometimes don’t get that black holes are spheres, and there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; no underneath. I blame the funnel story. Sadly, it’s the best analogy I’ve seen, so we’re stuck with it. Use it with care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="50%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Black holes spin!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s kind of an odd thought, but black holes can spin. Stars rotate, and when the core collapses the rotation speeds way, way up (the usual analogy is that of an ice skater who brings in his arms, increasing his rotation rate). As the core of the star gets smaller it rotates more rapidly. If it doesn’t quite have enough mass to become a black hole, the matter gets squeezed together to form a neutron star, a ball of neutrons a few kilometers across. We have detected hundreds of these objects, and they tend to spin very rapidly, sometimes hundreds of times a second! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true for a black hole. Even as the matter shrinks down smaller than the event horizon and is lost to the outside Universe forever, the matter is still spinning. It’s not entirely clear what this means if you’re trying to calculate what happens to the matter once it’s inside the event horizon. Does centrifugal force keep it from collapsing all the way down to the Planck length? The math is fiendish, but do-able, and implies that matter falling in will hit matter inside the event horizon trying to fall further but unable to due to rotation, This causes a massive pile up and some pretty spectacular fireworks… that we’ll never see, because its on the other side of infinity. Bummer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="50%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Near a black hole, things get weird&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spin of the black hole throws a monkey in the wrench of the event horizon. Black holes distort the fabric of space itself, and if they spin that distortion itself gets distorted. Space can get wrapped around a black hole — kind of like the fabric of a sheet getting caught up in a rotating drill bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a region of space outside the event horizon called the &lt;em&gt;ergosphere&lt;/em&gt;. It’s an oblate spheroid, a flattened ball shape, and if you’re outside the event horizon but inside the &lt;a href="http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/ergosphere.html"&gt;ergosphere&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll find you can’t sit still. Literally. Space is being dragged past you, and carries you along with it. You can easily move in the direction of the rotation of the black hole, but if you try to hover, you can’t. In fact, inside the ergosphere space is moving faster than light! Matter cannot move that fast, but it turns out, according to Einstein, space itself can. So if you want to hover over a black hole, you’d have to move faster than light in the direction opposite the spin. You can’t do that, so you have to move with the spin, fly away, or fall in. Those are your choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest flying away. &lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt;. Because…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="50%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Approaching a black hole can kill you in fun ways. And by fun, I mean gruesome, horrifying, and really really ookie.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, if you get too close, plop! You fall in. But even if you keep your distance you’re still in trouble…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/2988079060/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3221/2988079060_e85cb29118.jpg" alt="Black hole, down the drain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gravity depends on distance. The farther you are from an object, the weaker its gravity. So if you have a long object near a massive one, the long object will feel a stronger gravitational force on the near end versus a weaker force on the far end! This change in gravity over distance is called the tidal force (which is a bit of a misnomer, it’s not really a force, it’s a &lt;em&gt;differential&lt;/em&gt; force, and yes, &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/tides.html"&gt;it’s related to why we have ocean tides on Earth from the Moon&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, black holes can be small — a BH with a mass of about three times the Sun has an event horizon just a few kilometers across — and that means you can get close to them. And that in turn means that the tidal force you feel from one can get distressingly big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="left"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/2822918943/in/set-72157607041453990/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3060/2822918943_e5fde9aa1a_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praying to this guy won’t help.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you fall feet first into a stellar-mass BH. It turns out that as you approach, the difference in gravity between your head and your feet can get huge. &lt;em&gt;HUGE&lt;/em&gt;. The force can be so strong that your feet get yanked away from your head with &lt;em&gt;hundreds of millions&lt;/em&gt; of times the force of Earth’s gravity. You’d be stretched into a long, thin strand and then shredded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomers call this &lt;em&gt;spaghettification&lt;/em&gt;. Ewwww.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So getting near a black hole is dangerous even if you don’t fall in. Evidently, there really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a tide in the affairs of men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="50%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Black holes aren’t always dark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, black holes can kill from a long way off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/2988248792/sizes/o/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3001/2988248792_eaffd2054f_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disk of DOOOOOM!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image credit: NASA/CXC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matter falling into a black hole would rarely if ever just fall straight in and disappear. If it has a little bit of sideways motion it’ll go &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; the black hole. As more matter falls in, all this junk can pile up around the hole. Because of the way rotating objects behave, this matter will create a disk of material whirling madly around the hole, and because the gravity of the hole changes so rapidly with distance, matter close in will be orbiting much faster than stuff farther out. This matter literally rubs together, generating heat through friction. This stuff can get really hot, like millions of degrees hot. Matter that hot glows with intense brightness… which means that near the black hole, this matter can be seriously luminous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, magnetic and other forces can focus two beams of energy that go plowing out of the poles of the disk. The beams start just outside the black hole, but can be seen for millions or even billions of light years distant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re &lt;em&gt;bright&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, black holes that are eating matter in this way can glow so brightly &lt;em&gt;that they become the brightest continuously-emitting objects in the Universe!&lt;/em&gt; We call these &lt;em&gt;active&lt;/em&gt; black holes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as if black holes aren’t dangerous enough, the matter gets so hot right before it makes the final plunge that it can furiously emit X-rays, high-energy forms of light (and the beams can emit even higher energy light than that). So even if you park your spaceship well outside the event horizon of a black hole, if something else falls in and gets shredded, you get rewarded by being fried by the equivalent of a gazillion dental exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may have mentioned this: black holes are dangerous. Best to stay away from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="50%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8) Black holes aren’t &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; dangerous.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="left"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/2988290776/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3243/2988290776_de47459fbf.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m right there with you, dude.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, let me ask you a question: if I were to take the Sun and replace it with &lt;del&gt;Folgers crystals&lt;/del&gt; a black hole of the exact same mass, what would happen? Would the Earth fall in, be flung away, or just orbit like it always does?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people think the Earth would fall in, sucked inexorably down by the black hole’s powerful gravity. But remember, the gravity you feel from an object depends on the mass of the object and your distance from it. I said the black hole has the same mass as the Sun, remember? And the Earth’s distance hasn’t changed. So the gravity we’d feel from here, 150 million kilometers away, would be exactly the same! So the Earth would orbit the solar black hole just as nicely as it orbits the Sun now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we’d freeze to death. You can’t have everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="50%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9) Black holes can get big.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: What happens if two stellar-mass black holes collide? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: You get one bigger black hole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can extrapolate from there. Black holes can eat other objects, including other black holes, so they can grow. We think that early on in the Universe, when galaxies were just forming, matter collecting in the center of the nascent galaxy can collapse to form a very massive black hole. As more matter falls in, the hole greedily consumes it, and grows. Eventually you get a supermassive black hole, one with millions or even billions of times the mass of the Sun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, remember that as matter falls in it can get hot. It can be so hot that the pressure from light itself can blow off material that’s farther out, a bit like the solar wind but on a much grander scale. The strength of the wind depends on many things, including the mass of the black hole; the heftier the hole, the windier the, uh, wind. This wind prevents more matter from falling in, so it acts like a cutoff valve for the ever-increasingly girthy hole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but over time the gas and dust around the black hole (well, pretty far out, but still near the center of the galaxy) gets turned into stars. Gas can fall into a black hole more easily than stars (if gas clouds collide head-on their motion relative to the black hole can stop, allowing them to fall in; stars are too small and too far apart for this to happen). So eventually the black hole stops consuming matter because nothing more is falling into it. It stops growing, the galaxy becomes stable, and everyone is happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/2987460775/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3021/2987460775_a7937f52de.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t panic!&lt;br&gt;OK, maybe a little.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, when we look into the Universe today, we see that pretty much every large galaxy has a supermassive black hole in its heart. Even the Milky Way has a black hole at its core with a mass of &lt;em&gt;four millions times&lt;/em&gt; that of the Sun. Before you start running around in circles and screaming, remember this: 1) it’s a long way off, 26,000 light years (260 &lt;em&gt;quadrillion&lt;/em&gt; kilometers), 2) its mass is still very small compared to the 200 billion solar masses of our galaxy, and therefore 3) it can’t really harm us. Unless it starts actively feeding. Which it isn’t. But it might start sometime, if something falls into it. Though we don’t know of anything that can fall into it soon. But we might miss cold gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, remember this as well: even though black holes can cause death and destruction on a major scale, they also help galaxies themselves form! &lt;em&gt;So we owe our existence to them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="50%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10) Black holes can be low density. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the weirdnesses about black holes, this one is the weirdest to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, the event horizon of a black hole gets bigger as the mass gets bigger. That’s because if you add mass, the gravity gets stronger, which means the event horizon will grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do the math carefully, you find that the event horizon grows linearly with the mass. In other words, if you double the black hole’s mass, the event horizon radius doubles as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s weird! Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume of a sphere depends on the cube of the radius (think way back to high school: volume = 4/3 x π x radius&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Double the radius, and the volume goes up by 2 x  2 x 2 = 8 times. Make the radius of a sphere 10 times bigger and the volume goes up by a factor of 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So volume goes up really quickly as you increase the size of a sphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine you have two spheres of clay that are the same size. Lump them together. Is the resulting sphere twice as big?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No! You’ve doubled the mass, but the radius only increases a little bit. Because volume goes as radius &lt;em&gt;cubed&lt;/em&gt;, to double the radius of your final clay ball, you’d need to lump together &lt;strong&gt;eight&lt;/strong&gt; of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But that’s different than a black hole&lt;/em&gt;. Double the mass, double the size of the event horizon. That has an odd implication…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Density is how much mass is packed into a given volume. Keep the size the same and add mass, and the density goes up. Increase the volume, but keep the mass the same, and the density goes down. Got it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now let’s look at the average density of matter inside the event horizon of the black hole. If I take two identical black holes and collide them, the event horizon size doubles, and the mass doubles too. But volume has gone up by eight times! So the density actually &lt;em&gt;decreases&lt;/em&gt;, and is 1/4 what I started with (twice the mass and eight times the volume gives you 1/4 the density). Keep doing that, and the density decreases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A regular black hole — that is, one with three times the Sun’s mass — with have an event horizon radius of about 9 km. That means it has a huge density, about two quadrillion grams per cubic cm (2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;). But double the mass, and the density drops by a factor of four. Put in 10 times the mass and the density drops by a factor of 100. A billion solar mass black hole (big, but we see them this big in galaxy centers) would drop that density by a factor of 1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;. That would give it a density of roughly 1/1000 of a gram per cc… and that’s the density of air!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A billion solar mass black hole would have an event horizon 3 billion km in radius — roughly the distance of Neptune to the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See where I’m going here? If you were to rope off the solar system out past Neptune, enclose it in a giant sphere, and fill it with air, &lt;em&gt;it would be a black hole!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, to me, is by far the oddest thing about black holes. Sure, they warp space, distort time, play with our sense of what’s real and isn’t… but when they touch on the everyday and screw with that, well, &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; what gets me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first thought of this at a black hole conference at Stanford a few years back. I was walking with noted black hole expert &lt;a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/physics/people/faculty/blandford_roger.html"&gt;Roger Blandford&lt;/a&gt; when it hit me. I did a quick mental calculation to make sure I had the numbers right, and related to Roger that a solar system full of air would be a black hole. He thought about it for a moment and said, &amp;quot;Yes, that sounds about right.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, me droogs, was one of the coolest moments of my hole life. But thinking about it still makes my brain hurt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="50%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, what can I say? Black holes are weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it so happens, there was a lot more that could be said about them, of course. What about wormholes? What about how they form? what about Hawking radiation? Can black holes totally evaporate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find answers to these and other questions elsewhere on the web (and even on this very blog); I couldn’t cover everything in just ten sections! But I’ll note (shocker) that chapter 5 of my book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Skies-These-Ways-World/dp/0670019976/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220913560&amp;amp;sr=8-8/badastronomy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; talks in detail about how they form, and what they can do if you get too close to them. Later chapters also talk about the black hole in the core of the Milky Way, and what will happen to black holes a long time from now… literally, 10&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;, 10&lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt;, even a googol years from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even then, that’s not the scariest thing about black holes. I almost didn’t put this in the post, it’s so over the top mind-numbingly horrifying. But I’m a scientist, and we’re skeptics here, so we can take it. So I present to you, the worst thing about black holes of all:&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s nice to know that bullying thugs are monitoring Pharyngula to seek out more fragile targets, but it&amp;#39;s not good to see that they sometimes actually succeed in getting people suspended. We all have to hang in there and be tough, and support our fellow godless rationalists against the sleazy weasels who want to silence our voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, she's back now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weeks before the 2004 election I went shopping for a magnet with a photo of Dubya Bush that says: “I admit it. I am not one of the great linguists.” &lt;a href="http://gamesofberkeley.com/"&gt;Games of Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; had sold out, so I inquired if the item would be re-ordered. “No. The election’s on soon and Bush could be voted out of office.” I chuckled outwardly. I suspected that the voters would go with the devil they knew, and yes, I was soon back at the store, where the sales assistant agreed to order more, and it now sits proudly on my fridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, many Berkeleyites are nauseatingly political. I’ve frequently wanted to gnaw off my own ears to escape an eye-bleedingly dull tirade that all too often ends with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you actually vote?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, no…but…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; presume to tell you who to vote for. (Frankly, both are religious nuts and I don’t like the peddling of beliefs to obtain votes, although I understand the strategy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/unclesam.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="unclesam" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/unclesam.jpg?w=69&amp;amp;h=96" alt="" width="69" height="96"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; presume to tell you to vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a different electoral system in Australia. Yes, we have a two party system of &lt;strong&gt;Labor&lt;/strong&gt; versus &lt;strong&gt;Liberal&lt;/strong&gt; (the latter in a coalition with the &lt;strong&gt;National Party&lt;/strong&gt;), with a whole bunch of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Australia"&gt;ne’er-do-well parties&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooters_Party"&gt;Australian Shooters Party&lt;/a&gt;, racist fish ‘n’ chip queen Pauline Hanson’s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline%27s_United_Australia_Party"&gt;Pauline’s United Australia Party&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.cdp.org.au/"&gt;Christian Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; with the homophobic &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Nile"&gt;Fred Niles&lt;/a&gt; at the helm (but now with my friend &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/contact/nsw.htm"&gt;Ian Bryce’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.secular.org.au/index.php"&gt;Secular Party of Australia&lt;/a&gt; as opposition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major difference is that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; over the age of 18 votes. We only register once, then voting is obligatory. If you neglect to vote, a nominal fine of some $50 is imposed. Expatriates, travelers and the newly deceased are excused.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But that’s undemocratic!” you cry aghast, in the same voice that claims a law against smoking in a restaurant or talking on your cell while you drive violates your perceived rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, rights, as ethical as they may be, are but a social construct. Similarly, your right to vote is a socio-legal one, not an inherent one. Voting has never been a right, but is a privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/suffragette.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="suffragette" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/suffragette.jpg?w=72&amp;amp;h=96" alt="" width="72" height="96"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The global suffragette movements of history are evidence of this. Those progressive New &lt;a href="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/suffragette21.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="suffragette21" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/suffragette21.jpg?w=62&amp;amp;h=96" alt="" width="62" height="96"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Zealanders were the first to ‘give’ women the vote back in 1893. Australia didn’t do too badly, with state laws leading to women having the vote nationally in 1901 (the same year we had &lt;a href="http://www.australia.gov.au/Australia&amp;#39;s_Federation"&gt;Federation&lt;/a&gt;). Suffrage was slow and state-driven in the US, leading to national suffrage in 1920.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disenfranchisement is still too close for comfort historically. Sometimes, even closer than we think. In the Vatican City women aren’t allowed to vote on papel matters (not to mention the myriad of other discrimination that takes place in most religious institutions). South Africa granted the vote to black women in 1994. Kuwait granted women the vote in 2005. The United Arab Emirates promises that voting will become a legal right around 2010. In Saudi Arabia, women are not entitled to vote. In the Sultanate of Brunei, no one can vote at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/peasants.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="peasants" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/peasants.jpg?w=128&amp;amp;h=85" alt="" width="128" height="85"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Don’t think that the right to vote has only ever been deprived of chicks or stigmatized ethnic groups. Our modern-day government system evolved from feudalism, where &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; were a bedraggled, toothless peasant, and invariably, &lt;strong&gt;someone else&lt;/strong&gt; was your landlord, with your vote. Attributed to &lt;a href="http://dawodu.com/aluko135.htm"&gt;Morgens Jallberg&lt;/a&gt; is the quote: ”In democracy it’s your vote that counts. In feudalism, it’s your Count that votes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hard-won right is a privilege that some external group has granted to you. Freedom, liberty, rights, are always granted, never inherent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/voteelvis.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="voteforelvis" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/voteelvis.jpg?w=64&amp;amp;h=96" alt="" width="64" height="96"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The broader truth is, on any day, any country could be invaded, and the people and government subjugated into a totalitatian state. On a more local level, your city could become a state of emergency, a junta state, and some of your perceived ‘rights’ stripped from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This won’t happen to me in Shitsville, USA!” you warble. Is it probable? No. Is it possible? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, enjoy your freedom, your liberties, your civil rights; not god-given, but government-given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/votedummy.gif"&gt;&lt;img title="votedummy" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/votedummy.gif?w=75&amp;amp;h=96" alt="" width="75" height="96"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Your government controls you to some extent, so how can you ever control the government?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By voting…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democracy depends on participation, and every single vote counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By a single vote, &lt;strong&gt;Hitler&lt;/strong&gt; became the leader of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_German_Workers_Party"&gt;German National Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; in 1923. But, enough first year history and political science…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your vote, and use it with skepticism. But if you don’t vote, don’t tell me what you think, because you don’t really care, so I really don’t care, and your opinion isn’t being shared in any way that matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like a prayer that hopes, wants, or thinks, but doesn’t do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of us, least of all the electoral office, are mind readers…&lt;/p&gt;

We are also accused of turning away from therapies that "couldn't hurt".  After all, if someone wants to use aromatherapy, what's the harm?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that improbable medical claims are dangerous, and not just for the obvious reasons (i.e. dangerous practices such as chelation therapy).  They also turn people away from real therapy.  I've previously introduced you to the concept that there is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/04/there_is_no_such_thing_as_alte.php"&gt;no such thing as "alternative medicine"&lt;/a&gt;. When the Chinese herb &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisinin"&gt;artemisin&lt;/a&gt; was found to cure malaria and became widely used by modern doctors, it became by definition not alternative.  If something "altie" like massage makes someone feel better, it's neither altie nor "mainstream"---it's just nice; go and do it.  Yoga probably falls into the latter category, of a practice that may give comfort to some people, but is unlikely to affect objective measures of health and disease.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As reported (quite well) by &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/nyregion/30yoga.html"&gt;the Times&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A foundation run by Donna Karan, creator of...the much-imitated DKNY line of clothing, has donated $850,000 for a yearlong experiment combining Eastern and Western healing methods at Beth Israel Medical Center. Instead of just letting a celebrated donor adopt a hospital wing, renovate it and have her name embossed on a plaque, the Karan-Beth Israel project will have a celebrated donor turn a hospital into a testing ground for a trendy, medically controversial notion: that yoga, meditation and aromatherapy can enhance regimens of chemotherapy and radiation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll stipulate that by "Eastern and Western healing methods" they mean credulous Americans' impression of what is done in "the East" vs. science-based medicine as it is practiced around the world (the Eastern &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; Western bits).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why invest so much in bringing relaxation techniques to the hospital? According to Beth Israel's CEO:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"While we are giving patients traditional medicine, we are not going to exclude patients' values and beliefs," said Dr. David Shulkin, the chief executive of Beth Israel, noting that a third of Americans seek alternative treatments. "To make care accessible to these third of Americans, we're trying to embrace care that makes them more comfortable."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is 15% of cancer patients were seeking euthanasia? What if they wanted methamphetamine?  Should we integrate these practices into our modern cancer centers? I suspect the motives are both financial and compassionate, but the compassion is misguided.  Providing cancer patients undergoing treatments with relaxation techniques, treatment of pain and anxiety, spiritual care, and other comforts is hardly alternative.  To claim that they help people with cancer get better is the big leap.  (And let's set aside the possibility that an "Eastern" outfitted cancer center may not groove with everyone's sense of spirituality).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of Ms. Karan's stated goals are worthy:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidence? Subliminal advertising? Neither! &lt;a href="http://bread-and-honey.blogspot.com/2008/10/wtf-broccoli-part-deuce.html"&gt;In a followup post&lt;/a&gt;, Bread and Honey found out it’s a tribute the company makes to people who work there. I think that’s terrific, funny, and pretty cool. Frozen, even. But head on over there to see more of the facial trickery they did. It’s all pretty nifty. And it’s good for you.&lt;/p&gt;

There is considerable variation in usage on many points, and astonishingly passionate opinion about some of these points, even when they are mind-numbingly inconsequential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case in point: the use of periods in abbreviations composed of initial letters: I.B.M. or IBM? U.C.L.A. or UCLA? F.B.I. or FBI? Style guides vary, from those that are fond of periods (because the periods clearly mark the words as abbreviations and indicate where material has been suppressed) to those that are shy of them (because the result looks cleaner and takes up less space). Something can be said in favor of each scheme, and there is no issue of substance here. But some people have strong preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wikipedia &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation"&gt;entry&lt;/a&gt; on abbreviation surveys a variety of schemes, noting that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; is unique in having a consistent style by always abbreviating with periods: P.C. [personal computer], I.B.M., P.R. [public relations]. This is in contrast with the trend of British publications to completely make do without periods for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a few words about the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;'s practices, and about the value of consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt; tolerates abbreviations with lots of periods in them: four in U.C.L.A. and L.I.R.R. (Long Island Rail Road), five in N.A.A.C.P., six in A.F.L.-C.I.O. (against the practice of these institutions and organizations themselves, which is clean and period-free). But it's not quite true that the paper always uses periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, some abbreviations have become detached from their sources and are now seen as words on their own, and the paper prints these without periods: CD, for example, and in fact (despite the Wikipedia's claim) PC. (But the paper seems to use A.T.M. consistently.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the names of broadcast networks and television channels are period-free, whether or not people appreciate the origin of these names as abbreviations: BBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, ESPN, AMC, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, abbreviations that have been &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003555.html"&gt;"orphaned"&lt;/a&gt; — treated by the organizations in question as no longer &amp;quot;standing for&amp;quot; some longer name — are almost always period-free in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;: AARP, KFC, ACT, SAT, PSAT, etc. But the paper hasn't always gotten the news: AAA is still A.A.A. in the paper, and FFA is sometimes FFA and sometimes F.F.A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, abbreviations that are acronyms (pronounced as whole words rather than as sequences of letter names) are period-free: OPEC, NATO, FARC, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there's occasional variation. While Gross Domestic Product is almost always G.D.P. in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, Paul Krugman wrote about the GDP back on 30 April. And both N.Y.S.E. and NYSE occur, and both H.I.V. and HIV, though the versions with periods seem to predominate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably more loopholes. But in general the paper uses periods, even in headlines (where doing without them would save a little space) and even in the sports section (where some stylistic latitude is often allowed — but it&amp;#39;s N.B.A., N.H.L., and so on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a few words about the fact that the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; completely disregards the practices and preferences of named entities (institutions, organizations, associations, whatever), in favor of its house style. The American Association for the Advancement of Science calls itself the AAAS in all of its materials (the abbreviation is pronounced "triple-A S"), but it's A.A.A.S. in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is yet another conflict between Faithfulness (Faith: reproducing some original) and Well-Formedness (WF: making things conform to local customs). (I've returned to this topic on Language Log on a number of occasions, most recently &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005486.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, with links to five earlier postings.) In matters of the mechanics of writing, where the conflict is usually between different style sheets, there's a strong tendency for WF to override Faith: in citing or quotating an original (even, sometimes, the titles of books), its spelling and punctuation are "corrected" to suit the writer's preferences. As here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should WF trump Faith in this case? It comes down to Consistency. Some editors take consistency to be a bedrock virtue, a principle that should always be followed to the letter. That's hard to justify on rational grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong. There are circumstances in which consistency is genuinely important. One of the facts of life in teaching is that every field necessarily has its own set of concepts, and terminology to go along with them, and students have to learn that — even though they&amp;#39;ve been taught to vary their vocabulary and not just keep using the same words over and over again (good advice, but it has its limitations) — there&amp;#39;s very little wiggle room with technical terms. Thesaurisizing is a really bad move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other cases where you would not want to vary the form of expressions, for fear that readers or hearers would read too much into the choice of variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are also cases where the variants are just part of a big pool of variation, with different people doing different things, and if there's any way in which one variant conveys a different tinge from others, that difference is well below almost everybody's consciousness and might reasonably be treated as a random effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In which case, nobody should care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular: when there are widespread differences in punctuation or spelling, so that pretty much everyone will be exposed to variants, rigidly enforcing a choice of variants won't help readers one bit. They'll be used to confronting the variants, and they won't notice your meticulous choice of one of them. Frankly, my dear, they don't give a damn. Only readers who are fanatically attached to "rules" would notice, much less care about, my using &lt;em&gt;travelling&lt;/em&gt; (with consonant-letter doubling) at one point in my writing and &lt;em&gt;canceled&lt;/em&gt; (with no doubling) at another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no, I'm not saying that Anything Goes. I'm saying that &lt;small&gt;SOME&lt;/small&gt; distinctions are of no consequence. And, more important that it's a mistake to spend energy on such distinctions (including beating them into the heads of small children, as if they were God's word).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do understand where this disproportionate emphasis on tiny inconsequential points of writing comes from: this stuff is really easy to (attempt to) regulate, while more significant matters of grammar, style, and usage are much harder to grapple with. In addition, a lot of people think there's got to be One Right Way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four final notes.  First, on some points, some style guides will describe stylistic choices without insisting on one of them. But invariably the guides will go on to say that a writer should pick one scheme and use it consistently. In many cases, I can't see the point of this advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the schemes almost always turn out to be more complex than they appear at first. Note the exceptions and provisos in my discussion of the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;'s scheme for periods in abbreviations using initial letters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the schemes also turn out to be hard to adhere to consistently. Variation in practice will crop up, as in my examples above from the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;. Is achieving consistency worth the effort it takes to root out these variants?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, each scheme usually has something going for it (if only the weight of tradition), so that it's not possible to claim that one scheme has to be right. They're just conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I’m getting this news to you kind of late. Hopefully you all only have plans on Friday and were keeping your calendars clear just in case I might throw something together this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend, &lt;strong&gt;Elles&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/teen/"&gt;Teen Skepchick&lt;/a&gt; will be in town!  She’ll be hanging out at some of the museums, seeing the sites and taking in the awesomeness that is Chicago.  At the end of the day, you and I are going to meet up with her at Galway Arms to show her how the Chi-town Skeptics roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she’ll come talk to us about what it’s like to be 14 and have Richard Dawkins raving about your blog.&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/18346363@N03/2505193339/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2309/2505193339_81e8930683.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="252"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who:&lt;/strong&gt; You! And bring your kids, girlfriends, boyfriends, husbands, wives, moms and dads and grandparents, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/37/image/a/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/10/arp147.jpg" alt="Hubble image of Arp 147"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWESOME!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s Arp 147, a pair of interacting galaxies. Halton Arp, an astronomer, made an extensive catalog of funny-looking galaxies, most of which are due to near or direct collisions between galaxies. It looks like the one on the left glided right through the one on the right. Ring shapes are common after such encounters, though I must admit I’m a little baffled by the smooth ring with the off-kilter core of the left-hand galaxy. The odd angle of the galaxy to us — it’s almost edge-on — may be contributing to this particularly peculiar view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger galaxy is blue because the collision triggered huge amounts of star formation. That means massive stars get born, and they’re blue. They are also much, much brighter than other stars being born, so they dominate the light we see, making the whole galaxy look blue. Interesting that the smaller galaxy is not really blue as well, indicating that it had a milder star-formation burst if any. I don’t know why. I may have to dig through the literature when I have time. This is a pretty interesting pair of galaxies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hubble folks are billing this picture as a &amp;quot;Perfect 10&amp;quot;, because the galaxies kinda sorta look like a &amp;quot;10&amp;quot;. A little. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the good news is that this is from the Wide Field/Planetary Camera 2, which was shut down until a few days ago. It went offline when engineers were trying to restore Hubble back to speed after a major piece of hardware failed. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/27/hubble-on-the-road-to-recovery/"&gt;They were able to get a backup piece working&lt;/a&gt;, but other problems delayed the operation. Now, however, things are looking good, and it looks like we have a working telescope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime early next year NASA will launch a Space Shuttle mission to perform a final manned upgrade to the observatory, installing two new cameras and a bunch of hardware that will extend its life another few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me add that this has been pretty amazing. Hubble is an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; complicated piece of machinery, and it can be really fickle. The fact that it works at all is a testament to human accomplishment, and that it runs so well even after the number and scale of problems it’s had is really an incredible achievement for the engineers and scientists who have worked on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sincere and hearty congratulations go to NASA. Well done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let me add that &lt;strong&gt;the image above was taken just two days ago&lt;/strong&gt;, so my astonishment and amazement are directed at the HST imaging team, who must have drained all the coffee in Baltimore to get this done so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited to add: I just heard from my friend Lisa Frattare at Hubble: she worked on the image, along with Zolt Levay and Max Mutchler. I was right; they put in &lt;strong&gt;major&lt;/strong&gt; hours to get this image cleaned up, prettified, and published.

Specifically, I've expressed my dismay at the double standard, codified into law in 1994 in the form of the &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/02ConsumerProtection/dshea.html"&gt;DSHEA&lt;/a&gt;. This particular bit of truly awful law in essence took away the power of the FDA and FTC to regulate dietary supplements, except under certain rather narrow conditions. In essence, if a supplement manufacturer is careful to keep the claims for a supplement from being too specific, the FDA is virtually powerless to regulate the supplement because the law defines dietary supplements as "food." So, in other words, vague, meaningless claims, such as that a supplement will "boost the immune system" are hunky dory, and supplement manufacturers only get into trouble when they say things like, "This supplement can cure cancer." Worse, the FDA is overburdened and apparently doesn't consider policing these supplements, which are a multibillion dollar a year business even when their manufacturers do cross the line. Indeed, only recently, after a long period of doing little, the FDA actually &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/06/can_it_be_real_the_fda_brings_the_hammer.php"&gt;cracked down hard on some notorious quacks.&lt;/a&gt; I roundly applauded the action, but I couldn't help but ask what too the FDA so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I rail against the current law is that it places supplements in an exalted place, almost immune from regulation, despite the fact that snake-oil peddlers make the most outrageous claims for what they can do for your health. But there's an even more insidious effect of the current law. Supplements could potentially have health effects, both beneficial or detrimental. They are substances that our bodies need, but in the optimal amounts. At a conference in New York today, I was listening to a discussion about vitamin D and breast cancer (something I'll have to write more about soon), and that point was made again and again: Just because some of something is good does not mean more of it is better. In any case, we can't know what health effects various vitamins and supplements might have and at what doses if we don't do the research. Unfortunately, thanks to the lax regulation of these supplements and the dubious practitioners making all sorts of dubious claims for what they can do, vitamins and supplements as potential health modulators have undeservedly taken on the taint of quackery. They've been, in essence, "ghettoized." Instead of being studied with funding from Institutes at the NIH that do rigorous peer review, studies of the health effects of supplements have fallen under the purview of the woo-friendly National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, some good science is being done studying supplements. Unfortunately, one such trial, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), has had to be halted because the supplement &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27417113/"&gt;showed no benefit&lt;/a&gt; and showed a hint of risk:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/another_one_bites_the_dust_clinical_tria.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/another_one_bites_the_dust_clinical_tria.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/436958743" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225377624230"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2008://2.4013">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/90b0d2447fc21892</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Tangled Bank #117</title><published>2008-10-30T14:43:18Z</published><updated>2008-10-30T14:43:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/10/tangled-bank-11-6.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/tangledbank.php" title="The Tangled Bank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/tbbadge.gif" alt="The Tangled Bank" width="88" height="31" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Many businesses will seek new rules for their industries now, fearing that less favorable outcomes will occur if they chance it with the Obama Administration.  This business-initiated regulation will seek "ceiling preemption," meaning that the federal rules will supersede and cap strong state regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preemption has a profound effect on consumer protection, because frankly speaking, Congress rarely takes the time to pass consumer protection laws.  It has other important business, and there is a horde of lobbyists who get upset when consumer laws are even considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of a new report released by Rep. Waxman's Committee on Government Reform, Alicia Mundy &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122529821388980687.html"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal that preemption became very popular in FDA rulemakings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The administration began adding language to more than 50 regulatory rulings that pre-empt state standards and lawsuits at several agencies in 2005.

&lt;p&gt;The first such ruling at the FDA appeared in January 2006, surprising outside observers because the language hadn't appeared in earlier public drafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://oversight.house.gov/story.asp?ID=2266"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; finds that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...key FDA career officials strongly objected to Bush Administration drug labeling regulations that would preempt state liability lawsuits, asserting that the central justifications for the regulations were "false and misleading" and warning that the changes would deprive consumers of timely information about drug hazards.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No surprise.  And expect much more of this.  It will be difficult to clean this up.  Practically speaking, undoing these rules will only be possible where there is political will to do so. So many other important issues will take priority first.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/in_the_bush_world_regulation_i.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/436958136" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225375989786"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/the-freak-est-links-172/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/431679eece432ff6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="FREAK est links"/><title type="html">The FREAK-est Links</title><published>2008-10-30T13:34:41Z</published><updated>2008-10-30T13:34:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/LvZoouYstSg/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/the-freak-est-links-172/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">The industrial organization of rebel groups.

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I found the little vignettes about ordinary Americans a bit off-putting — political sentimentality makes me cynical.

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/UnmS_vULPxw%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony comes from the outraged Christian fundie voiceover. He accuses Obama of mocking the bible, and then defends it by claiming that the Sermon on the Mount is &amp;quot;spiritually inspiring&amp;quot;…completely missing the point that Obama was not saying otherwise. And then he claims that Jesus would never advocate turning the cheek to terrorists and America&amp;#39;s enemies. What? I don&amp;#39;t think Jesus had much to say about America, and probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have much concern about some strange secular nation far removed from his natal region. To defend Deuteronomy and Leviticus, he makes a similar non sequitur, complaining that the Ten Commandments are also in Deuteronomy. So? Even if you consider the Ten Commandments virtuous, it does not negate Obama&amp;#39;s point, which is that you have to pick and choose bits of the bible, making it an inappropriate guide to civic behavior…and there this narrator is, picking and choosing. And of course, the Ten Commandments are mostly irrelevant, and not the basis of US law anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then he accuses Obama of distorting the bible. That&amp;#39;s the whole point, bozo! The bible is a welter of contradictions and archaicisms — &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; are unavoidably distorting it if you try to take that mess literally and run a country on its precepts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/more_christian_irony.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/436903729" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225374405213"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=404">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/23ff542f6029fecd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Religion vs Superstition - Mande Barung Revisited</title><published>2008-10-30T11:00:22Z</published><updated>2008-10-30T11:00:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=404" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Michael Egnor has managed to write his &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/10/bigfoot_evolved.html"&gt;most incoherent blog entry ever&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s saying something.  I was actually impressed with how many errors and misconceptions he could cram into each sentence. Writing for the anti-evolution Discovery Institute, Egnor also reinforces the point I have been making recently that the Intelligent Design movement is not just anti-evolution but anti-science, and their primary strategy is to paint any scientific conclusion they find objectionable as “materialist ideology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time Egnor is playing off the recent &lt;a href="http://www.baylor.edu/pr/news.php?action=story&amp;amp;story=52815"&gt;Baylor University survey&lt;/a&gt; on religious beliefs, and true to form he gets it completely wrong. He begins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Skeptical” atheist Steven Novella has a blog post on &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog//?p=397"&gt;“Mande Barung,”&lt;/a&gt; an Indian version of the Himalayan Yeti and the North American Bigfoot. Novella ruminates on the credulity of one Dipu Marak, a local passionate believer in the shy mythical creature. Debunking Yeti sightings is low-hanging fruit for skeptics like Novella, whose skepticism knows no limits — except for his own materialist ideology, about which he is credulous to the bone. One wonders why atheist “skeptics” need to explain to their readership — presumably compliant atheist skeptics all — that Yeti probably don’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see that now he has taken to using “skeptical” in scare quotes. Clearly Egnor does not understand the first thing about skeptical philosophy. First, he seems to equate it with being an “atheist”. He does not bother to define “atheist”, which is not a small point, especially since I am on record as describing myself as an agnostic. (The atheist vs agnostic discussion is for another post.) This is also important because he is pushing the “materialist ideology” theme - and the whole point of agnosticism is anti-ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also assumes that skepticism and atheism are the same, which is also not true. There is only about a 70% overlap between scientific skepticism and religious non-belief. And that works both ways - I know some atheists who I would not call skeptics. Egnor is content, in his typically intellectually lazy and sloppy manner, to clumsily paint this all with the same broad brush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also doesn’t bother to defend his accusation that I profess a materialist ideology. As I have explained multiple times in the past in this blog and elsewhere, skepticism (as with science) is about method, not belief.  But”materialist ideology” is the talking point of the DI so every issue will be shoe-horned into that theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egnor then asks a question that is a setup to the main theme of his blog - why would I bother to tackle the “low hanging fruit” of Yeti? This is actually a legitimate question, if Egnor were actually sincere in asking it. I have also addressed this question in the past - skepticism is partly the study of why people believe strongly in things that are probably not true. Sometimes I take on demonstrably false beliefs as extreme examples of how the human “belief machine” goes awry. It is similar to presenting for teaching purposes an extreme medical case, where the pathology is far advanced. Such cases are easy to diagnose and will rarely be seen in practice, but they are useful for showcasing pathology so that it might be recognized in its more subtle forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Egnor is not interested in skepticism, belief, or the philosophical differences between agnosticism and atheism. He is just setting himself up to completely misinterpret the recent Baylor religion survey. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logan Gage explains why. Gage has a superb &lt;a href="http://www.dcexaminer.com/opinion/columns/guestcolumnists/Which_Secular_Superstitiion_do_you_Believe.html"&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; entitled, “Which Secular Superstition do you Believe?” Gage asks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…[Who] is more likely to believe wild eyed superstitions these days, the religious or irreligious?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, Gage observes, is unambiguous:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unambiguous?  Perhaps that is what Gage concluded, but Egnor would have done well to go to the original sources rather than simply quoting Gage, who writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Mollie Ziegler Hemingway reported in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, “While 31% of people who never worship expressed strong belief in these things, only 8% of people who attend a house of worship more than once a week did.”…”In fact, the more traditional and evangelical the respondent, the less likely he was to believe in, for instance, the possibility of communicating with people who are dead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mollie Ziegler Hemingway misinterpreted the results of this survey, and Gage continued her error, which was then repeated by Egnor.  The error is in trying to make sense of the survey by only considering a single axis of variation - religious vs non-religious. And yet Hemingway and Gage present the information that shows how problematic such a simplistic interpretation of this data is. &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122178219865054585.html"&gt;Hemingway reported&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even among Christians, there were disparities. While 36% of those belonging to the United Church of Christ, Sen. Barack Obama’s former denomination, expressed strong beliefs in the paranormal, only 14% of those belonging to the Assemblies of God, Sarah Palin’s former denomination, did. In fact, the more traditional and evangelical the respondent, the less likely he was to believe in, for instance, the possibility of communicating with people who are dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while 8% of people who worship more than once a week believe in the paranormal, 31% of those who do not worship regularly do, and 36% of those belonging to the United Church of Christ do. This is “unambiguous”? Further, of the 31% who do not worship regularly only the minority are actually atheists. In fact, the figures quoted by Gage and Egnor (31% vs 8%) were about frequency of worship - not religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gage hints at a more consistent interpretation of this data - although still manages to come to the wrong conclusion, which Egnor laps up greedily. This is not about being religious vs being skeptical. This is about the particular belief systems of conservative Christians - which includes the belief that the occult is evil and from Satan. This is really reflecting competing religions - conservative Christianity and New Age occultism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Egnor concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is amusing that, despite the pretensions of atheist “skeptics” such as Novella, atheists are much more likely to believe pseudoscientific claims such as UFOs, Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, psychics, Atlantis, and astrology than are traditional religious believers. Four times as likely, to be precise (31% vs. 8%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong. First, Egnor is concluding that the members of the United Church of Christ are not “traditional religious believers.” Second the 31% was not among self-described atheists, but simply those who do not worship regularly - and the same survey shows that the vast minority of that group are actually atheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also - Egnor’s conclusion (in addition to being factually incorrect) is logically absurd. Self-professed skeptics (certainly me, the majority of my readers, and members of the skeptical movement) demonstrably do not believe in UFO’s, Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, or psychics.  It is almost by definition that skeptics do not believe in such things because they are not adequately supported by scientific evidence. What Egnor is trying to argue, in a bizarrely twisted fashion, is that those who promote rigorous adherence to scientific methodology and the questioning of all claims credulously believe in the paranormal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This partly derives from the fact that he is failing to separate “skeptics” from “atheists” - they are not the same thing. His statement is incoherent when applied to skeptics. When applied to atheists it is more complex. The data show that many (but not all) atheists are indeed skeptics. For those who are not, some accept New Age beliefs, or Eastern mysticism. Some atheists are atheists because they reject the religion of their culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of this is reflected in the data quoted by Hemingway, Gage, and Egnor. This survey shows only that conservative Christianity is an incompatible belief system with New Age occultism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also - this survey is not the only information to be found on the relationship between religious belief and the paranormal. The parts of the survey quoted use worship as a measure of religiosity, and belief in communication with the dead as a measure of superstitious belief - but these are imperfect and narrow markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other and more thorough studies have shown a more complex picture. For example, &lt;a href="http://users.telenet.be/allemeesch/KlinPsy/publi/Beliefs&amp;amp;Personality.htm"&gt;this 2005 study&lt;/a&gt; showed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Past research has shown the following correlations between paranormal and religious beliefs: firstly, Tobayck and Milford (1983) found traditional religious belief to correlate positively with belief in witchcraft and precognition, but negatively with belief in spiritualism and non-significantly with belief in psi, superstition, and extraordinary life forms.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Clarke (1991) found slightly different results with religiosity correlating positively with belief in psychic healing and negatively with UFO belief.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Finally, Hillstrom and Strachan (2000) reported negative correlations between religiosity and beliefs in telepathy, precognition, PK, psychic healing, UFOs, reincarnation, and communication with the spirits.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;As indicated earlier, the mixed results are largely due to the different measurements of paranormal belief used. Moreover, the measurement of religiosity was performed either by a simple measure of attendance or via the Traditional Religious Beliefs subscale on the RPBS.&lt;span&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So past studies show that religiosity (depending on how you measure it) positively correlates with some superstitious or paranormal beliefs, negatively with others, and non-significantly with still others.  The results from the new study concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;In summary then, this study showed that religious beliefs and paranormal beliefs are indeed associated, confirming initial exploratory studies that suggested some kind of relationship between the two (Goode, 2000; Haraldsson, 1981).&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The other mixed results reflect the need for further research in both religiosity and in particular paranormal beliefs to see if a consistent pattern of results may emerge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm….so a more thorough study, far better designed than the Baylor survey, using accepted standardized measures of religiosity and paranormal belief, show a positive correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Egnor gullibly cherry picked bad data, which he then misinterpreted, to make the argument that he and his cronies are less gullible than those who profess the anti-gullible philosophy of skepticism.  That’s about par for the course for Egnor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Seems like they ought to win", I said, "with four at-bats versus three for the Rays."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response: "You're not from here, are you?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=746"&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; the "lack of a sense of entitlement, not to say bitterness and cynicism, that's characteristic of Philly sports fans", and Tim McKenzie &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=746#comment-11599"&gt;gave me a hard time&lt;/a&gt; for stereotyping a region. But that's how it is, here in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, the Phillies did win, and they only needed three turns at bat to do it. Here's a picture of the celebration on Broad Street that ran on the front page of the &lt;a href="http://www.philly.com"&gt;local newspaper site&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Phinallie.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Phinallie.jpg" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red Sox had to overcome the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Bambino"&gt;Curse of the Bambino&lt;/a&gt; to win in 2004.  Now rumor has it in Philadelphia that there's a hidden statue on top of the Comcast Building, obviating the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Billy_Penn"&gt;Curse of Billy Penn&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;sometimes used to explain the failure of [the city&amp;#39;s] professional sports teams … to win championships since the March 1987 construction of the One Liberty Place skyscraper, which exceeded the height of William Penn&amp;#39;s statue atop Philadelphia City Hall&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Atop Philadelphia City Hall stands a statue of William Penn, the city founder and original proprietor of the then-British colony of Pennsylvania (meaning "Penn's Woods"). For many decades, a "gentlemen's agreement" stated that the Philadelphia Art Commission would approve no building in the city which would rise above this statue. This ended in March 1987, when a modern steel-and-glass skyscraper, One Liberty Place, opened three blocks away. One Liberty Place dwarfs City Hall by 397 feet (121m), rising 945 feet (288m) in height compared to the height of Penn's hat on city hall, 547ft 11-3/4in (167m). The measurement of the height of City Hall is usually rounded to 548 ft, which coincidentally matches the career number of home runs hit by Phillies Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt. Its sister skyscraper, Two Liberty Place, at 848 ft (258m), would soon follow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Philadelphia sports teams had just before then enjoyed an enviable run of success: Major League Baseball's Philadelphia Phillies had won the 1980 World Series and the 1983 National League pennant; the National Hockey League's Philadelphia Flyers had won back-to-back Stanley Cups in 1974 and 1975, and were a regular presence in the finals (to wit, 1976, 1980, 1985, and 1987 as well as 1997); the National Football League's Philadelphia Eagles had appeared in Super Bowl XV, losing to the Oakland Raiders; and the National Basketball Association's Philadelphia 76ers had won the championship in 1983, as well as making the finals in 1977, 1980, 1982 and 2001.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rumor is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast_building"&gt;apparently true&lt;/a&gt;, though the new statue is only five inches high, rather than 37 feet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LibertyPenn.jpg" alt="" width="230"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/ComcastPenn.jpg" alt="" width="230"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among baseball superstitions, the Curse of Billy Penn is slightly less silly than the Chicago Cub's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Billy_Goat"&gt;Curse of the Billy Goat&lt;/a&gt;, since (as the Wikipedia article explains) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_City_Hall"&gt;Philadelphia's city hall&lt;/a&gt; was not only the tallest building in the city until 1987, but was actually the tallest building in the world from 1901 to 1908, and remains the world's tallest masonry building. But the shared word "Billy" does show a common cultural origin, and since the Billy Goat curse dates to 1945, while the Billy Penn curse dates only to the mid-nineties, we can be sure that Philadelphia was not the innovator in this case. On the other hand, the outcome of 2008 division series between the Cubs and the Dodgers suggests that the Billy Goat curse is still in effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who suspect a phallic subtext in all this concern over billies and building sizes will not be surprised to learn from the same article that &amp;quot;A joke among Philadelphians … is that when viewed from Ben Franklin Parkway the statue appears to be engaged in a lewd activity, due to the scroll in its hand&amp;quot;, as imperfectly indicated in this photograph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/PennScroll.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative view might associate Billy Penn's curse with the traditional Quaker dislike of ostentation. As E. Digby Baltzell wrote in the 1995 introduction to a new edition of his 1979 classic &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=LG29MRCw5d8C"&gt;Puritan Boston and Quaker Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The central theme of this book is that the elitist Puritan ethic firmly established class authority and deference democracy in Boston and Massachusetts and lasted from the colonial period down to the twentieth century; on the other hand, the egalitarian and victim ethic of Quakerism failed to produce class authority, resulting in the defiant democracy that has marked Philadelphia and Pennsylvania ever since. Two important unanticipated consequences flowed from these two antithetical ethics: In the first place, the hierarchical culture of Massachusetts produced great leaders on the local and national scene, while Philadelphia and Pennsylvania have produced hardly any leaders of distinction. This difference was nicely shown by a comparison of fifty First Families of Boston with fifty First Families of Philadelphia; while the Boston families produced 188 individuals with 34,365 liens written about them in the &lt;em&gt;Dictionary of American Biography (DAB)&lt;/em&gt;, the fifty leading families of Phildelphia produced only 146 individuals with 15,842 lines (or less than half) written about them in the DAB; twenty eight Boston Brahmins were memorialized by more than 300 line biographies while only three Proper Philadelphians were of such distinction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After living here since 1990, my impression is that William Penn's legacy, whether seen as a curse or a blessing, has dissipated to a considerable extent.&lt;/p&gt;

This summarizes Day 4, October 29, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll take a slightly different approach in this post for several reasons.  First, I’m short of time and sleep.  Second, much of the day was given over to cross examination of the middle school principal by Kelly Hamilton, Freshwater’s attorney, and Hamilton’s approach to cross examination does not lend itself to any sort of narrative flow.  Therefore I’ll summarize the main themes of the testimony with some examples of Q&amp;amp;A rather than attempting to reproduce the exact sequence of questions through hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the testimony today was from Bill White, Principal of the Mt. Vernon Middle School.  Another student, a former student of Freshwater who is currently a senior at Mt. Vernon High School, also testified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More below the fold.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stylistic note&lt;/strong&gt;:  Throughout this account where I use a sentence form like “He was first notified of the Tesla coil incident on Dec 10,” read it as “&lt;em&gt;He testified&lt;/em&gt; that he was first notified …”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White direct examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conducted by David Millstone, the Board of Education’s attorney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White started in the job of Middle School Principal in the Fall of 2007, just in time for the hoorah.  He was first notified of the Tesla coil incident the morning of Dec 10 by Steve Short, Superintendent of Schools, who called White to his office.  Short described the parents’ allegation and showed White the pictures taken by Jenifer Dennis, the student Zachary’s mother.  White identified two pictures entered as exhibits in the hearing yesterday as those Short had shown him.  Short instructed White to ascertain what he could about the allegation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That afternoon White and Mr. Ritchie, the middle school assistant principal, met with Freshwater.  According to White, when asked about it Freshwater initially said that nothing had occurred, but as the conversation proceeded admitted that there was a class exercise with shocks.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White instructed Freshwater to sequester the Tesla coil (I think the phrase used was “lock up” but I’m not sure).  He subsequently instructed Bill Oxenford, chairman of the middle school science department, to retrieve all the Tesla coils in the department and turn them in to White.  Oxenford returned three devices to White.  Note that yesterday Freshwater testified that he retained the device he had used in class.  White was not aware that there was a coil outstanding, and did not authorize Freshwater to remove one from the school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA), White testified that he met with Freshwater and Ritchie early in the 2007-2008 school year to pass to Freshwater an FCA manual outlining the duties of FCA faculty monitors.  Sections of the manual had been specifically highlighted by Superintendent Short.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White testified that he had multiple problems/complaints regarding Freshwater’s activities through the 2007-2008 school year.  This is a summary of White’s testimony:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complaints/issues included the use (or lack thereof) of parent permission forms for FCA.  Under White’s new administration of the middle school, parental permission forms are required whenever a student is not in his or her scheduled place during the school day.  Since FCA meets during lunch time, the new policy was applicable to FCA, and White testified that Freshwater was laggard in getting them.  Each such activity is also required to submit a report of an attendance count, and White testified that on a number of occasions the number of students reported to be attending FCA meetings exceeded the number of permission slips turned in.  White said that the permission slip problem persisted longer with Freshwater than the other FCA monitors (6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade), and that he doesn’t know if Freshwater ever fully complied with the policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White said that some of the topics discussed at FCA were reported to be inappropriate.  One such allegedly inappropriate topic was discussing students going to anti-abortion rallies.  Freshwater is a participant in Dave Daubenmire’s &lt;a href="http://www.minutemenunited.org/" rel="external "&gt;Minutemen United&lt;/a&gt;, which is a fundamentalist Christian activist organization that (among other things) protests at abortion clinics and takes pictures of vehicle license plates of patrons of a topless joint in Newcastle, Ohio, a hamlet out in Amish country.  (Careful about those mental images you’re generating!).  Daubenmire was a coach at Mt. Vernon high school years ago.  He moved to London, Ohio, where the ACLU brought suit against the district to prohibit Daubenmire from leading prayers with his football team.  The district settled out of court.  Daubenmire then left public education and founded &lt;a href="http://www.ptsalt.com/" rel="external "&gt;Pass the Salt Ministries&lt;/a&gt;.  He was one of Freshwater’s most vocal and mililtant supporters early on in this brouhaha, but has been frozen out over the last three or four months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that it is OK for a public school teacher to protest at abortion clinics on his/her own time.  The question here was whether Freshwater initiated that discussion with students while acting as a school employee.  White testified that he couldn’t substantiate the allegation that Freshwater initiated that discussion at FCA, and that Freshwater apparently discouraged students’ participation at this time due to unspecified conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freshwater was alleged to have participated in a healing ceremony or healing prayer for a visiting speaker at an FCA meeting.  White testified that he determined that Freshwater had indeed participated in a prayer for healing/good health for a guest speaker.  White testified that Freshwater told him he probably had prayed in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White testified that there was an allegation that Freshwater had initiated contact with at least some guest speakers rather than students, as is required.  FCA is supposed to be a student-led and operated organization, with the faculty member a monitor rather than leader/participant.  While FCA is not a school sponsored organization, the requirement for a faculty monitor derives from the fact that FCA meets during the school day (at lunch time) when the school bears responsibility for the students.  White testified that inquiries were made to several outside speakers (by whom it was not clear), and that Freshwater had indeed initiated the contact with a couple of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White testified that Freshwater had religious materials displayed in his classroom, and at a meeting in early April 2008 White instructed Freshwater to remove those displayed materials.  They included a collage featuring the 10 Commandments; stickers on cupboard doors with inspirational sayings and Bible verses; a poster of Colin Powell and George Bush praying with a Bible verse on it; a poster advertising a Will Graham evangelical event; a couple of boxes of FCA New Testaments in the room; and Freshwater’s Bible on his desk.  With respect to the latter, Freshwater was instructed that he could read it during non-class ‘off’ time, but that it had to be out of sight when students were in the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White had pictures taken of aspects of the religious displays, and several of those photos were entered into evidence at the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White testified that Freshwater did not promptly comply with the instructions to remove the religious materials, so in mid-April White wrote Freshwater a letter giving him a deadline for the removal.   White said that Freshwater asked him if he didn’t comply would that be insubordination.  White replied in the affirmative.  Sometime during that week Freshwater added a Bible checked out from the middle school library and a book titled “Jesus of Nazareth,” also from the middle school library, to the science table in his room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White testified that Freshwater left his Bible on his desk at the end of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White cross examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conducted by Kelly Hamilton, Freshwater’s attorney.  Once again, Hamilton’s cross examination style is scattershot, with questions skipping from topic to topic and back again.  Hamilton was once a Columbus, Ohio, police sergeant, and his cross examination style resembles a good cop’s interrogation style.  So I’ll here try to impose some narrative structure that was not in the actual sequence of questions and answers.  White’s cross examination was suspended late in the afternoon so the student mentioned above could testify, and will resume tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Hamilton established that White had not reviewed the testimony from Days 1 and 2 of this hearing, had not reviewed the independent investigator’s report before it was submitted several months ago, and had no input to that report beyond the questioning of White by the investigators in the course of their investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two main themes that I saw in the cross examination questioning.  One was the degree and appropriateness of the supervision provided to Freshwater.  The second was whether Freshwater was treated differently from other teachers through the last year in these kinds of matters.  Some subsidiary themes popped up now and then.  For example, the strange interpretation of the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Amendment Establishment Clause, to the effect that if someone doesn’t know that a Bible is a religious book, would it be promoting religion to have a Bible on one’s desk?  That is almost exactly what Hamilton asked White in one question sometime during the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supervision Theme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supervision theme emerged in several lines of questioning.  For example, in one line of questioning Hamilton established that White had talks with several other teachers about religious material displayed in their rooms subsequent to the public eruption of the Freshwater affair.  White testified that in answer to a question from one of them, he told those teachers that if they objected to removing the materials their best course was to remove the materials and then file a grievance as provided in the master contract with the collective bargaining unit.  Hamilton wondered why White had not given the same grievance advice to Freshwater.  White replied that Freshwater hadn’t asked about it, and that every teacher is (or should be) aware of the opportunity to file grievances through the process specified in the master contract.  When asked by Hamilton, White didn’t know if Freshwater is a member of the bargaining unit, a chapter of the Ohio Education Association.  (In fact Freshwater is not a member of the bargaining unit, but nevertheless the provisions of the master contract apply to him.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further questions in this theme focused on the boundaries of acceptable behavior by teachers concerning religious matters.  For example, Hamilton asked if a student raised a question about, say, Easter, could a teacher entertain a brief discussion of it.  White replied that if it was not in the standards-based curriculum, discussion would be inappropriate.  Asked what the teacher should do, White replied that speaking as an ex-elementary teacher, he would advise the student to take that question to his/her parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked whether there was a written policy specifically regarding teaching to the standards.  White replied that teachers were expected to teach to the standards.  Asked whether teachers could go beyond the material specified in the standards, White replied that they could if they had covered the material in the standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a series of questions to attempt to establish that Freshwater didn’t/couldn’t know that his use of the Tesla coil to shock students was inappropriate.  For example, Hamilton pursued the notion of on-the-job training, asking whether having been trained in the use of the Tesla coil by a now-retired teacher (Jeff George), and given that there had been no prior complaints or administrative communication regarding that use, could Freshwater rely on those to conclude that his use was appropriate?  White’s answer was inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton displayed (but did not enter into evidence) a poster showing a U.S. flag and the mottoes “In God We Trust” and “With God Everything is Possible.”  The former is the U.S. motto, the latter the State of Ohio motto.  Hamilton asked if there were such posters in the school.  White replied that there is a fair number of them in classrooms and other areas, that they had been donated by an organization in Steubenville, and that the school was legally required to display them if they were donated to the school.  (I know nothing about that – any Ohio legal scholars out there?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked a series of questions about whether the administrators, and White in particular, had a mandatory duty to report the incident to Children’s Services and why it wasn’t reported to the police if Freshwater had held the boy’s hand down, as the boy had testified.  White replied that he had too little information at the time to initiate a report – he knew only that one anonymous student of more than a thousand had possibly been injured, and that he reported what he found from Freshwater back to Superintendent White.  Pressed further, White said that if the same sort of situation occurred again he would report it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked White if he had observed any tests of the use of the Tesla coil on humans.  White replied that he had seen one, when the President of the Board of Education, Ian Watson, had asked White to shock him.  White declined on the ground that he (White) has an electronic implant and doesn’t fool around with things like that.  White called Elle Button, another middle school science teacher, to his office and asked her to shock Watson.  She declined on the ground that she thought it was inappropriate use of the device.  Watson finally shocked himself on the arm.  White could recall no details of the mark, if any, since he was keeping his distance on account of his implant.  White reported that Watson said it hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White was later reminded by Hamilton’s referring to the investigator’s report that White had also been present when an investigator shocked himself with a Tesla coil.  White conceded that he had been present, but once again had kept his distance from the procedure on account of his implant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Parenthetically, writing as an ex-Navy missile technician who was trained to work around RF sources, I am flabbergasted at how casually these people wander around zorching themselves and each other with RF (500 KHz) generating devices.  A few weeks ago I had a lively sidewalk discussion with a Kenyon physicist about a couple of his colleagues in that department who got peripherally involved early in the Freshwater affair by zapping themselves with a Tesla coil and going on to the newspaper about how it didn’t seem to cause tissue damage.  I passed on some suggestions about skin effects of RF – basically, it’s mainly conducted on or very near the surface of metallic conductors – and how in human bodies the RF “skin” depth is up in double-digit centimeters, meaning that RF readily passes into deeper tissue and into the nervous and circulatory systems.  There are anecdotal accounts of subdermal tissue damage with relatively minor visible manifestations due specifically to devices like those in the middle school.  It puts me in mind of 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century alchemists who tested compounds for their poisonous effects by dosing themselves with strange and wondrous concoctions.  We do not seem to have come far in some respects.  The only sensible people in &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; respect that I’ve seen mentioned in this affair are Elle Button and Bill White.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discrimination theme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In several lines of questions Hamilton attempted to show that Freshwater was systematically treated differently than other teachers in similar circumstances. For example, Hamilton asked White if other teachers had Bibles on their desks and/or religious displays in their rooms.  White replied that several teachers had had such displays, but took them down on instructions from him.  White was aware of only Lori Miller, another middle school science teacher, with a Bible on her desk currently.  Asked why Miller was allowed to keep her Bible on her desk while Freshwater was not, White replied that Miller’s was not there in the context of a larger display of religious materials, whereas at the time the instruction to conceal his Bible was given to Freshwater his was a part of a larger set of religious displays in his classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some subsidiary themes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Hamilton returned to his bizarre notion of the effect prong of the Lemon test described in my earlier post linked at the top.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One line of questioning established that the Dennis family was the original source of several of the allegations that are included in the independent investigator’s report.  White conceded that is true.  (One task of the Board’s attorney is to provide independent corroboration of those allegations, and that’s under way – see James Hoeffgen’s testimony below for the beginning of that corroboration.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another set of questions dealt with the pictures of Zachary’s arm.  White was asked if he thought someone could have altered the injury to make it look more like a cross.  I didn’t catch White’s response.  He was asked if he thought the pictures were fabricated.  He did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another line of questions focused on Zach Dennis’ honesty.  White was asked if he knew whether Zach had ever been dishonest.  White replied that he was once, that on one occasion Zach had apparently told his parents that he himself had contacted a potential FCA speaker, but that Freshwater had actually made the contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were repeated questions scattered through the cross about documentation – did White keep notes of conversations and events (sometimes), where were they (in his office), and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another set of questions focused on the fact that Freshwater’s daughter was a member of FCA, and on the potential conflicts that might involve.  White was asked if he thought there was a potential conflict between his role as parent and his role as FCA monitor.  White agreed there was.  Asked if he’d advised Freshwater of that potential conflict, White replied that he had not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White’s cross examination was suspended so James Hoeffgen could testify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James Hoeffgen direct examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James is a Mt. Vernon High School student who had Freshwater as his teacher in 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science in 2004-2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James testified that Freshwater spent a lot of time on evolution in his class.  Under questioning, he said that Freshwater used a creationist video by Kent Hovind, who Freshwater introduced as “a renowned scientist.”  James said that Freshwater told his class that carbon dating is unreliable, that the earth might only be a few thousand years old, and that dinosaurs may have lived at the same time as cave men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James testified that Freshwater used creationist-related material in his teaching of science.  For example, James said Freshwater used two handouts, one called &lt;a href="http://www.discovery.org/a/1209" rel="external "&gt;Survival of the Fakest&lt;/a&gt;, a 2001 &lt;em&gt;American Spectator&lt;/em&gt; article by Jonathan Wells, and the other a handout concerning Haeckel’s embryos asserting they were fake but are still used in biology textbooks.  While the handouts were supposed to be returned at the end of the class period, James took his home.  He said his parents were disturbed that Freshwater was using it and explained to him that it was in error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this was in 2004-2005.  Freshwater had testified that he ceased using the “Survival of the Fakest” handout in 2003 after his “Objective Origins Policy” had been rejected by the Board of Education.  According to James’ testimony Freshwater continued using obvious creationist materials well after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if Freshwater taught about “intelligent design,” James replied he did not, but hinted at a creator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James was asked if he was uncomfortable with the religious overtones of Freshwater’s teaching and room.  James replied that he was, that at that time he considered himself to be Jewish and that the displays of Christian materials in the room made him uncomfortable.  He said he told his parents that, but he didn’t know if they did anything further about it with the school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James Hoeffgen cross examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked if James knows the Dennis family.  He does not.  He was asked how many times he’d met with David Millstone, the Board’s attorney.  Once, last summer.  Hamilton asked how James came to be involved in this hearing.  James replied that a friend, Ron Griggs, knew of the pending hearing and knew James had been Freshwater’s student, and suggested he contact the relevant people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cross examination James reported that Freshwater had used the Hovind video once, and that it lasted one or two class periods.  He said he reported that to his parents, and that they contacted the middle school principal at the time about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James confirmed that Freshwater did not use the words “intelligent design,” “ID,” or “creationism in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Referring to a discussion of abortion in class, James could not remember whether Freshwater brought it up or a student did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton showed James some of the pictures of religious items in Freshwater’s room taken in the 2007-2008 school year.  James identified the 10 Commandments poster as having been in the room in 2004-2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James Hoeffgen redirect examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone asked James if he reached any conclusion, then or later, about what Freshwater was doing in his teaching of evolution.  James replied that his parents were upset about Freshwater’s use of &lt;em&gt;Survival of the Fakest&lt;/em&gt;, about Freshwater’s claims of the inaccuracy of carbon dating, about the Hovind video, and about the notion that dinosaurs and humans were on earth together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone asked James what he concluded from Freshwater’s teaching.  James replied with an anecdote.  He said his sister had found a rock and was going to take it to a teacher to see if she could find out how old it is.  James said he told his sister to not bother, &lt;strong&gt;“Science can’t be trusted.  Science can’t teach us anything.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a direct quote, immediately checked with an attorney who was also taking notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it says it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hearing was recessed until 9:00 tomorrow (well, today, actually, in about 5 hours!) &lt;/p&gt;

On the other hand, no one ever went broke overestimating the media's capacity for offhand condescension, as witness these excerpts from the &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/story?id=6140030&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt; that ABC published of Elizabeth Vargas' interview with Sarah Palin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ELIZABETH VARGAS:&lt;/strong&gt; If it doesn&amp;#39;t go your way on Tuesday … 2012?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOV SARAH PALIN:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m just … thinkin&amp;#39; that it&amp;#39;s gonna go our way on Tuesday, November 4….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;… PALIN:&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely not. I think that, if I were to give up and wave a white flag of surrender against some of the political shots that we&amp;#39;ve taken, that … that would … bring this whole … I&amp;#39;m not doin&amp;#39; this for naught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:normal"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;PALIN:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I think that people can … can read the comments and hear the comments that he made, because again, the, the refreshing thing about that tape being revealed … from 2001… it&amp;#39;s candidness there. It&amp;#39;s not … it didn&amp;#39;t seem to be his typical scripted, kinda … rhetorical message read off a TelePrompter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you wouldn't expect the transcribers to photoshop Palin's anacolutha and false starts (though I don't think the public's need for full information would be compromised if they cleaned up a repeated "the" here and there). But do they imagine that Palin is the only one of the candidates who drops a &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; now and again, much less says &lt;em&gt;kinda&lt;/em&gt; for&lt;em&gt; kind of&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;gonna&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;going to&lt;/em&gt;? And if you want to hear condescension compounded, listen to Wolf Blitzer having a Tina Fey moment as he &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aprz9wH0kto"&gt;reads&lt;/a&gt; from the Vargas interview transcript and dutifully drops Palin's g's where indicated.                 &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's true that Palin works her &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;-dropping for effect, as I &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=733"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in an earlier post. But then so do Biden, Obama, Hillary Clinton, and even McCain on occasion. And even if she's more ostentatious about it than they, there's no call for rendering it in transcriptions. It's a device that suggests speech that's uneducated or nonstandard, akin to eye-dialect (e.g., writing  &lt;em&gt;sez&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;says&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;wuz&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;). And in its small way, it seems to confirm the right's picture of elite media types who look down on ordinary Joes (Sixpack, Blow, or Plumber, as the case may be).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this connection, Bill Labov has observed that our perception of variable processes like &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;-dropping is categorical: when people do it a little, we don't perceive it; if they do it a bit more, they seem to be doing it all the time. Which may explain ABC's &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WN"&gt;heading&lt;/a&gt; for one video segment: "Palin: 'Not Callin' Out Obama." As it happens, though, when you listen to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, it turns out that Palin didn't actually drop the &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;calling&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoff Nunberg</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225345941668"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/29/sneak-peek-benders-game/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/57dc51250b460df2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="SciFi"/><category term="TV/Movies"/><title type="html">Sneak peek: Bender’s Game</title><published>2008-10-30T05:34:52Z</published><updated>2008-10-30T05:34:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/29/sneak-peek-benders-game/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The second greatest TV show of all time is coming back with a third movie: &amp;quot;Bender’s Game.&amp;quot; And &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj2VU_8l6gs"&gt;the trailer is on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last movie was pretty funny (much better than the uneven first one), and this one looks like it’s back to usual incredibly intelligent and funny Futurama that I worship, in a totally scientific and secular way.

So far, so typical, but then … well, they picked a peculiarly oblivious way to do it. &lt;a href="http://wonkette.com/403920/jesus-people-pray-that-false-idol-will-save-gods-economy"&gt;They prayed before a statue of a golden bull on Wall Street&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="nice_idol_you_got_there.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/29/nice_idol_you_got_there.jpg" width="400" height="385"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;span&gt;We are going to intercede at the site of the statue of the bull on Wall Street to ask God to begin a shift from the bull and bear markets to what we feel will be the 'Lion's Market,' or God's control over the economic systems. While we do not have the full revelation of all this will entail, we do know that without intercession, economies will crumble.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a clue: there's this book called "the bible" that these people claim to follow, but I suspect they've never actually read it, or they might have seen Exodus 32.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="golden_calf.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/golden_calf.jpg" width="400" height="288"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They even made &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049833/"&gt;a movie&lt;/a&gt; of it, if cracking a book is too highbrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust me, this is one of those things in the Judeo-Christian heritage that never ends well.

It seems Ms. &lt;a href="http://www.wral.com/news/state/story/3844708/"&gt;Hagan doesn't like us very much&lt;/a&gt;, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic Senate candidate Kay Hagan angrily demanded Wednesday that incumbent Sen. Elizabeth Dole take down a new ad that questions the challenger's ties to an atheist political group, calling the spot a slanderous and pathetic attempt to maintain political power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hagan's attorneys sent a cease-and-desist order to Dole's campaign, saying the "libelous" ad should come down within 24 hours. The order promised legal action if the ad stays on the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So…being called an atheist is &amp;quot;slanderous&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;libelous&amp;quot;, huh? Oh, well, then. Never mind, North Carolina, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter who you vote for in that election, you&amp;#39;re getting a loser. I suppose you should still vote for Hagan, but only for her party and not because she&amp;#39;s on our side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/with_friends_like_these_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/436433832" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225332980002"><id gr:original-id="http://actionforautism.co.uk/?p=275">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ea93aa9f26abef82</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Autism Speaks for Lisa Blakemore-Brown</title><published>2008-10-30T01:24:24Z</published><updated>2008-10-30T01:24:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionforautism.co.uk/2008/10/30/autism-speaks-for-lisa-blakemore-brown/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">While I am grateful to Michael, Dinah and Larry for sharing their impressions of the TreeHouse lecture in my post, Bob Wright - Autism Speaks in London, their reports do not tell the whole story.

I hate blog memes, but rules are rules.  As Robert Service said, "a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code," and although I'm not sure how that applies, I'm forced to respond.  From &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig"&gt;Abel over at TerraSig&lt;/a&gt; comes a random blog meme...literally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated a blog meme is sort of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme"&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt; but not really.  A &lt;em&gt;meme&lt;/em&gt; is a unit of information passed though learning or behavior, rather than genetics.  A &lt;i&gt;blog meme&lt;/i&gt; is a set of questions passed from blogger to blogger until it finally peters out.  It gives bloggers a chance to connect to each other and to connect their readers to other blogs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And for today's meme, the rules:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Link to the person who tagged you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Post the rules on your blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Write six random things about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Tag six people at the end of your post and link to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Let each person know they've been tagged and leave a comment on their blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. Let the tagger know when your entry is up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Six random things about me:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.  I am an expert &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/854539028306_0_ALB.php"&gt;flatwater canoeist, &lt;/a&gt;and made both of the things &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/OplCommandServlet.php"&gt;in this photo &lt;/a&gt;(although I had help with one of them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.  My Hebrew name is a composite of "heals/healer" and a suffix referring to "God".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.  I'm phobic of spiders (although I can appreciate them intellectually).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.  I grow tomatoes and chilis and make my own salsa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. I like to listen to NPR while I sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.  My maternal great-grandfather was the constable of Boston, and when my grandfather was born, he was given a locket reportedly by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Fitzgerald"&gt;this man&lt;/a&gt;, a locket my mother still has. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, fine.  I've done it. On to the next victims.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ames, over at &lt;a href="http://www.acandidworld.net/"&gt;Submitted to a Candid World&lt;/a&gt;, you're it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin, at &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/"&gt;the Lay Scientist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/"&gt;Bing McGhandi&lt;/a&gt;, for having a great name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rockstarramblings.blogspot.com/index.html"&gt;Bronze dog&lt;/a&gt;...he's usually a sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://perkyskeptic.blogspot.com/"&gt;Perky Skeptic&lt;/a&gt;...she seems a nice sort who won't kill me for tagging her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/"&gt;Blake, &lt;/a&gt;who I hope to meet at ScienceOnline09. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/tagged.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/436392655" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225323362207"><id gr:original-id="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/10/greenspan-einstein-and-reich/langswitch_lang/in">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f4eca4e85334a97d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Communicating Climate"/><category term="skeptics"/><title type="html">Greenspan, Einstein and Reich</title><published>2008-10-29T22:54:37Z</published><updated>2008-10-29T22:54:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/10/greenspan-einstein-and-reich/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.holtzbrinckpublishers.com/images/Books/L/0374466238L.jpg" align="right" width="25%" height="25%" border="5" alt="Shrek cover"&gt; I often receive letters that range from amusing claims that we are overlooking changes in the magnetic field, to tales about how the “weight” of carbon dioxide keeps it “near the ground”.  If the writer sounds serious, then I treat them seriously, and do my best to provide a helpful reply.  Often, though, I find myself in a pointless debate of the most basic, well-established physical principles.  I generally cut off the discussion at this point, because I simply don’t have the time.  This can result in a hostile response accusing me of “having an agenda”.  Most would call me naïve for bothering to respond in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is possible, after all, that somewhere in that barrage of letters lies a brilliant idea that ought to be heard, and could change the course of scientific history.  How to tell the difference?  Well, there is a story that we tell in our family that might provide some perspective on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is about Wilhelm Reich, the controversial Freudian psychoanalyist (1897-1957).  Reich was a personal acquaintance of my great uncle, William Steig, creator of &lt;a href="http://www.williamsteig.com/shrek_fr.htm"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shrek&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and illustrator of ones of Reich’s books.  Reich thought he had made a major discovery in physics that proved the existence of a previously unrecognized form of energy, which he called “orgone energy”.  He had built an “orgone energy accumulator” (basically a box whose walls were comprised of alternating layers of organic material and metal).  He had done some careful experiments that demonstrated that the temperature inside the box increased above the ambient outside temperature.  He made calculations that (he thought) demonstrated that the increase was greater than could be explained by thermodynamics, thereby proving the existence of an extra source of heat, which he attributed to the mysterious “orgone energy”.  He sent these calculations to Albert Einstein, who graciously wrote back to him, showing where his calculations were wrong.  Reich then wrote again, allegedly showing where Einstein had made an error.  Einstein never wrote back.  Some in my family took this as evidence that Einstein was stumped.  But most people would conclude that Einstein decided he had better things to do than continue an argument that wasn’t going anywhere.  This story has all the more poignancy to my family because my grandfather Henry, William’s brother, died of cancer while trying to cure himself by sitting in an orgone accumulator.  I don’t of course, believe that Wilhelm Reich is responsible for my grandfather’s death.  But clearly, Reich was wrong, and Einstein was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But wait a minute,” you might say.  “You guys at RealClimate are no Albert Einstein.”  True enough.  But like Einstein, we’re constantly subject to criticism from our fellow scientists.  That’s what the process of &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/04/blogs-and-peer-review"&gt;peer review&lt;/a&gt; is all about.  It’s not a perfect process, but it does provide an efficient means to separate ideas that have traction from ideas that are going nowhere.  Greenspan’s pronouncements about the economy, on the other hand, were not subject to any such process.  There might be a lesson in that.&lt;/p&gt;

The lies being spread about this proposal are thick and vicious.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/stem_cell_controversy_in_michigan.php"&gt;Orac also goes into a bit of detail&lt;/a&gt; about the dishonest tactics being used, mostly by religious groups, to try and stop this prop.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to remind you, Prop 2 would prevent the state and local governments in Michigan from passing laws against&lt;a href="http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/basics/defaultpage.asp"&gt; human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research&lt;/a&gt; that are any more restrictive than federal law.  That's about it.  The law does not set up any government agencies, taxes, fees or mandates.  It only keeps Michigan safe from theocratic laws that inhibit research funded by non-governmental agencies.  hESC research is a growing and important field, which has the potential to give significant insights into human disease, and perhaps some day, treatments as well.  hESC's are different from other stem cells used in laboratories.  They are derived as a byproduct of infertility treatment.  When harvesting eggs from a woman, there are inevitably more embryos produced than can be safely implanted in the patient, and unused embryos (each of which is a microscopic blob of cells) are usually discarded.  If the parents wish, they can donate these cell clusters to science.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are not fetuses.  This is not abortion.  The cell clusters have no arms and legs, no faces, nothing to identify them as anything that could grow into an animal.  Any arguments that equate stem cell research with abortion are patently false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now some religious folks have moral objections to stem cell research, mostly those who believe that "life" begins at conception.  It is unlikely that any of these people will support Prop 2, and they have an honest, albeit misguided reason for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really gets my goat is the campaign of lies that is hiding this religious motive.  Commercials are saying that Prop 2 will require government spending, will encourage selling of human parts, and all manner of weird accusations (including the man-cow hybrid thinggie).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my wife, who is a very busy person, took some time out of a very busy day to get the word out.  She went to someone's house to pick up Prop 2 literature, read it, asked questions, and went door-to-door in our neighborhood to spread the word.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has a lot of reasons for wanting to do this, not the least of which is our nephew, a type I diabetic since the age of four, who may stand to benefit in the future from hESC research.  She rightly thinks that he is more important than the "dignity" of a few cells in a dish.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife, who is an educator by profession, but not a scientist, did her reading, learned what she needed to, and put together a non-partisan message to bring to our neighbors.  It took a lot of &lt;i&gt;chutzpah&lt;/i&gt;, and I'm just so darn proud of her.&lt;br&gt;

Even folks who know better, who know intellectually that an antibiotic isn't going to fix their viral illness still harbor a strong suspicion that it just might help---and it couldn't hurt, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I've got two words for ya'll: &lt;strong&gt;eat shit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I don't mean that as an insult, I mean it quite literally.  But you'll have to keep reading to see what I'm talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many readers are aware of the problem of &lt;strong&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/strong&gt;---the phenomenon whereby bacterial diseases become resistant to antibiotics, a problem exacerbated by the profligate and inappropriate use of these agents.  Another serious complication of antibiotic therapy is &lt;b&gt;antibiotic-associated colitis&lt;/b&gt; (which also goes by the names "pseudomembranous colitis", "&lt;em&gt;Clostrium difficle colitis&lt;/em&gt;", or simply "C diff colitis".)  This one is nasty.  As diseases go, this is one you really, really don't want.  Really.  Think I'm kidding?  I've got two more words for you: &lt;strong&gt;toxic megacolon&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, let's get down to details.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/antibioticassociated_colitisa.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/antibioticassociated_colitisa.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/436307826" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225319205662"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/29/doctor-who-season-5-massive-spoilers/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2f20f6de11fa7479</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="SciFi"/><category term="TV/Movies"/><category term="david tennant"/><category term="doctor who"/><category term="mancrush"/><title type="html">Doctor Who Season 5 MASSIVE SPOILERS</title><published>2008-10-29T22:24:28Z</published><updated>2008-10-29T22:24:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/29/doctor-who-season-5-massive-spoilers/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red" size="+1"&gt;MAJOR DOCTOR WHO SPOILERS BELOW.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DO NOT READ THIS IS YOU DON’T WANT TO SEE A &lt;font size="+2"&gt;GINORMOUS&lt;/font&gt; SPOILER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IN FACT, &lt;strong&gt;EVERYONE&lt;/strong&gt; LEAVE NOW. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Looks around. Anyone left? OK.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;em&gt;crap&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s official. &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7698539.stm"&gt;David Tennant is leaving the role of Doctor Who&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Series 5 (what we call &amp;quot;season 5&amp;quot; in the US) will have the usual Christmas Special, then four more special episodes, and then a new actor will take over the role. Speculation is rampant about Who it will be (haha) but nothing has been confirmed yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have something of a &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/07/09/man-crush/"&gt;man crush&lt;/a&gt; on David Tennant, and I will be truly sorry to see him go. He has brought a depth and emotion to the role that beautifully ties in the pathos of the character that I need as an adult, with the swashbuckling nonsense I loved so much as an adolescent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjusting to a new actor will be very difficult, but that’s the price of love for the show. I wonder if they’ll establish a new companion before this happens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh. OK, I can deal with this. And who knows; I like Christopher Eccleston a lot, but wound up liking Tennant more. Maybe the next person will be even better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

OK, not surprising, I suppose…any organization that relies on or promotes scientific thinking has absolutely no choice in this election, so Obama is going to get the nod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do like one specific statement in the endorsement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Science is a way of governing, not just something to be governed. Science offers a methodology and philosophy rooted in evidence, kept in check by persistent inquiry, and bounded by the constraints of a self-critical and rigorous method. Science is a lens through which we can and should visualize and solve complex problems, organize government and multilateral bodies, establish international alliances, inspire national pride, restore positive feelings about America around the globe, embolden democracy, and ultimately, lead the world. More than anything, what this lens offers the next administration is a limitless capacity to handle all that comes its way, no matter how complex or unanticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an alternative way of governing, please do tell us about it in the comments. &lt;/p&gt;

Taken by Justin Quinnell, it shows the path of the Sun from winter to sumer over Bristol in the UK. Each arc is the Sun, blurred by its daily motion, and the differing heights of the arcs shows how the Sun’s position in the sky changes with seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinhole cameras are very cool; the hole is so small that any light rays from a small object entering it and hitting the film are naturally very close to parallel, and therefore in focus. You don’t need a lens! It’s similar to the depth-of-field issue versus aperture in a regular camera. Anyway, this is a very cool shot, and you should check out the New Scientist page, since it has more info, including links on how to do this yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

The tenets offer a tangible moral code, and answers to life’s toughest questions, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Why am I here?&lt;br&gt;
- What happens when I die/when my loved ones die?&lt;br&gt;
- Will those who get away with wrongdoing on earth ever be brought to justice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And often people equate this alleged peace of mind with a more peaceful existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Southern Mississippi performed a study to test that idea - to find out if an &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; in religious activity correllates with a &lt;em&gt;decrease&lt;/em&gt; in aggression.  The participants were asked to administer electric shocks to opponents in response to shocks given to them, after performing religious activities such as reading bible verses, praying, and meditating.  The control group performed no religious activities.  The intensity of the retribution shocks from both groups was compared to guage the level of aggression.  What do you think the results were?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does religion reduce aggression?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poetry submitted was fabulous, the YouTubery was rad, and the clay sculpture by Cassie was one of the greatest things I’ve ever seen in my life but alas I felt that declaring a &lt;a href="http://www.skepchick.org/teen"&gt;fellow Skepchick writer&lt;/a&gt; the winner would be unbecoming.

&lt;p&gt;There was one non-Skepchick who really shined, though, combining my innate egoism with my love of comic books (how did you know!?): FurryHermit, you totally owned the contest with &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/furry_hermit/2943859983/sizes/m/"&gt;this stellar cover art&lt;/a&gt;. You even worked in a unicorn! Well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, congratulations! You win all my love*, plus astronaut ice cream from Elyse**, plus a personal thank you note from me. Please send your name and mailing address to skepchick@skepchick.org in order to claim your prizes.&lt;/p&gt;

Some stories were repeated often around the fire while others, less favored, eventually faded into the hazy past.  Uninteresting details might be omitted by a storyteller, others elaborated.  New implications might be extracted—rules, roles, and ideas about the natural world--depending on the needs of the era.  The gods themselves matured. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The advent of writing changed this.  On the one hand, writing was one of humanity’s most powerful inventions.  It allowed information to be transmitted directly between people who didn’t know each other.  It allowed knowledge to accumulate.  But it also allowed ideas –especially those that couldn’t be tested—to stagnate.  Written words are frozen in time, a snapshot of the mind of the writer at a specific point in history.  Allegiance to a set of civic, moral or spiritual writings allows a person or a group of people to become developmentally arrested, bound to the insights and limitations of the authors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Canonization, the process by which an authoritative body designates a specific set of writings as complete, perfect, or more holy than all others, makes this worse.  Prior to canonization, a single fragment of text may be static but the mix can evolve, with some documents moving to the fore and others falling out of favor, perhaps being lost altogether.  Canonization freezes the mix, giving priority not only to the written word, but to a specific set of written words that have received the blessing of a specific human hierarchy.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ironically, the invention of the printing press, a world changing wonder insomuch as it accelerated the growth and spread of human knowledge, made even worse the opportunities for developmental arrest.  By making a static set of sacred texts widely available, it removed yet another form of flexibility and spiritual/moral growth.  Clergy could no longer selectively emphasize those canonical texts that fit the moral consciousness of a given time period (omitting the rest), without losing their authority in the minds of many adherents.   Some scholars have suggested that fundamentalism had its birth in the invention of the printing press, and that its spread across the planet region by region, religion by religion, has paralleled the growth of literacy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This leads to two conclusions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1:  Religious fundamentalism, a phenomenon that many consider one of the top current threats to our longevity as a species, can be thought of as problem of communication technology.  Specifically, it may be thought of as book worship or, in religious terms, bibliolatry.   Recall that an idol is an object (shaped by human minds and hands) that attempts to represent and communicate the essence of divinity.  For pre-literate people, statues, images, icons, and sacred spaces filled this role.   In an age of mobility and literacy, what better idol than a book?  And what more likely idolatry than bibliolatry?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2:  As a problem that originated in communications technology, the nuclear standoff of tribal fundamentalisms in which we live may be transcended also by communications technology.  Problems introduced by technological evolution frequently are solved by further technological evolution.  In fact, I might argue that they are rarely solved otherwise.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this light it is tremendously exciting that now, for the first time in human history, we have communication technologies that combine the best of oral tradition and the written word.  For the first time, utter strangers thousands of miles apart can exchange ideas and information via living documents that evolve continuously. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A book, they say, is out of date the day it is in print.  Not so with the Web.  Web 2.0 allows an individual text to evolve the way that oral instruction once did.  Wikipedia articles change daily as new information becomes available.  The Web also re-opens evolution at the level of the collection—a rich, indexed, ever-changing library replaces a canonical list of authoritative texts.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Savvy, entrepreneurial fundamentalists have latched onto new web technologies as a means of dispersing the words and world view of our Bronze Age ancestors, just as their ideological forebears did with the printing press.   But in their devotion to this world view they miss the stunning opportunity we have been given.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now as never before we have the means to honor not the answers of our spiritual ancestors but their questions:  What is Real?  What is Good?  How can we live in moral community with each other?  Because we have moved beyond the age of the book and of sacred books, we have the means to make this a conversation, not of a priestly class nor of a single culture, but of scholars and seekers and life lovers from every part of this precious planet.  Together we can take the conversation from where it got stuck and set it free once more to flow forward on the currents of human need and knowledge.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise. Seek what they sought.--Basho&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Valerie Tarico, Ph.D.&lt;br&gt;Seattle, 2008&lt;br&gt;www.wisdomcommons.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Although scientifically it’s just a tease, my favorite is this picture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/285935main_img5.4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/10/messenger_mercurycolor.jpg" alt="Mercury in color, by MESSENGER"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MESSENGER’s colorized Mercury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By eye, Mercury is a relatively uniform grey with splotches of variation in brightness. But MESSENGER’s sensitive cameras have filters on them which isolate different colors, and when put together and enhanced they show subtle color changes on the planet’s face. These colors are almost certainly due to changes in the composition of the rocks on the surface… in other words, MESSENGER can do mineralogical studies from space! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="left"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/285940main_img5.6_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/10/messenger_mercurycolor_zoom.jpg" alt="MESSENGER color shot of Mercury, zoomed"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this closeup view, younger terrain on the left is yellower, while older features appear blue. We know the area on the left is young because it’s smooth; it hasn’t been around long enough to get bombarded from space by comet and asteroid impacts. On the right, the material that appears blue may have been ejected by the impact that formed the crater on the right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, these colors are not nearly this striking to the eye! It’s only because we can enhance MESSENGER’s color information that these color features are visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the flyby was so fast that scientists can’t really interpret these colors and tag them to different kinds of minerals. But MESSENGER is going to settle into orbit around Mercury in 2011, and once it does, these cameras will map the surface to their hearts’ (well, CPUs’) content, providing us with incredible details of the content of this dinky, battered, roasted planet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Most people must have heard by now that about a week ago, T-mobile&lt;br&gt;
released the first Android based phone, with software by Google. I've been using an Android as a tester for about 6 weeks, and I'm now allowed  to talk about it, so I thought I'd post a review from the viewpoint of an extreme geek. Please excuse the low quality of the images; I took the pictures using my iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Obviously, there's a bit of a conflict of interest here. Google is very proud of the Android software, and I'm very happy and proud to be a software engineer at Google. I think that my review of the phone is fair
and unbiased, but take that with a grain of salt, given my connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; So, as I said, I've had the phone for about six weeks now. For a little over a year before I got my Android, I was using one of the original iPhones (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the 3g). So in a lot of things, I'm
going to compare my experiences with the Android to my experiences with the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Overall, I love the Android. It's not without its flaws, and some of them are fairly significant. I'll go into details below, but the short summary of my opinion is that the software is excellent, the hardware less so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; To be honest, I think the software is really late-beta quality. It's lacking polish, and there are a few awkward points. But overall, it's
extremely well done. Details below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

I often check for relative deficiencies in various vitamins related to neurological health, and even prescribe vitamins when supported by the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem with the current state of affair is that nutrtion and supplements are being “ghettoized” by the so-called alternative medicine movement.  Poor regulations are used (in fact were created) to bypass good science and create a hayday for snake-oil peddlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only bright spot is that good clinical trials involving supplements and nutrients are still being done and the mainstream standard of care is largely based upon evidence from these trials. The supplement and CAM marketplaces are blissfully disconnected from the evidence, and that’s the problem that needs to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large trial (35,000 men were enrolled) involving vitamin E and selenium for the prevention of prostate cancer&lt;a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-health/20081028/Prostate.Supplements/"&gt; was recently stopped&lt;/a&gt; because of lack of any benefit, and the small chance of risk, from the treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of more concern, slightly more users of vitamin E alone were getting prostate cancer — and slightly more selenium-only users were getting diabetes, the NCI said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t prove there is a risk from the supplements, the NCI stressed: Neither blip was statistically significant, meaning it could be a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without statistical significance it is likely that these correlations are random and not causative, but without any benefit the slight risk was not justified. Earlier smaller trials involving vitamin E and selenium for prostate cancer were positive. This was enough to justify the larger and more definitive trial, which is negative. This is a very common pattern in the medical literature (as I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=262"&gt;wrote about last week&lt;/a&gt; at SBM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of this trial are unfortunate - I certainly would like to be able to decrease my prostate cancer risk just by taking a vitamin - but it is best to have definitive evidence. Given that we are in the midst of a health-care cost crisis, it is extremely important to avoid wasting money on ineffective treatments. Ineffective treatments may also divert attention away from effective or potentially effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lessons from this and other similar large and negative trials is clear: We cannot rely upon the results of preliminary small trials. They are likely to be misleading and tend to be falsely positive. And - we need better regulations of supplements so that this valuable and very expensive-to-obtain scientific evidence gets put to maximal use.&lt;/p&gt;

Or text each other. Or put Islamic wallpapers on their cell phones. Oooh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, they could. So? We're living in a world where communications technologies are advancing rapidly and where people can &lt;i&gt;talk&lt;/i&gt; to each other constantly over long distances. This is a neutral technology; bad guys can use it, and so can good guys, and so can boring ordinary people who just want to chat about the weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latest threat: &lt;i&gt;Air&lt;/i&gt;.

Lately I've been getting lots of email from concerned locals who are worried about Tim Tingelstad, a candidate for the Minnesota Supreme Court, who is a &lt;a title="MPR: Bemidji judge challenges Supreme Court justice" href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/10/27/judicial_race/"&gt;religious wackaloon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone has an opinion or belief as to where absolute truth is and where it comes from, and that's what I'm telling people where I believe my rock solid foundation is," Tingelstad says. "I believe that absolute truth exists and that it comes from God."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s one of his milder statements. I&amp;#39;ve mentioned this guy before, but you all know how it is — judicial elections usually fly under the radar, and most people go into the voting booth with no clue about who these guys are, and they vote for the wrong reasons. In Minnesota, there is a bit of a tendency for candidates with good Scandinavian names to have an edge (Tingelstad doesn&amp;#39;t have an advantage here; his opponent is named Anderson), and there might be a little bit of an anti-incumbent bias this year (Tingelstad is a challenger), so no one knows how it could swing this time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's simple, though. Don't vote for &lt;a href="http://www.highesthill.com/"&gt;crazy Tingelstad&lt;/a&gt;; do vote for &lt;a href="http://www.justicepaulanderson.org/"&gt;Anderson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you really want a deranged theocratic god-babbler on the supreme court, of course.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/dont_vote_for_tingelstad.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/435899750" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225292669633"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/good-old-fashioned-1950s-corruption/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e5b32d591601dd49</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="corruption"/><category term="Ray Fisman"/><title type="html">Good Old-Fashioned 1950's Corruption</title><published>2008-10-29T14:31:59Z</published><updated>2008-10-29T14:31:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/72j6UDlMF9s/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/good-old-fashioned-1950s-corruption/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Economist Ray Fisman has a fascinating piece in Slate about insider trading surrounding a 1950's C.I.A. coup in Guatemala, and how some economists uncovered it.

Handley in the face of overwhelming epidemiological evidence that mercury in vaccines is in fact not detectably correlated with an increased incidence or risk of autism, there still remains a die-hard contingent who insists against all evidence that it's mercury that causes autism.

&lt;p&gt;Texans have a tough fight to make down there — keep plugging away!&lt;/p&gt;

Why would God do the greater deed and not also do the lesser deeds? This doesn't make sense of an omniscient, omnibenelovent, and omnipotent God. The excuses given for the paucity of evidence reveal that the Christian expects way too little from the God they believe in. [First posted 10/29/08]&lt;div&gt;

I am always left behind.  An even stupider one always comes along.  All I can say as of this morning is that I never thought I would see a story as stupid as this in a respected news source, and right now I cannot imagine how it could be surpassed (though within a few weeks I suppose it probably will be).  &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; has published (10/25/08:103) a &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12459697"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of a new book called &lt;em&gt;Alex &amp;amp; Me&lt;/em&gt; in which Dr Irene Pepperberg tells the story of her scientific life with Alex the grey parrot (see &lt;a href="http://158.130.17.5/~myl/languagelog/archives/004897.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004924.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of Alex's earlier appearances on Language Log Classic). &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; has already shown a certain affection for Alex's story: it devoted its obituary of the week to Alex when he died in 2007. The review calls the new book "a memoir of two unusual scientific careers, one of them pursued — not exactly by choice — by a bird." Now, I should make it clear that I do not have the book.  If this merited scholarly investigation I would of course obtain it; but given what I know so far, I am deeply reluctant to part with $23.95 to get hold of a trade book for sentimental parrot fanciers (the subtitle is: "How a Scientist and a Parrot Uncovered a Hidden World of Animal Intelligence — And Formed a Deep Bond in the Process").  So I will simply tell you about the stunningly stupid part of the review, and leave it to you to determine, if you care to, whether the review misrepresents the book on this point.  But I warn you, especially if you know a little elementary articulatory phonetics, that this one will boggle your mind. Are you prepared to face the rest of the day with a boggled mind?  Then read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review is anonymous, like all &lt;em&gt;Economist&lt;/em&gt; reviews, and after what I will say below, the reviewer will doubtless come to see this as quite a blessing.  What the reviewer reports, relying on the book, is that Alex the parrot didn't just chat with his keeper and keep her entertained, and know how to name fifty objects and the numbers from 1 to 6, and combine words to make up expressions (Alex is said to have named cake "yummy bread", though why this is counted as a creative act rather than a failure to learn the simple word &lt;em&gt;cake&lt;/em&gt; is not clear from the review); the thing is, Alex also "seemed to combine phonemes to construct new words".  This is a true first: creative lexical word formation from phonological segments, in a bird.  An example is cited:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#aa0000"&gt; Lacking lips, he could not pronounce the letter "p", so his term for an apple was "banerry" (apparently mixing "banana" and "cherry"). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you probably caught it.  The phonemes (systematically distinct speech sound units) that humans produce by bringing together the upper and lower lips, known as &lt;strong&gt;bilabial&lt;/strong&gt; consonants, include [p] as in &lt;em&gt;pop&lt;/em&gt;, [b] as in &lt;em&gt;bob&lt;/em&gt;, and [m] as in &lt;em&gt;mom&lt;/em&gt;.  Say these words while looking in a mirror and you will see that your lips come together.  And when you say "banerry" or "banana", of course, it happens just the same.  Apparently the reviewer did not have the intelligence to reflect on why failing to learn one word with a [p] in it should have something to do with not having lips, when pronouncing [b] was apparently no problem for the self-same bird.  I stared at the page, almost unable to believe what an asinine thing had been printed there.  (I have no idea whether the reviewer's remark has a basis in the text of the book.  Quite possibly it doesn't.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer dumbness of the reviewer's remark gets even worse if you reflect a little more.  Parrots don't have upper front teeth either, or the bony gum-covered area behind them that is known as the alveolar ridge, or a velum (the soft membrane at the back of the mouth) that can be lowered to open the velic port between pharynx and nasal cavity, so by the logic of the above quote they should also be unable to pronounce [n], a nasal consonant produced by lowering the velum and making a closure in the oral cavity by pressing the tongue tip against the alveolar ridge.  In fact parrots have just about none of the articulatory apparatus that humans have, which should mean they are utterly without the ability to mimic any human speech, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not.  They mimic the sound of human utterances brilliantly. But they do it in a totally different way, simulating the acoustic effect (not the articulatory production) by means of an organ known as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrinx_(biology)"&gt;syrinx&lt;/a&gt;, which birds have and humans don't.  This clever flute-like organ works for mimicking all kinds of sound without using anything like the organs or movements humans make do with.  Parrots don't need the anatomical attributes of the human oro-pharyngeal tract any more than an iPod or a radio does.  One of the staggering things about the quoted statement is that the reviewer didn't appreciate that obvious point.  I suppose it's just one more measure of how little knowledge educated people have about phonetics.  After a hundred years of really detailed work (three thousand years if you want to take things back to the age of the brilliant phoneticians and phonologists of ancient India) the study of the general nature of speech sounds and how they are produced is still almost unknown to the general public.  And the typical undergraduate career in a university includes not one single course on elementary aspects of the science of language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's more to be said about the review, and doubtless, far more than I'm ever going to say about the book.  But taking [b] to be a suitable substitute for [p] in a creature with no lips looked to me like definitely the dumbest piece of science writing about animal communication this month.  (It's October 29; there's only two more days for some &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000400.html"&gt;stupid fake pet communication trick&lt;/a&gt; story to beat it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[P.S.: I get a lot of flak for being skeptical about whether people's pets understand everything they say and name lots of objects and communicate with them better than a human child could etc. etc.  But, mindful of the spirit of democracy that animates our great blogosphere, I have opened comments on this post.  So below you will probably soon be able to read a long series of boring grumbles and sentimental special pleading by gullible bird-lovers who hate me. Enjoy.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

I own a bootleg copy of the Star Wars Holiday Special I bought for $20 at a comic shop in California when I was 12. It was so not worth it.&lt;br&gt;2. At a convention a few years back, I told R.A.

My mother says it's boring. I say it's simple. I'll know exactly what I'll be wearing every day. Besides, I look good in jeans and a black t-shirt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm afraid I'm going to break rule 4 and thus rule 5 as well. BD tagged pretty much everyone I'd tag, so I'm not going to try.

Vernon, Ohio, City Schools.  &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/10/freshwater-hear.html" rel=""&gt;Days 1 and 2 are here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three witnesses testified today, Zachary Dennis, the boy who was (allegedly) burned with a Tesla coil, his mother Jenifer Dennis, and Freshwater.  We’re still in the stage where the Board of Education is presenting its case for termination; later Freshwater will be allowed to put on a defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summaries below the fold.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Zachary Dennis Direct Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up was Zachary Dennis, who was in Freshwater’s 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade class last year.  Under direct examination by David Millstone, the Board’s attorney, he walked through a number of the issues that have been raised in the case.  This is a summary of that testimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freshwater used the Tesla coil in science class to demonstrate how different gases displayed different colors when ionized.  But he also used it to demonstrate the effects of the output on students.  He first lined volunteers up in a daisy chain, holding hands, and zapped the first student in the chain to see how far the shock would propagate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then solicited volunteers to be zapped individually.  Zach described how he placed his hand on the plate of an overhead projecter.  According to Zach’s testimony, Freshwater held his hand down and made two vertical passes with the Tesla coil and two horizontal passes.  Zach testified that Freshwater told him that “It was like a temporary tattoo and those crosses would last a while.”  When specifically questioned about it, Zach affirmed that “those crosses” was Freshwater’s phrase.  Zach also testified that Freshwater “zapped” another special needs student from behind as the student bent to pick something up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zach testified that there was discomfort immediately after the event, and that it became worse as the night wore on, possibly because his hockey goalie gear contributed to the irritation.  Even before that, however, it was red and blotchy, he said.  He couldn’t sleep for the burning sensation it gave him that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zach testified that Freshwater brought up religion in class in several ways.  First, he used a video, “The Watchmaker,” that likens life to a watch (Paley, anyone?).  Millstone showed the video in the hearing room.  It’s pure Paley, and was produced by &lt;a href="http://kids4truth.com/screensavers.htm" rel="external "&gt;Truth4kids.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Truth4kids is run by an engineer named Dave Hawkins, known on multiple web forums as “afdave.”  Dave also blogs at &lt;a href="http://truthmatters.info/" rel="external "&gt;Truthmatters&lt;/a&gt;, and he is a young-earth creationist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zach testified that Freshwater referred to a “higher being” in the context of Big Bang theory.  When teaching the Big Bang, a girl in the class commented “This is magic!”, and Freshwater replied “Or a higher being.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zach testified that Freshwater used a handout which said that someone had taken a sample from a Mt. St. Helen’s deposit after the eruption and had it “carbon dated” and it came back dated at millions of years old, when it was supposedly from a 10 year-old deposit by the volcano.  That might be associated with &lt;a href="http://noanswersingenesis.org.au/mt_st_helens_dacite_kh.htm" rel="external "&gt;Steve Austin mis-sampling specimens&lt;/a&gt; in a well-rebutted case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either in a handout or in class Freshwater was claimed to have repeated the tired &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CE/CE101.html" rel="external "&gt;YEC moon dust argument&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zach testified that Freshwater used Answers in Genesis as an internet resource in class, and assigned Zach to do some reading of AIG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zach testified that Freshwater taught what he called “hydrosphere theory.”  Asked to describe it, Zach outlined another creationist classic, &lt;a href="http://www.godandscience.org/youngearth/canopy.html" rel="external "&gt;Water Vapor Canopy&lt;/a&gt;.  Freshwater apparently didn’t explicitly tie that to Noah’s Flood, though Zach testified that’s how he interpreted it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zach testified that Freshwater encouraged Fellowship of Student Athletes members to call the local movie theater to ask that it show “Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed.”  Further, Freshwater accompanied a number of FCA students to a showing of it.  In his science class he gave an extra-credit assignment to students to write an “unbiased” paragraph about the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zach testified that Freshwater had a signaling system, so when the class encountered something in text or lecture that wasn’t necessarily true, like an old earth, they were to signal that by saying “Here!”  The meaning was that no one was there to see it, and therefore it is not necessarily trustworthy.  (Recall &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;Kent Hovind’s&lt;/span&gt; Ken Ham’s “Were you there?” rhetoric.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though as a faculty monitor of FCA Freshwater was not supposed to participate or lead, Zach testified that Freshwater participated in and led prayers with the FCA leadership group,  selected videos for them to see (Including “Obsession,” an anti-muslim video), picked some of the speakers, and occasionally picked students to lead prayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zach testified that Freshwater told him to call two potential FCA speakers, and gave him their phone numbers, violating the instruction to FCA monitors that they are not to take the lead in such matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zach said that FCA students were told by Freshwater that they shouldn’t see “The Golden Compass,” the movie made from the first of Pullman’s trilogy.  My notes don’t tell me if he told them why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zachary Cross Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no cross examination.  Kelly Hamilton, Freshwater’s attorney, elected to forgo cross since Zach will be called as a hostile witness for direct examination when Freshwater puts on his case.  He made the same decision about Zach’s mother.  The attorney for the Board, David Millstone, argued that forgoing cross-examination is forgoing cross examination, and Hamilton has his chance now and in direct during Freshwater’s case shouldn’t be allowed to (in effect) do cross then.  After mulling over lunch, the referee ruled that he saw no reason for limits on Hamilton during a subsequent direct examination.  I suspect there’s much looking up of cases on both sides overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenifer Dennis Direct Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zach’s mother Jenifer testified next.  She related how Zach came home from school and showed her the mark.  She was concerned, but with a neighbor there and Zach due to be driven 1.5 hours to hockey practice (for the obvious reason that Mt. Vernon doesn’t have any ice) she didn’t make a big deal of it then.  She did take two pictures of the injury with her digital camera.  Later her husband called her from the rink and said Zach was complaining of pain in his arm and was using it strangely on the rink.  He took pictures of it with his cell phone.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Added in edit 11/2/08]  Mother informed me that she actually took the pictures late that night after Zachary arrived home following hockey practice, and that’s what she recalled testifying.  That’s plausible – my notes are occasionally fragmentary.  Her husband took cell phone pictures of Zachary’s arm at hockey practice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In answer to a direct question from Millstone she denied “doctoring” the pics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Zach got home (around 11:30) he was tired and went to bed.  However, he couldn’t sleep and called her in.  She took more pictures, but elected not to take him to the emergency room.  She’s a former surgical technician and evaluated the marks as non-threatening, on the order of a bad sunburn or a burn from a stove burner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning she and her husband went to the school with the pictures and talked with the Superintendent, Steve Short (who testified on Days 1 &amp;amp; 2 linked above).  They told Short the didn’t want Freshwater to be fired, but wanted to ensure that whatever caused the marks to be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, there was no cross examination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Freshwater’s Direct Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone called John Freshwater as a hostile witness for direct examination.  First Millstone rehearsed various public statements Freshwater has made: that hed never burned or branded an student and had never taught creationism.  Millstone played videos of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1M9nJpnol4" rel="external "&gt;Freshwater speaking to the Board of Education&lt;/a&gt; in August 2008 and an interview with Fox News sometime in the summer (I didn’t get the URL for the latter).  Both supported the assertions above.  Freshwater testified that there are three categories: evolution, creationism, and intelligent design.  He said that he teaches evolution and not the other two, and that’s been true through his (24-year) career. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He testified that he’d used the Tesla coil on somewhere in the range of 500 to 600 students through the years.  He identified two examples of Tesla coils that had been removed from the middle school as similar to the one he’d used, but said that he still has the one he used.  Pressed by Millstone, Freshwater did not account for taking the school property home.  Asked “Were you authorized b anyone to take it from the school?” he answered “No.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked what a Tesla coil is used for, he responded to show gases of different colors when ionized, and to study human reactions.  (That last may not be a direct quote, but it’s close.)  Asked what Tesla coils are used for outside the classroom, he responded that he didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He testified that he knew the Tesla coil generated over 20,000 volts, but doesn’t know how long he’s known that – perhaps 21 years (the length of time he’s been teaching in Mt. Vernon.).  He wouldn’t say if 20,000 volts to 45,000 volts is “high” voltage.  He wasn’t certain if he knew previously that it operated at 500 KHz.  He doesn’t know if the small amount of ozone produced by its operation is hazardous.  He had never seen an instruction manual for the device.  He was shown the instruction manual downloaded from the manufacturer’s web site by the independent investigator.  He was asked to read into the record excerpts from it bearing on the safety warning to not allow it to touch skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to December 6, 2007, when Zachary was injured, and concerning the special needs student who was “zapped,” Freshwater said that it was inadvertent, that the boy was walking past him and he accidentally contacted the tip of the Tesla coil.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on to the Zachary incident, Freshwater described how the dais chain had himself as the first link contacting the Tesla coil, with students chained from him.  Again, it was to see how far the electricity would propagate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freshwater then solicited individual volunteers to be shocked.  Zachary was among 4-6 volunteers.  Freshwater denied holding Zachary’s hand on the overhead table, saying the kids just held out their arms and usually quickly withdrew them when the first shock was applied.  Asked why they withdrew quickly, he said “Because it hurts.”  He said he always shocks himself first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He denied seeing a mark on Zachary after the shock, and did not recall calling it a temporary tattoo or a cross.  He did acknowledge saying he put an “X” on Zachary’s arm.  He denied that the pictures taken by Jenifer Dennis and entered as exhibits were an accurate depiction of what was on Zachary’s arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if he knew any reason Zach would not tell the truth, he answered, “No.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if when students are zapped individually does it leave a mark, Freshwater responded “A slight reddening.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on to FCA, there was some testimony about confusion over parental permission to attend FCA concerning whether it had to be written or could be verbal over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freshwater denied initiating contact with potential speakers at FCA.  Confronted with an email from his school account to a potential speaker, he claimed his daughter, an FCA member, must have used his official school email account to invite the speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freshwater acknowledged telling Zach to call a couple of speakers and giving him their phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to a series of questions, Freshwater denied leading FCA meetings, denied selecting videos for FCA meetings, and denied praying at FCA meetings.  He explained that last by saying “I pray all the time, sir.”  He testified that it was his daughter’s suggestion to show “Obsession,” the anti-Muslim video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus endeth the morning session at 1:15 pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon session Millstone turned to the issue of religious displays in Freshwater’s classroom.  After establishing the timeline for their removal (Apr 6-16 2008), Millstone asked about the two books Freshwater checked out of the middle school library and placed on his science table in the classroom.  They were a Bible and a book titled “Jesus of Nazareth.”  Asked why he had them there, Freshwater responded that since he’d been instructed to keep his own Bible out of sight during class time and had not done so, he was afraid he’d come into his classroom some morning and find his own Bible gone and wanted the other available since the Bible is his inspiration.  He did not recall saying he had them there to “make a point” as the independent investigator’s report alleged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He recalled the middle school principal telling him that it would be insubordination to fail to comply with the instruction to keep his Bible out of sight during class hours, but then said he didn’t think it was insubordination.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He agreed that he had posters from an evangelistic event of Will Graham in 2007 but didn’t recall if he posted them in his classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged having had a short class discussion of the meaning of Easter in the context of teaching lunar calendars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He denied showing “The Watchmaker” in class, claiming that his daughter selected it for showing at FCA after watching it at home.  He couldn’t remember how he got it.  (I’ll note that the version shown in the hearing room during Zach’s testimony appeared to be the original, down to the original file name.  It wasn’t the Youtube version.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was asked if Answers in Genesis is an apologetics site.  He didn’t know, and characterized it as an “informational” site.  He was then asked to read into the record the first paragraph from the &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/about" rel="external "&gt;AIG “About Us” page&lt;/a&gt; identifying it as an apologetics ministry.  He acknowledged referring Zachary to AIG, and also showed the AIG site in class.  He acknowledged making AIG-based assignments to perhaps a dozen students in the 2007-8 school ear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on to the Big Bang, he acknowledged that he discussed “hydrosphere theory” as Zachary had testified.  He said it was in the context of discussing alternatives.  It was never clear what hydrosphere theory has to do with the origin of the universe.  He evaded question about what hydrosphere theory implies.  (Noah’s Flood wasn’t directly mentioned.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked to define a scientific theory, he responded “Something that’s backed up with scientific information and knowledge, that’s not completely proved.  It’s not a law yet.”  (That’s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; close to a direct quote, if perhaps not precisely so.  Freshwater speaks softly and it was often hard to hear him even though I was in the front row.  I have no idea how the court reporter coped, though her ears are about 30 years younger than mine.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if a scientific theory was merely a hypothetical, Freshwater responded “There may be some doubt.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked “Is hydrosphere theory a scientific theory?” Freshwater answered “Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked “In order to be accepted, does a scientific theory have to be published in reputable scientific journals and be subject to peer review?” Freshwater answered “No.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if he presided over a debate in his classroom in 2007-2008 on evolution vs. creationism, he answered “Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked what the scientific consensus is about the age of the universe he answered “About 20 billion years.”  Scientific consensus on the age of the earth?  “About 5 billion years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freshwater acknowledged telling students in class that it was possible that humans and dinosaurs were on the earth together at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freshwater affirmed that he told students that &lt;em&gt;Tyrannosaurus rex&lt;/em&gt; had teeth that were “not deep enough” for it to be a carnivore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freshwater acknowledged that he read (portions of?) &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;amp;field-keywords=%22Chicken+soup+for+the+teenage+soul%22&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0" rel="external "&gt;Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul&lt;/a&gt; in class (not clear which particular member of that group of books was used).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handed two worksheets, “Giraffes” and “Woodpeckers,” he acknowledged that the last question on each was identical: “Was an ID involved?”  Freshwater denied knowing whether “ID” in that context meant “intelligent designer,” and could not recall where he got the worksheets.  He testified that he didn’t use them after 2003 when his proposal to adopt the &lt;a href="http://www.intelligentdesignnetwork.org/" rel="external "&gt;Intelligent Design Network&lt;/a&gt; “Objective Origins Policy” was rejected by the Board of Education.  He also testified that he used Wells’ &lt;a href="http://www.iconsofevolution.com/embedJonsArticles.php3?id=1209" rel="external "&gt;Survival of the Fakest&lt;/a&gt; until 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if he had heard complaints on multiple occasions from high school science teachers about his teaching, he answered “Yes.”  Asked about the topic of their complaints, he responded “How I teach evolution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on to &lt;em&gt;Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed&lt;/em&gt;, he acknowledged that he had called the theater to ask them to show the movie, and said it was his daughter’s idea to take a group of FCA students to it.  (Are we sensing a theme yet?)  Freshwater evaded answering whether Zachary’s testimony that he had encouraged FCA members to also call the theater was accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did not recall telling students that homosexuality is a sin, but did acknowledge using an analogy between sexuality and magnets, saying opposite poles attract and similar poles repel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if he used a Kent Hovind video, he said “Pieces of it.  It relates to the standards that I teach to.”  Asked what pieces, he responded “It’s about whales, moths.”  Asked what it purports to teach or show, he responded “It examines evolution.  It’s showing evidence of evolution.  It’s talking about the evolving (sic) of whales.”  He would not disagree that it is questioning evolution.  (Sorry for the syntax: That’s the way the question was worded.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked why he kept Wells’ &lt;em&gt;Icons of Evolution&lt;/em&gt; in his room, Freshwater responded that “It’s looking at evolution and the icons of it.”  He agreed that it was not supportive of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a reprise of videos:  Does he have a video called “Ten Lies of Evolution” in his room?  “Yes.”  Does he have a book titled “Refuting Evolution” in his room?  “Yes.”  Has he shown a video on the Loch Ness Monster that says the earth is less than 6,000 years old?  Not since 2003.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to his 2003 proposal, Freshwater didn’t know where he got the “Objective Origins Policy.”  He didn’t know much about the Discovery Institute.  He said he was “closely tracking” the No Child Left Behind Act at that time (presumably the so-called Santorum Amendment, though that wasn’t explicit in the testimony).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, earlier in his testimony he said “it is possible” that he told students in some context that Catholics are not Christians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, Freshwater’s attorney elected to forgo cross examination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus endeth the third day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editorial Note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to stay more or less neutrally reportial in this summary.  However, as you all know, I’m a partisan.    I’m too damned tired to editorialize; I think it’s obvious in the summary of Freshwater’s testimony that he is incompetent to teach science in the public schools.  I leave rounding up news stories to commenters: I’m too tired now, and there’s another day tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow: The fourth day.&lt;/p&gt;

But the difference between that and an amateur, who technically does it for fun, is getting hard to tell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take this image of Pluto and its moon Charon taken by so-called amateur astronomers Antonello Medugno and Daniele Gasparri from Italy: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/10/charon_amateur.jpg" alt="Pluto and Charon from amateurs"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bright blob on the right is Pluto, and Charon is on the left. The separation is 0.7 arcseconds, an incredible feat (the Moon is 2500 times wider than this in the sky). This is definitely Charon; it’s at the correct position, separation, and brightness. They nailed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind you, Charon wasn’t even discovered until 1978 by a pro, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DNwfG5hQ7-YC&amp;amp;pg=PA427&amp;amp;lpg=PA427&amp;amp;dq=charon+christy+palomar++telescope&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ots=BoREmUmqkc&amp;amp;sig=knw76nXDfnueI2obiuNG4XxcDiQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;resnum=8&amp;amp;ct=result"&gt;using a 61 inch telescope&lt;/a&gt;! The image above was using a 14″ telescope, and is in fact much better than the discovery image. In 30 years of progress, a much smaller commercial telescope can do better than a professional setup could. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, an amateur used an iPhone (and a telescope) &lt;a href="http://www.macobserver.com/article/2008/10/28.5.shtml"&gt;to capture this image of Jupiter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.macobserver.com/article/2008/10/28.5.shtml"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/10/iphone_jupiter.jpg" alt="iPhone image of Jupiter"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, it’s not the best, but c’mon, &lt;em&gt;it was taken with an iPhone&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in the future. Still no flying cars, but we live in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited to add: I did not include any of the technical descriptions of the Charon image, and I should have.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equipment: Meade L200GPS 14″ at f/25, with a Starlight Xpress SXV-H9 CCD&lt;br&gt;
Image scale: 0.15″/pixel, unbinned&lt;br&gt;
Exposure: 6 seconds/frame&lt;br&gt;
Filters: R +Ir (Baader)&lt;br&gt;
Final image: 21 frames, median combined, deconvolved to enhance sharpness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Pluto was 31 AU away, at a mag of 13.9 and Charon was mag 15.5. The images were taken on August 19, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	DonorsChoose drive is ending in just a couple of days! A small number of readers have made extremely generous contributions, which
	is very gratifying. (One person has even taken me up on my offer

	write you a blog article on that topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This post repeats a bunch of stuff that I mentioned in one of my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/goodmath/basics/"&gt;basics&lt;/a&gt; posts last year on the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/01/basics_margin_of_error.php"&gt;margin of error&lt;/a&gt;. But given some of the awful rubbish I've heard in coverage of the coming election, I thought it was worth discussing a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As the election nears, it seems like every other minute, we
hear predictions of the outcome of the election, based on polling. The
thing is, pretty much &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; one of those reports is 
utter rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, the citizens of the area have enjoyed a little notoriety and had some fun with the attention, marketing restaurants and merchandising various things with alien themes, a la Roswell, New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, some folks just can’t have the fun without the belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems &lt;a href="http://www.khou.com/topstories/stories/khou081027_mp_stephenville-ufo-sitings.155dda835.html"&gt;the lights in the Texas sky have returned&lt;/a&gt; ( see the news footage video &lt;a href="http://www.khou.com/video/index.html?nvid=296553"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and many people are as convinced as ever that something extraterrestrial is going on. It doesn’t matter that the military has confirmed that half a dozen or so F-16s out of Fort Worth were training in the area at the time of the sightings. Most of the people interviewed claim that the lights they saw were visible well before the F-16’s showed up, leading the really hardcore UFO “experts” to insist that the military jets were in pursuit of the “alien space craft”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, I suppose if I lived in that part of the state, I might just need a little extra something to make my life exciting, too.&lt;/p&gt;

I include them because I think it's important for people to see exactly what white supremacists say in their own words, if they are curious to do so and thus learn how low these people will go. However, if you're at work you may not want to click on them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Regular readers of this blog know that I have a major interest in World War II history and the Holocaust. Specifically, I've spent a fair amount of time writing about &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/history/holocaust_denial/"&gt;Holocaust denial&lt;/a&gt;. My interest in Holocaust denial derives from two sources. First, it's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/08/how_i_discovered_holocaust_denial.php"&gt;disgust&lt;/a&gt; at the racism, Hitler apologia, and anti-Semitism that are always at the root of it, no matter how much Holocaust deniers try to deny them as the motivation for their denial. Scratch a Holocaust denier, and you will always--I repeat, &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;--&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/08/pseudohistory_and_pseudoscience_1.php"&gt;find an anti-Semite&lt;/a&gt; and very likely also either a fascist sympathizer or admirer of Hitler. Second, I'm interested in Holocaust denial in the context of skepticism. After all, Holocaust denial is, boiled down to its core, merely a very, very despicable form of woo, in which conspiracies to keep The Truth secret in order to protect The Prevailing Dogma run rampant. The parallels to "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/breast_cancer_awareness_month_abused_by.php"&gt;alternative medicine&lt;/a&gt;" and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/04/bioethicist_art_caplan_the_darwinhitler.php"&gt;creationism&lt;/a&gt; are obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, one thing that's happened as I've delved into Holocaust denial over the last ten years is that I've come face-to-face with some of the ugliest beliefs humans hold, so much so that at times it beggared the imagination that fellow humans could actually seriously hold such vile beliefs. It's impossible to study Holocaust denial and avoid facing this, as Holocaust denial is so deeply entwined in so much of neo-Nazi and/or white supremacist belief systems. It's also hard not to become aware of the white supremacist and fascist underworld that exists in the U.S. and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why I'm not at all surprised about the ridiculously botched &lt;a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jsCEnrVzDQoU5tg63njLNy0UTDNAD943BSV00"&gt;assassination plot against Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; that was recently broken up. The only thing I'm surprised about is that there hasn't been one before. As a black man who is likely to win the election and become the President of the United States in one week, Obama represents a profound threat to the mental midgets who hold to white supremacist philosophy. Consider this: If law-abiding people with racist views &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/i_cant_believe_people_like_this_exist.php"&gt;find Obama threatening&lt;/a&gt;, imagine how much more so white supremacists do. In fact, Obama is an even worse threat to them in that he is not simply a black man but is biracial, the product of "miscegenation," something white supremacists detest almost above all else. For example, on the &lt;a href="http://www.stormfront.org/forum/showthread.php?t=527226" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stormfront&lt;/a&gt; discussion forum we find:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/the_white_supremacist_plot_to_kill_barac.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/the_white_supremacist_plot_to_kill_barac.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/435081630" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225226889711"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/with-road-safety-like-this-who-needs-drunk-drivers/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9511a20e80321f7c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="safety"/><category term="traffic"/><title type="html">With Road Safety Like This, Who Needs Drunk Drivers?</title><published>2008-10-28T20:10:29Z</published><updated>2008-10-28T20:10:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/0KrjMne3cSo/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/with-road-safety-like-this-who-needs-drunk-drivers/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Photo: Clav

A few weeks ago, I was driving with my family in upstate New York on one of those open two-lane highways where it's pretty easy to do 60 m.p.h. even though you probably shouldn't. (The posted speed limit is 55.) The road is dotted with farmhouses from which the occasional dog can dart out, [...]

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some experience with photography, but how much does it take to do things like get the angle and lighting right? The new shot is plastic looking and two-dimensional. I have been harboring deeply-hidden pessimistic thoughts about the new Trek movie, and this picture brings them to the surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie better be &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike that picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I say there? Oh yeah: &lt;strong&gt;FAIL&lt;/strong&gt;. I mean, c’mon, that &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be wrong.

But the other interesting revelation is that while denouncing earmarks for studying &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2008/10/07/john_mccain_bears/"&gt;bear DNA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/08/mccains-planetariophobia/"&gt;overhead projectors&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/sarah_palin_ignorant_and_antis.php"&gt;fruit fly research&lt;/a&gt;, the complaint is not about &lt;i&gt;earmarks&lt;/i&gt;, but about funding science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we tell? It turns out that &lt;a href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=4E2E5BFD-18FE-70B2-A815903CFF648F68"&gt;Sarah Palin was happy to lobby for earmarks&lt;/a&gt; to study recreational halibut fishing, the mating habits of crabs, and harbor seal DNA. Those all sound like legitimate science projects to me, but I doubt that Palin recognized that — all she cares about is diverting money to her bailiwick. This is a different kind of abuse of science, where it&amp;#39;s seen only as a tool for local profit … and you just know that she would not support even local science that interfered with her plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/these_guys_really_hate_science.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/435054010" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225222366618"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/why_good_medicine_requires_mat.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e42397afb5d45451</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Woo"/><title type="html">Why good medicine requires materialism</title><published>2008-10-28T18:15:41Z</published><updated>2008-10-28T18:15:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/434991853/why_good_medicine_requires_mat.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/why_good_medicine_requires_mat.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I don't like to repost, but Steve Novella has &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=402"&gt;some great pieces up&lt;/a&gt; right now, and this is directly related. --PalMD&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday afternoon, I'll be at the University of Guelph for an informal discussion, so you can ask me questions there.

According to Google's &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/20081027_booksearchagreement.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the settlement resolves lawsuits from the Authors Guild and five major publishers (McGraw-Hill, Pearson Education, Penguin, Wiley, and Simon &amp;amp; Schuster).  Google will shell out $125 million, much of which will be used to establish the Book Rights Registry, a system for locating and representing copyright holders (a way of dealing with so-called &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_works"&gt;orphan works&lt;/a&gt;").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One key aspect of the settlement, discussed on the &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/10/new-chapter-for-google-book-search.html"&gt;Google Book Search blog&lt;/a&gt;, is that GBS will now be able to display millions of books that are in copyright but out of print:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this agreement, in-copyright, out-of-print books will now be  available for readers in the U.S. to search, preview and buy online —  something that was simply unavailable to date. Most of these books are  difficult, if not impossible, to find. They are not sold through  bookstores or held on most library shelves, yet they make up the vast  majority of books in existence. Today, Google only shows snippets of  text from the books where we don&amp;#39;t have copyright holder permission.  This agreement enables people to preview up to 20% of the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s extremely welcome news for researchers who have been frustrated by the limitations of Google&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;snippet view.&amp;quot; Now (at least in the U.S.) we&amp;#39;ll get far more books in &amp;quot;limited preview,&amp;quot; where you can actually see full page images. Even if that viewing option is restricted to 20 percent of a book&amp;#39;s page extent, it&amp;#39;s still a vast improvement over the godforsaken snippets. Even better, the settlement provides for &amp;quot;free, full-text, online viewing of millions of out-of-print books at designated computers in U.S. public and university libraries,&amp;quot; so if you need a book in full view you can just head over to a library — or at least one that carries Google&amp;#39;s new institutional subscription. Combined with the establishment of the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=602"&gt;Hathi Trust&lt;/a&gt; for access to public-domain materials (before the 1923 copyright cut-off for U.S. titles), things are definitely looking up for the future of digitized research.&lt;/p&gt;

I hesitate to call them that, because I associate belief with faith, with thinking something is true without evidence. But it also commonly means just things you think are true, no matter why you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, its important to sit back sometimes and look at something you think to be true, and examine it. Why do you think it? What’s the evidence? Have things changed since you first adopted that position?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the election coming up, I find myself doing this more often. And then &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3841"&gt;Rebecca Watson at Skepchick&lt;/a&gt; sent me a note about the issue of gay marriage. Proposition 8 in California goes up for vote on the 4th, and if passed will basically outlaw gay marriage in that state. Rebecca helped make &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3kxDFgmu8"&gt;a very interesting video&lt;/a&gt; about it, comparing gay marriage to interracial marriage. Watch the video, then read on below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;

&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/2H3kxDFgmu8%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done? OK, good. Now first, my own thoughts are that being gay is not a choice, it’s just something you are, just like being heterosexual. You don’t choose that either! So to discriminate based on orientation is silly. If you have a distaste for gay people, well, that’s your own feeling. I don’t necessarily condemn it, as long as people understand that it’s a subjective, personal thing. I loathe cucumbers, but I don’t want to amend the state Constitution to forbid others from even putting it in their salads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video is interesting; my first reaction to it, honestly, was the thought that bigotry against gays is different than against race. Then I thought about it some more, and I had a hard time coming up with evidence for that conjecture. How are they different? Being gay is no more a choice than being white, or Asian, or black. Many religious texts have bad things to say about gays, but then many have bad things to say about blacks (like the Book of Mormon, &lt;del&gt;and the Bible&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;see the note at the bottom of this entry&lt;/em&gt;). Yet our country has striven to ensure blacks have the same rights as whites — somewhat imperfectly, certainly, but we’re trying. So how is being gay different?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if someone were to come up with some difference — and I’m willing to listen — then the video still has impact. I would think that most people have little or no issues with interracial couples, and ones who do are an endangered species (I hope). So by changing the wording of the video a little bit, it contrasts feelings about homosexuality with feelings about race. It forces you to examine your thoughts on both. We &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; have far better feelings about race as a country than we did a few decades ago. Yes, a lot of ugliness in the populace is surfacing about Obama, but I still think that kind of person is in the minority. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2005/04/07/14/"&gt;That contrasts pretty strongly with feelings about sexual orientation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my first reaction to the video was, I think, way off. I think now I was wrong because gayness and race aren’t that dissimilar, and even if they are, that’s not the point of the video. It’s to reveal bigotry in any of its guises, and for that it does a pretty good job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video itself may actually have some impact on Prop 8. Hard to say. But it’s had an impact on me, and in an interesting way. I hope that people will watch videos like that, and examine their own &amp;quot;beliefs&amp;quot;. Even though it’s October, it’s always a good time for a little mental spring cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note added later: I originally said the Bible had bad things to say about blacks. After reading the comments, and looking into this deeper, I discovered that this is a relatively recent interpretation. The Bible essentially condones slavery, and that was used to support the idea of black slavery, and the &amp;quot;Curse of Ham&amp;quot; (what I was basing my statement on) was interpreted to mean blacks. So I was wrong about the Bible saying bad things about blacks in particular. I’ll note, however, that the Old Testament, specifically Leviticus, is chock full of other horrors to our modern sense. The point is, looking to religious texts you will find plenty of examples of intolerance. The Sermon on the Mount — the best speech in the Bible — is cherry picked or ignored by people who use the Bible on which to base their own intolerance. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225212196191"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/are-gun-shows-dangerous/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6379cd48799ac920</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="guns"/><category term="Media"/><title type="html">Are Gun Shows Dangerous?</title><published>2008-10-28T16:20:40Z</published><updated>2008-10-28T16:20:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/6eDT_jgM0s4/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/are-gun-shows-dangerous/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Photo: Michael (mx5tx)

Here’s her letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’ve been a dedicated listener for over a year now, ever since my boyfriend found your podcast.  I am a Ph.D. student in psychology, have Health Sciences Master’s and Undergraduate degrees, and work as a researchers for the Federal government.  However, I am being faced with a personal crisis that threatens to overwhelm me with pseudoscience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in the hospital for all of May and June due to Ulcerative Colitis.  I had emergency surgery that did not go well and I spent 3 weeks in ICU on and off life support.  It is not surprising that my hair almost completely fell out due to the trauma and malnutrition.  My hair has started to grow back, but it is thin and basically awful.  People are constantly recommending that I use various products (Rogaine and Nioxin being the forerunners) to thicken my hair and make it grow back faster.  I’m a 27-year-old female and, I have to admit, having bad hair really bothers me.  It is very tempting to try these products but quality research is difficult, if not impossible, to find.  I don’t want to waste my money on products that won’t work and, on principle as a skeptic, I don’t want to buy into the pseudoscience (and the cosmetic companies’ ability to spin the pseudoscience rivals that of “alternative” medicine).  Any help would be greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenelle
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forwarded her letter to Lucia Gagliese, PhD, a very good friend of mine and one of the most compassionate and intelligent skeptics I know. She just so happens to have a lot of experience working with patients who are coping with problems like Jenelle’s. Her excellent response follows!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hi Janelle,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s great to hear that you are on the road to recovery and that your hair is growing back.  I understand how difficult it is to have “bad hair”.  For many women, our hair is key to feeling attractive and confident so it isn’t surprising that losing our hair is incredibly difficult, even when we know it will grow back.  There are studies among women diagnosed with cancer that have shown that a major concern is chemotherapy-related hair loss.  Sometimes, hair loss is the single most feared aspect of treatment.  As you describe so well, this is a situation that is ripe for friendly suggestions, self-doubt, impatience with gradual improvement, and increased interest in potentially questionable treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to the science:    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important consideration is the cause of your hair loss.  As you describe, it’s associated with a major stressor (surgery, ICU, complications) and malnutrition.  This is one of the most common types of temporary hair loss in women, and the usual treatment is targeted to the underlying cause.  I am assuming that you are being followed closely by your doctors in this regard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hair regrowth treatments that you are wondering about are not really targeted to this type of hair loss.  They have mostly been tested for male pattern baldness.  They may help some women with female pattern baldness or alopecia, although this has not been as extensively studied.  Some of the treatments may not be safe for women of child-bearing age or who are pregnant, and they may have adverse side effects, including increased facial hair.

Here’s her letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’ve been a dedicated listener for over a year now, ever since my boyfriend found your podcast.  I am a Ph.D. student in psychology, have Health Sciences Master’s and Undergraduate degrees, and work as a researchers for the Federal government.  However, I am being faced with a personal crisis that threatens to overwhelm me with pseudoscience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in the hospital for all of May and June due to Ulcerative Colitis.  I had emergency surgery that did not go well and I spent 3 weeks in ICU on and off life support.  It is not surprising that my hair almost completely fell out due to the trauma and malnutrition.  My hair has started to grow back, but it is thin and basically awful.  People are constantly recommending that I use various products (Rogaine and Nioxin being the forerunners) to thicken my hair and make it grow back faster.  I’m a 27-year-old female and, I have to admit, having bad hair really bothers me.  It is very tempting to try these products but quality research is difficult, if not impossible, to find.  I don’t want to waste my money on products that won’t work and, on principle as a skeptic, I don’t want to buy into the pseudoscience (and the cosmetic companies’ ability to spin the pseudoscience rivals that of “alternative” medicine).  Any help would be greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenelle
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forwarded her letter to Lucia Gagliese, PhD, a very good friend of mine and one of the most compassionate and intelligent skeptics I know. She just so happens to have a lot of experience working with patients who are coping with problems like Jenelle’s. Her excellent response follows!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hi Jenelle,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s great to hear that you are on the road to recovery and that your hair is growing back.  I understand how difficult it is to have “bad hair”.  For many women, our hair is key to feeling attractive and confident so it isn’t surprising that losing our hair is incredibly difficult, even when we know it will grow back.  There are studies among women diagnosed with cancer that have shown that a major concern is chemotherapy-related hair loss.  Sometimes, hair loss is the single most feared aspect of treatment.  As you describe so well, this is a situation that is ripe for friendly suggestions, self-doubt, impatience with gradual improvement, and increased interest in potentially questionable treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to the science:    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important consideration is the cause of your hair loss.  As you describe, it’s associated with a major stressor (surgery, ICU, complications) and malnutrition.  This is one of the most common types of temporary hair loss in women, and the usual treatment is targeted to the underlying cause.  I am assuming that you are being followed closely by your doctors in this regard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hair regrowth treatments that you are wondering about are not really targeted to this type of hair loss.  They have mostly been tested for male pattern baldness.  They may help some women with female pattern baldness or alopecia, although this has not been as extensively studied.  Some of the treatments may not be safe for women of child-bearing age or who are pregnant, and they may have adverse side effects, including increased facial hair.  Of particular interest to you, Janelle, is that although these treatments are topical (applied to the skin), some may have effects on your immune system which may be bad news for someone with ulcerative colitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that your hair is growing back.  I urge you to try to embrace your new, thin hair as a sign of your improving health.  Many brave women are coping with hair loss and online resources are available with tips and strategies for coping (e.g., &lt;a href="http://www.breastcancer.org/tips/hair_skin_nails/coping.jsp"&gt;http://www.breastcancer.org/tips/hair_skin_nails/coping.jsp&lt;/a&gt;).  It is difficult when dealing with a symptom that impacts on our sense of self to stick with the evidence.  I admire your strength in choosing this path to recovery. &lt;/p&gt;

We talked &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Skies-These-Ways-World/dp/0670019976/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220913560&amp;amp;sr=8-8/badastronomy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of course. It’s always fun talking with Pamela (and not just because one of the two best radio voices ever — if she ever does a podcast with George Hrab, the mega-sonorous tones may melt me down to my component molecules), and it’s fun talking about cosmic disasters, so this was fun&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Hope you like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I don’t seem to have a picture of Pamela and me together, even from DragonCon where we hung out a lot. So instead, enjoy this: one of my favorites pictures of Pamela, featuring her hanging with fellow awesome skeptic &lt;a href="http://www.djgrothe.com/Home.html"&gt;D.J. Grothe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Update: the equally awesome Space Writer &lt;a href="http://thespacewriter.com/wp/2007/01/07/"&gt;has a picture of Pamela and me from last year&lt;/a&gt;.

I realize that those are some of the funnest posts here and that people like them, but a little variety is required. No study, however, had quite floated my boat, and I was almost to the point of being desperate enough for blog fodder that I considered perusing &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;NaturalNews.com&lt;/a&gt; (maybe later in the week) in search of that searing stupidity that is always in need of an Insolent takedown. Then what to my wondering eyes should appear (yes, I know Christmas is still two months away) but a study in the British Medical Journal by a group lead by Jon C. Tiburt at the Department of Bioethics at the National Institutes of Health in collaboration with investigators at the Osler Institute at Harvard University and the McClean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago entitled &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/oct23_2/a1938"&gt;Prescribing "placebo treatments": results of national survey of US internists and rheumatologists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serendipity? Who cares? The study addresses a very important aspect of science-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, Tiburt &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; undertook a survey of 1,200 practicing internists and rheumatologists in the U.S. to assess their usage of placebos and their attitudes towards their use. Their results, summarized in the abstract, are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;679 physicians (57%) responded to the survey. About half of the surveyed internists and rheumatologists reported prescribing placebo treatments on a regular basis (46-58%, depending on how the question was phrased). Most physicians (399, 62%) believed the practice to be ethically permissible. Few reported using saline (18, 3%) or sugar pills (12, 2%) as placebo treatments, while large proportions reported using over the counter analgesics (267, 41%) and vitamins (243, 38%) as placebo treatments within the past year. A small but notable proportion of physicians reported using antibiotics (86, 13%) and sedatives (86, 13%) as placebo treatments during the same period. Furthermore, physicians who use placebo treatments most commonly describe them to patients as a potentially beneficial medicine or treatment not typically used for their condition (241, 68%); only rarely do they explicitly describe them as placebos (18, 5%).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There conclusions were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Prescribing placebo treatments seems to be common and is viewed as ethically permissible among the surveyed US internists and rheumatologists. Vitamins and over the counter analgesics are the most commonly used treatments. Physicians might not be fully transparent with their patients about the use of placebos and might have mixed motivations for recommending such treatments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, indeed, now &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;'s a topic bound to stir up some controversy!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/using_placebos_outside_of_clinical_trial.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/using_placebos_outside_of_clinical_trial.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/434708263" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225201313308"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/short_takes_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b64f7c41bd1bb087</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Short takes</title><published>2008-10-28T14:29:38Z</published><updated>2008-10-28T14:29:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/434715645/short_takes_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/short_takes_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Stuff is accumulating in my mailbox far faster than I can put it out here with commentary, so I'm just going to dump the recent pile of links here rather than my usual tactic of simply letting them disappear by neglect.&lt;/p&gt;

Earlier this season, the Miami Dolphins went to a "wildcat" formation, wherein the snap goes to a running back and the quarterback is in the slot. This creates new opportunities for the offense and chaos for the defense. After the Dolphins shocked by world by beating the Patriots behind a five-touchdown performance by [...]

I believe that he referenced the AAPS site, not this one, but people are finding their way here via web search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for any internet pilgrims who may be reading quickly: There is no credible evidence that Barack Obama — or any other candidate in the current election cycle — is attempting to use NLP or any other hypnosis-like technique. The discussion in the item on the AAPS site is a combination of unsupported assertions, transparent falsehoods, and general properties of political rhetoric as practiced by all effective candidates of all parties. The longer anonymous piece at Freedom&amp;#39;s Phoenix is no better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, no one should treat this story as anything other than an opportunity for a good laugh at the wilder edges of current political paranoia; and anyone who promotes it seriously is either a fool or a scoundrel.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the web site of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (&amp;quot;A Voice for Private Physicians Since 1943″), there&amp;#39;s an unsigned &amp;quot;News of the Day&amp;quot; item dated October 25, 2008, under the title &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.aapsonline.org/newsoftheday/0089"&gt;Oratory — or hypnotic induction?&lt;/a&gt;". This article's disturbing message is indicated by the rhetorical questions in its opening sentences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Is Barack Obama a brilliant orator, captivating millions through his eloquence? Or is he deliberately using the techniques of neurolinguistic programming (NLP), a covert form of hypnosis developed by Milton Erickson, M.D.? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;67 additional pages of anonymous evidence and argument can be found in "&lt;a href="http://www.freedomsphoenix.com/Find-Freedom.htm?At=039963"&gt;An Examination of Obama's Use of Hidden Hypnosis Techniques in His Speeches&lt;/a&gt;", hosted at &lt;a href="http://www.freedomsphoenix.com/"&gt;Freedom's Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; ("Reigniting the Flames of Freedom"), a conservative website based in Phoenix, AZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But please don't panic; simply put on your tinfoil hat and continue straight ahead to the end of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before considering these issues further, we need to help you distinguish between the AAPS whose red-white-and-blue logo has the rod of Asclepius between the two As, and the AAPS whose yellow-green-and-white logo has the it between the second A and the P:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://aapsonline.org"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/AAPS2.gif" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aapsga.org/index.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/AAPS1.gif" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_American_Physicians_and_Surgeons"&gt;Association of American Physicians and Surgeons&lt;/a&gt;", based in  Tucson, Arizona. Wikipedia quotes Time Magazine as calling it "an ultra-conservative political action group", and notes that its publication, The Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, has published articles arguing that the FDA is unconstitutional, that humanists have conspired to replace the "creation religion of Jehovah" with evolution, that HIV does not cause AIDS, and that vaccination and fluoridation are harmful to public health. Ron Paul is a &lt;a href="http://www.archive.org/details/AssociationofAmericanPhysiciansandSurgeonsRonPaulSpeaksatAAPS62ndAnnualMeeting"&gt;prominent member&lt;/a&gt;. They are &lt;a href="http://www.aapsonline.org/resolutions/2001-2.htm"&gt;against government regulation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.aapsonline.org/resolutions/2002-1.htm"&gt;in favor of Newfoundland dogs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second one is the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_of_Physician_Specialists"&gt;American Association of Physician Specialists&lt;/a&gt;", with offices in Tampa, Florida, which publishes the American Journal of Clinical Medicine, and is one of the organizations that oversees board certification and re-certification in medical specializations from Anesthesiology to Radiation Oncology. They appear to approve of the FDA, and to have no official position on dog breeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As another piece of background, you may need a primer on Neurolinguistic Programming, familiarly (if &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLP"&gt;confusingly&lt;/a&gt;) known as NLP, an approach to psychotherapy developed at Santa Cruz, CA, in the 1970s. The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming"&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; is a reasonable introduction, or at least it seems that way to me. I&amp;#39;m certainly no expert — I&amp;#39;ve never quite gotten over being puzzled about the name, since the ideas seem to have nothing at all to do with programming, and very little to do with either neurology or linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, the stage is set for an epic confrontation: the libertarian medical wingnuts of Arizona against the New Age psychological moonbats of California, with Barack Obama in the middle of it all. Can the robocalls be far behind? News at 11:00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, that's all that I have time for this morning. Keep those tinfoil hats on tight, and in due course we'll take a look at the evidence and the arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Hat tip: &lt;a href="http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~dicanio/"&gt;Christian DiCanio&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: Although the &lt;a href="http://www.aapsonline.org/newsoftheday/0089"&gt;cited news item is unsigned&lt;/a&gt;, I gather that this web site is managed by &lt;a href="http://www.oism.org/s32p20.htm"&gt;Dr. Jane Orient&lt;/a&gt;, the Executive Director of the AAPS. Therefore, I'll refer to her as the author, pending better information. She (or the author operating under her guidance) writes that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;A fundamental tool of “conversational hypnosis” is pacing and leading—a way for the hypnotist to bypass the listener’s critical faculty by associating repeated statements that are unquestionably accurate with the message he wants to convey. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; In his Denver acceptance speech, Obama used the phrases “that’s why I stand here tonight,” “now is the time,” and “this moment” 14 times. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious interpretation of the last sentence is that the cited three phrases were used 14 times each, for a total of 42 hypnotic repetitions. Alternatively, you might think that the sum of repetitions across all three phrases was 14 — certainly less hypnotically effective, but still perhaps noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, under either reading, the AAPS claim is simply a lie. According to the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/28/us/politics/28text-obama.html?partner=permalink&amp;amp;exprod=permalink"&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt; of that speech, the sum of uses of the cited three phrases is 9:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style="text-align:center" border="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phrase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Count&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;"that's why I stand here tonight"&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;"now is the time"&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;"this moment"&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2 (4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sen. Obama uses &amp;quot;this moment&amp;quot; twice — but on one of the occasions of use, he repeats it three times because it&amp;#39;s the start of a sentence after a big applause line, and the applause doesn&amp;#39;t die down, so that he has to stop and start over twice. Thus you could count this phrase as occurring twice, or as occurring four times. Less than 14 in either case…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: in the comments, Brad pointed out an unfortunate mistake in the earlier version of this post — I originally counted just one use of &amp;quot;now is the time&amp;quot;, not six — I guess I looked by mistake on just one on-line page.  The count is now corrected above.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Orient's explanation continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Paces are connected to the lead by words such as “and,” “as,” “because,” or “that is why.” For example, “we need change” (who could disagree?)…and…that is why I will be your next President.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her rhetorical point may be valid, but again, there is an extraordinary lack of elementary care to stay within the bounds of truth. The phrase as cited doesn't appear in the transcript of Sen. Obama's speech. Nor do any of the three-word subphrases "we need change", "that is why", "I will be", "your next president".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt one can find examples in Sen. Obama&amp;#39;s acceptance speech — as in any speech — where universally accepted formulations are coupled with more controversial assertions. What&amp;#39;s shocking here is that Dr. Orient didn&amp;#39;t even bother to try to find one, but simply made something up. This is even more breathtakingly solipsistic than &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=738"&gt;James Wood's attack&lt;/a&gt; on Sarah Palin's pronunciation and use of &lt;em&gt;verbiage&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on, but it would be cruel. Could it be that Dr. Jane Orient is a sort of Manchurian Libertarian, programmed by evil leftists at Columbia Medical School to infiltrate and subvert the movement for free-market medicine, by publishing absurd conspiracy theories full of easily-checked falsehoods?. That&amp;#39;s implausible, I know — but what&amp;#39;s the alternative? That she&amp;#39;s a dishonest polemicist who is used to inventing &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot; out of thin air, secure in the belief that no one in her audience will ever check? Surely that can&amp;#39;t be true of a medical school professor.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225196718569"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=406">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0a2d36be7fa45048</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Logic/Philosophy"/><title type="html">More on Methodological Naturalism</title><published>2008-10-28T12:03:13Z</published><updated>2008-10-28T12:03:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=406" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My posts from last Thursday and Friday on materialism sparked an unusual amount of activity in the comments, which is always great. There is much great discussion and links to further reading. But I feel I did not make my position clear enough, and a longer clarification than is appropriate for the comments is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the confusion and disagreement seems to revolve around definitions - it is difficult to find common ground when people are using different specific definitions for the same words. This is a common problem in philosophy, which seems to multiple terms with subtle distinctions, and has been further magnified by the fact that I was partly confronting how other people (like ID proponents) are using terms, vs how philosophers define them, vs how the public perceives them. Confusion ensued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is probably obvious, I want to say for the record that I am not a philosopher. I am a scientist trying to understand philosophy as it pertains to science and skepticism. This probably causes as many problems as philosophers who are not scientists trying to understand the philosophy of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as I crawl back through this discussion of methodological naturalism and materialism I will try to be careful about defining terms and in which context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Materialism and Consciousness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem, as I see it, is that the term materialism can have two uses. In one usage it specifically refers to the philosophical position of monism, as opposed to dualism. Monism is the notion that consciousness reduces to brain activity, and that nothing else need be going on to explain consciousness. Dualism is the belief that there is “something else,” although this something could be physical or not, depending upon the type of dualism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materialism has also been used, especially recently by ID proponents and their ilk, in a broader sense - applying it to all phenomena, not just consciousness. By this definition materialism is the philosophical position that all things can be explained ultimately by material physical causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This broader use is very problematic, for reasons explored thoroughly in the comments of my previous post. One definition that currently has no utility is saying that materialism refers only to matter. Science already includes things other than matter in its model of reality - no one, as far as I know, argues that the universe is made only of matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the anti-materialists (I will use this term to refer ID proponents and others who argue that science is “rigged” against the supernatural) are using the term “materialism” to refer to the current scientific approach to understanding nature (not just consciousness). In that sense, materialism must include all of the stuff that science currently says nature is made of, including all types of energy, dark matter, and space-time itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural vs Supernatural&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be the crux of much of the confusion - how to define natural vs supernatural. This is, in a way, an unanswerable question - because any meaningful answer requires absolute knowledge of reality, which we will forever lack. There is therefore no gold standard of natural that we can use to define, by exclusion, the supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural is therefore defined by our current knowledge - it is everything that has been discovered by science to exist in nature. That list will change as new discoveries are made. This is not an a-priori list - nothing is included or excluded based upon first principles or any bias. The list is strictly science-based and therefore open-ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, I agree with those who have argued that the distinction between natural and supernatural is meaningless, and that science does not restrict itself to any arbitrary list of what is “natural.” It is true as some have observed that saying that science deals with only the natural is a tautology, because the natural is defined by what science deals with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confusion stems from trying to define these terms by some fixed criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Method in Methodological Naturalism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to make sense of all of this, in my opinion, is to define natural and supernatural not based upon what is, but on what we can know.  They are defined by whether or not they are amenable to scientific methods of investigation - not whether or not they are actually true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take ID, for example. ID is outside the realm of science not because it posits something which is not known to exist, but because it frames that new thing outside the methods of science.  It is alright within the framework of science to hypothesize that the universe has intelligence, that a powerful force created life with intention and design, or any other such notion. The only requirement is that such a hypothesis must make testable predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ID proponents say that life was created by an intelligent designer - but they do not allow anything to be speculated about that designer or the methods used. This prohibits any predictions. No ID proponent has ever proposed a method for the creation or the design, nor have they made any statement to the effect that - if life on earth were designed then it should have these testable properties. Rather, they flip it and say that whatever properties life has, that is what the designer intended - because the designer is not constrained in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, ID proponents will say that they have done this - that if life were designed it will display “irreducible complexity.” But this does not work, because IC is not a demonstrable property of life or any component of it. Rather, it is based entirely on the perceived inability of another theory (evolution) to currently explain features of life (it is therefore a negative feature of another theory, not a positive feature of ID). As an example of why this does not make ID testable, prior claims of irreducible complexity have been shown not to be irreducible, and this has not falsified ID. Even if evolution could explain every jot an tittle of life ID proponents could still say that the designer just chose to make life look that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting back to the main point - what makes ID not science is not in the fact that it proposes new forces of nature (although that is a weakness, as Occam’s razor favors minimizing new assumptions), rather it is that it is not amenable to scientific investigation. As I said previously, scientific method does not allow you to say - “and then a miracle happens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert linked to &lt;a href="http://www.naturalism.org/science.htm#explanation"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; on the naturalism.org website. Actually, I agree with the details of this article. It is really saying the same thing I am, just in a different way. For example, under the definition of science it says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science seeks testable, verifiable, and transparently mechanistic or specifiable explanations for phenomena - &lt;em&gt;no mysterious or unspecifiable processes&lt;/em&gt; play a more than a passing role in scientific accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And about why ID is not science it says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ID doesn’t specify how design is carried out: no mechanism or process is proposed, and further, no means of discovering this mechanism is proposed. The mechanism remains&lt;em&gt; unacceptably mysterious &lt;/em&gt;with no hope of being clarified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does “mysterious” mean? I think an operational definition of “mysterious” would be the same as my methodological definition of “supernatural.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science and God&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This methodoligical approach also deals with the problem of whether or not science can deal with God.  The answer is - yes and no. If a supernatural (meaning inaccessible to science) power were meddling with our universe (with stuff science could access), science could detect it, document it, and even describe it. We could say that something was happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However (by the premises of this hypothetical situation) if the ultimate cause of these physical effects were beyond scientific methodology, the best science could do would be to describe anomalies. Science comes across anomalies all the time, and the typical approach is to assume (because we really have no choice) that the anomalies are due to either errors in observation, errors in our current theories, or incompleteness in our current theories, meaning there is some new phenomenon to discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the scientific approach (assuming anomalies will lead to a deeper understanding of reality) has worked out pretty well. This is the best evidence we have that our universe if mostly rational and does not include “supernatural” (by my definition) forces that will remain forever “mysterious.” If it did, then we would run across anomalies that we could never explain scientifically. All we could do would be to describe them, but we could never come up with a testable theory of mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example - what if we were all really just computer programs living in a virtual “matrix”-like universe? The laws of the universe that we are investigating are really the laws of this virtual matrix. But we are just virtual beings in this matrix, and as such have no hope of ever discovering the true underlying nature of reality. Only a perspective outside the matrix can do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the matrix is embedded in a physical universe with its own rules and laws. Beings in that greater universe who control the matrix can make things happen that cannot be explained by the rules that apply within the matrix - because they derive from a deeper reality inaccessible to being limited to the matrix itself. In this hypothetical situation the methods of science can discover the rules of the matrix, but not the rules of the deeper universe in which it is embedded, or this fact itself. Science could only be agnostic toward the matrix hypothesis because it cannot be investigated scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matrix creators, however, could create anomalies within the matrix. Scientists could investigate those anomalies (document and describe them) but could never explain them - they would be enduring anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a perfect analogy to some concepts of God - he exists outside the confines of the laws of this universe but is able to meddle with it. We, as beings of this universe, have no hope of ever understanding God. But this also means we can never know scientifically if such a being exists or not. At most there would be enduring scientific anomalies.  There are currently no such anomalies, and the criteria for “enduring” is fuzzy, of course. How long must an anomaly defy explanation before we should conclude it is unexplainable? You could argue, never, and that is the approach I would prefer, but very long-standing anomalies would at least give those who choose to believe in an underling reality something to point to. Further, the lack of such anomalies is strong evidence for the power of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying that science requires methodological naturalism is really just another way of saying that science requires falsifiable hypotheses, which in turn requires the assumption that the universe makes sense - it consistently follows an internal set of rules. ID proponents and others who oppose this view want to inject supernatural explanations into science, by which they mean ideological beliefs that are not testable by science. They try to dress up these beliefs as scientific theories by framing god-of-the-gaps arguments from ignorance (like irreducible complexity) as if they were testable hypotheses - but they are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They further confuse methodological naturalism, which in practice means that “natural” is whatever is amendable to scientific investigation, with an a-priori list of accepted natural phenomena, everything else being excluded supernatural phenomena - but there is no such list.  The anti-materialist arguments are all an elaborate deception (facilitated by confusing philosophical terminology) meant to break the rules of science to allow for untestable ideological beliefs. This fight was fought long ago, and the current rules of science are the result. The anti-materialists just don’t like the view from the losing side.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's an &lt;a href="http://www.myconfinedspace.com/?attachment_id=53508"&gt;anti-Al Franken brochure that's being mailed around here in Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;—that&amp;#39;s aimed at kids, with childish illustrations, while accusing Franken of some contemptible acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Come on in, kids... Senator Franken's going to tell a few jokes!"&lt;br&gt;
"We shouldn't have to be ashamed of Minnesota's senator!"&lt;br&gt;
Al Franked tackled a protestor at a political rally- and bragged about it&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;We shouldn&amp;#39;t have to wonder what he will say…&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
Al Franken wrote a pornographic column in Playboy- and thought it was funny.&lt;br&gt;
"We shouldn't have to apologize for his actions..."&lt;br&gt;
Al Franken has written so-called comedy routines about raping women.&lt;br&gt;
Al Franken: A bad example for our kids; completely unfit for public office&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two white supremacists allegedly plotted to go on a national killing spree, shooting and decapitating black people and ultimately targeting Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, federal authorities said Monday.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In all, the two men whom officials described as neo-Nazi skinheads planned to kill 88 people - 14 by beheading, according to documents unsealed in U.S. District Court in Jackson, Tenn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a horrible and sordid story of idiots with guns, but in scanning the various news sources, there is a curious but obvious word missing — a word that normally our media and government fling about with unscrupulous abandon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That word is "terrorism".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t it strike you as peculiar that white homegrown right-wing fascist killers are somehow exempt from being called what they are — terrorists?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/what_word_is_missing_in_this_s.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/434240831" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225158282526"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=777">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/849d97daccd135fc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Morphology"/><category term="Semantics"/><title type="html">Zero relationships</title><published>2008-10-28T01:43:01Z</published><updated>2008-10-28T01:43:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=777" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=501"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; a while back on countification (M(ass)&amp;gt;C(ount) conversion of nouns, with accompanying individuating semantics) elicited e-mail and blogging about other cases of zero relationships in English (of which there are a lot, though all  pretty much irrelevant to my topic in that posting), and now Bill Poser&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=767"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; on moose has set off a comments thread on zero plurals (&lt;em&gt;moose&lt;/em&gt; being an example of a noun with a zero plural).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an important point here: formal relationships — like phonological identity (&amp;quot;zero relationship&amp;quot;), suffixation by /z/, and systematic vowel alternations, are &amp;quot;just stuff&amp;quot;. They have no intrinsic meaning on their own, but are available to serve all sorts of grammatical ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[To follow up on the &lt;em&gt;moose&lt;/em&gt; comments: zero plurals are treated in every reputable reference grammar of English. The &lt;em&gt;Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&lt;/em&gt; has a particularly nice succinct survey on pp. 1588-9.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phonological identity, or zero relationship, is the simplest sort of formal relationship there is for expanding on the lexicon (though from the semiotic point of view it's suboptimal), so it's no surprise that it's all over the place in languages, and particularly visible in languages (like English) that are not especially rich morphologically. (Other high-frequency strategies for expanding the lexicon include combining different stems, into compounds of various sorts, and combining duplicate copies of a single stem.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category-changing zero derivation.&lt;/strong&gt; English has by-now fully lexicalized nounings of verbs (&lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;talk&lt;/em&gt;, and many, many others) and verbings of nouns (&lt;em&gt;hammer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;query&lt;/em&gt;, and many, many others); and there are other nounings and verbings "in the pipeline" (the verb &lt;em&gt;verb&lt;/em&gt; itself, for example, plus things like the count nouns &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; 'a request' and &lt;em&gt;swear&lt;/em&gt; 'swear word' that I've posted about &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=340"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=508"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; there are endless numbers of others that can be (and are) made up on the spot ("We'll Chevrolet to California", "They gave it a long contemplate").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Digression: these "spontaneous" verbings and nounings have a profile that's familiar from N+N &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=437"&gt;compounding&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=508"&gt;non-predicational&lt;/a&gt; Adj+N composites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(a) There's a morphological configuration (N+N=N, Adj+N=N, N or Adj = V, V or Adj = N) that has, when you look at the whole range of actually occurring examples, very general and unspecific semantics (a N2 related to a N1 in some way, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) But there are recurrent subtypes, or patterns, of this configuration with much more specific semantics, so that they can be produced, and comprehended, "off the shelf", so to speak, without a lot of taking context, background knowledge, and so on into account. These recurrent subtypes have been catalogued in some detail for N+N compounds and for verbings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(c) Nevertheless, novel instances, with very context- and knowledge-dependent interpretations, are freely available (e.g. N+N &lt;em&gt;canoe wife&lt;/em&gt;, Adj+N &lt;em&gt;diabetic insole&lt;/em&gt; 'insole for diabetics', &lt;em&gt;to bookend&lt;/em&gt; 'to place between two paired items').&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that this is the way &amp;quot;word formation&amp;quot; (including both various kinds of compounds and derivational formations) works a lot of the time: great vagueness in the associated semantics, a number of more specific templates for interpretation, and a big zone of open context-dependent interpretations. This is the pattern for N&amp;gt;V derivation in &lt;em&gt;-ize&lt;/em&gt; and for duplicative compounds that have characteristic exemplars (&amp;quot;It was (not) a DATE date&amp;quot;, on which there&amp;#39;s now a fair literature) — and, I&amp;#39;m sure, for other types of word formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's obviously a lot more to be said about category-changing zero relationships, but but I'll pass on to zero relationships between different subcategories of the same "part of speech", in particular, relationships between C and M uses of nouns. Here I'm going to focus on the (b)-type cases, where there are patterns of conversion with conventional semantics associated with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This is going to be just a sampling of what&amp;#39;s out there, and it doesn&amp;#39;t pretend to give detailed semantics of the various types. I&amp;#39;m posting this to give a sense of how much diversity — and specificity — there is.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&amp;gt;C: countification.&lt;/strong&gt; A M noun that refers to an assemblage or collection of elements has a C use to refer to one of these elements: &lt;em&gt;spam&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;e-mail&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;porn&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;slang&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;folklore&lt;/em&gt;. Often commented on here, most recently &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=501"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C or M&amp;gt;C: situational metonymy.&lt;/strong&gt; Based on an association between pairs of referents in some specific situation — for example, the association between a customer in a restaurant and the item that customer has ordered. The metonymy can take C to C (&amp;quot;Table 4 has two hamburgers and two hotdogs sitting at it&amp;quot;) but it can also take M to C (&amp;quot;Table 4 has two spaghettis and two lasagnas sitting at it&amp;quot;). (I&amp;#39;m paraphrasing examples from Geoff Nunberg&amp;#39;s Ph.D. dissertation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&amp;gt;C: variety individuation.&lt;/strong&gt; A M noun has a C use to denote varieties or subtypes: "There are many lavenders growing in my garden" (not 'many lavender plants', but 'many types of lavender', e.g. Lavandula angustifolia, Lavandula dentata, Lavandula stoechas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&amp;gt;C: serving individuation.&lt;/strong&gt; A M noun denoting something drinkable or edible has a C use to denote a serving of it ("I drank three Tsing Taos", "We ordered three Veal Orloffs").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&amp;gt;M: the universal grinder.&lt;/strong&gt; A C noun has a M use to denote a thing or things transformed (actually or imaginatively) into stuff ("The child took the flower and smashed it into pulp, and soon the table was covered with tulip" [invented]; "Biological 'success' simply means something like: there are many more pounds of dog in the world than there are pounds of wolf" [attested example supplied by Joel Wallenberg]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&amp;gt;M: expanse massification.&lt;/strong&gt; A C noun has a M use to denote an assemblage of things presenting themselves en masse ("We rounded a corner in the Dutch countryside and were confronted with a huge expanse of tulip").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&amp;gt;M: substance massification.&lt;/strong&gt; A C noun denoting an individual has a M use to denote a generic substance or totality, usually in construction with a quantity determiner ("That's a lot of horse", "That's more elephant than we can handle").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've distinguished two types of massification here, but the difference between them is not always clear, as in this attested example: "When huge deposits of ruby and sapphire were found several years ago, Cushman was one of the first dealers to venture into the often violent mining towns".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&amp;gt;M: meat conversion.&lt;/strong&gt; A C noun denoting a creature has a M use to denote the edible flesh of that creature — &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s not much rat in it!&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;We had chicken/lamb/eel for dinner&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Some dictionaries list some of these M uses as subsenses of the entries for the C nouns, even though meat conversion is productive. [Digression: some meat conversion M noun uses are pre-empted by lexical items borrowed (long ago) from French: &lt;em&gt;pork&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, normally pre-empts &lt;em&gt;pig&lt;/em&gt; as a meat name.])&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&amp;gt;M: sex-part conversion.&lt;/strong&gt; A C noun denoting a sexual part has a M use denoting this part as a generalized object of lust ("I'm looking for some cunt/pussy/cock/dick/ass").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the C~M conversions above can pretty easily be seen as metonymies. One last type is based on a metonymical idiom &lt;em&gt;give head&lt;/em&gt; 'provide oral sex', but is not itself metonymical:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&amp;gt;M: give &lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;great/good&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;strong&gt; N&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance: "I can still give great lecture"; "You give great interview!"; "He can really give rant".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Older speakers often report finding the &lt;em&gt;give-&lt;/em&gt;N idiom extensions to be too sexual for use in anything but the most informal contexts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semi-final note.&lt;/strong&gt; The C~M conversions are notably &lt;small&gt;CONVENTIONALIZED&lt;/small&gt;: although, given enough context, you can make up a new instance on the spot and get away with it — people will see what you&amp;#39;re trying to convey — and although maybe some of these inventions will become fixed as idioms, most of the occurrences fall into types, which people (in general, or in certain groups) will process as familiar patterns, without having to &amp;quot;work out&amp;quot; other people&amp;#39;s intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that, however "natural", intuitive, and obvious some of these conversions might seem to you, they are things you've &lt;small&gt;LEARNED&lt;/small&gt; about the use of the language, and there is no guarantee that other languages will have the same conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in fact they do not. Jerry Sadock reports to me that conventionalized metonymies are virtually absent in Greenlandic Eskimo (and that creative metonymy is conversationally problematic), and a quick survey even of familiar European languages will show that some of them lack some of the conventions that English speakers find so natural (while having others that are initially strange to us). I'm not competent to survey such facts (though I've taken part in entertaining discussions with various multilingual linguists about them), so I won't pursue the topic here. But it would be nice to see someone take an extended look at it (and maybe someone has; I miss a lot of stuff).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final note.&lt;/strong&gt; What I've said here barely scratches the surface of zero relationships. There are zero relationships between adjectives and adverbs; between intransitive and transitive verbs; and, spectacularly, between different inflectional forms (as, for example, in English zero plurals, alluded to above: &lt;em&gt;one sheep&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; two sheep&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;one moose&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;two moose&lt;/em&gt;; and some people's &lt;em&gt;one croissant&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;two croissant&lt;/em&gt;). And more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero relationship is a purely formal matter, with no overarching content of its own; it can be pressed into service to do all sorts of work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Arnold Zwicky</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225153296123"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/27/hubble-on-the-road-to-recovery/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0482de1189a2ee1f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="NASA"/><title type="html">Hubble on the road to recovery</title><published>2008-10-28T00:05:41Z</published><updated>2008-10-28T00:05:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/27/hubble-on-the-road-to-recovery/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Holy cow, how did I miss this? On Saturday, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/servicing/SM4/news/status_rpt_7_20081025.html"&gt;engineers sent commands&lt;/a&gt; to the Wide Field/Planetary Camera 2 (Hubble’s main camera since the Advanced Camera for Surveys suffered a short a while back) to wake it up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional commanding allowed engineers on the ground to assess the instrument’s state of health and verify the contents of the camera’s microprocessor memory. All systems are poised to begin acquiring science data later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first observations made will be for data calibration purposes. The team at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which manages Hubble science, expects to release an image late next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad I spotted this &lt;a href="http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001711/"&gt;on Emily’s blog&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly, there’s no RSS feed on that page from NASA (sigh). But I’ll try to stay on top of this; I imagine NASA will send out a press notice when the new images are released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not all the way home yet — the Shuttle still needs to get up there and place out a lot of equipment, including installing a backup for the backup that’s now being used to control the cameras. Still…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One commentor gave a definition of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;autism advocacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - one which I think that few people would disagree with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“[A]utism advocacy” has to do with understanding and support of families affected by autism, educational needs of children with autism, becoming educated about, and advocating for meeting the needs of older children and adults with autism, advocating for needed services in the community and like topics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second commentor came up with a good definition of how “autism advocacy” is seen by autistic people themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Autism advocacy” is the widespread effort to make the world as free of autism — that is, of autistic people — as possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ’blogmaster, D’oC came up with the term &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;anti-autism advocacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to describe those people whose goals - stated or implied - fit the latter definition better than the former.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I don’t know if he coined the term or found it somewhere else, but it truly fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I contemplated this curious dichotomy, it occurred to me that most organizations, governmental agencies, foundations and informal groups that claim “autism advocacy” as part of their mission seem to fall into the &lt;em&gt;anti&lt;/em&gt;-autism advocacy category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t to say that even the most militantly “autism-is-the-scourge-of-the-earth-and-must-be-eradicated-completely” group doesn’t - on the rare occasion - do something that at least partially helps actual autistic people; &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; groups (there are exceptions) have a mix of both activities. However, most of the more prominent groups seem to lean rather heavily to the “anti-autism” side and give only lip-service to helping autistic people (apart, of course, from “curing” them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, in fact, &lt;em&gt;very few&lt;/em&gt; organizations or groups that are &lt;em&gt;predominantly &lt;/em&gt;focused on helping &lt;em&gt;autistic people&lt;/em&gt;, as opposed to &lt;em&gt;parents&lt;/em&gt; of autistic children. I won’t go into who is and who isn’t, since that would distract from the point of this article (not to mention exposing me to lawsuits - some of the &lt;em&gt;anti’s&lt;/em&gt; are also very pro-lawsuit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’d like to do is propose a set of definitions to “disambiguate” our discussions of “autism advocacy”. I’d also like to introduce a term of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definitions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;[Note: the activities included in the definitions below are NOT meant to be an exhaustive list of what the different types of advocacy involve. Failure to include an activity in the admittedly short list included in the short definition should NOT be construed to imply that the author feels that that activity is NOT a part of that type of advocacy. Thank you for not putting words in my mouth.]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autism Advocacy:&lt;/strong&gt; Speaking for, lobbying for or otherwise working to improve the lives of people with autism. This would include - but not be limited to - removing obstacles to greater independence, helping them to reach their highest potential and assisting them to express themselves in words, writing, art and music. It would also include helping autistic people free themselves from oppression, abuse and exploitation. &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;This would &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; include researching and disseminating accurate information about autism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-autism Advocacy&lt;/strong&gt;: Speaking for, lobbying for or otherwise working to eradicate autism. This would include - but not be limited to - researching the causes of autism, ways to prevent autism or ways to treat or “cure” autism. Included in this would be efforts to disseminate and publicize &lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt; information about causes, prevention and treatment of autism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;I think from those two definitions, you could figure which groups do autism advocacy and which groups do anti-autism advocacy. But I think that there is a piece of the puzzle missing - and here it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autism-&lt;em&gt;angst&lt;/em&gt; Advocacy&lt;/strong&gt;: Speaking for, lobbying for or otherwise working to increase the public fear of autism. This would include - but not be limited to - disseminating informational material implying that autistic people are unable to function independently or have a reasonable quality of life, that autism in its greatest severity is the norm, that common activities, household products or medical interventions cause autism (without data to support such a claim) or that children with autism do not develop at all without extensive use of untested psuedo-medical “therapies”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;I think that this third cetegory describes &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; autism-related groups better than either of the other two. After all, there are certain organizations that seem to be uninterested in helping autistic people and yet are not actively working to find a cause, prevention or cure. What they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; seem to be doing is stirring up a lot of fear and anger. Thus, &lt;strong&gt;autism-&lt;em&gt;angst&lt;/em&gt; advocacy &lt;/strong&gt;- for the people who don’t want to be part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Autism-&lt;em&gt;angst&lt;/em&gt; advocacy appeals to the people who want someone to blame, who want those smug, satisified parents with “typical” kids to share their fear, who want to show the world that there’s nothing wrong with &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; genes, by damn! It attracts people who aren’t ready to deal with the child they have and want to spend a little more time wallowing in fear and anger over the child they &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;It also appeals to people who are tired of doctors and scientists being the only ones who can do meaningful medical research. It’s very post-modern in its ideas that the “narratives” of parents are the equal of any “numbers from a study” or “epidemiological herd”. This also appeals to many second- and third-tier “alternative” practitioners, who find the “Data!?! We don’t need no stinkin’ data!” attitude very conducive to their practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;The ultimate &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt; of autism-&lt;em&gt;angst&lt;/em&gt; advocacy is harder to fathom, since increasing fear and anger about autism will not help autistic people (quite the opposite!), their families (ditto!) or autism research (double ditto!). In fact, it makes no sense at all unless its purpose is to generate an inchoate anger that can be directed at whatever target - vaccines, doctors, “the government” - that the leaders choose in order to generate political power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Of course, it doesn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to make sense. It may be that the leaders of the autism-&lt;em&gt;angst&lt;/em&gt; movement have no purpose at all beyond wanting other people to be as frightened and angry as they are. Misery loves company, we are told, so it would &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; like a rally…or a mob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Whichever way the autism-&lt;em&gt;angst&lt;/em&gt; advocacy groups are heading - directed mass action or accidental mob implosion - we should &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; be keeping an eye on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Two excerpts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zachary Dennis, now a high-school freshman, told his mother that his eighth-grade teacher, John Freshwater, held his arm down Dec. 6 and used an electrical device used to test gases to burn a cross on his forearm during a science class demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He said ‘Mr. Freshwater said this cross will be here for awhile; it’s like a temporary tattoo,’ “ recalled Jenifer Dennis, Zachary’s mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We never intended to go in to get Mr. Freshwater in trouble,” said Mrs. Dennis. “I send my child to school and expect my child not to come home with an injury to his arm.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know the Dennis family, and know that they originally wanted only to assure the safety of Zach and the other children in Freshwater’s classes.  Freshwater’s other behaviors at issue came to light in the aftermath of his burning the child and &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; subsequent publicity seeking via demonstrations outside the schools and on the Mt. Vernon public square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The termination hearing on Freshwater resumes tomorrow (Tuesday).  I’ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/06/placebo_effect_not_placebo_tre.php"&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I argued that placebo is an artifact of certain clinical interactions, rather than a treatment that we can exploit.  Apparently, there are a whole lot of doctors out there who don't agree with me.  Or are there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent study published in &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/oct23_2/a1938"&gt;the British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt; is getting&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2008/10/the_ethics_of_using_placebos.php"&gt;a lot of &lt;em&gt;enk&lt;/em&gt; (e-ink) in the blogosphere.&lt;/a&gt; As a practicing internist, I have some pretty strong opinions (based in fact, of course) about both this study and placebos in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Study &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current BMJ study defines placebo as "positive clinical outcomes caused by a treatment that is not attributable to its known physical properties or mechanism of action."  I've got a lot of problems with this definition, but we'll get to that later.  It also allowed physiologically active medications to "count" as placebos.  Oops.&lt;br&gt;

I’ve made cakes in the past that have been pretty good, though I use box mix. I can make excellent brownies (being at 1700 meters elevation makes that non-trivial, by the way). But I know that if I were to try something difficult, like shaping a cake into something cool, it would be a disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why &lt;a href="http://cakewrecks.blogspot.com/2008/10/guest-blogger-great-white-snark.html"&gt;I have sympathy for these folks&lt;/a&gt;. I think they tried really hard, but maybe weren’t quite up to the task. They weren’t professionals, so I don’t think that snark is called for, but still. Yikes. They did post their cakes in public places, so they’re asking for it. And honestly, I wouldn’t have known what that last one was had it not been in the context of the others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. BA is an excellent baker, and maybe I’ll ask her to make a cake like this for my birthday next year. If she makes one, I’ll post pictures, and it’ll be awesome. She’s done Spongebob, Zim, and Kenny cakes in the past, and they were very cool. Maybe it’s time to go 3D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you want to try this yourself, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaDY_avosaU"&gt;this might help&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American Association for the Advancement of Science    _____&lt;/li&gt;

2007 Annual Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1a.Objectives (from AD-416)
Explore for natural enemies (pathogens, parasites and predators) in the native range of insect pests identified as high priority targets by the ARS National Program Staff. Identify, colonize and evaluate the most promising natural enemies and ship to U.S. cooperators. Results of laboratory and field studies will be used to improve the ability to predict key factors for application to future programs. Key target pests include the Asian longhorned beetle(Anoplophora glabripennis), emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis), wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus), olive fly (Bactrocera oleae), Formosan subterranean termite (Coptotermes formosanus), and plant bugs (several species).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NP304, Component V: Pest Control Technologies. A key natural enemy of the olive fruit fly in Africa is discovered and shipped to California. The olive fruit fly threatens olive production in California. Long known in the Old World, it invaded California without its co-evolved natural enemies. Among several parasitic wasps discovered from Eurasia and Africa, one from Kenya, and southern Africa was showed to be specific to olive fruit fly. Extensive collections in Kenya, South Africa and Namibia yielded several thousand olive fruit flies which were shipped to the ARS laboratory in France for processing. Seventeen shipments containing over 13,000 parasitic wasps (Psyttalia lounsburyi) were subsequently shipped to California for evaluation and release. If successfully established, it is highly likely that pesticide use and associated costs will be substantially reduced. This activity was accomplished in cooperation with USDA-APHIS, the California Department of Food and Agriculture, and the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now (as advertised or ‘As Seen of TV’), you too could become a God working miracles just like the Jesus, the &lt;span&gt;emperor&lt;/span&gt; and the Classical &lt;span&gt;demi&lt;/span&gt;-gods / semi-gods (This being the proofs promised by Jesus in the Gospels, but today &lt;span&gt;practiced&lt;/span&gt; mostly by Faith Healers).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, if you did NOT want the “carrot” of being be a wonder working Christian here on earth, then you would get the “stick” of roasting forever (Thus, if you think it’s bad for you now, just you wait and you’ll wish you had of converted)!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As stated above, in a world where all sickness was said to be caused by the Gods (or demons)(often for wrong actions as punishment); where the reality of severe pain of being burnt either in daily cooking or in fires for warmth; where the daily struggle to find clean clear drinking water form wells and stream not cursed by demons or the Gods (remember they had no knowledge of micro-organisms) meant life or death. The claim where one MUST live after death in a place that incorporated all the real fears and realities of this life, was a great tool in evangelizing propaganda that the other competing religions in the &lt;span&gt;Greco&lt;/span&gt;=Roman west just did not have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Here is a hard fact!&lt;/strong&gt; Especially note the fierily burning trash dump of the Semitic term and Hebrew place called “Gehenna”. This was a place where the general population could actually see the fires, smoke and smell the rotting and burning flesh of dead animals along with unclaimed human bodies. Palestinian Christianity used this concept to strike fear in the people of that location, but , once the Christian religion moved west into Asia Minor, Gehenna was totally dropped for the Classical Greek religious concept Hades / Hell which itself was reworked to strike fear in the Hellenistic populations.}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In conclusion, the claims and promises of a once powerful Christianity fueled by human fears and superstitions also being re-enforced by the lack of knowledge (modern science) which preached that all natural disasters were from either God or Satan (a &lt;span&gt;modification&lt;/span&gt; of the old demons(note here within the last 300 years the Witch trials in Europe and Salem, Mass.)) is a parade which has forever past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christianity has conceded so much of its mystical word view that it now appears weak and deflated much like King &lt;span&gt;Triton&lt;/span&gt; who lost all his mighty powers to the Sea Witch in Disney’s “The Little Mermaid”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without Christianity’s living proofs of what the Gospels calls “Signs and Wonders” no longer able to compete with our scientific knowledge, all its reality (now known as dogmas / doctrines ) are moved into some vague and mysterious “after life” untouchable by “sinful man’s” science and technology begin relocated in either Heaven (for the righteous) or Hell (for the people who refuse to join in on this superstition in the modern world).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The “Bible Christians” who show up here at DC to argue the “truths” of Christianity, appear like the Cain in Genesis 4: 13; they seem to be forever cursed to wonder in a strange new land where their burden of a past mystical claims now seems almost too much to bear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With hope fueled by faith, they struggle on just like Pilgrim in John Bunyan’s &lt;em&gt;Pilgrims Progress&lt;/em&gt;, but whose faith, like the ancient Gods, are superstitions that die hard. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest shooting-itself-in-the-foot-moment for the Lone Star State is based on a panel to create its state science curriculum (oh, you already know where this is going, dontcha now?). Out of the six seats on the panel, three are going to creationists! And not just any run-of-the-mill creationists, but one of them is Stephen C. Meyer, &lt;em&gt;director of the Discovery Institute.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will pause a moment while the air leaks back into your room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready? OK then, let me say this again: &lt;strong&gt;Texas has placed a creationist who runs the Discovery institute — a hotbed of creationist deceptions — on a panel that will decide what &amp;quot;science&amp;quot; the children of Texas will learn. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And who will lead this panel of three reality-based scientists and three people dedicated to destroying reality? Why, it’s our old friend Donald McLeroy! &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bablog/2007/07/25/texas-doomed/"&gt;Remember him&lt;/a&gt;? He’s a creationist. He hates science. He thinks abstinence-only education works (if you want teen girls to get STDs and get pregnant, then you’d be right). And &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/05/24/thats-it-texas-really-is-doomed/"&gt;he’s proven&lt;/a&gt; that he has no business being within three hundred yards of any sort of educational process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you live in Texas, what can you do? First, educate yourself: read what others have to say on this topic, including &lt;a href="http://www.texscience.org/releases/creationists-science-review-panel.htm"&gt;Texas Citizens for Science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/prepare_for_an_ugly_battle_in.php"&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/editorial/outlook/6073364.html"&gt;Houston Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/31666_Texas_Creationists_Pushing_Hard"&gt;Little Green Footballs&lt;/a&gt; (a website with which I agree on almost no other topic). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, write letters. Tell your friends. Send them here, or to those other links. Go to the Texas Citizens for Science site. If you have a blog, write about this, because when exposed to light this creationist ideologues tend to wither from embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, McLeroy was appointed by Texas Governor Rick Perry, and the next election for governor isn’t until 2010. But don’t forget: Perry is the guy who put an anti-science, inexperienced man in charge of Texas education, a man who has proven beyond any doubt whatsoever that not only is he wrong for the job, but that he will destroy science education in Texas… and Texas is a state that drives textbook sales throughout the country. This affects all of us. One man — one creationist — can unduly influence &lt;em&gt;the entire country&lt;/em&gt;. And this must be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="+2"&gt;Texas (and science education in the U.S.):&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So, who in their right mind would not want to be a god just like Jesus (being a Christian, even today, means being “Christ like” or being a wonder working messiah like figure yourself now limited to Faith Healers).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since about 99.9% of the world that early Christians proselytized from were already religious, Christianity had to offer something totally new and different to gain members. Now (as advertised or ‘As Seen of TV’), you too could become a God working miracles just like the Jesus and the Classical Gods! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:+0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:+0"&gt;However, if you did NOT want the “carrot” of being be a wonder working Christian here on earth, then you would get the “stick” of roasting forever (So if you think it’s bad for you now, just you wait and you’ll wish you had of converted)!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As stated above, in a world where all sickness was said to be caused by the Gods (often for wrong actions as punishment); where the reality of the server pain of being burnt either in daily cooking or in fires for warmth; where the daily struggle to find clean clear drinking water form wells and stream not cursed by demons or the Gods (remember they had no knowledge of micro-organisms) meant life or death. Thus, to have to live after death a place that incorporated all the real fears and realities of this life, was a great tool in evangelization that the other competing religions in the Greco=Roman west did not have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Here is a hard fact!&lt;/strong&gt; Especially note the fierily burning trash dump of the Semitic term and Hebrew place called “Gehenna”. This was a place where the general population could actually see the fires, smoke and smell the rotting and burning flesh of dead animals along with unclaimed human bodies. Palestinian Christianity used this concept to strike fear in the people of that location, but , once the Christian religion moved west into Asia Minor, Gehenna was totally dropped for the Classical Greek religious concept Hades / Hell which itself was reworked to strike fear in the Hellenistic populations.}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In conclusion, the claims and promises of a once powerful Christianity fueled by human fears and superstitions re-enforced by the lack of knowledge (modern science) which preached that all natural all disasters were from either God or Satan (note here within the last 300 years the Witch trials in Europe and Salem, Mass.) is a parade which has forever past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christianity now has conceded so much of its mystical word view that it now appears weak and deflated much like King Neptune who lost all his mighty powers to the Sea Witch in Disney’s "The Little Mermaid”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without Christianity’s living proofs of what the Gospels calls “Signs and Wonders” no longer able to compete with our scientific knowledge in the modern world, all its reality (known as dogmas / doctrines ) are now moved into some vague and mysterious “after life” untouchable by “sinful man’s” science and technology now begin relocated in either Heaven (for the righteous) or Hell (for the people who refuse to join in on this superstition in the modern world).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the “Bible Christians” who show up here at DC to argue the “truths” of Christianity, like Cain in Genesis 4: 13, they seem to be forever cursed to wonder in a strange new land where their burden of a mystical past now seems almost too much to bear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But with hope fueled by faith, they struggle on just like &lt;em&gt;Pilgrim&lt;/em&gt; in John Bunyan’s in &lt;strong&gt;Pilgrim's Progress&lt;/strong&gt; often facing the reality that  like the ancient Gods, superstitions die hard! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It resembles a particularly ugly bird with a nasty bite, but it couldn&amp;#39;t fly — none of the feathers covering its forelimbs are pennaceous, but are more like an insulating fur. Or, alternatively, its feathers were all about display, a possibility suggested by the odd long feathers of the tail. Here are the bones; as you can see, the integument is remarkably well preserved, with a scruffy ruff of short, non-shafted feathers over the body and limbs, and a surprising spray of just four very long feathers coming off the tail.&lt;/p&gt;

Abbreviations: l1, l2 and l7, 1st, 2nd and 7th left teeth of upper jaw; l1', r1' and r5', 1st left, 1st right and 5th right teeth of lower jaw; l2 and r2, 2nd left and right teeth of upper jaw.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s what it would have looked like in life (only the colors are imaginary). It would have been about the size of a pigeon — I think a pack of these scurrying about New York&amp;#39;s Times Square would be both scenic and would quickly clean up the pigeon problem there.&lt;/p&gt;

Fully. 100%. I loved them. I needed them. I only wished I had more money to spend to talk to them. Knowing that I could use a psychic to connect with my loved ones who have gone was easy to believe, and was the hardest thing to let go of.  But once I did let go, I was able to call myself a skeptic, a stronger woman, with a new world-view. I was able to face my old beliefs full-frontal. But in order to get there, I had to prove it to myself that the whole business was a scam. For me, there was only one way to do it, and that was to actually &lt;em&gt;do it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2003 some time, I was on my way out of religion, and slowly on my way into what I now know is called &lt;em&gt;skepticism&lt;/em&gt;. I was done handing over money to men who were using it to pay their defense lawyers to smear the names of the children they had harmed.  I think the breaking point may have been when my own pastor was named. (I’m not really sure what specifically made me run from the Church, but rape was- and still is- one of my major turn-offs.)  While searching for my new home in the spiritual world, I came to realize that there was a better explanation than “God did it all!” In fact, I came to realize that God probably didn’t do &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I wrestled with that.  I knew that if I accepted that there was no god, then I had to stop believing in an afterlife… it meant that I could no longer communicate with my dead sister. It meant that my sister, who I missed terribly (and still do) was not watching over me. She wasn’t talking to me. She wasn’t sending me messages. She didn’t want me to know she was okay. She isn’t telling jokes to my grandfather and she’s not playing fetch with our childhood dog. She’s not proud of me. She’s not guiding me. She’s gone. Nothing more, nothing less. Just gone. It meant that the psychics I was communicating through to talk to her were lying to me. It meant I never talked to her after she was gone. It meant that the last thing I ever said to her was that sure, she could call me back later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She never did call me back… until I talked with a man named &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.chipcoffey.com/"&gt;Chip Coffey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t go into much detail about what Chip and other psychics told me about my sister.  I was assured that Colleen was still around, that she loved me, there is no pain in the afterlife and all the typical beautiful, flowery, heartwarming bullshit that “spiritual mediums” say. Chip did paint a graphic verbal picture of her, on the pavement, a bloody mess of a half-dead body. As upsetting as it was to hear, that served as “validation”, I was told; a way for me to know that I was, indeed, talking to my sister who, just months earlier, died after being struck by a car while crossing the street. I really believed that this was something I needed to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t ready to let go of Colleen, and psychics let me hold on to her for as long as my credit card would let them let me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with a new world-view coming into focus, I had to walk away from those conversations with Colleen.  And in order to walk away, I had to admit to myself that those conversations were never had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/coldread.bmp"&gt;&lt;img title="coldread" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/coldread.bmp" alt="" width="169" height="115"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For a long time, I brushed off those guys who would come on TV and talk about psychics using a trick called “cold reading”.  You know the ones - the old guys with the beards… the ones trying to tell me that there was no way I could talk to Colleen anymore. They said that anyone who picked up a book on cold reading could, with practice, become as good as any daytime talkshow medium.  I used to blow them off as cold, heartless old men who were trying to tear me away from my only means of contact with my beloved little sister. Now I was wondering &lt;em&gt;what if they’re right&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d spent years trying to hone my own psychic powers (because supposedly we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; have them) to no avail.  What if there was no such thing as psychic powers at all?  It would certainly explain my inability to get better at contacting the dead and my failure to move clock hands with my mind.  What if the reason I couldn’t be psychic was simply because I didn’t open a magician’s handbook and read the chapter on this thing called “cold reading”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to answer that question for myself.  If I could make people believe that I had special powers, then I had my answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I became a phone psychic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than spend money and time reading books on the topic, I decided to just spend an afternoon Googling “cold reading”. I got the basics and got to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that my psychic specialty would be love. I figured love advice, psychic or otherwise, was usually a pretty easy thing to give. And I refused to rape the minds of the grieving to prove a point and make a buck.&lt;a href="http://www.imagechef.com/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn-img1.imagechef.com/w/081026/anmf40f96ec9fcb25f0.gif" alt="" width="140" height="140"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called one of my friends, who was already a non-believer, and we came up with a game plan for how the calls would go down.  I knew most of it would be improvising and making guesses based on information that the callers would give me, but I still needed a plan of attack. Making educated guesses, I had learned, was important. How would I get that information?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first thing I would do was get birthdates.  I wanted to quickly get started taking calls. I knew I didn’t have time to memorize the Zodiac, but I could use birthdays as a frame of reference. Was I dealing with a 16-year-old getting over getting dumped at the prom or a 45-year-old woman trying to catch her husband cheating on her with his secretary? The callers could make the assumption that I was doing something astrological if they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I made a list of mundane things that everyone has a story about.  Something that would apply to them personally without appearing to apply to anyone. It’s been years, so I can’t remember what all those things were, but a couple of my favorites stand out in my memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What did the note say? There was a note. On a small piece of paper. Tell me about it. What did it say?&lt;/em&gt; It was&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/call-me.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="call-me" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/call-me-300x263.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="158"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; one of the first questions I’d ask. And I’d ask it suddenly, as if it came to me out of nowhere. I was trying to gain credibility. We’d barely gotten past names and birthdates and suddenly I already knew about this note the two love-birds passed between each other… or the note passed between friends about this target of hopeful lust… or it was a break-up letter that she wrote and threw away… or it was a phone number he found in his girlfriend’s pocket last night… There was always a note. Always. No one ever questioned this one.  The first day of calls I took, my callers could practically see the green of my inexperience glowing through their phones’ earpieces. Some calls were unsalvageable wrecks of magled miss after miss.  But most of the time, that initial hit - the note - gave my callers faith in me. Sometimes it even gave me divine credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who’s got the funny nickname? &lt;/em&gt;Of course, if I were psychic, I should have known what the nickname was and whose it was. But no one called me out.  They were more impressed that I knew there was a funny nickname at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, I usually had enough information to dispense some pretty solid advice.  Even if I asked them not to offer up information, they couldn’t help themselves. Within 5 minutes I usually knew every detail required to tell them what they wanted to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My callers usually already knew the answers to their questions before they even called; they just needed a “psychic” to look into the future and confirm they were making the right decision. It wasn’t hard to “see” what they needed to hear and “see” what they needed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took calls for about two weeks, then ended my experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though not the case with every caller, there was an undeniable theme of desperation and vulnerability. My most memorable caller was a woman, 44-years-old, who had been in a bad relationship for about a year and a half.  She didn’t need a psychic; she needed a support system. She needed friends. She needed help. I dropped the psychic act early in the call, and talked to her like a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her boyfriend didn’t have a job. He didn’t help around the house. He didn’t respect her; he called her names. He’d go out without saying anything to her only to return the next afternoon, still drunk. It wasn’t hard to peek into the future and see that this wasn’t going to stop. What she needed to do was dump him and never looked back.  She knew this, she told me repeatedly, but she was afraid. She needed the reassurance of someone who could see the end of this and tell her everything would be okay if she left him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what ever happened with her and her boyfriend. She very well may have stayed with him. I do know that there is little chance she would have left him if she hadn’t received “psychic” guidance. She would have been easy to take advantage of… I could have gotten her to call me every day for a year. And the reality is, she probably called more psychics after me. I hope she did the right thing. I hope she left him. I hope she didn’t get a second opinion. But I’ll never know. The call still breaks my heart, 5 years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience changed me, no doubt.  I had a new disgust for the people who “help” people connect with their deceased loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to look back at my talks with Chip Coffey and the like. For a long time I couldn’t figure out how he knew the details of my sister’s accident without me telling her how she died. I realize now that he never actually painted the picture. He threw out a few random nouns and adjectives (e.g.; red, black, car) and let me fill in the blanks. Those blanks were filled in with the mental image of my sister bleeding out on the street. As I described it back to him, Chip did nothing to dissuade me from believing that this was the information my sister wanted me to have, and instead encouraged me to continue picturing the accident site. That picture gave him two advantages. First, as I talked about the accident, it kept me on the phone, paying by the minute. Second, I provided him plate after plate of information at the all-you-can-eat detail-buffet of my loss. And immediately after talking to him, I believed that he was the one providing the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my experiment I can walk myself through those post-Colleen calls I made, and I can see where I went wrong and how I was taken advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to watch the TV psychics in amazement.  I would have given anything to get onto &lt;em&gt;Crossing Over&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Montel&lt;/em&gt;. After my experiment, I turned on these shows and I could see through the whole act. I could see exactly what they were doing, the whole process.  I was still amazed… but for new reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t say that I’m proud of what I did. But I’m glad I did it. I can’t know if I would have ended up the skeptic that I am today if I hadn’t. The thing I regret most, though, is not telling my callers I was a fraud. I wonder how many saw through it.  Hopefully it’s more than I’d guess.&lt;/p&gt;

Beckwith who, I have to tell you, is a Professor of Philosophy and Church-State Studies at Baylor University - the largest Baptist University in the world.  You'll see the sort of mind it takes to be a professor at this institution by &lt;a href="http://www.whatswrongwiththeworld.net/2008/10/apple_computers_opposes_califo.html#more"&gt;reading the following letter&lt;/a&gt; Prof. Beckwith wrote to Apple Computers, who recently came out against Proposition 8 in California, which is trying to re-ban same-sex marriages out there.  Here's Apple's position (from his letter):&lt;blockquote&gt;Apple is publicly opposing Proposition 8 and making a donation of $100,000 to the No on 8 campaign. Apple was among the first California companies to offer equal rights and benefits to our employees’ same-sex partners, and we strongly believe that a person’s fundamental rights — including the right to marry — should not be affected by their sexual orientation. Apple views this as a civil rights issue, rather than just a political issue, and is therefore speaking out publicly against Proposition 8.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ok, just to get this ball of ear-wax rollin' here's Prof. Beckwith's weirdness on full display in the first part of his response:&lt;blockquote&gt;Apple's reasoning is flawed, since sexual orientation has never inhibited people from getting married. If marriage has a particular nature--one man, one woman--any man and woman not already married to someone else can marry each other regardless of their sexual orientation. So, “no” on Prop 8 does not advance any liberties at all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Um...does anyone else see a problem with this?  Am I reading this wrongly?  &lt;i&gt;"...Sexual orientation has never inhibited people from getting married"&lt;/i&gt;?  So, if a gay dude wants to get married, all he has to do is marry a girl.  Problem solved - he's married and his sexual orientation had no bearing on the procedure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except for the fact that he enjoys penis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next up is a shocking, firework-like display of semi-lobotomized rationalizing.  Only with a mind holed out by religious "thinking" could a person with a higher education degree and a specialization in this area be able to spout this sort of incredible pig-shit.  I &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; this reasoning.  I mean, imagine the size of the helmet on his guy's head:&lt;blockquote&gt;In Massachusetts soon after the state’s Supreme Judicial Court in 2003 required that the state issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, Catholic Charities, which was at the time in the child adoption business, was told by the state that it could no longer exclude same-sex couples as adoptee parents, even though the Catholic Church maintains that same-sex unions are deeply disordered and sinful. Because it did not want to compromise its moral theology, Catholic Charities ceased putting children up for adoption. And thus children and families were harmed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yeah, fuckers!  See what you do when you try to drag archaic, bronze-age institutions into the modern era?  They respond by retreating into the cave of denial and eyes-squished-closed-fingers-in-the-ears-la-la-la-I-can't-hear-you frame of mind that hurts babies!  BABIES!  Are you progressive, liberal, assholes happy now?!  You've forced the Catholic church to harm BABIES!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last bit:&lt;blockquote&gt;Because marriage is a public institution, there is surely no way to enforce same-sex marriage without punishing those who dissent in every public institution and accommodation. Thus, supporters of male-female marriage see the injustice in the state coercing them to embrace a policy for which their well-reasoned beliefs maintain is deleterious of social justice and the public good.&lt;/blockquote&gt;No, no one is &lt;i&gt;"coercing them to embrace"&lt;/i&gt; anything.  If you don't want a gay marriage, don't have one.  This is what so many of us genuinely hate about religious people - you just can't leave everyone else the fuck alone and you just &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to make your way the &lt;b&gt;only&lt;/b&gt; way.  &lt;i&gt;Well, I think gay marriage is wrong...so YOU shouldn't be allowed to do it."&lt;/i&gt;  No, douche, you keep your relationships to yourself, I'll keep my relationships to myself, and Ellen can keep her's to herself too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MYOB, fuckers, and don't try to make us regular people buy into your ridiculous crap.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

Californians will be voting on Proposition 8, which, if passed, will take away the rights of gays to marry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Carroll at Cosmic Variance had a wonderful essay last week about why this should matter to rational people, so I’ll &lt;a href="http://cosmicvariance.com/2008/10/19/marriage-and-fundamental-physics/"&gt;link to him&lt;/a&gt; instead of being redundant. I’ll simply underscore the point that the only reason we do not grant equal rights to gays is because of stubborn religious dogma that has no reason for existing in the present-day. Same-sex marriage will not ruin straight marriage (straights already ruined it all by themselves), and it will not cause the collapse of society (see Massachusetts, and the Netherlands, Belgium, South Africa, Canada, Norway, and Spain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a video floating around YouTube featuring young people blathering on about how same-sex marriage in California will destroy civilization, so &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/skepticsguide/index.php/topic,15077.0.html"&gt;some enterprising Skeptics’ Guide listeners&lt;/a&gt; took it upon themselves to make a point by redubbing the voices. I was happy to help them out, so please enjoy the following improved video, and Californians, don’t forget to vote &lt;a href="http://www.noonprop8.com/"&gt;NO on Proposition 8&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

We can’t get enough of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skepticblog.org"&gt;SkepticBlog&lt;/a&gt; is a group skeptical blog featuring regular contributions from Michael Shermer, Phil Plait, Yau-Man Chan (yeah, the Survivor guy), Mark Edward, Kirsten Sanford, Brian Dunning, and Ryan Johnson. Oh, yeah - and me. That’s a pretty solid line up of skepticism, if I do say so myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read my &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2008/10/24/introducing-skepticblog/"&gt;introductory post here&lt;/a&gt; for more info.  Essentially, the blog has two functions. The first (and the impetus for the blog) is to help promote our pilot skeptical reality TV show &lt;a href="http://www.skeptologists.com/"&gt;The Skeptologists&lt;/a&gt;. That project is still moving forward, and the blog is a way to help promote it. If the show gets picked up then the blog will likely continue as a companion to the show - although I honestly have no idea what would happen once TV executives own the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completely aside from The Skeptologists, we just wanted to run a group skeptical blog for its own sake.  This blog will have a life of its own, whether or not the show gets picked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be contributing to the blog every Monday - and you can read my first Monday contribution &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2008/10/27/the-real-ghost-story/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I will continue to contribute at the same rate to NeuroLogica, including a regular Monday post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am already getting the obvious question - am I spreading myself too thin? Well, yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of work load, yes I am extremely busy, what with my academic medical career, 2 podcasts, and now 4 blogs. But honestly, the amount of time I put in is about average for an academic, and less than many of my colleagues. Rather than spending all of my time in the lab, or maintaining a textbook, or publishing hundreds of papers, I am promoting science and reason and exploring the new media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also - popular science bloggers write more blog entries than I do each week. Phil Plait (Bad Astronomy) wrote 18 blog entries in the last week, and PZ Myers (Pharyngula) wrote 31.  I typically write 6-7 blog entries per week, and now will increase that number to 8. I just spread my work around to 4 different blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if this is a good strategy or not, but it fits my goals. Phil and PZ have built their media-science careers around their very popular blogs. My media flagship is my podcast - the Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe. NeuroLogica is my personal blog where I explore whatever interests me, including issues of neuroscience. The Rogues Gallery is a companion blog to the SGU, and so there I focus on issues that relate more to the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science-Based Medicine represents the intersection of my medical career with my promotion of the public understanding of science and anti-pseudoscience watchdog activities. This site, which is also a group blog, has a very specific purpose - to promote higher and better standards of science in health care, and to oppose those efforts to either change the definition of science in medicine or to eliminate the scientific basis of the standard of care in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now SkepticBlog also has a specific purpose - to promote The Skeptologists. But also to serve as a collaboration among various skeptical organizations (Skeptic Society, JREF, the NESS) and individuals. Skeptical activists have been pretty much left to do their own thing, without any existing organizational infrastructure to climb. This has had its benefits, actually, encouraging independence and experimentation. But as the movement has grown, I think there is great potential in trying to pull together some of the various threads into collaborative projects to achieve things that individually we cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas up until now the skeptical movement has been dominated by individual efforts, now I think we are entering a new phase that will be shaped by collaboration and partnerships. SkepticBlog and The Skeptologists are manifestations of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll see where it takes us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this date in history…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1838 – Missouri governor Lilburn Boggs issues &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extermination_Order_(Mormonism)"&gt;The Extermination Order&lt;/a&gt;, which orders all Mormons to leave the state or be exterminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We at The Skeptics Guide have been critical of Mormons when they have acted badly by either attacking science or indoctrinating people into their cult-like sects. But can you imagine a time in US history when the governor of a state could issue an extermination order against any person or a group of people? Well, it seems the Mormons have been getting in to lots of different kinds of trouble for a long time. This story involves bigotry, intolerance, hate mongering, brawls, murders, political intrigue, religious zealotry, military trials, and prison escapes. Give it a read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1961 - NASA launched the first Saturn I rocket in Mission Saturn-Apollo 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first flight of the Saturn I booster, the first in the Saturn family, and a huge increase in size and power over anything launched before it. It was three times taller, required six times more fuel and produced ten times more thrust than the Jupiter-C rocket that had launched the first American satellite, Explorer 1 into orbit in 1958. The entire mission duration was 15 minutes, and the rocket traveled about 206 miles. Until the Space Shuttle program launched in 1981, the Saturn class rocket was the accelerator of choice for the US space program’s most important missions for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People celebrating birthdays, or would otherwise be celebrating their birthdays on this day are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1728 – Captain James Cook – was an English seaman who was the first of the scientific navigators. Captain Cook spent several years surveying the coasts of Labrador and Newfoundland. He observed a solar eclipse on August 5, 1766 near Cape Ray, Newfoundland. On the first of three expeditions into the Pacific (1768) he took Joseph Banks as the ship’s botanist to study the flora and fauna discovered. (This practice of carrying a naturalist took place some 75 years before Charles Darwin’s famous voyage.) Cook observed the transit of Venus on this voyage from the island of Tahiti on June 3, 1769. This would help scientists plot the distance between the Sun to the earth. His geographical discoveries made him the most famous navigator since Magellan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1806 - Alphonse Pyrame de Candolle - was a Swiss botanist who began new methods of investigation and analysis in phytogeography (the geographic distribution of plants). His father, Augustin Pyrame de Candolle had developed a general scheme of plant classification, for which he coined the word taxonomy (1813). This was to dominate plant classification for 50 years. Augustin used his scheme in a major series of volumes on botany. Alphonse de Candolle, completed this series, and is mainly responsible for continuing the great work Prodromus Systematis Naturalis regni vegetablis, published over a number of years, following the original lines laid down by his father. His own Origin of Cultivated Plants was published in 1882&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1811 – Isaac Singer - was the English inventor of the continuous-stitch sewing machine in 1851. Singer was an itinerant machinist until 1851 when he designed an effective sewing machine using the basic features found on modern machines. A patent infringement settled with Elias Howe, another sewing machine inventor, did nothing to deter Singer. The company he founded was, within the decade, the world’s largest sewing machine manufacturer. Singer gained 20 additional patents, but his biggest invention was the new way of marketing to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1827 - Pierre-Eugène Marcellin Berthelot – was a French organic and physical chemist, science historian, and government official whose creative thought and work significantly influenced the development of chemistry in the late 19th century. He helped to found the study of thermochemistry, introduced a standard method for determining the latent heat of steam, measured hundreds of heats of reactions and coined the words exothermic and endothermic. Berthelot systematically synthesized organic compounds, including some not found in nature. His syntheses of many fundamental organic compounds helped to destroy the classical division between organic and inorganic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1855 - Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin – was a Russian horticulturist, of little education, who crossbred over 300 new types of fruit trees and berries, some able to survive the winters of Central Russia, and was praised by Soviet officials. His theory of hybridization held the fanciful the idea that acquired characteristics were inheritable. His private orchard at Koslov, became a state institution, and in 1932 the city known as Kozlov for four centuries became Michurinsk. When Mendelian genetics came under attack in the Soviet Union, Michurin’s controversial theory became state doctrine. It was elaborated by Trofim D. Lysenko, a Bolshevik bureaucrat, as a uniquely communist approach to agriculture, despite the nearly universal rejection of this doctrine by the world’s scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1925 - Albert Medwin – is an American inventor who holds several US patents, including ones in the field of electronic encoders. Albert was involved in the early development of integrated circuits while working at RCA in Somerville, New Jersey. In the 1960’s he led the engineering group that developed the world’s first low power CMOS chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1951 - Carlos Frenk – is a world-famous Mexican-British cosmologist who has given invited lectures at major international conferences throughout the world. His main interests lie in the field of cosmology, galaxy formation and computer simulations of cosmic structure formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some notable names that perished on this date include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1449 - Ulugh Beg, Timurid ruler and astronomer (b.1394) was a Timurid ruler as well as an astronomer, mathematician and sultan. His commonly known name is not truly a personal name, but rather a moniker, which can be loosely translated as “Great Ruler” or “Patriarch Ruler”. Ulugh Beg was notable for his work in astronomy-related mathematics, such as trigonometry and spherical geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1968 - Lise Meitner, German physicist (b.1878) Lise Meitner was part of the team that discovered nuclear fission, an achievement for which her colleague Otto Hahn was awarded the Nobel Prize. Meitner is often mentioned as one of the most glaring examples of scientific achievement overlooked by the Nobel committee. A 1997 Physics Today study concluded that Meitner’s omission was “a rare instance in which personal negative opinions apparently led to the exclusion of a deserving scientist” from the Nobel. In 1917, she and chemist Otto Hahn discovered the first long-lived isotope of the element protactinium. In 1923, she discovered the cause, known as the Auger effect, of the emission from surfaces of electrons with ’signature’ energies. Meitner was one of the first scientists to articulate a theory of how the nucleus of an atom could be split into smaller parts. She (along with fellow scientist Otto Frisch) had discovered the reason that no stable elements beyond uranium (in atomic number) existed naturally; the electrical repulsion of so many protons overcame the “strong” nuclear force. Meitner also first realized that Einstein’s famous equation, E = mc2, explained the source of the tremendous releases of energy seen in atomic decay, by the conversion of the mass-defect into energy. (Wow!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1980 - John Hasbrouck van Vleck, American physicist, Nobel Prize laureate (b.1899) was an American physicist, co-awarded the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physics, for his contributions to the understanding of electrons in magnetic solids. Van Vleck participated in the Manhattan Project by serving on the Los Alamos Review committee in 1943. (He was also a native of Connecticut.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1992 - David Bohm, American-born physicist, philosopher, and neuropsychologist (b. 1917) an American-born quantum physicist who made significant contributions in the fields of theoretical physics, philosophy and neuropsychology, and to the Manhattan Project. Bohm’s approach to philosophy and physics receive expression in his 1980 book Wholeness and the Implicate Order, and in his 1987 book Science, Order and Creativity. Bohm also made significant theoretical contributions to neuropsychology and the development of the holonomic model of the functioning of the brain. Bohm helped establish the foundation for Pribram’s theory that the brain operates in a manner similar to a hologram, in accordance with quantum mathematical principles and the characteristics of wave patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1999 - Robert Mills, American physicist (b. 1927) was a physicist, specializing in quantum field theory, the theory of alloys, and many-body theory. While sharing an office at Brookhaven National Laboratory, in 1954, Chen Ning Yang and Mills proposed a tensor equation for what are now called Yang-Mills fields&lt;/p&gt;

Gene Myers, a former vice president at Celera who was one of the leaders in sequencing the human genome, has been quote by Tom Abate in the San Francisco Chronicle as saying,  &amp;quot;What really astounds me is the architecture of life…The system is extremely complex. It&amp;#39;s like it was designed… There&amp;#39;s a huge intelligence there.&amp;quot; This quote is one of the stock items used by Muslim and Christian creationists everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was &lt;a href="http://www.tonkafocus.org/Amicus%20brief%20info.htm"&gt;interviewed by TonkaFocus&lt;/a&gt;, and asked flatly whether he was an Intelligent Design creationism supporter. His answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not. I am being taken out of context and upset about this. Abate [SF Chronicle reporter] interviewed me shortly after we had completed the genome and for a moment I waxed poetic about the complexity of what was there and the elegance of the 'design'. Evolution is very real - it is directly observable in the time frames of mutating bacteria, e.g. the acquisition of antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case closed on that one.

The issue made national news, including some rather&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/10/despicable_rhetoric_from_rush_limbaugh_1.php"&gt; despicable rhetoric from Rush Limbaugh&lt;/a&gt; about Michael J. Fox, who made ads in support of the Missouri initiative, as well as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/10/another_reason_to_hope_that_the_tigers_c.php"&gt;deceptive ads against the proposal&lt;/a&gt; featuring Patricia Heaton and members of the St. Louis Cardinals. It was a big stink that drew national attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to two years later and to my home state of Michigan, and history appears to be repeating itself, although I fear that the outcome will be different this time. It turns out that Michigan has a similar issue on its ballot regarding stem cell research, but there doesn't seem to be anywhere near the national attention aimed at the issue as there was at Missouri two years ago. Perhaps it's because this is a Presidential election rather than a midterm Congressional election. I don't know. However, the issues at stake are at least as interesting and important as the Missouri ballot issue. In fact, they're arguably more so, given that Michigan presently has one of the most restrictive in the nation. Moreover, &lt;a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/ED-20_11-08_Props_Poster2_251561_7.pdf"&gt;Proposal 2&lt;/a&gt; says nothing more than this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/stem_cell_controversy_in_michigan.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/stem_cell_controversy_in_michigan.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/433546670" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225115840787"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/jennifer-hudsons-family-tragedy/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5042df100a7f0273</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="celebrity"/><category term="crime"/><category term="names"/><title type="html">Jennifer Hudson's Family Tragedy</title><published>2008-10-27T13:43:51Z</published><updated>2008-10-27T13:43:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/F2KferXWWSE/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/jennifer-hudsons-family-tragedy/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Not that far from where I live, Jennifer Hudson's mother and brother were murdered this weekend.

Now, I don’t mind the occasional handing of the head to someone who so desperately needs it, but my time is limited, and I cannot stamp FAIL on everyone’s forehead no matter how richly they deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I will point you to two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/10/03/comments-policy/"&gt;My commenting policy&lt;/a&gt;. It boils down to, &amp;quot;Don’t be a jerk.&amp;quot; Hint: if you’re wondering whether you’re stepping over the line of my policy, you probably are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) More importantly, perhaps, is &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/07/15/politics-science-me-and-thee/"&gt;my statement on posts dealing with politics and religion&lt;/a&gt;. Face it: the next week or two I will not be posting less on politics. I’ll be posting more. A large fraction of the time McCain or Palin open their mouths, some antiscience nonsense spews forth (as opposed to what comes out &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the time). When they do (or in the event that Obama and Biden do as well — but if you don’t understand that’s more likely on the R side than the D one, you might want to spend some quality time in my archives) I will call them out.

&lt;p&gt;Newspaper stories about the financial markets often contain quantitative information that is intepretable only by experts. The headline screams &amp;quot;Dow Up 200!&amp;quot;, but what does that mean? In some contexts (say, apartment rentals), 200 is a lot.  In others (e.g., houses prices), it is hardly anything at all. Similiarly, what is a 3% change like? Sometimes we&amp;#39;re asked to shrug off 3% differences as irrelevant (think of polling data). For the markets, though, most of us have the sense that 3% is  a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headlines do contain some information that all of us have intuitions about: the verbs and other predicates that describe the change. We know that &lt;em&gt;rise&lt;/em&gt; says  that the change was upwards, and we can intuitively juxtapose it with &lt;em&gt;soar&lt;/em&gt;, which suggests really dramatic upward change. Conversely, &lt;em&gt;fall&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;plummet&lt;/em&gt; describe motion in the downward direction, with the second implying much worse news than the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for our linguistic intuitions. Do they square with the way newspaper headline writers use these predicates in describing financial markets? This is much less clear. As part of our &lt;a href="http://web.linguist.umass.edu/~drh/"&gt;Data Rich Humanities project&lt;/a&gt;, sponsored by &lt;a href="http://www.umass.edu/hfa/"&gt;UMass Amherst CHFA&lt;/a&gt;, we have been exploring this question using the collection of 23,327 NY Times financial headlines described in &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=714"&gt;this earlier post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an initial experiment, we pulled all the headlines that match the pattern &lt;strong&gt;Dow PRED N (point(s)/percent/%)&lt;/strong&gt;, where &lt;strong&gt;PRED&lt;/strong&gt; is a verb/predicate and &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt; is a numerical value. Where the unit is not mentioned, &lt;em&gt;points&lt;/em&gt; seems always to be understood. Headlines writers have a strong propensity for reporting changes in terms of points, which are interpretable only if one knows the size of the market at the time of reporting. However, percentage changes can involve &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004992.html"&gt;small enough numbers that they might raise other issues&lt;/a&gt;. So we can assume that, whatever the numerical value, most readers look to the words in the headline to figure out what happened. This makes those words vitally important to accurate reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We converted all point values to percentage values, using the opening price of the market on the day the headline was written (or as close as we could come, for days when we didn't have the data). This put all the data on a uniform scale, and it removed the time-dependence of point values. (200 points was a much bigger deal twenty years ago than it is today. Percentage changes have a more constant impact.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are generally encouraging; it looks as though readers of the Times can basically trust their intuitions about the relevant predicates in forming an opinion about how serious the financial news is. Figure 1 provides histograms for four predicates: &lt;em&gt;rise&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;fall&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;soar&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;plunge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Figure 1 (click to enlarge)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ll-dowpreds-histogram.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ll-dowpreds-histogram.jpg" alt="Histograms for rise, fall, soar, and plunge" width="375" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, &lt;em&gt;rise&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fall&lt;/em&gt; are moderate change verbs. They are (generally) used when the market change was below 1%. After that, their superlative counterparts (usually) take over. In the terms of linguistic pragmatics, &lt;em&gt;rise&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicature/"&gt;conversationally implicates&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;not soar&lt;/em&gt;: soaring counts as rising, but it is misleading to use &lt;em&gt;rise&lt;/em&gt; for dramatic changes. Some misleading instances aside, headline writers seem to be adhering to this pragmatics. The same can be said for the &lt;em&gt;fall-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;plunge&lt;/em&gt; pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The histograms are suggestive, but we think they are not the ideal  tool, especially since our data have some notable outliers and gaps that probably trace to data-sparseness. The boxplots in figure 2 seem superior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Figure 2 (click to enlarge)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ll-dowpreds-boxplot.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ll-dowpreds-boxplot.jpg" alt="Boxplots for rise, fall, soar, and plunge" width="375" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an information-rich visualization.  It is worth pointing out various of its features, since they point  uniformly to the idea that headline writers use these predicates reliably:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most important data-point is the dark horizontal line in each plot.  This is the median value. The values for &lt;em&gt;rise&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fall&lt;/em&gt; are close: 0.53 for &lt;em&gt;rise&lt;/em&gt; and 0.63 for &lt;em&gt;fall&lt;/em&gt;. In contrast, the median values for &lt;em&gt;soar&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;plunge&lt;/em&gt; are higher: 1.5 and 1.9, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can also compare the boxed areas. These delimit the values within the first and third quartiles — the core of the data. For each of the &lt;em&gt;rise&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;soar&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fall&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;plunge&lt;/em&gt; pairs, these areas do not overlap, a strong indication that their median values are genuinely different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The downward whisker of &lt;em&gt;soar&lt;/em&gt; (whose length extends 1.5 times the 25-50% inter-quartile range or to the minimum) does not overlap with the upper quartile (75%) of &lt;em&gt;rise. &lt;/em&gt; The downward whisker for &lt;em&gt;plunge&lt;/em&gt; just barely overlaps with the upper quartile of&lt;em&gt; fall&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these distributional features point to the conclusion that headline writers, like the rest of us, generally use &lt;em&gt;rise&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fall&lt;/em&gt; for modest changes, reserving their more picturesque counterparts for extreme changes in the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we do not mean to say that the language is never misleading:&lt;/p&gt;

For those of you who are alcestically challenged, this is a bull moose:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And this is a cow:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I'd better clarify that.  The photograph above is of a cow &lt;b&gt;moose&lt;/b&gt;. The photograph below is of a &lt;b&gt;cow&lt;/b&gt;.  Every year any number of &lt;strike&gt;drunken morons&lt;/strike&gt; hunters mysteriously confuse one with the other.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.cvmbs.colostate.edu/ilm/proinfo/necropsy/images/dairy%20cow.jpg" width="65%" alt="A cow"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can distinguish a moose from other cervids very easily by the antlers: only the antlers of moose are palmate (broad and spread out, like the palm of the hand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in Carrier country moose are an important source of both food and hides, so it isn&amp;#39;t surprising that there is a fairly refined vocabulary for them.  In general, moose are called either dʌni or xʌda. The bull moose is dʒejo, the cow either dʌniʔat &amp;quot;moose wife&amp;quot; or xʌdats&amp;#39;e &amp;quot;female moose&amp;quot;. The calf is called tsije, which is probably a loan from Sekani meaning &amp;quot;little yellow thing&amp;quot;, reflecting the fact that moose calves tend to have a jaundiced appearance. In the photo below, you can see the calf&amp;#39;s yellowish coloration.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/14/16031279_e8f7c936b6.jpg?v=0" width="65%" alt="A cow moose with calf"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When the calves have been weaned, they are called tʃ&amp;#39;abedʌnis̪tʃut. A dry cow is called dets&amp;#39;it, while a newly sexually mature cow that has not yet had a calf is called a tʃandʒu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms for the parts of a moose are the same as the body part terms for other animals, with the exception of the dewlap or &amp;quot;goatee&amp;quot;, which is called dʌnitʃʌl. Another term for the dewlap is dʌtʃ&amp;#39;ʌkʷ jenʌxwʌle, literally &amp;quot;the thing that porcupines play with&amp;quot;, reflecting the fact that moose and porcupines are considered to be friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have a picture of that, but moose actually do occasionally play with other smaller animals.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/duniboosnadubo7.jpg" width="65%" alt="A moose and a cat nuzzling each other"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
English and French have less elaborate terminology for moose, but interestingly, in both languages, the term used in North America is different from the term used in Europe. The term &lt;i&gt;moose&lt;/i&gt; used in North American English is a loan from Eastern Abenaki &lt;i&gt;moz&lt;/i&gt;, cognate to the Plains Cree word more familiar here in Western Canada, &lt;i&gt;mōswa&lt;/i&gt;. In British English, moose are called &lt;i&gt;elk&lt;/i&gt;, a word that goes back to Proto-Indo-European. The animal called &lt;i&gt;elk&lt;/i&gt; in North American English is a different species, &lt;i&gt;Cervus canadensis&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Cervus_canadensis2006.jpg/650px-Cervus_canadensis2006.jpg" width="65%" alt="A North American elk, Cervus canadensis"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Notice the more robust body, thicker, sturdier, legs, slenderer snout, and non-palmate antlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian French term for moose is &lt;i&gt;orignal&lt;/i&gt;, which comes from Basque &lt;i&gt;oreina&lt;/i&gt; "deer" via &lt;i&gt;orignac&lt;/i&gt;, the form that the Basque word took on in the Basque-Micmac pidgin used by the Micmac and visiting Basque fishermen and whalers. The European French term, &lt;i&gt;élan&lt;/i&gt;,is a loan from Middle High German &lt;i&gt;elend&lt;/i&gt;, which is ultimately related to the English word &lt;i&gt;elk&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific name for moose, &lt;i&gt;Alces alces&lt;/i&gt;, contains the Latin term for moose, which is a loan from some Western Germanic language. Moose are not found in Italy, so the Romans only encountered them when their conquests led them well to the North.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do North American English and French use different words for moose than their European counterparts? It probably reflects the fact that the early settlers were unfamiliar with moose. In Europe today moose are found in Scandinavia, the Baltic, Russia, and Siberia, In earlier times they were found in Scotland but have been extinct for several thousand years.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Sarah Palin is known for, other than her liking for mooseburgers, is her reported ability to field dress a moose. Here's what the result of field dressing looks like.  We've kept the head because the nose will later be cut off and boiled to be eaten.  I don't know if the Palins eat moose nose.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here's what a partially dressed moose looks like. It has been opened up and the guts removed. The big shiny thing at lower left is the moose's stomach, full of partially digested food. The legs have not yet been removed, and the meat has not yet been cut off.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Incidentally, the proper way to remove a moose's tongue, which many regard as a delicacy, is by cutting a slit underneath and pulling it out from below. That gives you a better grip and lets you get at the root of the tongue with your knife. Here Sam has cut the slit.&lt;br&gt;

I don't know why no journalist, or Joe Biden during the debate, has asked Sarah Palin about her moose butchering technique. I would think that discerning voters would want to know.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bill Poser</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225054258640"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/26/nasa-sad-but-true-graph/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d946da06525c9fc6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="NASA"/><title type="html">NASA: sad but true graph</title><published>2008-10-26T20:30:59Z</published><updated>2008-10-26T20:30:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/26/nasa-sad-but-true-graph/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/"&gt;Hemant Mehta&lt;/a&gt; sent me a link to &lt;a href="http://graphjam.com/2008/10/24/song-chart-memes-nasa-in-the-news/"&gt;this graph from GraphJam&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

Paul&lt;/a&gt; argues based on the sociological data from several different nations to this conclusion: &lt;blockquote&gt;The non-religious, pro-evolution democracies contradict the dictum that a society cannot enjoy good conditions unless most citizens ardently believe in a moral creator. The widely held fear that a Godless citizenry must experience societal disaster is therefore refuted. Contradicting these conclusions requires demonstrating a positive link between theism and societal conditions in the first world with a similarly large body of data - a doubtful possibility in view of the observable trends.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;

They've had it worse than I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some students burst into tears when a high school biology told them they'd be studying evolution. Another teacher said some students repeatedly screamed "no" when he began talking about it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Other teachers said students demanded to know whether they pray and questioned why the had to learn about evolution if it was just a theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get remarks on my student evaluations (last year, a group of students must have collaborated, because there were a half dozen evaluations that said exactly the same thing: &amp;quot;This class taught me to love Jesus even more!&amp;quot;, which they may have thought would hurt my feelings, but I just laughed.) I&amp;#39;ve had some students who talked to my colleagues about this evolution stuff — they were apparently afraid to confront me. I do get some forthright creationists, but they don&amp;#39;t respond with tears…they try to argue with me, which is just fine. But otherwise, the only screams I get are when I return exams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solutions are a little vaguely stated, but OK — they are actively responding to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, Pratt started holding meetings - open to parents, students, church members and others - to address their questions about evolution. She holds the annual session a few weeks before she begins the unit and gets about 200 people.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"It used to be that the whole unit was a struggle, and we were butting heads," Pratt said. "This meeting helps everyone understand that science teachers are not the enemy. Now, the kids are showing up ready to learn about evolution."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Other teachers said they try to fix students' misconceptions. They explain how humans and apes share a common ancestor that no longer exists, not that humans and apes evolved from one another. They say that while "theory" may describe a hunch in everyday language, in science it is defined as an explanation supported by factual evidence to describe events that occur in our world.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Graham Balch, a biology teacher at Grady High in Atlanta, addressed the controversy head-on. He had his students read about Cox's actions and the response she got. They learned about efforts across the country to water down lessons about evolution and how other public and private schools teach the material. They debated the cause of the conflict and whether evolution should be taught in public schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for myself, the way I handle it is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to push atheism in the classroom (you're shocked, I know), since that would lead into arguments that aren't part of the subject matter of the course. What I do instead is teach a historical approach to the issue of evolution, showing that there really wasn't an Evil Atheist Conspiracy at work, but simply scientists who were making honest evaluations of the evidence: 19th century geology was driven by profits to be made from coal and railroads and canals, not ideology, and Darwin arrived at his conclusions in spite of his upbringing in a faith. And once you've gone through the evidence, it becomes really easy to spend a lecture or two ripping up creationists, because the students can easily see how creationists are not operating in good faith and are in denial of the facts of geology and biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some still argue with me now and then, but usually my problem is keeping the other students in the class from brutalizing the poor credulous sap's arguments too cruelly.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a pilot for a TV show I did with six other skeptics. We’re still working on getting it picked up, and I hear things are still warm on that front, which is good to know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime though, we decided we’d put together a blog where all of us could contribute. So all of us — Brian Dunning, Michael Shermer, Kirsten Sanford, Yau-Man Chan, Mark Edwards, Steven Novella, and I — &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/"&gt;have started up the SkepticBlog&lt;/a&gt;. It’ll feature a post a day from one of us on some sort of skeptical topic. The first are already up, including ones about the economy, hucksters on TV, Sylvia Brown, Chinese skepticism, and mine about UFOs (a repost from here; I know, but I was spread a little thin when we needed the first post); things should ease up soon and I’ll have original content).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/joom/"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt; at Randi’s site, a multi-blogger format will give you a chance to see what’s going on in different people’s minds, with different perspectives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And reading one more skeptic blog won’t kill you. It might even make your day go a little better.

&lt;p&gt;Baloney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The context of that comment was that she was claiming research had "little or nothing to do with the public good", and she brought up these seemingly trivial little animals and a place the right wing despises as dogwhistles to her hoople-headed fans. Claiming &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; that she was making an informed criticism of a specific study is a feeble attempt to distract with a lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, this is the crank governor of Alaska who denies evolution and global warming, the backup candidate to a man who &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2008/10/07/john_mccain_bears/"&gt;mocks research into bear DNA&lt;/a&gt; and calls a multimillion dollar educational tool an &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/08/mccains-planetariophobia/"&gt;"overhead projector"&lt;/a&gt;, from a party that &lt;a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/?p=7515"&gt;ridicules people with Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; because they want more stem cell research, and idiots want to claim that she isn't &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; anti-science because in this one case she was actually targeting an instance of applied research that directly benefits agricultural interests?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's insane. You have to be a purblind slavering zombie of the Rethuglican party to swallow that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes deeper than just trying to belittle science, too — we are a technological society that is entirely dependent on the advancements science has brought to us, that is facing a new series of challenges that will require new science to overcome. The Assemblies of God churches are not going to come up with anything to help with global warming, alternative energy, new medicine, new reproductive technologies, new discoveries, new ideas. Science is our tool to help people, yet the Republican party only sees it as a kind of armament factory to help them kill strangers in foreign lands. As &lt;a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/?p=12886"&gt;John Cole put it&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;why is it that the people who claim to adhere to the culture of life are so filled with hate for…people?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/losing_the_sense_of_the_argume.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/432617204" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1225033368709"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/best_doctor_who_adventure_ever.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b3db63e0c5a89f00</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment/culture"/><title type="html">Best Doctor Who adventure ever?</title><published>2008-10-26T15:27:04Z</published><updated>2008-10-26T15:27:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/432621663/best_doctor_who_adventure_ever.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/best_doctor_who_adventure_ever.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don't recall where I saw this, but I've been meaning to post it.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;If […] &amp;quot;go mad&amp;quot; is a modern formation that is perfectly grammatical, why would Mr Pullum label &amp;quot;head dagenham&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;…a little beyond the syntactic fringe&amp;quot;? What&amp;#39;s the difference?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dagenham business is in Geoff Pullum's post "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=275"&gt;Beyond Barking&lt;/a&gt;", 6/24/2008; and the assertion about "go mad" is &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=764"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And I'm afraid that Amy's question doesn't have a very impressive answer, because this isn't, as far as I can tell, something that can (or should) be deduced from the fundamental axioms of grammar and logic. Essentially, it's just a fact about the verbs &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;head&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can put this answer into a broader context by observing that "go mad" is a fairly productive pattern, commonly attested not only with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, but also with dozens of other words, such as bad, ballistic, bankrupt, crazy, native, sour, straight, wrong. If you interpret &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dagenham&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to mean "spectacularly crazy", as a jocular implication of the fact that it's one stop beyond Barking on a certain rail line (and thus "beyond barking (mad)") then you could presumably say that someone has "gone Dagenham". There are even syntactic precedents in expressions like "go Hollywood" or "go Nashville".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;head&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (as Geoff pointed out) generally requires a prepositional phrase or similar direction word: you can "head out of town" or "head home" or "head south", but you can't "head crazy" or "head Hollywood".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no logical reason for this — it&amp;#39;s perfectly clear what it would mean to &amp;quot;head crazy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;head Hollywood&amp;quot;, but the English language happens not to use &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;head&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that way. This would be a reasonable extension to the language, so it's not a shock to find a few relevant examples out there on the web, like &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXdEMmx6a0k"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; (though it's apparently not from a native English speaker). But to a pretty good approximation, expressions like "head crazy" just aren't used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could explore the history of the words and constructions in question — and discover that phrases like &amp;quot;go mad&amp;quot; are not particularly &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; — and we could compare the analogous constructions across languages; but in the end, Geoff wrote one thing about &amp;quot;head Dagenham&amp;quot; and I wrote something else about &amp;quot;go missing&amp;quot; because that&amp;#39;s just the way the English language is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source

I think Sarah Palin is a disaster. You know all the reasons: no experience, chosen cynically, a past that can charitably be called checkered, no understanding of the job for which she’s been picked, stirring up vile emotions in the base, blatant hypocrisy, $150,000 for clothes (how much sporting equipment could your standard Hockey Mom buy for that?), so on and so forth ad nauseum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/16/repost-mccains-planetariophobia/"&gt;John McCain has shown a weird contempt for science education&lt;/a&gt;, repeatedly, though he does seem to support some science. But now Palin has opened her mouth once again, and dontcha know, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCXqKEs68Xk"&gt;garbage has spewed forth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;

&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/HCXqKEs68Xk%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palin is criticizing research into fruit flies, presumably because it’s a waste and takes away money that could be spent on helping learning disabled kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would rail and froth at the sheer evil and willful antiscience of these statements, but &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/sarah_palin_ignorant_and_antis.php"&gt;PZ makes the case pretty well&lt;/a&gt;, showing why this research is vital into understanding genetics and molecular biology. &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/10/sarah-palin-proudly-ignorant.html"&gt;Skeptico has, too&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/10/25/01849/495"&gt;Daily Kos has an awesome smackdown&lt;/a&gt; of her ignorant ravings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Olbermann interviewed Richard Wolfe about this, who didn’t hold back either, &lt;a href="http://crooksandliars.com/nicole-belle/countdown-palin-wants-help-special-ne"&gt;calling this comment from Palin&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;mindless ignorant [and] uninformed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/10/24/palin-fruit-flies/"&gt;Think Progress points out the real stupidity of Palin’s claims&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;research into fruit flies has led to understanding autism better&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans used to stand for good science, way back in the 60s and 70s. What happened to this party? I can guess the massive pandering to the &amp;quot;religious right&amp;quot; is what destroyed their ability to support reality. I am strongly of the opinion that people like Palin, Inhofe, Brownback, and others in the government don’t represent the majority of citizens of the country or even their home constituents… and if they do represent them, it’s because science has been &lt;strong&gt;mis&lt;/strong&gt;represented to those citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I commission polls at UC Berkeley and we call wireless phones.  Seems like a no brainer to me.  So, I've never quite understood why professional polling firms wouldn't call cell phones.  (I'm an expert in telemarketing laws; survey firms can call cell phones legally so long as it is not a front for marketing.)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I poked around at some prominent pollster's sites to see whether they call cell phone users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallup: &lt;a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/110383/Does-Gallup-call-cell-phones.aspx"&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;, when it is a "national telephone Gallup Poll" survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zogby: No.  Here are their &lt;a href="http://www.zogby.com/cemag/view.cfm?id=13"&gt;reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Princeton: It looks like yes, but it's not clear that they always do.  Looks like Pew did a &lt;a href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/964/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; with Princeton on this issue finding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Pew Research Center for the People &amp;amp; the Press has conducted three major election surveys with both cell phone and landline samples since the conclusion of the primaries. In each of the surveys, there were only small, and not statistically significant, differences between presidential horserace estimates based on the combined interviews and estimates based on the landline surveys only. Yet a virtually identical pattern is seen across all three surveys: In each case, including cell phone interviews resulted in slightly more support for Obama and slightly less for McCain, a consistent difference of two-to-three points in the margin.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Hart: No statement on the matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/mr_president_we_must_not_allow.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/431938293" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224961170711"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3778">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9c8670cba5fe97a9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition 10.25</title><published>2008-10-25T18:59:07Z</published><updated>2008-10-25T18:59:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3778" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7f8dc9b4af2d865e06ed52ad165c9589&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving home the other day, listening to Aesop Rock’s lament of the IAU’s August 2006 decision to demote Pluto, (a fun and geeky song titled, fittingly, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG8bD28Ek84"&gt;“Bring Back Pluto”&lt;/a&gt;) I wondered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we over Pluto?  Nobody talks about it anymore.  Despite the cultural nostalgia associated with it, I pretty much understood and agreed with the decision from the beginning, but are there some of you out there secretly holding out hope that they will bring it back?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2008/10/21/2008-10-21_elephantshaped_ganesh_growth_cured_my_il.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/10/amaranth_ganesh.jpg" alt="An amaranth plant shaped like an elephant"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, maybe it’s just me, but to me it looks like a plain old elephant. But then, I don’t worship Ganesh. Lots of people do, though, and so of course this means the guy is getting lots of visitors, and he thinks it has cured his illnesses. How miraculous that this pachydermic plant happened to grow in the garden of a believer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… or is it? Amaranths grow into all sorts of odd shapes. It didn’t take me long on Flickr to find &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vizpix/2856709508/"&gt;one like this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="left"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you worship Cthulhu, you’re in luck! Though, if you worship Cthulhu, you’re probably &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; in luck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I lived in Northern California, amaranths like this were everywhere, including right outside my building. They would constantly crack me up. Why? Because I suspect &lt;a href="http://figswithbri.com/?p=25"&gt;they were trying to tell me something&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as a final snark, let me add something: the name of this particular variety of amaranth? &lt;strong&gt;It’s called Elephant Head.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Lucky bastards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, this little setback affords me more time to play online, and allows me to pass on some good information to you all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the election coming up, it’s a good idea to remember that not just the big offices are being contested. There are many important state and local offices with open seats; and they are not always coveted by the most ideal candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in Texas, there are several positions on the Board of Education up for grabs, and some of the candidates vying for these seats could have a huge negative impact on science education should they be elected. You see, there is a large creationist contingent determined to remain a factor in guiding the educational standards in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, that’s Texas,” you say. “It doesn’t affect me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it can very well affect you. Large states like Texas and California obviously have the most students in the public school system, and textbook publishers tend to follow the standards established in those states to avoid the cost of printing different versions of textbooks to satisfy every state’s standard. So if a Board of Education in a state the size of Texas decides to teach the “weaknesses of evolution” in biology classes ,for example, the resulting textbooks will have to be adopted by other states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is evidence that altering science standards is exactly what the creationists running for Board of Education seats want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube skeptical crusader, AronRa, posted a video related to this. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTVpzwcpCCM"&gt;Take a look&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/XTVpzwcpCCM%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you are a Texas voter, use your vote wisely. Or if you’re not from Texas, but have friends and relatives there, be sure to get word to them about the importance of voting, if even for the state and local offices.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224958606810"><id gr:original-id="tag:typepad.com,2003:post-57542743">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c40cfb4f452698e4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution / Intelligent Design" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Science" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Creationism" scheme="http://sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><category term="Fruit Fly Research" scheme="http://sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><category term="Sarah Palin" scheme="http://sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><title type="html">Sarah Palin Proudly Ignorant</title><published>2008-10-25T17:33:20Z</published><updated>2008-12-11T10:05:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/10/sarah-palin-proudly-ignorant.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/10/sarah-palin-proudly-ignorant.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" xml:lang="en-US" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Sarah Palin gave a &lt;a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/Speeches/Read.aspx?guid=3d5fc0cf-8229-490f-879b-91f6f4bb9eb2"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; on the McCain/Palin plans for special needs children. And in it she demonstrated her ignorance more clearly that in anything she had said before. Which, considering the other things she has said, is quite an achievement. Get a load of this: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a matter of how we prioritize the money that we spend. […] And where does a lot of that earmark money end up? It goes to projects having little or nothing to do with the public good -- things like fruit fly research in Paris, France. I kid you not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Research into fruit flies. In France. &lt;strong&gt;France I tell you!&lt;/strong&gt; The horror. (The “I kid you not” was not part of the official transcript, but she said it. I kid you not.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palin&amp;#39;s proud ignorance shines through loud and clear. The actual research she was mocking was into the olive fruit fly – a major pest that threatens California’s olive farmers. (I guess she doesn&amp;#39;t care about Joe the farmer.  How elitist.) But fruit fly research is much more than this. The fruit fly is a standard organism that is used to study numerous genetic traits, precisely because it shares so many genetic similarities with humans. Including possibly genetic causes of some of the very “special needs” traits of children Palin was supposed to be supporting in her speech. Just a ten second Google of &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=fruit+fly+research&amp;amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS283US283"&gt;fruit fly research&lt;/a&gt; would reveal 1,390,000 articles explaining the many benefits of research using fruit flies. Avenues of research and benefits achieved already that are too numerous for me to list, although a &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/10/25/01849/495"&gt;molecular biologist writing in the Daily Kos&lt;/a&gt; yesterday managed to list quite a few. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, such research only makes sense if you accept that evolution happened - that humans and fruit flies have a common ancestor. Palin doesn’t believe this, because it conflicts with what she read in her bible, and so she sees no value to it. And right there you have, eloquently expressed, the reason that creationist nonsense should not be taught as science, and why creationist idiots (some redundancy there) like Palin should not get anywhere near having any real power.  And I kid you not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 27 - Edited to add:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/10/palin_autism_and_fruitflies_it.php"&gt;Bora&lt;/a&gt; has much more on this, including links to this response from UNC researchers: &lt;a href="http://unchealthcare.wordpress.com/2008/10/25/in-defense-of-fruit-flies-and-basic-medical-research/"&gt;In defense of fruit flies and basic medical research&lt;/a&gt;, as well as videos from some actual fruit fly research scientists, and these additional links:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2008/10/about_that_fruit_fly_research.php"&gt;Mike the Mad Biologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It is revealing to see who is supporting each side of the contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/24/BAV413NQG6.DTL&amp;amp;tsp=1"&gt;organizations trying to oppose Proposition 8&lt;/a&gt; include Apple Computer, Sergey Brin of Google, the California Teachers Association, and the state Democratic party — anyone supportive of civil rights, progressive causes, or (to be honest) finding a profit in not discriminating against well-educated people in a technological workforce for irrelevant reasons, like what they do in the privacy of their bedrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who is supporting it? Yahoos and churches. Once again, on a basic civil rights issue, religion comes out fighting for the wrong side. For a &lt;a href="http://saddlebackfamily.com/blogs/newsandviews/index.html?contentid=1502"&gt;great example of narrow-minded wretched biblical rationalizations&lt;/a&gt;, listen to Rick Warren of the Saddleback Church. He comes out strongly for Prop. 8, calling it a &amp;quot;moral issue&amp;quot; (which it is — too bad he&amp;#39;s fighting on the side of evil), and trying to argue &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; his sheep should vote for it…and the only reason he&amp;#39;s got is &amp;quot;because its always been this way&amp;quot;. Seriously — he repeats himself multiple times, and that&amp;#39;s the only reason he offers, again and again. Apparently, the &amp;quot;traditional, historical, universal&amp;quot; definition of marriage has &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; been "one man, one woman". I don't think he's been reading his bible very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Californians, whose side are you on? 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century America, or the imaginary repressed Puritan America of the theocrats?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/the_division_on_proposition_8.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/431828679" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224954269932"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=764">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/91e60f05dda8be00</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and politics"/><title type="html">Going rogue</title><published>2008-10-25T17:00:32Z</published><updated>2008-10-25T17:00:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=764" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;According to Ben Smith ("&lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14929.html"&gt;Palin allies report rising campaign tension&lt;/a&gt;", Politico, 10/25/2008):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Four Republicans close to Palin said she has decided increasingly to disregard the advice of the former Bush aides tasked to handle her, creating occasionally tense situations as she travels the country with them. Those Palin supporters, inside the campaign and out, said Palin blames her handlers for a botched rollout and a tarnished public image — even as others in McCain's camp blame the pick of the relatively inexperienced Alaska governor, and her public performance, for McCain's decline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"She's lost confidence in most of the people on the plane," said a senior Republican who speaks to Palin, referring to her campaign jet. He said Palin had begun to "go rogue" in some of her public pronouncements and decisions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"I think she'd like to go more rogue," he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t had the time or motivation to read all 637 comments on Smith&amp;#39;s post, but a quick scan suggests that no one has yet complained that &amp;quot;go rogue&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;go more rogue&amp;quot; are ungrammatical. I doubt that this is because prescriptivists don&amp;#39;t read Politico — perhaps they&amp;#39;re temporarily distracted by partisan enthusiasm. It&amp;#39;s certainly not likely that the would-be defenders of our linguistic civilization have accepted this construction, despite its use over the years by English writers and speakers of all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a prescriptivist intervention that led me to discuss a related set of examples several years ago ("&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001142.html"&gt;To pass into a certain condition, chiefly implying deterioration&lt;/a&gt;", 6/30/2004).  One of William Safire's readers,  Daniel Baldwin of New York, appealed for confirmation of his view that "the term 'goes missing' is grammatically incorrect". Mr. Safire sensibly disagreed, and I risked expulsion from the LSA by supporting and even praising his analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I observed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"go PREDICATIVE" often suggests that the predicative is a kind of deterioration: go bad, go ballistic, go bananas, go bankrupt, go blank, go cold, go crazy, go dead, go gray, go Hollywood, go lame, go mad, go native, go numb, go nuclear, go nuts, go sour, go vacant, go wrong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Sometimes the corresponding positively-evaluated condition doesn't work: go bad but ?go good (in the sense of "become good", not as an informal version of "go well"), go crazy but ?go sane. However, there are some positively evaluated conditions in common inchoative collocations with go: go live, go platinum, go blonde.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;On the other hand, there are also common adjectives expressing deterioration that don't seem to work well with go, preferring get instead: ?go sick, ?go fat, ?go dizzy, ?go sleepy, ?go antsy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Note also that the meaning of the predicate is often restricted: thus went dead is fine if you're talking about a phone line or a radio, but doesn't work to mean that an animate being died.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;All in all, the collocational propensities of go, in this construction, seem much more like derivational morphology than like normal compositional syntax.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in any case, Mr. Baldwin was all wet, in the curious manner of those prescriptivists who allow their rationalizations to overcome their common sense. The rationalization, in this case, seems to be that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;missing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; modifies &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and therefore must be an adverb. Since &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;missing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t have the form of an adverb — well, the obvious conclusion is that the analysis is wrong, and we should think again about the structure of this indubitably grammatical English phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a subtle difference between &amp;quot;go rogue&amp;quot; (and &amp;quot;go crazy/native/missing/etc.&amp;quot;) and a number of other &amp;quot;&amp;lt;motion-verb&amp;gt; &amp;lt;state-expression&amp;gt;&amp;quot; cases discussed in several posts last year (&amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004231.html"&gt;Amid this vague uncertainty, who walks safe?&lt;/a&gt;", 2/23/2007; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004315.html"&gt;A moment that never going to lost&lt;/a&gt;", 3/18/2007; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004725.html"&gt;The Grammar Vandal strikes in Boston&lt;/a&gt;", 7/16/2007). When you "go crazy", you've undergone a change of state. First you weren't crazy, then you were. But if a river "runs smooth", it needn't ever have run any other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a motion verb, and so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Do not &lt;strong&gt;go gentle&lt;/strong&gt; into that good night&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is no more suggestive of a change of state than&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The course of true love never did &lt;strong&gt;run smooth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, "go rogue" is not a new coinage. A search on &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?as_q=%22go+rogue%22"&gt;Google Books&lt;/a&gt; suggest that it's especially popular in science fiction and fantasy, most often applied to robots, cyborgs, or other intelligent machines such as spaceship AIs, but also to members of fantasy races such as spell-bound animal spirits, vampires, elves, and so on. Of the first 50 Google Books hits that I checked, more than half seem to be of this kind. Close in second place are cases of intelligence agents or "black ops" specialists who "go rogue" by pursuing a private agenda without the approval of their handlers. And of course there are a few elephants and other real-world animals. Oh, and a woman in a &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=4fYN8XGoPjwC"&gt;romance novel&lt;/a&gt; who escapes the bounds of politeness to make a scandalous scene (&amp;quot;Everyone she passed there stared […] as if they didn&amp;#39;t know when she&amp;#39;d go rogue on them again, and they certainly wouldn&amp;#39;t approve if she did, but they didn&amp;#39;t want to miss it if possible.&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s interesting  — but not surprising — that (some) political operatives think of their candidates in the way that others think of robots, animals, elves, and death-squad members: useful but dangerous creatures whose initiative needs to be carefully restrained by programming, training, or magical spells.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224953651917"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=763">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/71871c0d383d597f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and politics"/><category term="Linguistic history"/><title type="html">A brief history of hubristic drape-measuring</title><published>2008-10-25T16:52:37Z</published><updated>2008-10-25T16:52:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=763" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Thursday's &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/22/AR2008102203446.html"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Leiby digs into the background of a political cliche: "measuring (for) drapes." In his stump speech, John McCain says that "Senator Obama is measuring the drapes," meaning that he is already presumptuously planning how to decorate the White House. President Bush used the line about Congressional Democrats before the 2006 midterm elections, and Bush the elder applied it to Bill Clinton in the 1992 campaign. Leiby took the drape expression back to a 1980 reference in the New York Times on John Anderson ("Obviously, it's much too soon for Mr. Anderson to start measuring for drapes at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue"), but its roots actually go back for several decades before that, as befits such a sturdy cliche.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expression turns up with &lt;em&gt;drapes &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;curtains &lt;/em&gt;used interchangeably, which may offend interior decorators ("Drapes are pleated and are more formal, whereas curtains are informal and generally gathered," says &lt;a href="http://www.dressedwindows.com/drapes_curtains.htm"&gt;Well Dressed Windows&lt;/a&gt;), but the distinction matters not a stitch to most of us. Putting up new drapes (or curtains) in the White House has traditionally been seen as an appropriate task for a new First Lady, along with picking out china patterns and other domestic busywork. (Jacqueline Kennedy was perhaps the most famous White House decorator, and on Jan. 17, 1961 Helen Thomas of the UPI noted that Mrs. Kennedy "brushed aside questions about fashion but said she already has ordered fabric for curtains and slipcovers at the White House and the Kennedy weekend home at Middleburg, Va.").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An early example of a hubristic First Lady-in-waiting was Martha Taft, wife of Senator Robert Taft, the early favorite for the 1940 Republican presidential nomination. Martha spoke too soon in February 1940, since her husband didn't even manage to get the party nod, losing out to Wendell Wilkie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martha Taft is sure that "Bob is going to get it." She is ready to answer questions in regular stump style, though she refuses to say whether she will change the drawing-room drapes in the White House.&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=C8YLAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=nFQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=3560,3163003&amp;amp;dq=drapes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(St. Petersburg, Fla.) Evening Independent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Feb 19, 1940, p. 11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1968 presidential campaign, the full-blown drapery joke appeared at least twice. The first time came in April, shortly after Lyndon Johnson dropped out of the race, opening up the Democratic field to Robert Kennedy among others. Jack Wilson, in his syndicated "Potomac Fever" column, wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally Bobby wanted to talk to the President as soon as possible — he had to fix it so Ethel could get in to measure for curtains.&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;em&gt;Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal&lt;/em&gt;, Apr. 9, 1968, p. 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in late October, Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey used it to deride his opponent Richard Nixon at a rally in downtown Los Angeles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humphrey, almost hoarse from shouting, accused Nixon of "playing president."&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;Why he&amp;#39;s even been to Washington … to look at the White House … and measure for drapes,&amp;quot; Humphrey quipped.&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;em&gt;(Van Nuys, Calif.) Valley News&lt;/em&gt;, Oct. 25, 1968, p. 31A&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joke got transferred to state gubernatorial races too. In 1970, David F. Cargo had served two terms as governor of New Mexico and couldn't stand for reelection. That allowed him to joke about his eager potential successors in the state legislature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governor Cargo prefaced his message to the Legislature by inviting all of the legislators and their wives to a reception at the executive residence at 8 o'clock last night. He commented that this would give an opportunity for some of them to measure the curtains, an amusing reference to the number of gubernatorial hopefuls who have received public mention.&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;em&gt;The (Santa Fe) New Mexican&lt;/em&gt;, Jan. 21, 1970, p. 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drapery joke got a boost from the Watergate scandal, as speculation increased about Nixon's resignation, despite Vice President Ford's insistence that he had no interest in taking over the White House. In April 1974, Art Buchwald imagined this conversation between Gerald and Betty Ford:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are all those swatches on the floor?"&lt;br&gt;
"I was just looking at drapery material. You know the drapes in the Lincoln room are so ugly."&lt;br&gt;
"Why are you looking at drapery material for the Lincoln room, Betty?"&lt;br&gt;
"You have to order this stuff six months in advance. You can't just get them by calling up Macy's."&lt;br&gt;
"Betty, I don't think you should be ordering drapes for the White House, even if it takes six months to get them. If I've told you once I've told you a hundred times there is absolutely no way I will be President of the United States."&lt;br&gt;
"Then why do you keep standing in front of a mirror every night in a morning coat with your hand on a Bible repeating 'So help me God.'"&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Apr. 21, 1974, p. H1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then columnist Arthur Hoppe used the joke in reference to the Fords in August of that year, just before Nixon announced his resignation. Hoppe casts the Ford family in a sitcom, and has Betty say this to the kids:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, children, you know your Dad doesn't want to be President. And as I tell reporters several times a day, I've never given a thought to becoming First Lady. Which reminds me, those awful drapes in The Oval Office are really going to have to be replaced.&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
–The (Oil City, Penn.) Derrick&lt;/em&gt;, Aug. 9, 1974, p. 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joke was used in 1975 by Earl Dodge, vice-presidential candidate for the National Prohibition Party (who knew prohibitionists even still existed then?) to strike a note of humility:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My wife hasn't started to measure for drapes in Nelson Rockefeller's house." said Dodge. 43. of Lakewood, Colo. "I have no illusions or delusions."&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;em&gt;(Mansfield, Ohio) News Journal&lt;/em&gt;, June 28, 1975&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 1976 &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt; profile of Donald Rumsfeld, who had just been named Secretary of Defense by Ford, Henry Kissinger poked fun at the young man's ambitions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kissinger had quipped that he found it necessary to announce that he was signing on with Ford through '76 because "Something had to be done. Mrs. (Elliott) Richardson and Mrs. Laird were running in and out of my office measuring it for curtains, and Rumsfeld too was coming in to measure."&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt;, Jan. 4, 1976, p. I12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1978 the joke traveled north of the border, as used in a Canadian political cartoon described in this UPI report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau sits scowling in an armchair at home as Conservative Party leader Joe Clark — his wife Maureen busying herself in the background — leans over and says, &amp;quot;We have come to measure the curtains.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;em&gt;Hartford Courant&lt;/em&gt;, Dec. 22, 1978, p. C27&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Canada, the cliche spread to the U.K. and Australia as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Neil Kinnock] went on to mention … his own remarks made last year about it being time to measure the curtains at Number 10.&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, May 16, 1986&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put another way, if Mr. Bouchard loses, John Turner can start measuring the drapes at 24 Sussex Drive.&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;em&gt;The Globe and Mail&lt;/em&gt;, June 16, 1988&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A competent Opposition, led by a credible leader, would already be measuring the curtains in the ministerial offices.&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;em&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt;, Mar. 23, 1990&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the U.S. it popped up in various local races throughout the '80s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone looking for evidence that a 1986 Senate race is under way between Gov. Bob Graham and Sen. Paula Hawkins would have discovered plenty last week, but in Washington, D.C., not Florida. … The governor came up in midweek to discuss the state&amp;#39;s interest in federal immigration issues and, I suspect, to measure for curtains in the Senate office.&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;em&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/em&gt;, Feb. 3, 1985&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I can't tell you that I'm measuring the curtains for the governor's mansion," [Alabama state GOP executive director Marty] Connors said, "but what we are witnessing is the birth of the two-party system in Alabama."&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;, Aug. 8, 1986&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before [New York City mayoral candidate David] Dinkins starts measuring for curtains at Gracie Mansion, however, a few caveats are in order.&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Feb. 12, 1989&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Utah Governor Norm] Bangerter, [chief of staff H.E. "Bud"] Scruggs said, has warned the leader of the House "what he was going to do if he caught him measuring for drapes or carpet one more time."&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;em&gt;(Salt Lake City, Utah) Deseret News&lt;/em&gt;, Feb 14, 1989&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's surprising that anyone would dare utter the cliche seriously before an election, but it was used that way about the first President Bush:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Republicans like Gov. Michael Castle of Delaware exulted that "I think Bush can start measuring the curtains for the White House," the mood among Democrats was somber.&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEED9103EF936A25753C1A96E948260"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Oct. 15, 1988&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after the '88 election, Barbara Bush felt that it would be presumptuous to start thinking about White House drapery, as George Plimpton wrote at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barbara Bush feels that sizing up the Rose Garden now would be like measuring for drapes before the Reagans have moved out of the White House.&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;a href="http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1068134/8/index.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Dec. 26, 1988&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bushes then further cemented the cliche in American political parlance, as noted by Leiby. But by then this hoary chestnut had already traveled far and wide.&lt;/p&gt;

But what is the vision for the future that we atheists and skeptics have? What if atheism were predominant in America? What then? Would atheists want to marginalize and kill Christians? Would it return to the days of Lenin, Stalin and others in which there was mass killing? I think Christians are scared about this. I really do. Can we assauge their fears right here and now? What say you?&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would like for the whole world to embrace democratic capitalism, the kind we have in America, with a constitution like it, and with the separation of powers. I want a firm wall between church and state, and that means believers would have no fear of atheists since the state could not and should not enforce anti-religious beliefs either, even if we were a majority of atheists. There would be no religious nor non-religious litmus test for running for office, and no state supported religion or non-religion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Religious people would still be free to practice their religion as they see fit, although we will still have to step in like we do now when they refuse life saving medical treatment for their children. Religious people will be able to argue their cases in public and before the courts if their rights are being violated, much like it is now, since we grant minorities legal rights that the majority opposes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian does that assauge your fears?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The view of Latter Day Saints is that the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt; consists of a historical record beginning in Biblical times and continuing with the immigration circa 600 BCE of two groups, known as Lamanites and Nephites, from Israel to the New World. The Nephites fell into wickedness and were eventually exterminated by the Lamanites, who were the ancestors of Native Americans.  The last prophet of the Nephites, known as &lt;em&gt;Moroni&lt;/em&gt;, is said to have hidden this record, engraved on golden plates in “Reformed Egyptian”, on a hillside in upstate New York around 400 CE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 21, 1823 the angel Moroni revealed the location of the golden plates to Joseph Smith, a semi-literate farm boy who was to become the founder of the Mormon Church. On September 22, 1827 Smith was allowed to take possession of the golden plates, together with two stones in bowls known as the Urim and Thummim. Using these seer's stones, Joseph Smith received the English translation of the golden plates, which he dictated, line-by-line, to a scribe. The first edition of the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt; was published at Palmyra, New York in 1830 by “Joseph Smith, Junior, Author and Proprietor”, as he identified himself on the title page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authenticity of the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt; is a matter of dispute. Believers consider it to be an authentic divine text and an accurate historical account, a sequel to the New Testament. Just about everyone else considers it either to have been composed by Joseph Smith or to be a plagiarism by Smith of an earlier contemporary work, such as the Reverend Solomon Spalding's &lt;em&gt;The Manuscript Found&lt;/em&gt;, a parodic romance on the Old Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for doubting the authenticity of the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt;, including the peculiar circumstances of its origin, the fact that the golden plates of which it is allegedly a translation are not available for study, the fact that the "Reformed Egyptian" in which it was allegedly written is unknown to linguists, the fact that portions allegedly written prior to 600 BCE contain excerpts from the Sermon on the Mount, and the inconsistency of the prehistory of the Americas that it presents with the findings of archaeology, genetics, and historical linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authenticity of the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt; has also been challenged on linguistic grounds. Perry Benjamin Pierce adduced the evidence of the language of the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt; in a paper entitled “The Origin of the 'Book of Mormon'”, which appeared in the &lt;em&gt;American Anthropologist&lt;/em&gt; N.S. 1.4.675-694 in October of 1899.  Much of the article is devoted to a detailed account of the procedure followed by Smith, which is described in a number of writings by witnesses, reported by members of Smith's family and Mormon authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These accounts emphasize that Smith did not read or translate the text himself. Rather, he looked at the seer's stones, upon which the English translation appeared, and read the English translation aloud to his scribe.  Only when the scribe had correctly transcribed the line would it disappear from the seer's stones and a new line of translation appear. As a result, neither the translation that Smith read out nor what the scribe recorded could be in any way erroneous. Smith neither read nor translated the "Reformed Egyptian" text and therefore could not be the source of any error. Moreover, while the scribe may have misunderstood what Smith read out, or written it down incorrectly, any such errors would have been detected and corrected due to the fact that the translation that Smith saw would not move on to the next line until the scribe had written it down correctly. The original manuscript of the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt; is therefore claimed to be a perfect English rendering of the original “Reformed Egyptian” text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compositor of the first edition of the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt; testified that he did not edit or correct the text in any way. It was published exactly as in the manuscript, save for the fact that the printer added punctuation, which was absent from the manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pierce then turns to his main point, which is that the original edition contained thousands of errors of English usage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="color:black;background-color:#e0ddff;border:3px solid green;padding:7px;font-size:120%"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that the Urim and Thummim breastplate did not aid the grammarless translator, or his uninspired amanuensis, or even his village printer, is evident from such eccentric irregularities and bold departures from the "well of English undefiled" as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="font-size:90%;border:0px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;thou remembereth&lt;/em&gt;” (page 27); "and I have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; written &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; a small part of the things I saw" (page 35); "therefore they did not look unto the Lord as they &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; ought" (&lt;em&gt;ibid&lt;/em&gt;.);…"and this he &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;" (page 225); "and the words of Amulek which &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; declared unto the people" (page 245); "now the object of these lawyers &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; to get gain" (page 251);…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pause out of breath, with this result of a most cursory inspection of the inspired pages under examination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pierce points out that there are more than 700 instances in the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt; in which the relative pronoun &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; is used in reference to people in place of &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt;, e.g. “Our brethren &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; were slain”.  This is of course not acceptable in standard varieties of English, nor was it acceptable in the early 19th century. It was, however, normal usage in the seventeenth century, when the King James version of the Bible was composed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such evidence presents us with two choices. One is that the omnipotent and omniscient creator of the universe did not control the grammar of Early Modern English.  The other is that the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt; was written by a semi-literate farm boy acquainted with the King James Bible, whose grammar and style he unsuccessfully attempted to emulate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bill Poser</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224917443651"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-3391817541458204285">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d5d0aaac2e5ef5ef</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Jesus, The Dodo Bird and The Reality of Extinction</title><published>2008-10-25T04:30:00Z</published><updated>2008-10-25T04:47:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/431395693/jesus-and-dodo-bird-and-reality-of.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/3391817541458204285/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=3391817541458204285" title="2 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/10/jesus-and-dodo-bird-and-reality-of.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">Lets say all the facts as recorded in the Gospels were totally true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let say that all the ancient testimonials of the ancient pagan authors were correct and true as recorded about Jesus and what they recorded totally supported the Gospels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lets say we had a Jesus who was 100% New Testament reality who lived and functioned in the past reality. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lets say we had the original autograph texts of the Gospels themselves, no question about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lets say there was no doubt that Jesus did miracles. He, without a doubt, did raise the dead, heal the sick and cast out demons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let say there is totally no way anyone today could deny the reality of miracles a wonderworking Jesus did in the Gospels as recorded by both Christian and pagan authors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lets say that we possess Gospel texts which are totally in 100% agreement with each other without any mixture of error or contradiction and that all the events in the life of Jesus are such hard facts that no one in his right mind would even think of denying them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now lets asked: Just what happened to all the miracles (the works the Gospels calls the “Signs and Wonders”)? Just why did everything come to a sudden stop? Just why don’t we have a continuation of wonder workers or miracle working disciples known as Christians today rising the dead, healing the sick and working “Signs and Wonders” as given by the master Jesus himself to all who believe in the King of Heaven / God and as proof of the Gospel reality? In short, just why are not there Gospels miracles still happening today performed by ALL Christians?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fact is, even if we removed all the debate about the truthful historicity of the New Testament, we still fail to have Christians living and working “Signs and Wonders” among us today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fact is, the Dodo bird did exist. The Dodo bird did feed hungry sailors. The Dodo bird did factually live in history and no one could argue otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the Dodo bird is no more. Gone is its wonderful nourishing meat. Gone is this huge flightless bird that fascinated all who saw it. Far all the historical truthfulness of a past real live Dodo bird, it can now only live on in human imagination. That’s the price of extinction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So to even if one were to accepts all the above about Jesus in the New Testament as being totally true, he would remain an extinct creature of the past just like our Dodo bird. A factual and wonder working reality of the past, but a totally extinct wonderworker who is now gone forever. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where does a lot of that earmark money end up anyway? […] You&amp;#39;ve heard about some of these pet projects they really don&amp;#39;t make a whole lot of sense and sometimes these dollars go to projects that have little or nothing to do with the public good. Things like fruit fly research in Paris, France. I kid you not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am appalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idiot woman, this blind, shortsighted ignoramus, this pretentious clod, &lt;i&gt;mocks&lt;/i&gt; basic research and the international research community. You damn well better believe that there is research going on in animal models — what does she expect, that scientists should mutagenize human mothers and chop up baby brains for this work? — and countries like France and Germany and England and Canada and China and India and others are all respected participants in these efforts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, scientists work on fruit flies. Some of the most powerful tools in genetics and molecular biology are available in fruit flies, and these are animals that are particularly amenable to experimentation. Molecular genetics has revealed that humans &lt;i&gt;share&lt;/i&gt; key molecules, the basic developmental toolkit, with all other animals, thanks to our shared evolutionary heritage (something else the wackaloon from Wasilla denies), and that we can use these other organisms to probe the fundamental mechanisms that underlie core processes in the formation of the nervous system — precisely the phenomena Palin claims  are so important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the Republican party has ended up: supporting an ignorant buffoon who believes in the End Times and speaking in tongues while deriding some of the best and most successful strategies for scientific research. In this next election, we've got to choose between the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century rationalism and Dark Age inanity. It ought to be an easy choice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/sarah_palin_ignorant_and_antis.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/431317572" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224901415510"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=760">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cf6f0fec56ccbca0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Lost in Translation"/><title type="html">A not so ambiguous sign</title><published>2008-10-25T02:14:13Z</published><updated>2008-10-25T02:14:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=760" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;James Fallows has &lt;a href="http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/two_beijing_pics_1.php"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; this subway ad, at the Dongsishitiao station of Beijing's Line 2, on the Atlantic website and raises a lot of interesting questions about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Fallows comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="background-color:#ffd0d0;border:2px solid #666;padding:10px"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English speakers could, I think, read these English words in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="border:0px"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) More freedom, /and also/ more happiness (no causal relationship, "bigger and better"); or&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
2) /The/ greater the freedom, /the/ greater the happiness (cause-effect, "the more, the merrier").
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve gotten different views from my native Chinese-speaking friends about the connotations of the Chinese version:更多自由,更多欢乐. Some say that it could be read both ways, like English; others, that it mainly means #1. So there are various possibilities here, all interesting: that this is a slyly subversive message in both languages; that it is an unintentional transmission of a subversive message though inexact translation; or that it is a fully intentional and brilliantly conceived transmission in English only, letting foreign-language readers conclude that an increase-freedom campaign is underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say, but I'm tantalized by the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it has to do in either language with panda-themed tourism is a different question.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reply, I may note several things about the wording of the ad and the picture beneath it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
GENG4DUO1 ZI4YOU2, GENG4DUO1 HUAN1LE4.  This kind of construction in Chinese is not really ambiguous.  Syntactically it normally indicates, "The more freedom (you have), the more happiness (you will have)," i.e., "the happier you will be."  It would not make sense to reverse the order of the clauses: *GENG4DUO1 HUAN1LE4, GENG4DUO1 ZI4YOU2, because being happier does not necessarily and logically lead to having greater freedom.  In other words, through the wording at the top of the ad, the statement is being made that greater freedom leads to greater happiness.  In the context of contemporary China, this is a rather subversive assertion, and not very subtle at that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my estimation, the English translation is — whether intentionally or not — suitably ambiguous in an ad-speak kind of way.  It is concise and snappy, and offers various possible interpretations, including the one intended by the Chinese version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Why the panda?  There are several reasons.  The first is that pandas are cute and lovable (KE3AI4 可爱), so the adorable creature serves to soften, if not defuse entirely, the subversive verbal claim hovering above its head.  Secondly, having just finished a book on the world history of tea, I immediately noticed that the panda is holding a cup of tea in his left hand (paw).  That is appropriate, since Sichuan is one of the earliest and most developed areas in China for tea cultivation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that this is an advertisement for panda tourism in Sichuan.  The tie-in with &amp;quot;freedom&amp;quot; is that pandas supposedly roam freely in their (protected) reserves, and that you — the prospective tourist — can get a taste of freedom by travelling (a kind of roaming) to Sichuan and observing the pandas in their natural habitat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, the joys of reading between the lines and the images in China!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thank Bill Poser for calling this ad to my attention. Bill in turn thanks his cousin David Strip for the pointer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224888083563"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/well_yeahso_who_does_gw_bush_e.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bd9bb97de29ffd3d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Well, yeah…so who does GW Bush endorse, anyway?</title><published>2008-10-24T23:03:14Z</published><updated>2008-10-24T23:03:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/431145061/well_yeahso_who_does_gw_bush_e.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/well_yeahso_who_does_gw_bush_e.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

He's that blight on North Carolina's medical establishment, known for his "transdermal chelation therapy" that he's unable to demonstrate as being able to be absorbed through the skin, much less chelate anything (arguably a good thing, actually, because at least it probably doesn't hurt anyone, as a real transdermal chelation agent might). He's also known for some rather more--shall we say?--&lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=364"&gt;colorful "treatments" for autism&lt;/a&gt; (colorful as in "yellow"), not to mention &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/12/dr_buttar_has_a_new_protocol.php"&gt;IV ozone&lt;/a&gt;. He's also in trouble with the North Carolina Medical Board for using &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/12/dr_rashid_buttar_the_medical_board_is_a.php"&gt;equally dubious therapies&lt;/a&gt; for cancer patients, all the while promising he could cure them. Unfortunately, the only thing he could cure them of is having excess cash in their wallets, as he charged exorbitant fees for his "services." He also charmingly likened the North Carolina Medical Board to a "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/12/dr_rashid_buttar_the_medical_board_is_a.php"&gt;rabid dog&lt;/a&gt;," what I would call a rather unwise thing to do, given that that board would decide his fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Dr. Buttar had his practice restricted to exclude children (to keep him from treating autism) and cancer patients.  Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to have stopped him. Indeed, he's out there still, and he wants to hear from you. In fact, he wants to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drbuttar.com/askdrbuttar.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;If you had 30 seconds to ask me one question about Autism or Heavy Metal Toxicity, what would your single most important question be?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Warning: There's a video that autoplays there; so you might want to turn the sound off if you're in an environment where it might disturb others or embarrass you.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure that you, my readers, can come up with some fantastic questions for Dr. Buttar to answer. In fact, so confident am I in your ability to ask really great, brief questions, that I'd love to see you send them to Dr. Buttar using the link above. Also, if it's not too much trouble, share them with me and my readers below in the comments, so that we can appreciate your incisiveness and discuss the questions.&lt;/p&gt;

Those that collect the data provide it to those that store it and maintain it, and to those that use it.  There are different values associated with IDQ dimensions depending on which categorical context it falls into(16).  For example, the data custodian considers accuracy as the number one value while the consumer (depending on the context) may not consider accuracy the most important dimension.  In all cases the most important criteria for the user is whether or not it is useful.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that the consumer does not necessarily regard accuracy as the highest value creates a  market for less accurate information which enterprising data producers are willing to satisfy.  One example is the "tabloid" and "gossip magazine" industry.  However, the desire for useful though inaccurate information extends across categories into business, marketing, politics and religion.  Unfortunately, to ensure accurate data when needed, some extra work is necessary in the form of cross-checking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;Who is the author?&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like everything in life, cross-checking should be able to be used to verify a piece of information to see if it makes sense from another perspective.  One way to do that is by being able to identify the author.  When the author can be identified their credentials can be reviewed.  Whether or not the author is an expert can be assessed, what their peers thought of them and what environment they lived in.  These properties can be used to cross-check to see if the information has external consistency and makes sense from other perspectives. These properties allow the use of inference to assess the credibility, plausibility, believability and most importantly the accuracy of the information.  There is no precise definition of accuracy, and in fact many of the dimensions of IDQ are self-referential, but it is the case that what accuracy is NOT is apparent and using that as a criteria, a working definition can be derived. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;Accuracy implies that the datum represents a real world state.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It implies that when the data are reviewed, and compared to the real world event or object it describes the real world event sufficiently for more than one person to have as close to the same understanding of it as possible.  An accurate representation of a real world event will not be ambiguous, will not lack precision and will not be incomplete because this will lead to inferences about the real world that do not or never existed or that represent an incorrect element in the real world(3).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accurate and verifiable data are crucial to having enough understanding about the subject to be able to make reliable decisions, inferences and predictions in order to increase the likelihood of successful outcomes.  Verifiability increases the credibility of information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;Your spouse, parents and reputable organizations endorse accurate reporting.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost everyone that has an interest in making some kind of an investment whether its monetary from a giant corporation or emotional from a trusting spouse desires, requires and demands IDQ.  Human understanding and knowledge depend on it.  Technology is successful because it builds on the accurate reporting and successful reproduction of work that came before it.  Relationships are successful because Information Quality (also known as truth) fosters trust.  Since Information Quality is so fundamental, it is easy to find reputable organizations that endorse it and not just your mother, father, spouse or friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reputable organizations such as Cornell University(17), East Tennesee State University(19) and George Mason University(20) and McGraw Hill(21) and the U.S. Government(18) have websites set up which are devoted to promoting criteria for assesing the quality of information from sources.  They place a high value on it and stress the importance of it.  Two other websites related to education are "The Virtual Chase"(22) which is devoted to "teaching legal professionals how to do research", and Robert Harris's VirtualSalt(15) which is heavily referenced throughout the Internet.  VirtalSalt has a checklist called "CARS" which was derived from the first letter of its major criteria, Credibility, Accuracy, Reasonableness and Support.  The CARS Checklist encapsulates the research criteria that are endorsed by reputable organizations in an easy to remember mnemonic and can be found &lt;a href="http://www.virtualsalt.com/evalu8it.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;Criteria for Data and Information Quality in research&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Listed below are the components of the CARS checklist.  The initials of some of the other organizations listed above are used to show where their criteria fit into it.

What sources did the author use?&lt;br&gt;- What support is given?&lt;br&gt;- Can this be cross-checked with at least two other independent sources?&lt;br&gt;- Is the information in the other independent sources consistent with this information?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;What are some real world examples of poor Data and Information Quality research?&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conclusions about History are necessarily defeasible.  One of the problems is that methodology and techniques improve a little every century.  Conclusions made about a certain topic are revised as new information turns up.  New information is used to compare to the old information for coherency and consitency.  Some of these problems stem from poor data creation by the originator.  Data are not accurate or complete.  Users still struggle with these problems today.  "A Website Dedicated to Information/Data Quality Disasters from Around the World" has been set up by the International Association for Information and Data Quality (IAIDQ) and its called &lt;a href="http://iqtrainwrecks.com/"&gt;IQ Trainwrecks&lt;/a&gt;(14 ).   "Poor data quality can have a severe impact on the overall effectiveness of an organization"(3) and  "Poor data quality can have substantial social and economic impacts"(11) that span the spectrum from news to marketing to text books to health care.  Fortunately we can examine the methods of the ancient historians and scientists to see what led to poor results so that we can avoid those methods, improve what can be improved and derive new ones to replace the old.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;Applying Data and Information Quality for research to the Bible.   &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As accurate as they tried to be, the authors of scripture still suffered from the same sorts of problems common with ancient historians and scientists.  They were biased, inaccurate, had no way to verify information, depended on second or third hand information from relatively uneducated people, were influenced by political affiliations and commissions from aristocrats and state leaders and had poor tools to work with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Authors of the bible do not do any better job than their historian and scientific peers in documenting the world.  In fact, of the three categories, scientists fared somewhat better because of their quality of documentation. The Library in Alexandria was destroyed by fire over time, so much of ancient scholarship and science was lost but some of the works that do remain leave little doubt about how to reproduce their experiments or their authorship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It used to be believed that every author of every book in the bible could be identified but over time, it has come to be recognized that tradition is a poor way to record who authored what.  External verification of the data revealed how unlikely it was that the person traditionally believed to be the author actually was or even existed. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;According to several sources "The Bible comprises 24 books for Jews, 66 for Protestants, 73 for Catholics, and 78 for most Orthodox Christians." (24) From others: "The Protetant Bible contains 66 books (39 OT, 27 NT); the Catholic Bible contains 73 books (46 OT, 27 NT); the Eastern Orthodox Bible contains 78 books (51 OT, 27 NT). The Hebrew Bible (the name of the OT by Jews) contains only 24 books.(23)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;Most of the authors of the original information about the Abrahamic God are unknown&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are different books in the bible depending on if you use the Hebrew, the protestant, the catholic or the orthodox (for example) If we use the greatest number of books in any bible as our total, then there are only about 21% of them where the author can be identified. 79% percent of them are unknown(24). 79% percent of the original information that exists about the abrahamic god comes from unknown sources. One of the indicators for lack of credibility in a work is anonymity(15).  A small percentage of scripture are not considered worthy of inclusion between denominations. What makes one worthy to one group and not worthy to another?  Lack of credibility is one criteria that comes to mind.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The bible is an amalgum of scriptures that span years.  Some of the scriptures seem to be derived from other scriptures most of which were also included in the Bible. Trying to use the criteria for varied sources for cross-checking with the Bible is difficult because they were derived from each other, a large portion of the authors are unknown and the quality of production was poor.   The criteria used to put them together is not clear but a presumption at a minimum of a need for coherency and consistency is warranted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The word "trust" is used liberally to describe IDQ criteria. While the bible is generally considered to be trustworthy, is it really?  What is it about something that make it "trustworthy"?  Accuracy? Coherency and consistency with what we know from our experience?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;What follows is a summary of principled research criteria standards which the Bible does not meet with some generic examples.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For the sake of brevity I did not include many solid examples but I do welcome audience participation by documenting them in the comments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Authorship - Traditional authorship have been overturned by later scholarship&lt;br&gt;* Not up to date - Leviticus and Deuteronomy in the OT, Pauls bias against women in the NT&lt;br&gt;* Inaccurate, incorrect - The rivers of Eden in the OT, Inconsistencies between the gospels &lt;br&gt;* Irrelevant - Leviticus and Deuteronomy in the OT, ambiguous NT fallacy apparently contradictory anyway "Whoever is not against us is for us — Mark 9:40" vs "He who is not with me is against me — Matthew 12:30a"&lt;br&gt;* Bias - Old testament treatment of worshipers of other gods, NT treatment of Jewish leadership and scholars.&lt;br&gt;* Unlikely -  Most of the OT and in NT Jesus sternly rebuked his disciples for sleeping in the garden of gesthemane so who witnessed it? &lt;br&gt;* Conflicts with knowledge obtained from our experiences - Magicians do water to wine tricks.&lt;br&gt;* Contradicts itself - Who discovered the empty tomb? &lt;br&gt;* Cross-checking with external sources is extremely difficult and does not support to a large degree.  There is no verifiable eyewitness account of the existence of Jesus, however that does not mean he did not exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Robert Harris's VirtualSalt has a checklist with a mnemonic for how to deal with information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;Living with Information: The CAFÉ Advice from VirtualSalt&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;(15)&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Challenge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Challenge information the information with critical questions and expect accountability. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adapt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adapt your requirements for information quality to match the importance of the information and what is being claimed. Extraordinary claims warrant extraordinary evidence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;File&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;File new information in your mind rather than immediately reaching a conclusion.  Turn your conclusion into a question.  Gather more information until there is little room for doubt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evaluate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evaluate and re-evaluate regularly. New information or changing circumstances will affect the accuracy and the evaluation of previous information. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will sum it up in a word.&lt;br&gt;Cross-check, Cross-check, Cross-check.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;REFERENCES AND FURTHER READING&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management"&gt;Wikipedia, "Data Management"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://mitiq.mit.edu/"&gt;Information Quality at MIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/web.mit.edu/tdqm/www/tdqmpub/WandWangCACMNov96.pdf"&gt;Anchoring Data Quality Dimensions in Ontological Foundations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://www.dmreview.com/"&gt;DMReview, Data Management Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. &lt;a href="http://mitiq.mit.edu/MITIQ/IQ1.htm"&gt; IQ-1 Certificate Program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq"&gt;Wikipedia, 2003 Invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;7. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/09/how-accurate-is-bible.html"&gt;How Accurate Is The Bible?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;8. &lt;a href="http://www.datalever.com/"&gt;Datalever.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;9. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh#Chapters_and_verse_numbers.2C_book_divisions"&gt;Wikipedia, Tanakh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;10. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis"&gt;Null Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;11. &lt;a href="http://w3.cyu.edu.tw/ccwei/PAPER/ERP/data%20quality(JMIS).pdf"&gt;Beyond Accuracy: What Data Quality Means To Consumers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;12. &lt;a href="http://mitiq.mit.edu/Documents/Publications/TDQMpub/2002/IQ%20Benchmarks.pdf"&gt;IQ Benchmarks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;13. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/08/reasonable-doubt-about-adaption-theory.html"&gt;Reasonable Doubt About Adaption Theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;14. &lt;a href="http://iqtrainwrecks.com/"&gt;IQ Trainwrecks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;15. &lt;a href="http://www.virtualsalt.com/evalu8it.htm"&gt;Robert Harris' VirtualSalt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;16. &lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/tdqm/www/tdqmpub/PipinoLeeWangCACMApr02.pdf"&gt;Data Quality Assessment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;17. &lt;a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/olinuris/ref/research/skill26.htm"&gt;Cornell University Library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;18. &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/final_information_quality_guidelines.html"&gt;Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility and Integrity of Information Disseminated by Federal Agnecies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;19. &lt;a href="http://www.etsu.edu/cas/history/ToolBox.htm"&gt;East Tennesee State University Researchers Toolbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;20. &lt;a href="http://historymatters.gmu.edu/browse/refdesk/#evaluating"&gt;George Mason Univeristy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;21. &lt;a href="http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/007288021x/student_view0/evaluating_internet_resources.html"&gt;McGraw-Hill Higher Education, Evaluating Internet Resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;22. &lt;a href="http://www.virtualchase.com/quality/criteria_print.html"&gt;The Virtual Chase, Criteria for Quality in Information--Checklist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;23. &lt;a href="http://www.juliantrubin.com/biblefacts.html#17"&gt;Know Your Bible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;24. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors_of_the_Bible"&gt;Wikipedia, Authors of The Bible &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;25.

What do we hope to accomplish by advocating atheism? Do we want to get rid of religion entirely? Would the world be a better place without it? Here is my off the cuff answer...&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A philosopher with a Ph.D. emailed me this question:&lt;blockquote&gt;What is the goal and purpose of these atheists? What purpose do they want to accomplish? What kind of existential purpose are atheists offering people who would replace their purpose-filled faith with atheism? I'm curious what you think. I'm not being impish.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Where do I start? ;-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're tired of being maligned and considered to be less trustworthy than prostitutes and child molesters, for start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're tired of scientific ignorance, and the destruction and killing in the name of God, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are plenty of negative reasons for asserting ourselves and our arguments, and that alone is justification for our arguments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But we also have a positive goal. We believe we're right. Being correct is a worthy goal, even if we think that delusional beliefs lead to terrible puplic policies and agendas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our vision for the future? It would depend on the particular skeptic I suppose. I mainly think about MY particular future. So I want less antagonism toward me as an atheist. Since I don't believe religion will ever pass from the scene, given what Paul Kurtz calls &lt;em&gt;The Transcendental Temptation&lt;/em&gt;, if all we can do is to lessen the effects of religious beliefs then that's a worthy goal, probably the only goal possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is religion beneficial? It is beneficial for delusional people in the same way that a prozac drug is beneficial for depressed people. As long as there are depressed people we'll need prozac, a new kind of "opium for the masses." But a healthier person doesn't need prozac or religion. I want to make people healthier, you see. When that time comes, if it does at all, we won't need religion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It&amp;#39;s a dark time for the religious right (although they should just hang on—things apparently get better for them by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Temples_of_Syrinx"&gt;2112&lt;/a&gt;), and the story tells about all the horrible things that come to pass under Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a weird read. &lt;i&gt;Everything&lt;/i&gt; is about the gays — forget changes in the economy, or foreign affairs, or alternative energy, or labor, or anything that might actually affect most people. The whole story is about the gay conspiracy taking control and locking up the guns while spreading pornography throughout the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s absurdly unrealistic, and it isn&amp;#39;t even interesting science fiction. But then I realized…it isn&amp;#39;t a work of SF at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a world-building prelude to a work of &lt;i&gt;slash&lt;/i&gt; fiction. Future chapters, I'm sure, will include lurid stories of handsome young Christian men being compelled by scantily clothed muscular gay men to watch explicit pornography, followed by more chapters detailing their forcible deflowering by hunky followers of the Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that context, it makes a lot more sense. Those fellows at Focus on the Patriarchy really do have a lot of repressed issues, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

We are in the midst of a national miasma in which the federal government and Wall Street in particular are considered practically vile. 
I am sure this will change - either when these institutions improve themselves or when the public moves on to another target.
It is easy to assail institutions because they are so [...]

Hope you’re  having a fun Friday!  I must apologize for my blog silence the past few weeks - work has been really crazy for me, and I’ve been travelling and running around like a headless chicken.  When that happens, my body will periodically force me to stop by giving me a cold.  This happened this week and I had to take a couple of days off to rest and recuperate.  Of course, with a regular old cold, there really isn’t much you can do but rest and drink lots of fluids.  So, in the spirit of cold season, today’s question is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your handy ‘cure’ for the common cold?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Masala Skeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224875033320"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/10/how_not_to_do_message_integrit.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dffd19dd110a1adc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Encryption"/><title type="html">How Not to Do Message Integrity, featuring CBC-MAC</title><published>2008-10-24T19:21:52Z</published><updated>2008-10-24T19:21:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~3/430999192/how_not_to_do_message_integrit.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/10/how_not_to_do_message_integrit.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; In my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/10/cryptographic_integrity_using.php"&gt;last cryptography post&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote about using message authentication codes
(MACs) as a way of guaranteeing message integrity. To review briefly, most ciphers
are designed to provide message confidentiality - which means that no one but the
sender and the intended receiver can see the plain-text of the message. But
ciphers that provide confidentiality don't necessarily make any guarantees that
the message received is exactly the message that was sent. There are a good number
of cryptographic attacks that work by altering the message in transit, and 
depending on the cipher, that can result in a variety of undesirable
results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; For example, if you use DES encryption with the ECB mode of operation,
you can insert new blocks anywhere in a message that you want.  By using
a replay attack (where you take encrypted blocks from other messages using
the same encryption, and resend them), an attacker can alter your messages, and
you won't be able to detect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; So in addition to just confidentiality, we need to provide integrity. What does integrity really  mean? Basically, it expands the definition of the
decryption function. Written as a function signature, confidential message
decryption is a function &lt;code&gt;decrypt : ciphertext × key → plaintext&lt;/code&gt;. With message integrity, we add the
option that decrypt can return a result saying that the message is invalid: &lt;code&gt;decrypt&lt;sub&gt;integ&lt;/sub&gt; : ciphertext × key → (plaintext | REJECT)&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

This somewhat tardy edition of the Carnival of the Liberals happens to be the last one before election day, which makes it important to bring up the issues we ought to be considering as we make our decisions about who we&amp;#39;re going to vote for…although, if you&amp;#39;re liberal, this is a year when the decision is remarkably easy to make. So here we go with an issues-oriented carnival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foreign policy:&lt;/b&gt; What do you think of the Bush Doctrine, the idea that we should unilaterally and preemptively attack anyone we think might be a threat? Here's a better plan: &lt;a href="http://lfab-uvm.blogspot.com/2008/10/be-good-guys.html"&gt;Let's be the good guys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Health care:&lt;/b&gt; Compare and contrast &lt;a href="http://www.uspharmd.com/blog/2008/obama-vs-mccain-on-healthcare-top-10-issues/"&gt;Obama vs McCain on Healthcare&lt;/a&gt;.  There are important differences in how they would improve the management of the country's health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abortion:&lt;/b&gt; To a liberal, abortion is also a health care issue — we care about the health and autonomy of &lt;i&gt;women&lt;/i&gt;, something Republican candidates don't seem to comprehend. Consider &lt;a href="http://www.acandidworld.net/2008/10/17/summary-judgment-mccains-legal-errors-at-the-debate-and-why-they-matter-part-1/"&gt;McCain's Legal Errors at the Debate, and Why They Matter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Poverty:&lt;/b&gt; It's a related issue. How do women break out of the entrapment of pregnancy? It's a question of &lt;a href="http://www.sex-kitten.net/articles/2454755153618/Blog_Action_Day%3A_Poverty_%26_Choice.html"&gt;Poverty &amp;amp; Choice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Homosexuality:&lt;/b&gt; Conservatives want to strip a significant minority of their rights, and in every election cycle someone gets the bright idea of rousing the right-wing vote by throwing anti-gay legislation on the ballot. This year, California has Proposition 8, a proposed law that would once again make whipping boys of the homosexuals. Read a &lt;a href="http://www.bay-of-fundie.com/archives/518/brief-analysis-of-the-yes-on-8-side"&gt;Brief Analysis of the Yes on 8 Side&lt;/a&gt; — they&amp;#39;re really bringing on the sleaze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Race:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Every&lt;/i&gt; American election is about race, deep down. When Republicans rail against crime, or welfare, or immigration, it's all about suppressing minorities further. Greg Laden's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2008/10/the_science_museum_of_minnesot.php"&gt;Review of the Science Museum of Minnesota's Exhibit on Race and Racism&lt;/a&gt; has a lot to say about the cultural effects of racial differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The economy:&lt;/b&gt; With the economy in its current state of crisis, with lending companies receiving massive bailouts, you might be wondering &lt;a href="http://www.kirbyonfinance.com/2008/10/16/are-you-stupid-for-paying-your-mortgage/"&gt;Are you stupid for paying your mortgage?&lt;/a&gt; After all, if Wall Street can be forgiven for errors and mismanagement, why can't you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Religion:&lt;/b&gt; I&amp;#39;m often told that religion is an institution that provides support for the underprivileged — it is a private, charitable source for public assistance. How can that be if, in their ignorance and dogmatic biases, &lt;a href="http://www.cultofgracie.com/2008/10/and-religion-taketh.html"&gt;the faithful dismiss important issues in health&lt;/a&gt;? There's nothing like the fallacious belief that mental illness is the work of devils to deprive people of good medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Patriotism:&lt;/b&gt; To a liberal, patriotism is not an unquestioning faith in the perfection of one's country, but a recognition that a country can always be bettered and its flaws corrected. We have a perfectly horrid example of illiberal, unthinking jingoism right here in my home state, with &lt;a href="http://kudzumaster.wordpress.com/2008/10/18/michele-bachmann-and-her-un-american-paranoia/"&gt;Michele Bachmann and her Anti-American Paranoia&lt;/a&gt;. Let's hope we can get her out of office soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, none of our candidates are perfect; there's a lot I personally dislike about Barack Obama, for instance. What we have to do on 4 November, though, is balance our concerns about the issues in the election, and perhaps follow a &lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2008/10/the-harm-reduction-model-of-politics.html"&gt;harm reduction model of politics&lt;/a&gt; — let&amp;#39;s try to get a candidate in office who at least moves the government in a better direction. I think we all know what that means, and the choice is clear: despite his flaws, we need to put Barack Obama in office. Let&amp;#39;s make the country better. Not perfect, but better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next edition of the Carnival of the Liberals will be at &lt;a href="http://layscience.net"&gt;The Lay Scientist&lt;/a&gt; on November 5th. Hey, that's the day &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the big election — that&amp;#39;s going to be an interesting one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A curator of the Israeli Museum called this event &amp;quot;a miracle&amp;quot;. It’s hard to know if he was being literal or not, but Moriel does an excellent job showing exactly how this is no miracle, and in fact might even be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll note the diary landed in mud, making the pages very difficult to examine and read. That’s not terribly miraculous. And, of course, if it’s a miracle that the diary made it, what does that say about the deaths of seven astronauts and the destruction of their billion-dollar machine? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a title="McCain Volunteer Says She Was Mugged, Had &amp;#39;B&amp;#39; Cut in Her Face - FOXNews.com Elections " href="http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/10/23/mccain-volunteer-says-mugged-b-carved-face/"&gt;top news story on Fox right now&lt;/a&gt;: a McCain volunteer says she was robbed at an ATM, by a black man of course, and then when the thief saw her McCain bumper sticker, he beat her up and carved a &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;Barack&amp;quot; in her face. It&amp;#39;s getting a bit…shrill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could have happened, but there are just a few odd details here. She claims the assailant used a knife — a very dull knife — to cut her cheek, but all there are are faint scratches, not real cuts.

Intrigued, I purchased it immediately and have been reading it the law few nights.  The author, Paulina Borsook, wrote for Wired and yet was shocked by some of the socioretardation in the Silicon Valley tech community.  She published this book in 2000; it's a significant expansion of her 1996 Mother Jones &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/1996/07/borsook.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on the same topic, which concludes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...Just as 19th-century timber and cattle and mining robber barons made their fortunes from public resources, so are technolibertarians creaming the profits from public resources -- from the orderly society that has resulted from the wise use of regulation and public spending. And they have neither the wisdom nor the manners nor the mindset to give anything that's not electronic back.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her point is the technolibertarians are some of the biggest benefactors of government largess (Arpanet, aerospace/defense spending, UC Berkeley, etc), they are a generation that was never really mistreated by the government (no draft, major wars, etc), and yet they are bizarrely anti-government.  Switching back to the book, she describes this philosophy as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the most virulent form of philosophical technolibertarianism is a kind of scary, psychologically brittle, prepolitical autism.  It bespeaks a lack of human connection and a discomfort with the core of what many of us consider it means to be human...As many political schools of thought do, these technolibertarians make a philosophy out of a personality defect.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ouch!  And right on!  MarkH and I encountered many such things at a party several years ago in DC.  MarkH, being MarkH, spent the night engaging with these creeps, to find the core of their objection to humanity.  I just wanted to take a shower.  I've had enough.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in the technolibertarian form of denialism, pick up Borsook's book.  Sciblings would probably be most interested in her description of the social darwinist attitudes among the technolibertarians (these people would be the first to die under rugged individualism), and their pseudosciency belief in the market functioning as a biological system (something called Bionomics, the 1990s, Silicon Valley version of The Secret).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/on_the_nature_of_the_cyberself.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/430760873" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224856467373"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3751">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bce78d17afdadd3d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Quickies"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 10.24</title><published>2008-10-24T13:21:58Z</published><updated>2008-10-24T13:21:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3751" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

I’m talking about the other end of the spectrum dealing with whether an object is a very large planet or a really small star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone heard of the European CoRoT space telescope? I hadn’t.&lt;br&gt;
CoRoT stands for COnvection, ROtation and planetary Transits. I think they should have brainstormed a better acronym, maybe CRaP-T or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission of this telescope is to search for exoplanets and to study the insides of stars or stellar seismology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “planetary transit” part of its name means that it can detect planets by the dip in brightness of a star when one of its planets moves between us and the star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogimages/transit.gif" alt="" width="429" height="257"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this technique, the probe found something extraordinary. An object the same size as Jupiter, but more than 20 times its mass (twice as dense as lead) with an orbit lasting only a little more than 4 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been given the following catchy name: COROT-exo-3b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is…..is it a planet or a star? You might think this would be a fairly straightforward decision and most of the time it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This objects sits in a gulf between the biggest planet previously found….about 12 Jupiter masses…and the smallest star ever found which has about 70 Jupiter masses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Suzanne Aigrain of the University of Exeter, said&lt;br&gt;
“There is no clear consensus among scientists where to draw the exact boundary between planets and brown dwarfs. No object has been found before which is so close to this boundary, yet orbits its host star so rapidly. Many astronomers had started to think that such objects did not exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another cool aspect of this story is how much of a worldwide effort it was to vett this thing.&lt;br&gt;
Institutes all over the planet helped fill in the gaps in our knowledge. For example: The Thuringia State Observatory in Tautenburg Germany determined the object’s mass and orbit, Israel’s Wise Observatory and the telescope of the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands were used to make sure other stars weren’t contaminating the data. The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever decision is made whether this is a planet or star it’s win-win for scientists. Either we have a new class of behemoth planets to study or a new type of teeny-tiny star to ponder.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bob Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224854337366"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=403">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/303f67a60ecb3f5e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Reports of the Demise of Materialism Are Premature - Part II</title><published>2008-10-24T13:00:16Z</published><updated>2008-10-24T13:00:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=403" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=402"&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the Wedge strategy of the intelligent design (ID) movement - namely to undermine and replace the materialist basis of modern science with something that conforms to their ideological spiritual beliefs. This anti-materialist agenda has been primarily targeted against evolution, but now seems to be shifting its attention to neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Unholy Alliance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wedge strategy of the Discovery Institute (DI) and other ID proponents is largely a Christian movement. It is interesting that they have found common ground with others who have a very different ideology but share in common a distaste for strict materialism because it is inconvenient to their spiritual agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the New Scientist article discussing this topic quotes Jeffrey Schwartz as saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“YOU cannot overestimate how threatened the scientific establishment is by the fact that it now looks like the materialist paradigm is genuinely breaking down. You’re gonna hear a lot in the next calendar year about… how Darwin’s explanation of how human intelligence arose is the only scientific way of doing it… I’m asking us as a world community to go out there and tell the scientific establishment, enough is enough! Materialism needs to start fading away and non-materialist causation needs to be understood as part of natural reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Schwartz is a psychiatrist and a fellow of the &lt;a href="http://www.iscid.org/fellows.php"&gt;International Society for Complexity, Information and Design&lt;/a&gt; (ISCID), which is an ID think tank and also has as fellows prominent IDers Michael Behe and William Dembski. Schwartz, however, also relates that his dualist epiphany came from his study of Buddhism - an ideology incompatible with Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddhist connection perhaps explains Schwartz’s predilection for abusing quantum mechanics to “justify” his claims for dualism. Eastern spiritual philosophies have taken a liking to quantum mechanics, or at least to twisting this scientific theory so that it seems to support some Eastern notions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puts Schwartz in the same camp as Deepak Chopra and his “quantum healing” popular nonsense, although Chopra is a far less serious intellectual than Schwartz. Another Buddhist and quantum mechanics abuser is B. Allan Wallace (see &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=312"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for my discussion of Wallace and why the quantum mechanical arguments for dualism are fatally flawed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third faction in the anti-materialist camp are the purveyors of New Age mysticism and pseudoscience. This camp, while distinct, has some overlap with the Buddhists, but is largely incompatible with Christian creationists. An example of this philosophy is  Rustom Roy, who began his career (like Schwartz) as a legitimate scientist, but has recently been spending his time supporting demonstrably absurd notions like homeopathy with “water memory” pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=40"&gt;During a debate on homeopath&lt;/a&gt;y which I attended with Roy, he declared that “the materialist paradigm is dead.” At the time he justified that bold statement by referencing the abilities of John of God - a charlatan faith healer who had apparently bamboozled Roy with his slight of hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Materialism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this discussion of materialism I guess I should define it.  Put simply, it is the philosophical position that all physical effects have physical causes. There are no non-physical or non-material causes of physical effects. Historically materialism has been defined as the philosophical belief that matter is all there is - the only type of substance that can be said to exist in nature. Materialism stands specifically in opposition to dualism and other philosophies that posit a spiritual or non-material aspect of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any viable modern definition of materialism, however, must also include energy, forces, space-time - and anything else discovered by science to exist in nature. In this way materialism is really just a manifestation of naturalism - the philosophy that says that nature (in all of its aspects) is all that there is - there is nothing supernatural. In fact, the term materialism as broadly defined does not have much applicability today. We know that there is more to the universe than ordinary matter, and if you include everything in nature in your philosophy then you have naturalism. Materialism is mostly used in its narrow sense as it applies specifically to consciousness (that consciousness is what the brain does) and stands in opposition to dualism (the belief that consciousness is a non-physical thing unto itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the broader “anti-materialist” movement of ID, dualism, and various healing pseudosciences is more accurately defined as anti-naturalism. But I guess for propaganda purposes it is better to be against “materialism” than against nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real debate is whether or not science is required to follow methodological naturalism (which it clearly does). Philosophical naturalism is the metaphysical belief that nature is all there is. Methodological naturalism is proceeding as if nature is all there is while remaining agnostic toward the deeper metaphysical question. Another way of looking at it is that methodological naturalism posits that nature is all the we can know, regardless of whether or not it is all that there is (which by definition we cannot know).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does science require methodological naturalism? Yes. This is the real debate going on between mainstream science and various ideological groups who wish to promote a non-naturalist belief system.  But this philosophical fight was fought in centuries past - and the naturalists won. The fight is over. But the anti-materialists (really anti-naturalists) want to resurrect this fight, and since they cannot win it in the arena of science they want to fight it in the arena of public opinion and then the legal and academic realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science is dependent upon methodological naturalism because a necessary feature of any scientific hypothesis is that it is testable. Non-natural causes are by definition non-falsifiable, and therefore scientific methods cannot act upon them. It is like the now famous cartoon of the mathematician writing out a very complex equation, but in one part simply writes “and then a miracle happens.” His colleague points out that, “I think you need to be a little more explicit in this section.” (I may be paraphrasing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science cannot say, “and then a miracle happens.” There is no way to do an experiment or make an observation that can test a miracle. Miracles, by definition, defy natural forces or explanations. They cannot be constrained, which is a necessary feature of any hypothesis that can be falsified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ID had this very problem. The notion of an intelligent designer that created life by top-down fiat is not falsifiable because proponents can always argue (and do) that whatever we find in nature was what the designer intended - no matter what it is. The designer is not constrained in any way - not by the laws of physics nor by human logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear - science does not say, and cannot say, that all life on earth was not created in an instant by an all powerful designer. It is agnostic towards such a belief. It can only say that such a hypothesis is outside the realm of science because it cannot be tested scientifically. That is methodological naturalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As evidence that this is the real issue at stake here is the Kitzmiller v Dover trial involving the teaching of ID in public science classes. Here is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District/4:Whether_ID_Is_Science#4._Whether_ID_is_Science"&gt;long excerpt from the decision&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; NAS is in agreement that science is limited to empirical, observable and ultimately testable data: “Science is a particular way of knowing about the world. In science, explanations are restricted to those that can be inferred from the confirmable data – the results obtained through observations and experiments that can be substantiated by other scientists. Anything that can be observed or measured is amenable to scientific investigation. Explanations that cannot be based upon empirical evidence are not part of science.” (P-649 at 27).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rigorous attachment to “natural” explanations is an essential attribute to science by definition and by convention. (1:63 (Miller); 5:29-31 (Pennock)). We are in agreement with Plaintiffs’ lead expert Dr. Miller, that from a practical perspective, attributing unsolved problems about nature to causes and forces that lie outside the natural world is a “science stopper.” (3:14-15 (Miller)). As Dr. Miller explained, once you attribute a cause to an untestable supernatural force, a proposition that cannot be disproven, there is no reason to continue seeking natural explanations as we have our answer. Id.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ID is predicated on supernatural causation, as we previously explained and as various expert testimony revealed. (17:96 (Padian); 2:35-36 (Miller); 14:62 (Alters)). ID takes a natural phenomenon and, instead of accepting or seeking a natural explanation, argues that the explanation is supernatural. (5:107 (Pennock)). Further support for the conclusion that ID is predicated on supernatural causation is found in the ID reference book to which ninth grade biology students are directed, Pandas. Pandas states, in pertinent part, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stated another way, ID posits that animals did not evolve naturally through evolutionary means but were created abruptly by a non-natural, or supernatural, designer. Defendants’ own expert witnesses acknowledged this point. (21:96-100 (Behe); P-718 at 696, 700 (“implausible that the designer is a natural entity”); 28:21-22 (Fuller) (“. . . ID’s rejection of naturalism and commitment to supernaturalism . . .”); 38:95-96 (Minnich) (ID does not exclude the possibility of a supernatural designer, including deities).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is notable that defense experts’ own mission, which mirrors that of the IDM itself, is to change the ground rules of science to allow supernatural causation of the natural world, which the Supreme Court in Edwards and the court in McLean correctly recognized as an inherently religious concept. Edwards, 482&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last paragraph is key - the anti-materialist/naturalist movement is really about changing the ground rules of science (re-fighting the fight they lost in the past) to include supernatural explanations, but this is impossible within the necessary framework of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a further hypocrisy in the anti-materialist/naturalist agenda. They accuse scientists (and me personally) of being “materialist ideologues.” However, science does not profess philosophical materialism or naturalism (of course, individual scientists may) - science only professes methodological naturalism, a necessary prerequisite to science as a method of investigation. Science is agnostic toward the deeper philosophical or ideological question (and, for the record, I am personally as well) . Therefore science is non-ideological. It is they who are anti-materialist and anti-naturalism ideologues - they who are professing an anti-scientific ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Materialism and Neuroscience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ID proponent William Dembski wrote an interesting review of Schwartz’s book The Mind and the Brain called &lt;a href="http://www.designinference.com/documents/2003.02.Schwartz_Review.htm"&gt;Challenging Materialism’s “Chokehold” on Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;. The article is a good indication of the “unholy alliance” I discussed above - Dembski is trying to praise Schwartz for his attack on materialism as it applies to consciousness, without endorsing his Buddhist or quantum mechanical notions. We also see in this essay an interplay between the two main lines of argument for dualism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz’s essential argument for a non-materialist interpretation of mind is the phenomenon of plasticity. This is the ability of the brain to change its own hard-wiring in response to use. Incidentally, this is identical to the argument put forward by Deepak Chopra. Schwartz calls this phenomenon “self-directed neuroplasticity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroplasticity is well established, and researchers in the last 10 years have discovered that even adults retain significantly more plasticity than previously thought. We have also discovered at least one mechanism of this plasticity - adults also retain neural stem cells is larger numbers than previously thought. This is not controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dualism argument derives from the fact that we can change our brain activity by thinking. Dembski writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From brain scans, Schwartz found that certain regions in the brain of OCD patients (the caudate nucleus in particular) exhibited abnormal patterns of activity. By itself this finding is consistent with a materialist view of mind (if, as materialism requires, brain enables mind, then abnormal patterns of brain activity are likely to be correlated with dysfunctional mental states). Nonetheless, having found abnormal patterns of brain activity, Schwartz then had OCD patients engage in intensive mental effort through what he called relabeling, reattributing, refocusing, and revaluing (the 4 Rs). In the case of compulsive hand-washing, this would involve a patient acknowledging that the hands are in fact clean (relabeling); attributing anxieties and doubts about the hands being dirty to a misfunctioning brain (reattributing); directing thoughts and actions away from handwashing and toward productive ends (refocusing); and, lastly, understanding at a deep level the senselessness of OCD messages (revaluing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz documents not only that patients who undertook this therapy experienced considerable relief from OCD symptoms but also that their brain scans indicated a lasting realignment of brain-activity patterns. Thus, without any intervention directly affecting their brains, OCD patients were able to reorganize their brains by intentionally modifying their thoughts and behaviors. The important point for Schwartz here is not simply that modified thoughts and behaviors permanently altered patterns of brain activity, but that such modifications resulted from, as he calls it, “mindful attention” — conscious and purposive thoughts or actions in which the agent adopts the stance of a detached observer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz’s technique is really just a form of cognitive therapy.  Interestingly he equates an alternate approach of behavioral therapy (making OCD patients keep their hands dirty, for example) as a manifestation of the materialist view of mind, while his cognitive therapy is more compassionate and spiritual. This is a non sequitur, however. Many therapists use both cognitive and behavioral techniques, and assessments of their effectiveness are independent of materialist philosophy, as is the ethics surrounding specific behavioral techniques. But to the anti-materialists everything is about materialism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core argument is that the mind (a non-physical substance) is changing the physical brain. But his is just a circular argument - because if the mind comes from brain, than this is just the brain changing the brain. You can only interpret this as a non-physical cause changing the brain if you assume that the mind is non-physical in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Dembski has to admit this weakness of Schwartz’s argument, writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you want a knock-down argument against materialism and materialist accounts of mind, this won’t do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Dembski then goes on to argue (absurdly) that even though this argument by itself is worthless,  it is still compelling when combined with other (worthless) arguments against materialism, such as the strong anthropic principle. As further evidence for the “unholy alliance” he even cites Dean Radin’s &lt;em&gt;The Conscious Universe&lt;/em&gt; - that’s pretty desperate for a movement trying to grasp at scientific respectability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second type of argument used for a non-material interpretation of mind is nothing more than a god-of-the-gaps argument. This is the type of argument favored by Michael Egnor, &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?s=Michael+Egnor"&gt;with whom I have sparred &lt;/a&gt;numerous times in the past. Egnor essentially argues that the modern tools of neuroscience do not conform precisely to mental activity, and this discrepancy (gap) is due to the non-material part of the mind. Of course, the far simpler explanation is that MRI’s and EEG’s have limited resolution, and our models of brain anatomy and function are incomplete (gaps). Egnor sees dualism in the current gaps in neuroscience in the exact same logically fallacious way that creationists see God (or ID) in the gaps of the fossil record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, any science could be targeted with the same god-of-the-gaps strategy, and such arguments have been lampooned, as in this “&lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/39512"&gt;intelligent falling&lt;/a&gt;” article in The Onion, by inserting ID into the gaps in our current theories of gravitation. So, why attack neuroscience and not Newtonian mechanics? I think there are two primary reasons. The first is that some findings in science are more emotionally disagreeable than others. Evolution tells us that humans are animals, and neuroscience tells us that all of our hopes and fears are just chemicals and electrical signals in that lump of meat that sits in our skulls. Evolution and neuroscience are more personal than gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason is that these sciences deal with very abstract and difficult to imagine natural processes. Evolution unfolds over millions of years, a time scale that is beyond human experience and therefore difficult to fathom. Consciousness arises from brain function as an emergent phenomenon of a very complex system. It is difficult even for scientists to fully wrap their imaginations around the concepts involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sciences are therefore vulnerable to ideological attack. Their science is solid and progressing nicely (which is a testament to their underlying assumptions) but there are gaps in our current understanding, they are conceptually very challenging, and they potentially strike at our self-image. The anti-materialists offer in their place a simple and self-affirming ideology. Forget all the nuances about punctuated equilibrium - you were created by a loving parent-figure. Forget emergence and neurons - you are a luminous and immortal being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all get’s back to the Wedge strategy - the anti-materialists cannot win (and in fact have already lost) in the arena of science. Science requires methodological naturalism. All this talk about “materialist ideology” is all a diversion from the truth, which is that creationists, dualists, and proponents of various kinds of woo want to change the fundamental and necessary rules of science to allow their religious beliefs to pass as science. They are doing this for purely ideological reasons, and they don’t care if they have to destroy modern science in the process. Yet, they have the gall to accuse scientists of being “materialist ideologues” when they are just defending of method of inquiry from ideological assault.&lt;/p&gt;

These can be incredibly frustrating and challenging patients. Most physicians try reason, cajoling, and persuasion. Believe it or not, physicians are still held in enough esteem that this will often work on the force of the regard in which patients hold physicians alone. However, it doesn't always. Then the question becomes: How far can a doctor legitimately go to persuade the patient?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://allbleedingstops.blogspot.com/2008/10/i-am-bully.html"&gt;Shadowfax has an idea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He relates the story of a patient who came in with an acute abdomen. For those who don't know what an acute abdomen is, it's an abdomen in which something catastrophic has occurred, either a a perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, or some other process that has led to generalized peritonitis. Patients with peritonitis "look sick." Also, because peritonitis makes movement very painful, they tend to lie perfectly still and grimace if forced to move or if anyone presses on their belly. Indeed, there are certain clinical signs on physical examination characteristic for an acute abdomen, and every general surgeon becomes very skilled in diagnosing it because, well, that's what we do. It's considered our area of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, this patient, despite having an acute abdomen and a CT scan showing air where it should not be (i.e., outside of the intestines, meaning that there is a perforation somewhere), refused surgery, even though surgery was the only thing that could save his life. This is about as close to a no-brainer of a situation as there is in surgery and medicine. Patient with perforated intestine and acute abdomen = operating room. If no operating room, patient with perforated intestine = dead patient. In any case, it was pretty clear that this patient was in denial. At that point, Shadowfax deployed a most interesting technique of persuasion:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/the_gentle_art_of_persuasion.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/the_gentle_art_of_persuasion.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/430650136" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224851199839"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-6843608681430009109">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/be8243024c71f06a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blog Carnivals" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The 98th Skeptics Circle</title><published>2008-10-24T11:02:00Z</published><updated>2008-10-24T11:02:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2008/10/98th-skeptics-circle.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://uncrediblehallq.net/blog/?p=180"&gt;The 98th meeting of the Skeptics Circle&lt;/a&gt; has been posted at &lt;a href="http://uncrediblehallq.net/"&gt;The Uncredible Hallq&lt;/a&gt;.

It was pretty funny, even if he didn't tackle the intellectual big dogs. Why should he, though? In a sense, that would just be giving in to the Courtier's Reply. Most of his interviewees seemed to be chosen for what they could show to moderate religious people: "These are the guys you &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be repudiating. This is how ridiculous, ignorant, and dangerous they are." I hope someone gets the message.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, back to breakfast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;I told him what Maher said that had been irritating me, and he said "That's just stupid. It's meaningless. It's like asking 'What flavor is pink?'"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My answer was "Usually strawberry."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His point was well taken, though. "What flavor is pink?" is, in the most literal sense of the word, nonsense. Pink does not have a flavor. It cannot have a flavor. It is a color, which means it's a wavelength of light or an intangible concept or a subjective experience or what have you, but it cannot, under any common definition, have a flavor. The sentence "What flavor is pink?" has a proper grammatical structure, but its adjective cannot possibly apply to its noun and so it's totally meaningless. It's like Noam Chomsky's famous nonsense sentence "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then my mind jumped to logical fallacies (as it sometimes does), and I looked at the sentence from the other direction. "What flavor is pink?" is meaningless, but what if someone used it as if it &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; meaning? What if someone honestly asked that? Well, in a way, they'd be begging the question; by even posing the question in the first place as if it had meaning, they assume without evidence that pink has a flavor. When posed with this question seriously, one might stop for a moment to consider "What flavor &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; pink?" before they realize that the sentence is essentially gibberish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is, I believe, exactly what happens with most people when somebody says what Maher said at one point in &lt;i&gt;Religulous&lt;/i&gt;. What Maher said that got so under my skin was something that, on the surface, seems quite reasonable. He said "Nobody knows what happens after death."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To say that, however, is to assume implicitly that something &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; happen "after death." Maybe Maher doesn't mean it that way, but scads of theists who might say to an atheist "So what do you think happens after death?" do. They live with the assumption that, for an individual, there is such a thing as "after death." If someone asks you this, and you answer with "Nothing," or "You rot" or something, you are, in a way, conceding to them that the phrase "after death" means something. They're taking the rhetorical high ground just by asking the question at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suspect that, robbed of religious assumptions, the question "What happens after death?" has about as much meaning and sense as questions like "What happens to Ishmael after you close &lt;i&gt;Moby Dick&lt;/i&gt;?" or "What happens to Jack Sparrow when you stop the DVD?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, if we take a step back and look at more than simply a dying individual, it becomes easy to put a real, useful meaning on the phrase "after death." After someone's death, their body is taken to a morgue where it is embalmed, their relatives have a funeral and mourn, the corpse is interred, and it is broken down by bacteria and small subterranean critters. Or maybe the body is cremated, and a celebration of the person's life is held. Or maybe it's exposed in the woods for animals to eat so it becomes one with nature. The answer depends on cultural context, but when we look at the greater picture instead of just the individual, there &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be an answer. "After death" becomes a meaningful phrase, devoid of baseless assumption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this isn't the answer religious people want when they as "What happens after death?" because they're asking a different question. They're asking "What happens to &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; after &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; die? What happens to &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; after &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; die?" What happens to an individual person after that individual person dies? This is the question that presupposes that &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; happens, or at least that something &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; happen, and that we can talk meaningfully about that something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lacking, however, any convincing evidence for personal survival of death, or a part of a being that &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; survive death, or a mechanism by which something of an individual could survive death they're just asking what happens to Ishmael.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After you close the book, maybe you take a walk, have a cup of coffee, turn in for the night, or go watch TV instead. Maybe you make a phone call, and the book is left on the coffee table for you to pick up again later. But what happens to &lt;i&gt;Ishmael&lt;/i&gt;? That question doesn't even make sense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My answer to the question "What happens after death?" will henceforth be twofold, answering the question they mean to ask and the one they don't: "In the greater scheme of things, my family will mourn; my body will rot. The world will move on much as it had before. As for what happens to me, individually, after I die? I'll tell you when you tell me the flavor of pink."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224831710952"><id gr:original-id="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/?p=243">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2b50420db133b12f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Anna Nicole Smith"/><category term="ghost"/><category term="incubus"/><category term="Jessica Alba"/><category term="Montel Williams"/><category term="Patrick Swayze"/><category term="poltergeists"/><category term="Satan"/><category term="sex"/><category term="spirit"/><category term="succubus"/><category term="Sylvia Browne"/><title type="html">The beast with one back</title><published>2008-10-24T06:59:39Z</published><updated>2008-10-24T06:59:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/2008/10/23/the-beast-with-one-back/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghosts have needs too…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/infamousghostshot.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="infamousghostshot" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/infamousghostshot.jpg?w=167&amp;amp;h=192" alt="" width="167" height="192"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Folklorically, a &lt;em&gt;ghost&lt;/em&gt; is a manifestation of a deceased person. Ghosts are somehow caught in limbo between the physical world and whatever afterlife in which the believer believes. (Contrast this with a &lt;em&gt;spirit&lt;/em&gt; that has achieved the afterlife, but has no physical form.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seem to be two main kinds of ghosts, those that follow a routine or pattern conducted during their lifetime, such as repeating a traumatic event. The other kind of ghost has limited interactive abilities, they can materialize if they require the intercession of the living to right a wrong, or lay their bones to rest so they too can access the afterlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe they just appear with their hollow eyes and transparent glow to scare your tits off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/theghostandmrsmuir.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="theghostandmrsmuir" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/theghostandmrsmuir.jpg?w=128&amp;amp;h=87" alt="" width="128" height="87"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Some of you might recall fictional ghosts that endeavor to interact with the living via a medium, like &lt;strong&gt;Patrick Swayze’s&lt;/strong&gt; insipid character in &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099653/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Other ghosts can interact directly with people, such as the sailor in &lt;a href="http://www.macwombat.com/ghost.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ghost and Mrs Muir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Since I’m lately on a roll of unrequited (and unrequitable) love, this movie and tv series focused on the barely restrained sexual tension between a sexy widow and a ghostly, rugged, salty seaman.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But can ghosts do things that the living can do? Do ghosts, like poltergeists, have tactile abilties? Can they touch us, harm us, and even engage in intercourse with us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mate &lt;strong&gt;Mark Dallas&lt;/strong&gt; of Toronto sent me a link to an &lt;a href="http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/a88600/jessica-alba-attacked-by-ghost.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about actress &lt;strong&gt;Jessica Alba&lt;/strong&gt; who was once reputedly “attacked by a ghost”. Mark further says, “I mention it because I was watching that highly informative and intellectual program Entertainment Weekly, which mentioned another actress (whose name escapes me) who has recently (allegedly) been scratched all over by the ghost of the son of a brothel-keeper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark’s quote reminds me of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuthering_Heights"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wuthering Heights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; quote: “He’s exactly like the son of the fortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right…moving on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the article, Alba claims vaguely that on a single occasion she felt “something”, a “presence”, take the covers from her bed before she then felt a “pressure” placed on her body. The crappy tabloid translates this to the explicit: ”Jessica Alba has claimed that she was attacked in bed by a ghost when she was a teenager.” Whatever the cause, the event scared the shit out of her, she ran to the safety of her parent’s room, and implied that she soon left the house, while her parents tried to treat the perceived problem really rationally, “They got it blessed and they burned sage and stuff since then.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are non-specific symptoms of a haunting, but what could have caused this incident, and these sensations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this event occurred at least a decade ago, and even the experiencer can’t be a reliable informant for such a dated incident. Especially given the variables of the incident…it was presumably night time, presumably dark, she was presumably nearing sleep, or actually asleep at the time. We are relying on anecdotal evidence, which is kind of like joining a line without knowing what it’s for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/john_henry_fuseli_the_nightmare.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="john_henry_fuseli_the_nightmare" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/john_henry_fuseli_the_nightmare.jpg?w=120&amp;amp;h=96" alt="" width="120" height="96"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Without being there at the time, or being able to replicate that exact occurrence, we should first consider natural explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few plausible explanations include &lt;a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=47489"&gt;parasomnia&lt;/a&gt; (nightmare, sleep paralysis or night terror) or even &lt;a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_apnea/article.htm"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;. This is very real stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these conditions could engender feelings of pressure, immobility, suffocation, and panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, one &lt;a href="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/www.doctoratlantis.com/index.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctor Atlantis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; told me that as a lad he was once awoken similarly by a “pressure” on his bed. His parents answered his screams and the culprit turned out to be a dodgy light fitting that fell from the ceiling, nearly sliced him up a treat. (Until he has children we can’t be sure that he escaped unscathed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once watched a particularly disturbing episode of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montel_Williams"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Montel Williams Show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, disturbing not only because &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_browne"&gt;Sylvia Browne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was a guest, but also because the moll claimed that a teenage boy in the audience was ‘being visited by the ghosts of victims of the American Civil War’. These ghostly soldiers supposedly attacked him as they recreated their battles. What was the evidence for this claim? The kid was covered in tiny cuts. Could he have been into self-mutilation? For some kids, a cockandbull story about ghosts would be less embarrassing than the truth. &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":("&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also a possibility that some similar cases of ‘abusive ghosts’ mask abuse by people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/from-wwweso-gardencom1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="from-wwweso-gardencom1" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/from-wwweso-gardencom1.jpg?w=108&amp;amp;h=96" alt="" width="108" height="96"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This reminds me of a claim by &lt;a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Anna_Nicole_Smith"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anna Nicole Smith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (god rest her soul) that she often enjoyed sex with a well-equipped and lusty ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, now Smith has crossed over, there are &lt;a href="http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/28443/Ghost-busties-on-call-for-Anna/"&gt;claims that &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; is now a ghost&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps you’ll get lucky guys (and girls, from what I’ve heard…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Also, see &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thenaughtyamerican.com/index.php/articles/478/Sex_With_A_Ghost_Can_Be_Quite_Spirited"&gt;Sex with a ghost can be quite spirited&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for a cute overview of this topic, including some patently ridiculous nonsense from paranormal researcher &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.joshuapwarren.com/"&gt;Joshua Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the slutty demonic, gobliny and ghostly &lt;a href="http://www.occultopedia.com/i/incubus.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;incubi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.occultopedia.com/s/succubus.htm"&gt;succubi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://skepdic.com/satan.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;satan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with his ‘ice cold member’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we believe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle of &lt;a href="http://skepdic.com/occam.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occam’s Razor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; teaches us that the more simple explanation is often the correct explanation. The natural, mundane, common answer is the more likely explanation for violent ghosts and ghostly lovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were you attacked by a ghost, or simply having a fucking awful nightmare? Did you have sex with a ghost, or simply have sex with your partner? (…or was it a bloody wet dream you pervert?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I think these raunchy ghosts warrant a deeper investigation…so, to all you ghosts out there reading this…I’m, err… headed off to bed right now if you, um… want to, well, join me…for science…&lt;/p&gt;

It’s all asplodey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennis Leary is sometimes funny, but he can also be a serious jerk. It’s part of his schtick, but there are times… In a book he wrote, &lt;em&gt;Why We Suck: A Feel-Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy and Stupid&lt;/em&gt;, he says that some claims of autism are really just an excuse by “inattentive mothers and competitive dads who want an explanation for why their dumb-ass kids can’t compete academically, so they throw money into the happy laps of shrinks . . . to get back diagnoses that help explain away the deficiencies of their junior morons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/10/leary_mccarthy.jpg" alt="Dennis Leary and Jenny McCarthy"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a more perfect world…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/news/denis-leary-says-autism-Criticism-taken-out-of-context"&gt;He says this quotation is being taken grossly out of context&lt;/a&gt;. I have not read the book, so I can’t say for sure, though I can see where this might be the case. For example, he might be saying that most cases of autism are real, but only some parents use it as an excuse. Or maybe it’s simply an excrutiatingly poorly-aimed joke. He does say that he talks about autism being a real disorder, and &amp;quot;that I not only support the current rational approaches to the diagnoses and treatment of real autism but have witnessed it firsthand while watching very dear old friends raise a functioning autistic child.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it sounds like he may be trying making a what he thinks is a legitimate point, though doing so in a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; crass and ill-advised manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then the crazy gets, well, crazier. Enter Jenny McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/20/but-how-do-we-recover-from-jenny-mccarthy/"&gt;She is at the forefront&lt;/a&gt; of the loud but grossly wrong antivaccination movement. &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27229732/"&gt;About Leary, she says&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whoo! First of all, let me tell you, the autism community has received probably 10,000 emails [saying] ‘Go kill him!’ ‘Go yell at him,’” McCarthy, 36, told Access Hollywood’s Billy Bush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[But] it’s so hard to even get up enough juice in me or energy in me to even try to fight someone that is obviously stupid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. Where to start? With the &amp;quot;autism community&amp;quot; threatening him with death? Or her saying someone else’s claims about autism are &amp;quot;stupid&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Leary’s comments were pretty dumb, whether he’s right or not. Stirring up an issue with this much emotion to make a joke is not such a brilliant idea. Of course, he’s not trying to spearhead a movement  that creates a huge public health hazard and is literally putting the lives of our children at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having McCarthy jump on this already exploding dumbosity… well…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This nice you man published very well written a monthly apologetic newspaper he entitled: &lt;strong&gt;The Bible Trumpet&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With regards to our debate, he asked me if his wife could help in defending his conservative position on Biblical truth. I told him I would welcome her input. The debate did not fair well for them and they left disappointed..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A year later, he excitedly told me that he was going to attend an apologetic Bible conference where the famed Gleason Archer (The International Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties) and the renowned conservative Old Testament scholar, Walter Kaiser would be leading a major conference on the defense of the Bible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Archer's topic was: &lt;strong&gt;What Proof Do We have That Moses Wrote the Pentateuch?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Walter Kaiser’s topic was: &lt;strong&gt;The J E D P Documentary Hypothesis Exploded&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;After both apologetic lectures, Drs. Archer and Kaiser would debate several Moslem scholars in order to exposed the Qu’ran as a false historical record (A debate I thought was like the pot calling the kettle black!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My young friend told me he had been in touch with Dr. Archer who challenged him to have me write down any facts which I felt proved Moses did not write the Pentateuch. My friend said he would personally give them to Dr. Archer at the conference who he claimed “would put me in my place“.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My editor friend told me that he was very excited about Dr. Archer’s challenge to me and he could not wait to give me my irrefutable apologetic answers. So I wrote down five hard facts which I felt proved Moses did in fact not write the Pentateuch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A week later my ministerial friend returned, but seemed put out. After all, he had used his short vacation time off from his night job (as he was a full time college Bible student during the day), plus he paid all his expenses to and at the conference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I asked him what irrefutable evidence did Dr. Archer provide to prove my facts wrong, he told me he did not know what happened. He said he gave Dr. Archer my questions, who studied them for a short time, then he threw them on the conference table and exclaimed: “Whose this nut?” before walking off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s right! Your’s truly was declared an official declared a “nut” by the editor / author of &lt;strong&gt;The&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;International Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties&lt;/strong&gt; (sounds a lot like JP Holding).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I had the last laugh since, the funny thing is, it only took a “nut” to stump the great Gleason Archer!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sad to say, about 3 years later I heard form my apologetic ministerial friend again. Since I work in electronics, he wanted me to show him how to hook up a motion controlled camera to catch him wife cheating on him after he went work at night while she stayed with the kids. He told me he had already caught her once and that it had upset him so, he quit writing his apologetic paper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I gave him the information and wished him well. That was seventeen years ago and sadly, I never heard from him again. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I'm avoiding a lot of them, because
(A) they bore me, and (B) I'm really not the right person to ask. I try to stay
out of this stuff unless I have some clue of what I'm talking about. Rest assured, I'm not spending all of my blogging time on this; I've got a post on cryptographic modes of operation in progress, which I hope to have time to finish after work this evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But there's one question that keeps coming in, involving the nature of things
like so-called "Credit Default Swaps", which I thought I'd explained, but
apparently my explanation wasn't particularly clear. So I thought I should fill
in that gap, and strengthen the main weakness in my earlier explanations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; The basic question is: "What's a credit default swap?"; I think what people
really want to know is both what, specifically, a credit default swap is, and how
the system surrounding credit default swaps and related monstrosities work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Credit default swaps are interesting - in the same way that a Rube Goldberg
device is interesting. They are in a fundamental sense very simple, but the
structure that's built up around them is so bizarre, so ridiculous on the face of
it, that when you look at it in retrospect, it's hard to believe that anyone
actually thought that it was a good idea, or that it could ever work.&lt;/p&gt;

You're gonna hear a lot in the next calendar year about... how Darwin's explanation of how human intelligence arose is the only scientific way of doing it... I'm asking us as a world community to go out there and tell the scientific establishment, enough is enough! Materialism needs to start fading away and non-materialist causation needs to be understood as part of natural reality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? That's exactly the same rhetoric the Discovery Institute has used towards evolution, and it's just as false. It's to be expected, since this is the &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/brain/mg20026793.000-creationists-declare-war-over-the-brain.html"&gt;ranting of a DI fellow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Schwartz is arguing for is dualism: the idea that the mind is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the product of the activity of the brain, but is somehow generated supernaturally, with the brain being nothing but the host or receiver for the emanations of an immaterial &amp;#39;soul&amp;#39;. Contrary to his claims, however, this is definitely not a popular view in the neuroscientific community — if anything, the trend is going far, far away from what he claims, with the evidence growing that the reductionist, materialist approach to the brain is the best way to understand how it works. It&amp;#39;s not breaking down. Just as evolutionary theory has been strengthened by advances in molecular biology, so too has the materialist view of the mind been strengthened by multidisciplinary approaches in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/brain/mg20026793.000-creationists-declare-war-over-the-brain.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; is reporting on a meeting of these DI-sponsored loons, and it really does sound like a delightful coterie of idiots. Denyse O'Leary was there, along with Mario Beauregard, who together authored what I consider the worst book of 2007, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/10/the_spiritual_brain.php"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Spiritual Brain&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and so far I've read nothing as bad in 2008, so they may deserve a lifetime award. It's a book that was practically unreadable in its incoherent style, and which was full of illogical claims built from fallacious premises and bad experiments. Schwartz provides more excellent examples of the nonsense these guys are propagating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To properly support dualism, however, non-materialist neuroscientists must show the mind is something other than just a material brain. To do so, they look to some of their favourite experiments, such as research by Schwartz in the 1990s on people suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder. Schwartz used scanning technology to look at the neural patterns thought to be responsible for OCD. Then he had patients use "mindful attention" to actively change their thought processes, and this showed up in the brain scans: patients could alter their patterns of neural firing at will.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From such experiments, Schwartz and others argue that since the mind can change the brain, the mind must be something other than the brain, something non-material. In fact, these experiments are entirely consistent with mainstream neurology - the material brain is changing the material brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That makes no sense. The perception of mental activity is associated with detectable changes in the activity of the brain; that is not evidence for dualism. Would it be evidence for the idea that the mind is the product of the brain if our most sensitive instruments revealed that while people composed sonnets or solved calculus problems or daydreamed about Tina Fey nude, their brains were as inert as large lumps of cold silly putty? I think not. These data are exactly what we'd expect if thought were the product of brain activity, that we'd see &lt;i&gt;brain activity&lt;/i&gt; while &lt;i&gt;people were thinking&lt;/i&gt;. We even have experimental evidence of correlated brain activity &lt;i&gt;preceding&lt;/i&gt; individual awareness of conscious thought…again, as we materialists would expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article points out that this is a looming concern, and it&amp;#39;s one I&amp;#39;ve been talking about for a long time. Just as evolution challenged religious literalists preconceptions about human exceptionalism and our origins, and made itself a focus of concerted hatred by the dogmatists, neuroscience is the next big science that is going to antagonize them, since it challenges other fundamental concepts of primitive religious thought, such as the idea that we have immortal souls separate from our flesh, that we are imbued by our creator with this magical element at some instant, such as conception. Remember that this is the papal escape clause: Catholics can accept physical evolution, but that the significant spiritual event was the endowment of a soul on the human lineage at some indefinite time in the past. It&amp;#39;s also going to be a flashpoint for the anti-choice crowd, who want to claim personhood and identity on clumps of cells that don&amp;#39;t even have any neural tissue — it yanks the basis for their claims right out from under their feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing sparing us right now is that most public school science classrooms never introduce anything about neuroscience, so it avoids the problem so far of actually directly antagonizing ignorant yahoos who don't like their children liberated from the biases of their parents' ignorance. Give it a few more years, though, and let it become a bit more high profile, and it will trigger furious outrage in many more. After all, it is so &lt;i&gt;degrading&lt;/i&gt; to be told that your finest thoughts are made from well-ordered meat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/your_brain_is_the_next_battleg.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/430006603" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224794595863"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/bachmann_flameout.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/438cec4a5322ee79</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Bachmann flameout</title><published>2008-10-23T20:36:43Z</published><updated>2008-10-23T20:36:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/429977486/bachmann_flameout.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/bachmann_flameout.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Oooh, this has got to sting.

Engineers are trying to get a backup system started to take over for &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/14/nasa-will-try-to-fix-hubble-tomorrow/"&gt;a system that failed earlier&lt;/a&gt;. What failed was the hardware that controls the science instruments, so without this Hubble is seriously crippled. However, when trying to get everything back online, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/17/hubble-fix-hits-snag-is-delayed/"&gt;there were a couple of problems&lt;/a&gt; that made engineers suspend the repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the Advanced Camera for Surveys suspended when a software test violated a safety protocol. There was no actual safety issue, though! Basically, the software had been changed to support the upcoming servicing mission, and the test wound up stepping on some of the new code. This issue has been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the entire science payload suspended due to &amp;quot;an electrical event&amp;quot;, which tripped the hardware reset. This too was not a big deal, but the hardware is programmed to shut down in such an event so humans can take a look and see what happened. This too has been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the good news is, while a few days were lost, engineers are ready to get Hubble back on its feet, so to speak. They’re hoping to have it up and running by this weekend! &lt;/p&gt;

There are many things I do not understand about the financial crisis, but the one thing that currently puzzles me the most is how there have not been dozens of huge hedge-fund failures over the last few months.
I am sure there are plenty of hedge funds that are long mortgage-backed securities. Moreover, hedge funds [...]

&lt;p&gt;John Scalzi is cool. He’s a science fiction writer, and a year or two ago I was lamenting of never reading SF again. I was reading &lt;a href="http://www.wilwheaton.typepad.com/"&gt;Wil Wheaton’s blog&lt;/a&gt;, and he was raving over this scifi writer guy’s blog, so I took a look. Next thing I know, I’ve read &lt;em&gt;Old Man’s War&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Android’s Dream&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Last Colony&lt;/em&gt;, and more. Scalzi rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also has a feature on his blog, &lt;a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com"&gt;Whatever&lt;/a&gt;, called The Big Idea, where he gets authors to describe the process of writing their book. &lt;a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2008/10/23/the-big-idea-phil-plait/"&gt;He asked me to contribute to The Big Idea&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/em&gt;, so I did. It’s a bit of the back story of how the book got made, and what it was like. I haven’t written much about that here on my own blog, so go take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/about/the-canonical-bacon-page"&gt;Maybe he’ll tape bacon to my book&lt;/a&gt;.

Okay so far?  I think these facts are undeniable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if you want a deductive argument expressing this inductive argument of mine, here it is:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;p -&amp;gt; q:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If 1-4 is true, then it’s probable that people adopt their religion based upon “when and where they were born.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;p:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1-4.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;.: q:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Therefore, it’s probable that people adopt their religion based upon “when and where they were born,” and if that’s the case the religion a person adopts is probably dependent upon the "accidents of birth" rather than rational assessment of the case. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based upon 1-4, it's highly probable religious adherents will not investigate their faith dispassionately. They will use reason to solidify and support religious beliefs arrived at prior to rationally examining them. And because there isn’t a mutually agreed upon scientific test to determine the truth of any religion, therefore social/political and geographical factors heavily influence what religion one adopts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This conclusion is the strongest in those communally shared religions where doubt places the adherent in danger of hell, as well as the fear of losing the friendship of the religious community he or she is involved in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This conclusion leads to the presumption of skepticism when investigating any religious faith, including one’s own; for it’s probable that the adherents merely adopted their faith based upon “when and where they were born.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a Christian is unwilling to take this test then he must justify his double standard. Why does he approach all other religious faiths as an outsider and yet be unwilling to evaluate his own faith by the same standard?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Objection:&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why do you think atheism stands outside the bubble?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's a great question. In the first place atheism is the position of last resort having examined the various religious claims and finding them faulty by virtue of the &lt;em&gt;Outsider Test&lt;/em&gt;. And if we're all inside some kind of bubbles to varying degrees, when it comes to being inside the bubble of science, education, and rational thought, I'll go with that every time, since the alternatives are superstitious, and because science has accomplished so much. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, if I am to question atheism (defined as metaphysical naturalism) as an outsider and find it wanting then at best I would be an agnostic, a complete skeptic with regard to metaphysical claims, and that grants the believer no ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other than that, the differences have to do with the nature of communal religions, threats of punishment if one will entertain doubts, ancient texts written by superstitious people over against scientific reasoning, the nature of what history can and cannot show, and the fact that atheists usually come out of religions by themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mean, really, if Christians really cared to truly investigate their faith, then atheist books should be flying off the shelves! Think about it. But most Christians will never buy or read a book that argues against their faith.

He wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;Suffering allows for the proving and demonstration of courage, faith, stamina, perseverance, determination, spirit, triumph, glory, heroism, overcoming. Thus, while motives of an individual may be malicious, the condition of meaningless suffering is not evil to God - it is the backdrop against which the godly qualities of life are manifested and made clear.&lt;/blockquote&gt;My question is why these virtues are important to God since in heaven for the saints they will be completely irrelevant in an eternal bliss without any pain or suffering.

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the countdown towards #100 continues. Next up is King of Ferrets &lt;a href="http://ferretcage.blogspot.com/"&gt;Ferret Cage&lt;/a&gt;, who will be hosting the 99th Edition of the &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com"&gt;Skeptics' Circle&lt;/a&gt; a fortnight hence, on Thursday, November 6, 2008. I should go back and check to see whether King of Ferrets is the youngest host we've ever had (age 15). Now, I know you all want to encourage the next generation of skeptics; so encourage King of Ferrets and be sure to send him your best stuff in time to be included in the next Circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you're interested in hosting one of these Circles yourself (and, if you're a skeptical blogger and have never hosted one, you really should, not to mention that if you've hosted before you should consider hosting again), check out the &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2005/10/skeptics-circle-archive-and-schedule.html"&gt;schedule and archive&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/07/skeptics-circle-reloaded.html"&gt;guidelines for hosts&lt;/a&gt; and then drop me a line. Assuming you're not a woo masquerading as a skeptic, I'll get you right on the schedule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/the_98th_meeting_of_the_skeptics_circle.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/429793120" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224780584294"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/our-daily-bleg-the-source-of-goldwaters-discomfort/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c9915bd22a23d54a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="bleg"/><category term="fred shapiro"/><title type="html">Our Daily Bleg: The Source of Goldwater's Discomfort?</title><published>2008-10-23T16:08:27Z</published><updated>2008-10-23T16:08:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/HHBzh-BtwzI/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/our-daily-bleg-the-source-of-goldwaters-discomfort/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Photo: Cliff1066

The scenario was that a teacher tried to advocate creationist theories in a public high school classroom, was fired for it, and is trying to sue for reinstatement. Here's Greg's account of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Pharyngulites and I (ggab and his friend) attended last evenings mock trial at NKU.  You can see pictures of the event here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gallery.me.com/gllopc#100069"&gt;http://gallery.me.com/gllopc#100069&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pictures include the question the audience/jury was asked, and the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;36% Believe she should remain fired&lt;br&gt;
2% Believe she should remain fired, but for other reasons&lt;br&gt;
31% Should be given her job back unconditionally (that is, she should be permitted to continue presenting research by young earth scientists that challenges evolution)&lt;br&gt;
4% Believed should she keep her job, providing she stop including young earth science research as part of her teaching&lt;br&gt;
28% Believed she should keep her job, if she agrees to make it clear when teaching young earth research that most scientists reject that research and accept evolution as the explanation for the origins of the Earth and its plant and animal life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some rounding up was obviously done, as this equals 101%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mock trial itself was a bit confusing, as it was unclear what was being argued: the wrongful termination of the teacher, or creation science versus evolution.  Ggab believed that there may have been some confusion between the mock attorneys and witnesses in that the school board's attorney argued that the teacher was given a warning to cease the teaching of "creation science", where the teacher's attorney argued that no warning was ever given.  Ggab believed that it was settled ahead of time that warning was given, and perhaps the teacher's attorney conveniently forgot, or veered off script.  They then introduced witnesses that argued for or against creation science, which seemed non-sequitur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teacher's expert, Dr. Scripture, played a video, as seen in the pics, which showed the inner workings of a cell.  His argument was for irreducible complexity.  Dr. Scripture made sure to get in a plug for his website, as well as the Expelled DVD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The school boards expert, Ed Kagin, was both entertaining and informative.  He was twice accused of filibustering by the fired teachers attorney.  The audience enjoyed him.  He called the teacher a "liar" for teaching creation science in class, and yet calling herself science teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evening ended with a Q&amp;amp;A.  Dr. Scripture appeared to have a plant in the audience (he was reading from a sheet of paper) who brought up microevolution versus macroevolution.  Dr. Scripture gave his explanation, saying that there is no proof of macroevolution since it can&amp;#39;t be observed, only inferred via the fossil record. Immediately after a biology professor at NKU stood and gave examples of macroevolution, citing the evolution of batwings, as well as Cortez&amp;#39; army&amp;#39;s immunity to small pocks during the invasion of the Aztecs - noting that over 90% of the Aztecs perished to the disease.  She was the only person to be applauded the entire evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When exiting the auditorium a table was setup with creation science materials, including a DVD on creation science.  No pro-evolution material was on the table (that I noticed).&lt;/p&gt;

J. Gevaerd, the editor of &amp;quot;Brazilian UFO Magazine&amp;quot; is what I would charitably call a crank. He once interviewed a guy in his magazine who claimed that Jesus is tied up in the UFO phenomenon — of course! — along with other things that would make my head all asplodey to write about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, he wanted to start a new research center to study UFOs, called the Carl Sagan Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I will give you a moment to make comical head-shaking noises and wipe your ears out with your fingers. Yes, he wanted to name his pseudoscientific center after Carl Sagan, one of the leading and most vocal critics of the UFO phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you might say to yourself, &amp;quot;Maybe Gevaerd will be critical and apply Sagan’s skepticism to the study of UFOs.&amp;quot; Hope springs eternal! But then there is the inevitable fall, you realize, remembering that whole Jesus-returning-in-a-UFO thing above. Yeah. Oh, and &lt;a href="http://forgetomori.com/2008/ufos/the-carl-sagan-institute-of-ufology/"&gt;in Gevaerd’s own words&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many think that Sagan passed away without knowing the result of his search … But that is far from the truth. Sagan had a close relationship with north-american governmental agencies dedicated to the UFO phenomenon investigation, and even Joseph Allen Hynek, considered the father of Modern Ufology, guaranteed that Sagan had a profound knowledge about the alien presence on Earth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, are we done arguing over this guy’s grip on reality? &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;. Yes, we are. Which is good, because this gets funnier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, Ann Druyan, Sagan’s widow, took a dim view of this eponymy. There are legal issues to be dealt with in using Sagan’s name… so what’s a UFOlogist to do? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, change the name, of course. It’s now called &lt;a href="http://www.ufo.com.br/index.php?arquivo=notComp.php&amp;amp;id=3952" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Galileo Galilee  Institute for Extraterrestrial Life Research&lt;/a&gt;. Besides the obvious travesty of using &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; name, and noting the weird use — I don’t remember Galileo talking very much about being abducted and having his butt probed — I have to add that the Church back then took an even dimmer view of this; they burned &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno"&gt;Giordano Bruno&lt;/a&gt; at the stake in part for his heretical writing about even the &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; of alien worlds and life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, those wacky UFOlogists. Burning at the stake isn’t needed any more. That burning smell is their credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

This being one of my pet topics, I thought this would be a good time to organize my thoughts and get a discussion going.  Maybe all y’all can help me figure some things out.  If you like it, I may even make a series of it.  FSM knows there’s enough material… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I’ll start off with something that sort of bothered me.  I know it was like forever ago now, but did anyone else cringe at that bit of the &lt;a href="http://cdn2.libsyn.com/skepticsguide/skepticast2008-07-09.mp3?nvb=20081022224020&amp;amp;nva=20081023224020&amp;amp;t=043d616a69d0306c013c8"&gt;July 9th SGU interview with Randi&lt;/a&gt; where they speculated (sans Rebecca) as to why the skeptical movement has trouble attracting women?  It was weird.  Nothing they said was necessarily disrespectful, and they seemed to be asking the question in a genuinely feminist way (at least they intended to), but I couldn’t help but get the impression that they were talking about women like we’re aliens or something, which strikes me as a huge reason for the problem which spurred the question.  Maybe it’s just me.  I do wish Rebecca had been there for that discussion, because I’m sure she would’ve had something more insightful to say than, “Well, women don’t like confrontation so they stay away, but we don’t want them to stay away ‘cuz they’re good at teh social stuff.” (I’m paraphrasing here, obviously.)  I do love the SGU guys, and Randi, but that conversation hit me the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And more recently, it was suggested to one of my fellow Skepchicks that the blog’s content has become too skewed toward “chick stuff”, rather than bringing women into the “mainstream” of the skeptical movement.  It immediately struck me that part of bringing women into the mainstream is to make the mainstream aware of issues that affect us as skeptical women, some of which can go completely unnoticed to people who haven’t experienced them.  You can’t attract people to the movement if you don’t take seriously the issues that they care about.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there’s an underlying tendency for some people to view Skepchicks as the cheerleaders of the skeptical movement: pretty faces standing at the sidelines whose proper place is to support whatever the men at the top happen to be championing at the moment.  For the most part, I don’t think this is a conscious thing, but extends naturally out of the larger societal view of women as either sexy or smart, but not both.  One of our main goals here at Skepchick is to change that view by being out there and showing our brains and our bodies, putting forward the issues that affect us, and having fun doing it.  I’d like to think we’re succeeding at that, but sometimes I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of the comment mentioned above, I wonder how many other people are simply blind to the brains aspect.  I skimmed briefly over our articles over the past couple of months, and saw one or two items relating directly to women’s issues, but mostly a whole lot of news stories, commentary, and book reviews that I would consider to be of interest to the “mainstream” skeptical community, albeit from our various perspectives.  Sort of makes me wonder if the commenter even really reads what we write.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know of a few individuals in the movement who disagree strongly with our approach and seem to think we should emphasize the brains/body dichotomy, cutting out the sexy altogether in order to garner some “legitimacy”.  I can’t think of a worse solution.  As frustrating as things can get sometimes, feeding into the problem does not solve it.  Besides, to do that (at least for me, though I’m sure my fellow Skepchicks would agree) would be to portray a false image.  What you see of me here on Skepchick is not a contrived character constructed to make a point or get attention.  It is just me (ok, I’m not really a cartoon).  I am smart, skeptical, opinionated, and nerdy, and I also have fun (which includes the occasional drink or 3), enjoy my body and my sexuality, and I see no reason to hide any of these things.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My instinct is that if we just keep on being ourselves, unapologetically, things will change.  I think things are changing, but socialized norms are tricky things to overcome.  Also I think it is crucial that we talk about these things.  Making skeptics of all genders examine critically how they think about these issues can only help root out previously unrecognized stereotypes and prejudices, and, hopefully, lead to a more diverse movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224770633390"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/vandalism_in_minneapolis.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fed98473d1b2abe9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Vandalism in Minneapolis</title><published>2008-10-23T14:47:38Z</published><updated>2008-10-23T14:47:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/429660442/vandalism_in_minneapolis.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/vandalism_in_minneapolis.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Someone has been targeting politician's homes for vandalism: it includes both Democrats and Republicans, including Michele Bachmann and Norm Coleman and John Kline and Amy Klobuchar. Despite their different political affiliations, all of the spray painted messages on the homes have the same message: &lt;a title="kstp.com - 6 Minn. politicians&amp;#39; homesvandalized " href="http://kstp.com/article/stories/S627869.shtml?cat=1"&gt;they call them "traitor" or "scum", demand resignation, and reference the same bible verse&lt;/a&gt;. So all we know at this point is that they have one deranged source, and whoever it is is almost certainly not an atheist. The verse in question is &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%202&amp;amp;version=9;"&gt;Psalm 2&lt;/a&gt;, which is typical biblical noise about demanding that defiant kings must serve the lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, this has been a vicious campaign season here in Minnesota, not that that excuses such behavior. Norm Coleman in particular has been awful: he's running an ad all the time right now that outright calls Al Franken a "pornographer" and throws sleaze like it was confetti. I haven't been able to find a copy of it on youtube yet, but &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YFkbtoUlyY"&gt;here's a critique of Coleman's negative campaigning&lt;/a&gt; that shows one example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be relieved when this election cycle is finally over…I just hope the Rovian slimebeasts don&amp;#39;t win, again.&lt;/p&gt;

Hat (as he's called in the blogosphere) asserted that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I personally am happy to sign on to the Descriptivist position as &amp;quot;caricatured&amp;quot; and state that there is no such thing as bad language change. […] To say any form of language change is &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; is to be ipso facto unscientific.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also suggested that my acquaintances and I belong to &amp;quot;a small sample of linguists who have … weirdly quasi-prescriptivist views about language&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these bracing sentiments, I think that Hat and I are not very far apart on this issue, in the end. But before we pass the peace pipe around, I'd like to take up the question of what &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; means, and what &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; means, and to whom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Menand clearly means &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in the OED's sense 2, "Lacking good or favourable qualities; unfavourable, unfortunate, untoward; that one does not like; not such as to be hoped for or desired". And by &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; he means not just the structure of spoken language, but the whole culture of communication, as indicated by these passages from his essay:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[Crystal&amp;#39;s] conclusions are predictable: texting is not corrupting the language; people who send text messages that use emoticons, initialisms (“g2g,” “lol”), and other shorthands generally know how to spell perfectly well; and the history of language is filled with analogous examples of nonstandard usage. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;A less obvious attraction of texting is that it uses a telephone to avoid what many people dread about face-to-face exchanges, and even about telephones—having to have a real, unscripted conversation. People don’t like to have to perform the amount of self-presentation that is required in a personal encounter. They don’t want to deal with the facial expressions, the body language, the obligation to be witty or interesting. They just want to say “flt is lte.” Texting is so formulaic that it is nearly anonymous. There is no penalty for using catchphrases, because that is the accepted glossary of texting. C. K. Ogden’s “Basic English” had a vocabulary of eight hundred and fifty words. Most texters probably make do with far fewer than that. And there is no penalty for abruptness in a text message. Shortest said, best said. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[T]exting has accelerated a tendency toward the Englishing of world languages. Under the constraints of the numeric-keypad technology, English has some advantages. The average English word has only five letters; the average Inuit word, for example, has fourteen. English has relatively few characters; Ethiopian has three hundred and forty-five symbols, which do not fit on most keypads. English rarely uses diacritical marks, and it is not heavily inflected. Languages with diacritical marks, such as Czech, almost always drop them in text messages. Portuguese texters often substitute “m” for the tilde. Some Chinese texters use Pinyin—that is, the practice of writing Chinese words using the Roman alphabet. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bad &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;and this sense of&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, there's no question in my mind: most linguists, even when they're wearing their professional hats, believe  that some real or hypothetical changes in "language" are or would be "bad".  For example, the web page for the LSA's &lt;a href="http://www.lsadc.org/info/lsa-comm-endanger.cfm"&gt;Committee on Endangered Languages and their Preservation&lt;/a&gt; clearly presupposes that language death is a Bad Thing.  I know many linguists who work on literacy projects, and I'm confident that most others believe that illiteracy in modern societies is generally a Bad Thing.  Linguists who work on discourse coherence universally believe that essays, narratives and conversations can be more coherent or less coherent, and I'm confident that most of them believe that reduced coherence is a Bad Thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that most linguists would assent to Prof. Menand&amp;#39;s particular views about the cultural and stylistic evaluation of texting. Some would, some wouldn&amp;#39;t — and most, I believe, would respond in the way that David Crystal did, which is to ask, wait a minute, what are the facts here? That was the main point of my original post on this subject: &amp;quot;we believe that moral and aesthetic judgments about language should be based on facts, not on ignorant and solipsistic gut reactions&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But suppose it really were true, as Menand might be taken to suggest, that pre-adolescent texting causes a pathological inability to manage "the facial expressions, [and] the body language" required to have "real, unscripted conversation" in "face-to-face exchanges".  In the face of credible evidence that texting leads to mass autism, it would be absurd to assert that as scientists, we must only describe the epidemic's progress, not evaluate its consequences and consider alternative measures for prevention or remediation. In fact, such an attitude would be not only foolish but also profoundly unscientific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, though, examination of the facts shows that no such epidemic is underway. A central point of David Crystal&amp;#39;s book was to debunk a whole list of similar sky-is-falling fears about texting, by looking at the facts of the case — and a central point of Louis Menand&amp;#39;s review was to undermine Crystal&amp;#39;s arguments on the grounds that those professional linguists, you know, they never met a language change they didn&amp;#39;t like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us back to a rhetorical problem in the culture of modern linguistics. When one linguist says to another "Was that good for you?", at least in a professional context, the phrase usually means "was that sentence consistent with your personal grammatical norms?" We don't mean "was it clearly expressed?" or "was it appropriately punctuated for publication in Language?" or "what is your moral or political opinion of the people who characteristically use such expressions?", or "how would you suggest re-phrasing it?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because linguists mostly use &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in the narrower sense of &amp;quot;grammatical system&amp;quot; rather than in its various broader senses — &amp;quot;means of communication&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;manner or style of expression&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;vocabulary or phraseology&amp;quot;, etc. There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with this choice, from a scientific point of view — speech really is different from writing, words really are different from gestures, syntax really is different from a set of word-association norms, and so on. But when a non-linguist uses &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;changes in the language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to include a decline in "the obligation to be witty or interesting", and uses &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to mean "I regret this, and invite others to join me in bemoaning it", then it's time to step out of the disciplinary box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on personal and professional opinions, linguists can choose from a large set of scientifically appropriate responses to (say) the claim that texting is making people less witty and interesting: &amp;quot;This is serious if true, and to check whether it&amp;#39;s really happening, we should …&amp;quot;; or &amp;quot;OK, witty and interesting is good, but I seriously doubt that texting is actually making people more bland and boring, because …&amp;quot;; or &amp;quot;Actually, what you call &amp;#39;witty and interesting&amp;#39; is mostly covert hostility, and society is better off with less of it, as is shown by …&amp;quot;; and so on. But among them is not: &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re scientists over here, and so as a matter of principle, we refuse to be bothered with your evaluative attitudes: whatever is, is right.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not the view that geophysicists take about climate change, for example, or the view that microbiologists and epidemiologists take about AIDS. Nor, in fact, is it the attitude that linguists take about language death, or literacy, or aphasia, or foreign language teaching. The problem with most so-called prescriptivists is not the presence of evaluative attitudes, but the absence of coherent analysis and accurate description. In some cases, the evaluative attitudes also express regional, class or ethnic prejudice; but again, this just means that they're the wrong evaluative attitudes, not that evaluation itself is out of bounds for scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: As I should have explained, there are senses of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;language &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in which Hat's position is tautologically true, for everyone and not just for linguists. If &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; means "the lexical and grammatical norms of speech community C", and&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; bad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; means "outside the lexical and grammatical norms of speech community C", then a "language change" could be "bad" only if the lexical and grammatical norms of speech community C changed in such a way as to become outside themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is not what people like Prof. Menand mean by these words. Linguists often focus on the question of whose norms are the basis of evaluation — obviously, for example,  &amp;quot;kids these days&amp;quot; often develop ways of talking that are outside the lexical and grammatical norms of some old guy like me, and we need to keep teaching people that this is not, like, the burning of the library of Alexandria, but rather an inevitable side-effect of human creativity and freedom. But an equally common reason for misunderstanding is equivocation about what language is, as discussed above.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224769855434"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/breast_cancer_awareness_month_abused_by.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9f9cba4c97d5b9cc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Breast Cancer Awareness Month abused by Mike Adams, 2008 edition</title><published>2008-10-23T14:00:00Z</published><updated>2008-10-23T14:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/429644478/breast_cancer_awareness_month_abused_by.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/breast_cancer_awareness_month_abused_by.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'll give Mike Adams one thing. He's consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistently a crank, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that purveyor of woo, paranoia, and conspiracy theories, not to mention the creator of one of the five largest repositories of quackery support on the Internet, &lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/"&gt;NaturalNews.com&lt;/a&gt;, the other three being &lt;a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mercola.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.whale.to/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Whale.to&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.curezone.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;CureZone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.garynull.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Gary Null&lt;/a&gt;, is up to his usual tricks again. He's back promoting cancer quackery in his own inimitable style, in which cancer can be prevented and cured with virtually 100% efficacy using supplements and diet and conventional medicine &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; cures any disease &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;. Perhaps what's most despicable about Mike Adams is how he takes events in the news and uses them to slime "conventional medicine" and his enemies, as he did when &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/the_ghouls_descend_upon_the_corpse.php"&gt;Tony Snow died of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; and Christina Applegate elected to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/a_ghoul_descends_upon_christina_applegat.php"&gt;undergo bilateral mastectomies&lt;/a&gt; because of her breast cancer and her genetic predisposition to the disease discovered at the time of her diagnosis. Unfortunately, Adams doesn't limit himself just to the deaths of famous people as an excuse to spew his toxic brand of quack-friendly idiocy. Oh, no. Starting last year in October, I noticed that Adams likes to slither his way onto the scene in order to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/10/breast_cancer_awareness_month_deception.php"&gt;slime Breast Cancer Awareness Month&lt;/a&gt;. I don't know if he did the same thing in the years before 2007, but I do know one thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adams is continuing the tradition I noticed last year and sliming &lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/024536.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Breast Cancer Awareness Month 2008&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, he's topped even himself. Be warned: If you dare to go below the fold, you're in for such a concentrated helping of toxic stupidity from Adams that you'll think a star of woo went hypernova and contracted into a black hole of quackery. No intelligence, science, or reason can escape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/breast_cancer_awareness_month_abused_by.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/breast_cancer_awareness_month_abused_by.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/429644478" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224769629896"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-903833368072954868">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c4020ed593fb23be</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Is Religion Here to Stay?</title><published>2008-10-23T12:55:00Z</published><updated>2008-10-23T13:05:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/10/is-religion-here-to-stay.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/903833368072954868/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=903833368072954868" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> In the comments of a recent posting we heard the oft-repeated argument that a majority of Americans are believers and nothing is going to change that.

The primary proponent of this argument for the DI (and a frequent foil of my blog entries) is Michael Egnor, a creationist neurosurgeon. But the New Scientist article correctly points out that this is actually part of a larger movement and a larger strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wedge Strategy &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This current attack on neuroscience has the same underlying roots as the ID attack on evolution - the real enemy for ID proponents is materialism. The infamous &lt;a href="http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.html"&gt;Wedge document&lt;/a&gt; makes this clear in its opening paragraphs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposition that human beings are created in the image of God is one of the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built. Its influence can be detected in most, if not all, of the West’s greatest achievements, including representative democracy, human rights, free enterprise, and progress in the arts and sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet a little over a century ago, this cardinal idea came under wholesale attack by intellectuals drawing on the discoveries of modern science. Debunking the traditional conceptions of both God and man, thinkers such as Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, and Sigmund Freud portrayed humans not as moral and spiritual beings, but as animals or machines who inhabited a universe ruled by purely impersonal forces and whose behavior and very thoughts were dictated by the unbending forces of biology, chemistry, and environment. This materialistic conception of reality eventually infected virtually every area of our culture, from politics and economics to literature and art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crystal clear from this and other writings, and well as the history of the ID/creationist movement, that this is about ideology, not science.  ID proponents feel that their spiritual ideological world view is threatened by the findings of modern science, and so have decided to undermine it. They want this to be an ideological and cultural war, because in the arena of science they lose. So they claim that science (at least those sciences with which they feel uncomfortable)  is nothing more than the ideology of materialism. They want to frame the conflict as that between the traditional, moral, and god-fearing spiritualism on one side, and cold, amoral, mechanistic materialism on the other.  This is an emotional fight they feel they can win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But their dilemma has been (made clear by the recurrent failures of the old-school creationist movement) that the institution of science appears to have a lock on public education, research funding, mainstream publications, and even to a large degree public respect. Therefore they decided, and this is clearly laid out in the Wedge document, to fight fire with fire - to create their own “scientific” institutions, their own scholars, and publications, and funding sources. They set out to pretend to do science and to make scientific arguments (the thin edge of the wedge) so as to break into the established scientific infrastructure, but their farce had a predetermined goal - to undermine the materialist basis of modern science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ID proponents began their efforts with evolution, but that was only ever a means to an end, that end being the destruction of materialism. Their recent efforts to attack modern neuroscience is simply another aspect of this underlying strategy. At first it may have seemed strange that a neurosurgeon was writing about dualism on the Evolution News and Views propaganda blog of the Discovery Institute.  But in light of the bigger picture, it makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think the New Scientist is correct in pointing out that the ID movement may be shifting their emphasis to neuroscience. I think it is fair to say that the ID attack on evolution has been largely a failure. They failed in Dover (where a conservative judge ruled that ID was warmed-over creationism and could not be taught in public school science classes), and the movie &lt;a href="http://www.expelledexposed.com/index.php/the-truth"&gt;Expelled&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be a huge boondoggle.  They are getting some traction with their “academic freedom” deception, but not much, and I think that effort will ultimately fail as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure of the ID attack on evolution is perhaps due to the fact that there is a generation of scientists, specifically biologists and evolutionary scientists, who grew up during the period of creationist attempts at pushing “equal time”and other ways of either limiting the teaching of evolution or forcing the teaching of creationism in public schools. These scientists and educators understand creationism, and have jumped all over any attempt by IDers to disguise old creationist arguments in new clothing. There are institutions, like the &lt;a href="http://www.natcenscied.org/"&gt;National Center for Science Education&lt;/a&gt;, that are effective watchdogs on anything even remotely creationist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the anti-materialists at the DI and elsewhere, attempting to push their wedge by targeting evolution ran up against a savvy and effective army of evolution defenders who were able to defend the integrity of science from this attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any predator, the anti-materialists are looking for easy prey. They are probing for a softer spot in the world of science to insert their wedge, and they think they have found it in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I will continue Part II of this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

That, although it's subtle, is a case of the phenomenon for which I have been using the (not exactly ideal) term  &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=276"&gt;nerdview&lt;/a&gt;. It is an example of a linguistically misleading communication in which the failure is not of grammar or meaning but of failing to keep in mind the viewpoint of the reader rather than the specialist (possibly nerdy) view of the writer.  Do you see why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you permitted to put cardboard in there only if it is mixed? Would a single piece, or a pair of pieces of cardboard of exactly the same type, be forbidden goods for that dumpster?  No, of course not.  That is the potential misreading.  You might not even notice it (though you should, because more serious instances of nerdview could cause airline disasters or fires, and probably have, in cases we don't even know about).  The point is that it is not us, the public throwing away packaging, who need to be told that the contents should only be mixed cardboard.  All we need to know is that we should put cardboard in there.  Putting in several pieces of exactly the same kind is fine; we do not have to ensure that it is mixed in any sense.  It may or may not turn out at the end of the day that there are mixed sorts in there.  If so, it is likely to be an unintended result of the collective actions of many of us not all throwing out the same kind of cardboard.  It is just a mistake to tell us we should put only mixed cardboard in there.  It signals a confusion about viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The view of the contents as "mixed cardboard" is the &lt;b&gt;recycling company's&lt;/b&gt; view.  To the people who place the dumpster and collect from it it might be relevant that the contents cannot be guaranteed to be all of one type — clean brown corrugated, white unwaxed, glossy printed, double-thick stiff packing, fat-contaminated pizza-box, or whatever types might concern them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "ONLY" in the sign indicates that the message is supposed to be for us (we should our individual little item in there if and only if it is made of cardboard); the "MIXED" indicates a confusion with the entirely different view taken by the recycler who deals with the stuff in bulk and should regard this as mixed cardboard materials.  Yes, it's a tiny point, and no harm done.  But it is illustratively useful. If you can see what I mean, you have begun to grasp the concept of nerdview.  As I said &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=276"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, the problem is that&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#AA0000"&gt; people with any kind of technical knowledge of a domain tend to get hopelessly (and unwittingly) stuck in a frame of reference that relates to their view of the issue, and their trade's technical parlance, not that of the ordinary humans with whom they so signally fail to engage. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They start out trying to write for us, and drift through inattention into unwittingly writing partly for themselves or their colleagues. The case noted above is fairly harmless (we can just ignore the word "MIXED").  But it betrays the viewpoint confusion that was there. Some cases of nerdview have much worse consequences, as in due course I will explain here in another post.  But that will be another day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[P.S.:  I classify my nerdview posts under "Lost In Translation" simply because I cannot see any other category that we use as more appropriate.  But the translation here is between thought and its linguistic expression.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

But when one reads marketing literature, a different consumer is encountered.  Often this consumer is an &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/marketing_autonomy_and_dignity.php"&gt;object to be manipulated&lt;/a&gt;; one who holds totally irrational ideas that must be shaped or corrected; one that has to be acclimated to changes, and managed to prevent revolt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One also encounters shockingly frank discussions of consumers' lack of sophistication in the literature.  This brings me to an &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122427233015845347.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in Monday's Wall Street Journal Report on marketing.  It was written by Madhubalan Viswanathan, Jose Rosa, and Julie Ruth, marketing professors at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Wyoming, and Rutgers (respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article discusses the problem of selling to indigent, low-literacy consumers in third world countries.  The authors explain that 14% of the American public is functionally illiterate, thus, a major segment of US consumers is also described.  How can retailers put this vulnerable group of consumers at ease, help them process product prices and discounts, and help them understand value?  This group faces challenges unimaginable in our lives.  I would love to paste the entire article.  Here are some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;CONCRETE THINKING

&lt;p&gt;One of the key observations we made is that low-literacy consumers have difficulty with abstract thinking. These individuals tend to group objects by visualizing concrete and practical situations they have experienced.  They exhibited what science would call a low grasp of abstract categories -- tools, cooking utensils or protein-rich foods, for example -- which suggests low-literacy consumers may have difficulty understanding advertising and store signs that position products that way...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists, what is a low grasp of abstract categories?  Aren't these categories socially constructed?  (The authors do hint at this.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It continues!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the most potentially detrimental results of concrete thinking, however, is the difficulty that low-literacy consumers have with performing price/volume calculations. They tend to choose products based solely on the lowest posted price or smallest package size, even when they have sufficient resources for a larger purchase, because they have difficulty estimating the longevity and savings that come from buying in larger volumes. Some base purchase decisions on physical package size, instead of reported volume content, or on the quantity of a particular ingredient -- such as fat, sodium or sugar -- but without allowing for the fact that acceptable levels of an ingredient can vary across product categories or package size.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This observation presents major public policy implications.  If a large segment of consumers are challenged by basic price/volume calculations, evaluating secondary characteristics of products would be next to impossible for them.  How can one obtain informed consent with these populations on any number of transactions--from computer licenses to privacy policies and credit card agreements? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;MISSPENT ENERGY

&lt;p&gt;We found that low-literacy consumers spend so much time and mental energy on what many of us can do quickly and with little thought that they have little time to base purchase decisions on anything other than surface attributes such as size, color or weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When shopping in unfamiliar stores, some low-literacy consumers will choose products at random, buying the first brand they see once they locate a desired product category or aisle. Others simply walk through the store, choosing items that look attractive based on factors such as packaging colors or label illustrations, without regard to whether they even need the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article concludes with a series of recommendations on how to reduce unease among this population, and help them better understand discounts and what they are purchasing.  If you have a subscription to the Journal, it's worth a read.  I'm fascinated by it, both as someone trying to understand consumer challenges, but also because of its description of the unuberman consumer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/selling_to_the_poors.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/429270138" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224739254890"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2008://2.4008">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7550c642b474c689</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biological complexity" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="dna" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="DNA"/><category term="kimura" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Kimura"/><category term="shannon" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Shannon"/><category term="genome" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="genome"/><category term="information" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="information"/><title type="html">Information content of DNA</title><published>2008-10-23T00:53:37Z</published><updated>2008-10-27T01:39:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/10/information-con.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information content of DNA is much harder to determine than merely looking at the number of base pairs and multiplying it by 2 to get the size in bits (remember that each site can have up to 4 different nucleotides, or 2 bits). However, this approach can provide us with a zeroth order estimate of the maximum possible information that can be stored in said sequence which for the human genome with 3 billion base pairs would amount to 6 billion bits or 750 Mbytes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, information theory shows that random sequences have the lowest information content and that well preserved sequences contain the maximum information content. In other words, the actual information content ranges from zero for totally random sequences to 2 bits for conserved sequences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at this is to compress the DNA sequence using a regular archive utility. If the sequence is random, the compression will be minimal, if the sequence is fully regular, the compression will be much higher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does one obtain a better estimate of the information content of DNA? By estimating the entropy per triplet (3 base pairs) which has a maximum entropy of 6 and for coding regions a value of 5.6 and for non-coding regions 5.82. This means that the information content for coding regions is 0.4 bit per triplet and for non-coding regions .18 bit per triplet. For 3 billion base pairs, or 1 billion triplets, this gives us an actual information content of 0.4 billion bits or 50 Mbytes  assuming the best case scenario that all DNA is coding or about 24 Mbytes if all the DNA is non-coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now how does this compare with evolutionary theory? In a 1960 paper “Natural selection as the process of accumulating genetic information in adaptive evolution”, Kimura calculated that the amount of information added per generation was around 0.29 bits or since the Cambrian explosion some 500 million years ago, on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; bits or 12.5 Mbytes assuming that the geometric mean of the duration of one generation is about 1 year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, Kimura reasoned that about 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; bits bits of information would be necessary to specify human anatomy.(Source: Adaptation and Natural Selection  By George Christopher Williams)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is this a reliable way to determine the information content of DNA? Perhaps not, and a better way is to take a large sample DNA from different people and determine for each base pair, how variable it is. A preserved site will have the maximum of 2 bits of information while a totally random site will have zero bits of information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is to understand how much information is contained by these ‘bits’. For instance, the total number of electrons is about 10&lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and finding one ‘preferred’ one’ amongst these&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;which&lt;/span&gt; translates to about 250 bits. This means that in 1000 generations, natural selection can achieve something far more improbable than this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Oct 26&lt;/strong&gt;: I have to take responsibility for not clarifying that my usage of information is based on Shannon’s theory of information according to which 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I(y)=H&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; - H(Y)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
where I(Y) is the amount of information, H(Y) is the entropy of the received sequence and H&lt;sub&gt;Max&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum entropy (basically the entropy of uniform distributed sequence). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/05/shannon-entropy.html" rel="external "&gt;Shannon entropy applied&lt;/a&gt; where I described how Shannon entropy is applied in biology with references to the work by Chris Adami and Tom Schneider. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do they give credit for it? Do they give &lt;em&gt;retroactive&lt;/em&gt; credit for it?&lt;/p&gt;

More on that later. Nor was I wrong about&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=738"&gt; James Wood's sneer at Sarah Palin's&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;"verbag&lt;em&gt;e"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. No more on that is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with respect to Anu Garg's A.Word.A.Day election special for "Palin", I completely blew it. After seeing &lt;a href="http://wordsmith.org/words/obambulate.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;obambulate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the AWAD resonance for "Obamba", I correctly predicted &lt;a href="http://wordsmith.org/words/bidentate.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;bidentate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the item for "Biden" (though I didn't register my guess in advance, and so don't deserve any any credit). But then I got cocky and &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=744"&gt;predicted &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;palinal &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;("Characterized by or involving backward motion, esp. of the lower jaw in chewing") for "Palin".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the "Palin"-oriented AWAD turns out to be &lt;a href="http://wordsmith.org/words/today.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;palinode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; "A poem in which the author retracts something said in an earlier poem". I would have been even more embarrassed if the word had been &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;palingenesis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; "Regeneration, rebirth; revival, resuscitation; Ontogenetic development characterized by the ordered recapitulation of inherited ancestral forms, with any innovation arising at the end of the sequence; The formation of new magma by the remelting of existing magmatic rocks".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I'm still stumped about what Anu will find for McCain.&lt;/p&gt;

It was reported on the local news, and &lt;a href="http://www.wgal.com/video/17666998/index.html"&gt;they’ve posted a video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t look like hail. Given the amount and size, I’m thinking it’s simply ice from an airplane, maybe some buildup on a wing that fell off. However, in the news segment, the woman and her husband speculate it might be a meteorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; doubt that. Really really. Ice is extremely fragile, and wouldn’t hit intact like that; it would break up or melt away long before it could hit the ground. In general, something that fragile would start off big, like school bus sized, then break up on its way down, showering down hundreds of pieces over a large area. However, the news report doesn’t mention any other such events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the ice looks fairly homogeneous, and not mixed up with rock. I’d expect a space traveler to be a bit more heterogeneous, though it’s maybe not out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all in all, I think they had an interesting event, but not an extraterrestrial one. I’m glad they saved some pieces; they’re being sent to a lab at York University for analysis. I’d recommend that anyway, but I strongly suspect the verdict will return a terrestrial origin for the night visitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, one more thing: the ice fell through the roof and hit the woman on the head in a glancing blow. She’s fortunate it didn’t hit her full on; it could have killed her. Instead, it raised a bump on her forehead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That must hurt! She should put some ice on it.&lt;/p&gt;

But a theme emerges, and I decided that this would make a good intermittent series: People with views that shouldn't still be prevalent in 2008, but are. &lt;a href="http://baptisthomeschooling.blogspot.com/2008/10/perilous-times-sodomites-in-school.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;For example&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The homosexual agenda wants people to think that homosexual men are safe for women to hang around and even be alone with. Nothing could be further from the truth. The stories about Sodomites in the Bible teach us that they do violate women as well as men. I've also known of people personally over the years who were known as gay yet "experimented" with the opposite sex. The term bisexual is an unnecessary distinction, because a faggot wants to defile anyone or anything he can get his hands on.

&lt;p&gt;A friend recently sent me this &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/10/13/gay.friendly.school/index.html"&gt;article about a "gay-friendly" high schoo&lt;/a&gt;l. If we were living in a biblical society, homosexuality would be punishable by death so such a school would be unnecessary. Although I'm against the special accommodations, perhaps this new trend of segregation will protect straight kids from these predators. With any luck, some radical will blow up the gay school. No, I'm not condoning vigilantism--I'm merely saying that it would be poetic justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/but_wait_theres_more.php"&gt;PZ&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2008/10/homosexual_agenda_revealed_by.php"&gt;Greg&lt;/a&gt;, among others, have already picked up on this, which is why I hadn't originally planned on linking to it, either. However, after I saw it, it occurred to me that it's just perfect as a continuation of the theme of "I can't believe people like this still exist." This homeschooling blogger, Raani Starnes, really does believe that homosexuality is evil and that the Biblical punishment for homosexuals is entirely appropriate because it's "in the Bible."

Today, &lt;em&gt;one in ten &lt;/em&gt;children has been diagnosed with an attention disorder and prescribed stimulants for treatment.  And this figure doesn’t include kids that have been prescribed antidepressants, antipsychotics, or sedatives.  In total, about 1,000 times more kids are on medication for mental disorders than were 50 years ago**.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have kids changed that much over the last 50 years?  Or are other factors at play?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the social landscape has changed over the last five decades.  Dual income homes are common now, and parents are often tired and stretched thin before even coming home to spend time with their kids.  The pharmaceutical industry is allowed to advertise, encouraging self-diagnosis and patient-initiated medical requests.  And the diagnostic criteria for mental disorders have been altered to include behavior once considered normal.  Is it possible that it isn’t &lt;em&gt;kids&lt;/em&gt; that have changed, but simply the environment in which today’s kids live?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, some children have legitimate disorders that are best addressed with medication.  &lt;strong&gt;But are we drawing the line in the right place, so that we are medicating only those that truly need it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time has now come to put up or shut up NoCal: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinking Skepchickally, San Francisco, Thursday, November 13, 2008.  7:00pm.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venue TBD.   (Recommendations welcome, my hotel’s close to Union Square.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’re closer to (my) home in San Diego, don’t miss the 2nd &lt;a href="http://geek.meetup.com/18/"&gt;San Diego Geek Bonfire&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow night.  Hosted once again by the gracious and swell &lt;a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/10/join_us_in_san.html;jsessionid=GHIAZJQHUT5XOQSNDLPCKH0CJUNN2JVN?queryText=mitch+wagner"&gt;Mitch Wagner from Information Week&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/people/Gina/posts/"&gt;Gina Trapani from LifeHacker.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be at both events, which I’m hoping you’ll see as incentive for attending. If not, I can also promise snowy white unicorns that juggle, five sets of identical twins, and a free dissected frog carcass for all who attend.  (Some of the above promised might not be supported by evidence come show time, but are nonetheless promised.)&lt;/p&gt;

I guess it’s interesting if you’ve never left the United States. But I don’t think this will surprise anyone who lives in Europe, travels outside the US, or who reads much foreign news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/41lyvplalkl_sl500_aa240_.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/41lyvplalkl_sl500_aa240_.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Contrary to the views of many conservative pundits and the Christian Right, the least religious countries in the world today are not full of chaos and immorality, but are actually among the safest, healthiest, most well-educated, prosperous, ethical, and successful societies on earth. Based on a year’s worth of research conducted while living in Scandinavia, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Society-without-God-Religious-Contentment/dp/0814797148/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1224697876&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Society Without God&lt;/a&gt; by Phil Zuckerman explores life in a largely secular culture, delving into the unique worldviews of secular men and women who live in a largely irreligious society, and explaining the reasons why some nations are less religious than others, and why religious faith doesn’t seem to be the secret to national success that so many claim it to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Most Americans are convinced that faith in God is the foundation of civil society. &lt;em&gt;Society Without God&lt;/em&gt; reveals this to be nothing more than a well-subscribed, and strangely American, delusion. Even atheists living in the United States will be astonished to discover how unencumbered by religion most Danes and Swedes currently are.

The Department of Education is no different from the others. Since numerous self-inflicted setbacks have left the No Child Left Behind effort with a less than positive heritage, today the Secretary released a report that includes dire warnings of impending doom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on the success of the administration’s past uses of what has come to be recognized as the “scare ‘em to death and they’ll do whatever we want strategy,” White House officials are now turning their attention to the grave dangers to the safety and well-being of our language. The cause of this immanent catastrophe is, of course, those pesky linguists, the libertarian destroyers of good usage who claim that, well, anything goes.  According to the report, “the language problem has now reached the crisis level and we are now experiencing a severe epidemic of bad grammar that will affect the very fiber of our nation.” The Secretary added, “an alarming number of children are suffering from the bad advice given by those socialist, left-wing, atheistic linguists and we just gotta do something about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing statistics that show that bad grammar can strike people of any age, race or ethnicity, her report goes on to say that even though a few adults and children may think their language is acceptable, they can always learn better grammar. “If your child, parent, colleague, friend, or spouse persists in error-making, let him or her know that he or she should get help,” advised the Secretary. “This is all of us’s problem,” she added. Referring to their mishandling of the past tense or to their pronoun gaffs as slovenly or uneducated and likening these to the speech of ignorant hillbillies are just two of the many effective methods that will encourage those suffering from this problem to seek treatment. &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=748"&gt;Responses&lt;/a&gt; from the linguistic community have already begun to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Secretary of Education has had a long-standing partnership with the &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2008/10/081020crbo_books_menand?currentPage=all"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; in their joint efforts to promote good English, she hints that the major key to solving this problem may be legislation. Congress is now contemplating a multi-billion-dollar bail out for the language crisis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Roger Shuy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224696414911"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/22/mccain-promises-nasa-money/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8299696db6789f5a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="NASA"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">McCain promises NASA money</title><published>2008-10-22T17:00:07Z</published><updated>2008-10-22T17:00:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/22/mccain-promises-nasa-money/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a speech at Florida’s &amp;quot;space coast&amp;quot; (the region near Cape Canveral and NASA’s Kennedy Space Center), &lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/10/17/mccain-promises-2-billion-to-help-nasa/?mod=googlenews_wsj"&gt;Presidential candidate John McCain said&lt;/a&gt; he would give NASA an extra $2 billion to fund the Shuttle-to-Constellation transition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s nice to hear. I’m pretty concerned over the next few years for NASA, and more money will help, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/09/27/obama-nasa-and-nobels/"&gt;though it cannot solve all the problems&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m not jumping up and down with glee over this, for a couple of reasons. One is the reason McCain gave for the need to pump up NASA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My friends, we just saw the Chinese. We saw them in space,” McCain told an afternoon rally of about 2,000 people. “We’ve got competition. We’ve got to stay ahead. We will be the first nation to Mars.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is absolutely 100% the wrong reason to do this. &lt;em&gt;It’s not a competition!&lt;/em&gt; I mean , of course it is to some extent, but if we get in the same Cold War mindset that led to Apollo, in 15 years we’ll be right back to where we are now: after an incredibly expensive race, all we’ll have are flags and footprints on the Moon or Mars and no sustainable access to space. We have to do this the right way, make sure we maintain our ability to achieve orbit and beyond, and move from very expensive, rare launches to more common, less-expensive ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racing the Chinese is a waste of money. Cooperating with them, cooperating with the other space-faring nations, means we all win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’m not thrilled with a swipe McCain took at Senator Obama:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always been a strong supporter of manned space flight and NASA,” he said in a community that is home to many in the field. “If I’m elected president I won’t cut NASA funds like Sen. Obama.” McCain aides noted that Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, had promised to pay for education programs by delaying the Constellation space program, which is meant to fill the gap to the next space vehicle, only to backtrack later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Obama did say that… a year ago. Since then he has educated himself on the importance of what NASA does, and how it ties in with other aspects of government (international cooperation, our public face, and so on). Obama has said several times that he supports NASA, and in fact has also promised a similar amount of money to keep NASA going during the Shuttle/Constellation gap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So McCain once again has said something that is at best misleading, and is better characterized as a lie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as an aside, as BABlogee Robin Ferguson pointed out to me, if McCain is elected, Sarah Palin is the titular head of NASA. Hmmmm. I’ll add that we survived four years of Dan Quayle, so I suspect that NASA would somehow muddle through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while I am loathe to believe campaign trail promises, the good news to remember here is that both candidates appear to be supporting NASA. The realities of a recession and a massive national debt may change that, but if the President supports NASA that’s better than the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224695106628"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/can_i_get_funding_to_torture_s.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aaf2fd87c301cbba</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Can I get funding to torture students?

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;n a bizarre experiment, academics at The Oxford Centre For Science Of The Mind 'tortured' 12 Roman Catholics and 12 atheists with electric shocks as they studied a painting of the Virgin Mary.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They found that the Catholics seemed to be able to block out much of the pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except, of course, for a few problems with the experiment. First, an atheist like me would find being afflicted with Catholic iconography would be a &lt;i&gt;compounding&lt;/i&gt; of the torture. They did try to control for that by also having subjects contemplate a Renaissance portrait of a woman with no overt religious connection (although, as we know from stories of Catholics around the world, they will call a grease stain blob a portrait of the Virgin Mary, so this seems ineffectual) — it had the same effects, making the Catholics more resistant while leaving the atheists unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we&amp;#39;re talking about some kind of placebo effect, though, it is not surprising that atheists would not find a picture floating before their face to be a palliative — they would not expect an image to have any effect, so the placebo effect would not kick in. Big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more significant flaw, though, is that the results of the experiment are entirely drawn from subjective self-reporting of pain. The Catholics may be &lt;i&gt;saying&lt;/i&gt; they feel less pain while feeling the same amount simply because they are accustomed to lying while surrounded by Christian paraphernalia. The less gullible atheists were trying to accurately report their sensations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course some religious leaders see this as an affirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were welcomed by the Anglican Bishop of Durham, the Rt Rev Tom Wright, who said: 'The practice of faith should, and in many cases does, alter the person you are.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
'It can affect the patterns of your brain and your emotions. So it comes as no surprise to me that this experiment has reached such conclusions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interpretation would be that belonging to a faith means you have already been selected for a weakness to being impressed by the superficial and trivial. And sure, beliefs and imagination and thoughts will change the activity of your brain — because that&amp;#39;s all they are, is products of the brain. Bishops probably shouldn&amp;#39;t welcome this conclusion, because it suggests that the mind is a product of material causes, and the absence of supernatural phenomena should put them out of a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case anyone would like to argue that the suggestibility demonstrated in this experiment is an advantage to Catholics, allowing them to better resist pain, I suggest a variation: hang a picture of Satan in front of them and see if it makes them more susceptible to report enhanced sensitivity to pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; &amp;gt;… the prescriptivist normally cares deeply about how people talk,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt;and it grates when language usage departs from the model that they&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt;support. The descriptivist is just interested in finding out how&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt;people actually do talk. Any &amp;quot;agenda&amp;quot; is unconscious, and the  ideal&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt;descriptivist, like any ideal scientist, really wants to  know what&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt;is going on and is willing to modify the model on the  basis of&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt;evidence.  For the prescriptivist, the model was  carved into stone&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt;tablets by God. The prescriptivist doesn&amp;#39;t care  how people *do*&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt;talk, but about how they *should* talk.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;this is roughly the usual caricature of the distinction, as seen from  a  decidedly "descriptivist" point of view.  and the caricature is encouraged by the all-too-human tendency to see things in terms of two  opposed forces.  but, as a great many people have pointed out, the  distinction arises from two values, *both* of which almost everyone  subscribes to:&lt;br&gt;
1. variety is a good thing.&lt;br&gt;
2. shared  norms are a good thing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;extreme positions are obtained by minimizing one of these at the expense  of the other, but most people take some more complicated, mixed position,  sacrificing one value in some contexts, the other value in other contexts.   (few modern scholars, even the most hard-line "descriptivists", are  willing to say that all variant spellings in english are fine, so long as  they either conform to generalizations about the system or have the  justification of tradition.  there are costs on either side - the time  cost to readers of coping with huge numbers of variants, the time cost to  learners in having norms enforced.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;these two values tend to attract others - reliance on the voice of the  common person vs. deference to institutions and authorities, embracing  change vs. resisting it, celebration of the idiosyncratic vs. suspicion  of it, appeal to individual experience vs. reasoning from a priori  principles, and many others.  that is, there are resonances among these  values that tend to produce opposed ideologies, but in principle there are  many different positions, and most scholars hold complicated, nuanced  positions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;it's ok to trot out the ten-second dichotomist text when you've got only  ten seconds and other fish to fry, but this is not a simple matter of Good  vs. Evil (or any other of your favorite oppositions). and i say this as  someone way over on the "descriptivist" end. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224689600909"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/do-good-newspapers-make-good-congressmen/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d2c20b0341501e59</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="congress"/><category term="government"/><category term="Media"/><category term="newspapers"/><category term="politics"/><title type="html">Do Good Newspapers Make Good Congressmen?</title><published>2008-10-22T14:54:28Z</published><updated>2008-10-22T14:54:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/s_ftRhrbr74/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/do-good-newspapers-make-good-congressmen/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Press coverage often does hold politicians accountable - on the local level at least. 
That's according to a new working paper by David Stromberg and James M. Snyder Jr.
They found that congressmen from districts with newspapers that aggressively cover local politics tend to work harder to represent the interests of their constituents. 
Such congressmen are [...]

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="5"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tesco-careers.com/home/about-us/visions-and-values/every-little-helps"&gt;Every little helps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Denise showed it to me on the back of a till receipt, and at first I misread it as "Every little bit helps".  (Recall the song title &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Little_Bit_Hurts"&gt;Every Little Bit Hurts&lt;/a&gt;.) Then I saw that the head noun &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; wasn't there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British students seem inclined to accept this phrase — possibly because they've been seeing it on bags and till slips for years (Tesco is still a mostly UK company).  But there seems to be an isogloss here (a boundary between dialects determined by the use of some particular word or phrase), with me and Denise on one side and possibly (we don't know yet) most British speakers on the other. What does seem clear is that this is not a productive or extensible pattern.  You just can't get away with other noun phrases formed, like &lt;em&gt;every little&lt;/em&gt;, from a determinative and an adjective.  You really can't say *&lt;em&gt;Every big is desirable&lt;/em&gt;, or *&lt;em&gt;Each generous gets us closer to the goal&lt;/em&gt;.  The phrase &lt;em&gt;every little&lt;/em&gt;, considered as a noun phrase, has to be some kind of special sui generis construction. It's not just a regular normal deployment of determinative and adjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying you can never make a noun phrase with a determinative and an adjective; you certainly can make some, like &lt;em&gt;the rich&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;the unthinkable&lt;/em&gt;.  (No, &lt;em&gt;rich&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;unthinkable&lt;/em&gt; are not nouns.  The argument is left as an exercise for the reader.)  There is even such a noun phrase using &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; as the adjective, namely &lt;em&gt;a little&lt;/em&gt;.  But notice that *&lt;em&gt;the little&lt;/em&gt; is not a well-formed noun phrase.  (&lt;em&gt;A little goes a long way&lt;/em&gt; is a sentence of English, but *&lt;em&gt;The little went a long way&lt;/em&gt; is not.)  The point is that &lt;strong&gt;there are only certain special noun phrase constructions of the form determinative + adjective&lt;/strong&gt;.  *&lt;em&gt;Every rich&lt;/em&gt; is not a noun phrase.  Nor is *&lt;em&gt;all unthinkable&lt;/em&gt;.  And for at least me and Denise, *&lt;em&gt;every little&lt;/em&gt; is no better than they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are quick learners, and we will recognize the phrase from now on, so we can follow what Tesco is talking about.  We are not complaining. But the phrase seems to be a small extension of our language, rather than a pre-existing part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#009900"&gt;[Update: Some of the comments below reveal that the origin of the phrase has nothing to do with Tesco, since &lt;i&gt;every little&lt;/i&gt; has been established as a noun phrase for hundreds of years.  So the odd fact here is that in three decades of hearing British English before my departure for the USA, I never noticed it or used it, and arrived at my present maturity still finding it ungrammatical to my ear.  Let me add that there was some repetition and arguing and ill-tempered complaining in the comments below as of 4 a.m. Language Log time, and I have spend some of the late hours of the night shift deleting some of the clutter.  If your comment was a snippy complaint or repeated something or was clearly confused or was wildly irrelevant or was overtaken by events, don't be too surprised to find it gone.  One of the comments I did not delete despite my disagreement with it, from Mollymooly, says that the phrase is merely a proverb, and "There are no generalisations to be drawn or lessons to be learnt. Everybody move along, now."  I couldn't fail not to disagree less.  This is not a proverb, and anyway proverbs can teach us things about syntax.  And from my quick look at this case, I have learned that the complexities of the syntax of the word &lt;i&gt;little&lt;/i&gt; are much greater than I thought.  It is an adjective but also a determinative; it can participate in modifier-head fusion (see &lt;a href="http://www.cambridge.org/uk/linguistics/cgel"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cambridge Grammar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pp. 410ff on that), but only with various odd restrictions on what the determiner is, and those restrictions are not the same in all dialects.  That's a lot to learn from having an undergraduate show me a supermarket till receipt!]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

It just gets more and more insane. It seems that while &lt;a title="Jim Bramlett @ inJesus.com" href="http://www.injesus.com/index.php?module=message&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;MID=CB007FA2&amp;amp;GroupID=2A004N9G&amp;amp;label=&amp;amp;paging=all"&gt;McCain's side knows how to do 'spiritual warfare', Obama has all the witches on his side&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minutes ago I spoke with friend Dr. Norman G. Marvin, M.D. and he is so concerned at what he has learned about Barack Obama's family in Kenya that he is calling a special prayer meeting in his home to pray against the witchcraft curses attempted by them against John McCain and Sarah Palin.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Marvin sent me the below e-mail from Flo Ellers. Flo is credentialed with the International Fellowship of Ministries which is based in Washington State. She is also a member of EndTime Handmaidens and Servants of Jasper, Arkansas. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
IF YOU KNOW HOW TO DO SPIRITUAL WARFARE, PLEASE PRAY TODAY AND CONTINUALLY THAT ALL SUCH CURSES BE BROKEN AND SATAN'S PLAN FOR AMERICA BE DEFEATED, IN JESUS' NAME. PRAY AND COVER MCCAIN AND PALIN WITH THE BLOOD OF CHRIST. IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DO SPIRITUAL WARFARE, IT IS TIME YOU LEARN!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days ago, I listened to a 9-6-08 message by Bree Keyton, a young woman evangelist who had just traveled to Kenya and visited Obama's home village and what she found out about his relations with his tribal people was chilling. And his "cousin" Odinga was dreadful. She said the witches, warlocks and those involved in satanism and the occult get up daily at 3 a.m. to release curses against McCain and Palin so B. Hussein Obama is elected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Pssst. McCain supporters. Here&amp;#39;s the secret to winning the election: stay home for the next few weeks praying nonstop. &lt;i&gt;Especially&lt;/i&gt; when the polls open up in November, you &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; stay on your knees calling on your god the entire day. Otherwise, the witches will get us.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/oh_noes_spirchul_warfare.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/428578665" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224686060186"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8317659032924518627.post-3425608589025878886">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d16d3a5f0c7cff34</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Book Review: Myth of the Oil Crisis</title><published>2008-10-22T13:36:00Z</published><updated>2008-10-22T13:36:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://evilutionarybiologist.blogspot.com/2008/10/book-review-myth-of-oil-crisis.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://evilutionarybiologist.blogspot.com/" type="html">I was pretty skeptical when I received Robin Mills Myth of the Oil Crisis because Peak Oil makes intuitive sense.

&lt;p&gt;That might surprise some doctors who may have thought that these new treatments might be safer than traditional chemical-based medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what I dislike here the use of the term "chemical-based medicine." After all, all medicines are chemical-based, because they are chemicals. It's just a pet peeve of mine. I realize what the writer is referring to is the new generation of drugs, which have been referred to as "biologicals." A lot of these new drugs are antibodies against specific biologically active proteins generated through monoclonal antibody and recombinant DNA technology. The idea is that they would be more specific and have fewer side effects because they target usually only one protein. At least, that's the idea. Perhaps there was a bit of naivete among physicians in believing that these drugs would be less likely to pop up with unexpected toxicities after release, but such was the hype surrounding this new class of drugs that this belief was widespread. It wasn't entirely unjustified, either. A lot of these drugs are incredibly precise in their effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if there's one thing biology teaches us, it's that interfering with the function of even a single protein can have unexpected and wide-ranging effects. Because our understanding of the biology is nearly always incomplete, the extent of such side effects and adverse reactions are often difficult to predict. Indeed, the tendency of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to cause stomach bleeding is not immediately obvious from their mechanism of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious, I looked up the study referenced in the news report above. Coming from a group of Dutch researchers, the study was published in the&lt;em&gt; Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/em&gt; and is entitled &lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/300/16/1887"&gt;Safety-Related Regulatory Actions for Biologicals Approved in the United States and the European Union&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/targeted_drugs_not_as_targeted_as_hoped.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/targeted_drugs_not_as_targeted_as_hoped.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/428555732" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224683224323"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v5/?p=891">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3d130e43cba982a4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Comments bug fixed</title><published>2008-10-22T12:20:42Z</published><updated>2008-10-22T12:20:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v5/2008/10/comments-bug-fixed/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Sorry to everyone who couldn’t comment without registering - I’ve fixed this now and everyone should be free to comment as they wish (except you filthy spammers!).</summary><author><name>Frank the SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224683224316"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1576">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8fc8f3dd320e3ed5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Memo to Bob and Suzanne Wright</title><published>2008-10-22T07:03:07Z</published><updated>2008-10-22T07:03:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/428291461/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Kev</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224683224316"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v5/?p=883">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4e215e7927104bf9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Beautiful robotic jellyfish</title><published>2008-10-21T22:34:36Z</published><updated>2008-10-21T22:34:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v5/2008/10/beautiful-robotic-jellyfish/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">It seems almost cruel to call this a ‘robotic’ jellyfish - graceful, sweeping movements and floating through the air are not characteristics we associate with robots.  But here it is, a beautiful, airborne, robot jellyfish.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[P]rofessional linguists, almost universally, do not believe that any naturally occurring changes in the language can be bad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a representative of the species, I can testify that this is false. Rather, we believe that moral and aesthetic judgments about language should be based on facts, not on ignorant and solipsistic gut reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it's precisely ignorant and solipsistic gut reactions that tend to dominate discussions of English usage, and so linguists and other sensible people are forced to spend time trying to clear things up. This sometimes leads to the false impression that we have no stylistic opinions or grammatical judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, last week I commented on the discussion of "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=738"&gt;Verbage&lt;/a&gt;" by Prof. Menand's fellow literary critic and New Yorker staffer, James Wood. Now in fact, I'll join Mr. Wood (and my &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=741"&gt;fellow linguist Geoff Nunberg&lt;/a&gt;) in recommending against pronouncing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;verbiage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as [ˈvɚ.bɪdʒ], or using it to mean "The manner in which something is expressed in words".  But Mr. Woods treated this as Gov. Sarah Palin's "coinage", and wrote that "It would be hard to find a better example of the Republican disdain for words than that remarkable term, so close to garbage, so far from language". In contrast, I took the trouble to do 30 or 40 seconds of research, and discovered that the &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/4/V0060400.html"&gt;American Heritage Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; gives both her pronunciation and her meaning as secondary options, without any usage note, as does &lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/verbiage"&gt;Merriam-Webster&lt;/a&gt;; and that the Oxford English dictionary traces the meaning "Diction, wording, verbal expression" back to Wellington in 1804, and forward through the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geoff Nunberg, who was the chair of the AHD usage panel, &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=741"&gt;expresses the opinion&lt;/a&gt; that the lack of a usage note in this case was an error; and on balance, I agree with him.  But that doesn't excuse Mr. Wood's childish egocentrism, which assumes without checking that "This isn't how I pronounce or use this word, so it must be wrong; and I don't recall having seen this before, so it must never have happened before". Nor does it excuse his magazine's characteristic failure to exercise its duty to check the facts of language in the same way that it checks facts of biography or geography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Menand's little poke at David Crystal was shorthand for a larger argument, which we've discussed many times here on Language Log. For example, in "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004231.html"&gt;Amid this vague uncertainty, who walks safe?&lt;/a&gt;" (2/23/2007), I quoted this passage from an Op-Ed by Alex Rose:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;This conflict lies at the heart of the so-called “Usage Wars,” the epic battle between the “Descriptivists” and the “Prescriptivists.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;To a Descriptivist, there are no such things as “correct” or “incorrect” where language is concerned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;There is only the multi-faceted spectrum of human communication and the myriad ways in which people convey meaning to one another. Descriptivists correctly note that language, like etiquette or fashion, is largely a function of class; a society’s official rules of grammar and lexicon reflect the attitudes of whoever happens to be in power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The Prescriptivists, however, believe that language is as much an art form as a utility. It’s one thing to name objects and command that traffic laws be obeyed, another thing to express oneself with clarity, precision and cultivation. It’s the difference between playing a scale and playing a sonata; between eating for nourishment and eating for pleasure. One way gets the job done, the other gets it done well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In untangling the confusions in this passage, it's hard to know where to start.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Let me decline to enlist on either side of this concocted War of the &amp;#39;Scriptivists, and speak instead on behalf of a third group: the Rational People. We believe in making value judgements about language use: some writers are better than others, and even good writers sometimes make poor choices and outright mistakes. But we also believe in the value of facts, both about linguistic history and about current usage. We&amp;#39;re unwilling to accept the assertions of self-appointed linguistic authorities about what is &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; in standard formal English, if these assertions conflict with the way that the best writers write. We understand that vernacular forms of English are not faulty or degenerate approximations to the formal standard — instead, they&amp;#39;re just, well, vernacular. We&amp;#39;re willing to accept, as Horace was, that new words and structures, and new uses of old words and structures, can be a valuable addition even to the most formal linguistic registers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In a nutshell: we don't worship our own prejudices, and we're more curious than censorious. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;There&amp;#39;s a characteristic psychological dynamic here. People like Mr. Rose see a bit of writing or talk that irks them. They&amp;#39;re not interested in analyzing the problematic usage, tracing its history, looking at its contemporary distribution and its relationship to other phenomenon, exploring the nature of their own reaction to it — no, they just want to make those people stop, dammit. And they want the rest of us to join them in howling at the miscreants. If we suggest a more temperate investigation, or dare to question whether a crime has been committed at all, they turn their wrath on us as well. In fact, our analytic detachment seems to annoy them even more than the object of their jihad does.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more of the same, you can sample the list of links to Language Log Classic from that same post, given below, or look at our recent posts filed under the category of "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?cat=5"&gt;Prescriptivist Poppycock&lt;/a&gt;". (Perhaps we really ought have a counterbalancing category "Descriptivist Dumbness", or a simple superordinate "'Scriptivist Silliness"; but alas,  it's harder to find good examples of nonsense from the descriptivist side.)&lt;/p&gt;

What is even more ironic is that Religulous outperformed Expelled from the opening weekend with half the theatre count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the Director of Borat, Larry Charles, the studio that brought us Fahrenheit 9/11 and Comedian Bill Maher comes a &lt;a href="http://www.lionsgate.com/religulous/" rel="external "&gt;hilarious comedy&lt;/a&gt; which allows us to look into a mirror and smile at ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
His “Religulous,” directed by Larry Charles, is an entertaining, funny, angry, thought-provoking journey from the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Via Dolorosa, the Qumran Caves, to Stonehenge, Habibi Ana (and a Moslem Gay bar), the Vatican, the Holy Land Experience Park in Florida, the U.S. Capitol, Mormon Tabernacle, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everywhere, Maher is asking a few simple questions: What do you believe, why, and how can you possibly…? Half Catholic, half Jewish, and fully agnostic, Maher is incredulous, in every sense of the word, but curiously warm and gentle asking questions about the “the final battle between intelligence and stupidity that will decide the future of humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A friend recently sent me &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/10/13/gay.friendly.school/index.html"&gt;this article about a "gay-friendly" high school&lt;/a&gt;. If we were living in a biblical society, homosexuality would be punishable by death so such a school would be unnecessary. Although I'm against the special accommodations, perhaps this new trend of segregation will protect straight kids from these predators. With any luck, some radical will blow up the gay school. No, I'm not condoning vigilantism--I'm merely saying that it would be poetic justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If this is your first time here, have a look around. You’ll probably find both stuff you like and stuff you disagree with. I encourage you to comment on either or both. I’m all about the rational discourse here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="50%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I just like linking to pretty pictures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2008/phot-37-08.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3007/2962776134_69bfc94725_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to describe it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the nebula Gum 29, a vast cloud of gas surrounding the cluster Westerlund 2. If that cluster sounds familiar, then you are a major BA geek: I’ve written about it in the past &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2005/03/25/astro-round-up/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/02/07/gamma-rays-from-monster-stars/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a beefy cluster: if you added up all the stars, they would mass 100,000 times that of the Sun! There is also a star deep in the heart of the nebula that is actually a binary, two stars orbiting each other (you can see them better &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2008/images/phot-37b-08-normal.jpg"&gt;in this image&lt;/a&gt;). Called WR20a, each of the two stars has more than &lt;em&gt;80 times the mass of the Sun!&lt;/em&gt; That’s near the upper limit of what a star can be, so having two orbiting each other is incredible. A binary like this may be unique in the entire Milky Way galaxy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both stars will blow up soon. That’ll be a pair of pretty big bangs when they do. Happily, at 26,000 light years distant, they’re too far away to hurt us (they’d have to be within about 100 light years or so to do anything to us; I have all the gory details in my book — take a look to your right in the blog sidebar), but close enough that they’ll make an incredible show. But it may take a few thousand more years before they pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image was taken using &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2008/pr-37-08.html"&gt;the European Southern Observatory’s 2.2 meter ’scope in La Silla, Chile&lt;/a&gt;. It’s more or less &amp;quot;true color&amp;quot;, though it also used a filter which picks out warm, glowing hydrogen gas to emphasize the nebula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there’s lot of science that can be squeezed from this image: how stars are born, how they die, how their cocooning gas behaves during all this, how clusters affect the way stars are born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all very cool. But sometimes, just sometimes, I like to just look at the pretty pictures. &lt;/p&gt;

After all, the largest providers of personal information to the government now are big marketing companies, like Acxiom and Choicepoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a more base level, I thought privacy may be instrumental in fostering autonomy and shielding individuals from (what I believe to be) the indignities that marketing perpetuates on our culture (think &lt;a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/electronic-publications/stay-free/admap/howardgossage.html"&gt;billboards&lt;/a&gt;, for instance).  This is a very difficult argument to make.  Many see it as cultural elitism, an attempt to engage in censorship or the like.  But sometimes, marketers themselves make the argument for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122427109679945225.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; written by two professors of marketing at UNC's business school published in the Journal Report yesterday.  It discusses how to get through to consumers who increasingly try to tune out advertising messages.  I think that some of these practices are gross; some of them are right out of &lt;a href="http://www.gotchacapitalism.com/"&gt;Gotcha Capitalism&lt;/a&gt;.  Dr. Balasubramanian and Dr. Bhardwaj suggest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Consider a series of billboards along a busy interstate proclaiming the approach of a business, but not really saying what the business does. To find out what the business is all about, travelers have to take an exit off the highway. While some may be disappointed with what they find and may not plan a second visit, there are always millions more of the uninitiated coming down the highway. This technique has been used to good effect by South of the Border, a Mexican-themed shopping and food cluster on I-95 near the border of the Carolinas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if your business sucks really bad, you can use vague brand advertising to trick people into visiting it.  Congratulations.  What's next, professors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Goodyear Tire &amp;amp; Rubber Co., for example, has teamed with Adidas AG on a range of motorsport-inspired driving and sports shoes. The soles of these shoes are made of rubber with tread patterns designed by Goodyear. If customers viewed the shoe purely as an Adidas product, Goodyear&amp;#39;s contribution would remain unnoticed. However, the Goodyear brand is prominently displayed on the outsoles of the shoes. The result is that every person wearing the shoes is now a messenger for the Goodyear brand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we really care about "Goodyear's contribution," we should wear advertisements for the company?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this not suggest that these people think the public are just morons?  People to be painted upon with logos?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professors, share some more strategy with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Successful marketing messages excite customers not only when they first encounter them -- they ingrain themselves into the customers' permanent memory. Once a message is embedded, customer resistance to processing it drops when it is encountered in the future.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goes directly to my point out autonomy.  "Embedding" messages?  Reducing "consumer resistance?"  This reads like a scientology manual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, professors, why not commodify some cultural objects, to make life less meaningful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cough-drop maker Ricola AG, which uses herbs cultivated in the Swiss Alpine regions for its products, invokes the image of the Alpine mountains and meadows in its advertising, which often features herders who harmoniously sing out the word "Ricola" into open, echoing meadows. The singing is accompanied by the blowing of an alpenhorn -- a long, curved wooden wind instrument with a distinctive, booming sound that was used by Swiss herders to call their cows from the pastures. The company has employed the sound and the imagery with such remarkable consistency that today, for many people, the sound of the horn alone is sufficient to invoke the rich imagery and heritage associated with the brand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If economics is the dismal science, what kind of science is marketing?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/marketing_autonomy_and_dignity.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/427915879" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224627041074"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/even_its_promoters_havent_seen.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8a4281f88004ac2b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Even its promoters haven't seen it</title><published>2008-10-21T22:31:11Z</published><updated>2008-10-21T22:31:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/427905604/even_its_promoters_havent_seen.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/even_its_promoters_havent_seen.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The horrible &lt;a href="http://expelledexposed.com"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Expelled&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is now available on DVD.

The court has now held an adversarial hearing on the matter and has issued a &lt;a href="http://www.gpwa.org/news/Kentucky.vs.141.Internet.Domains.pdf"&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt; confirming its &lt;i&gt;ex parte&lt;/i&gt; order. Most of the opinion is devoted to other issues, such as the question of whether domain names are property and whether the Kentucky court has jurisdiction, but the question of whether domain names are "gambling devices" as defined in the statute is briefly addressed at pp. 22-25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't easy for me to analyze the court's argument on this point because I'm not sure that I understand it. A major component of the court's error appears to be the mistaken belief that domain names are analogous to the keys to a building. This is of course false: the true analogy is that a domain name is an alias for the address of a building, as I explained in my previous post. Even if the court's analogy were valid, domain names would still not be gambling devices: they would be analogous to the keys to the casino, not the slot machines and roulette wheels whose seizure the statute authorizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second component of the court's decision is the view that the statute need not be interpreted literally, that what is important is its spirit, not the letter of the law. While one can certainly agree with this sentiment as a view of what constitutes justice, it is a dubious principle of legal interpretation. In any case, even if one admits such a principle, the question arises as to how far from the literal interpretation one may go. In my opinion, treating a domain name as a device is too great a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the court appears to address the argument that the statute requires that for a device to be seized it must be a "gambling device", that is, a device specifically designed for gambling. As I pointed out in my previous post, domain names are not designed specifically for gambling anymore than computers are, in contrast to the machines at which the statute is clearly aimed, such as slot machines. If I understand the court's argument, it is that the specific domain names chosen by the gambling sites are designed for gambling, e.g. that if a casino chooses a domain name like "texasholdem.com", that domain name refers to gambling and is intended to attract clients interested in playing poker. In other words, the court takes the design requirement to apply not to the class of devices but to individual devices. That is not how I would read it, but it may be a valid interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, while the court gives a colorable argument that the domain names satisfy the statute's requirement that the seized devices be designed for gambling, it fails to give a satisfactory argument that domain names are devices of any sort.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bill Poser</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224624117048"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/21/death-in-the-skies/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/81bb3db86ee78133</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="DeathfromtheSkies!"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Death *in* the Skies??</title><published>2008-10-21T21:00:54Z</published><updated>2008-10-21T21:00:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/21/death-in-the-skies/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;OK, I have a chapter about alien invasion, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rZ0y-rbznk"&gt;but I never expected this&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

I accidentally typed freakonomcs.com this morning.
Amazingly, there is something there. The content is actually pretty funny. 
I can't believe it was worth someone's time to set it up, but I think that about many things on the internet.
Hopefully, this post will have made it worth the person's time.

Larry and Debbie Skelf believe (apparently) that they have a petrified human brain. In a press release they state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bizarre rock, owned by Larry and Debbie Skelf, was just a sentimental token until about two years ago when research began on it.&lt;br&gt;
“It was given to my mother, Eddie Mae Hodge, by uncle Luther Hodge, in Tullahoma Tennessee, forty years ago. Since mom passed away in 1986, I just called it my pretty brain rock. Since then, we often used it as part of different ornamentations”  Debbie states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rock, now certified to be a petrified human brain, is no longer a table ornament. It has been examined by many leading U.S. scientists, including acclaimed Neuro Anatomy&lt;br&gt;
Professor Dr. Suzanne Vincent, Oral Roberts University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where to begin?  Go to their &lt;a href="http://www.petrifiedhumanbrain.com/home.html"&gt;dedicated website&lt;/a&gt;, and you will find a classic example of not just pseudoscience, but what Richard Feynman calls “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science"&gt;cargo cult science&lt;/a&gt;.” The term “cargo cult” refers generally to the phenomenon of a native pre-technological tribe or community coming into contact with a non-native technological society, and then using rituals and magical thinking to control the cargo spirits or gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This derives originally from the people of New Guinea who observed planes dropping supply cargo during World War II. They were later found to have built control towers and runways out of bamboo and grass, hoping to summon the sky spirits to drop their magical cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bamboo mock ups of a landing strip has the same relationship to actual aviation as creationism has to genuine science. It has the outward superficial form, but lacks the actual mechanics or any understanding of how it works. While reading the petrified human brain website you have the distinct impression that these people are as likely (or less likely) to do real science as the New Guinea natives were to summon cargo planes to drop them cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the love the jargon they throw around - clearly designed to obfuscate and impress, rather than inform. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No data available for purpose of  disclosure at this time.&lt;br&gt;
Entire specimen  mineral, not rock,  bio chemical sedimentary propagated by chemical sediments resulting from the precipitation of ions in water , forming silicate crystals. This was further precipitated by the action of an organ of a formerly living creature. Typical lithification fossilization process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first line refers to the fact that they have no idea where the rock came from. If it were a petrified human brain it would be reasonable to expect that it was associated with a human skull, or at least some other human remains.  We would also like to date the strata, see if it was geologically undisturbed, what other fossil animals it contains - you know, all that sciency stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “fossil” that was kept as a memento for forty years without any idea of where it came from is of dubious scientific value, even if it is a real fossil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second sentence is just geological babble, probably lifted without comprehension from a website or textbook. No evidence is offered to justify the mineral classification of the specimen. Also, the analysis contains the conclusion (again, without any justification or evidence) that it is a “typical” lithification process from living tissue. Yet, the site also states that “Fact is, nobody knows for sure how any natural fossil was created.” - so then what is a “typical lithification process” if nobody knows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site then descends from the ridiculous to the bizarre. I don’t want to reproduce the pictures without permission, so just visit the site (first link above) and look at the picture in the upper right corner of the page. That, it is claimed, is a scan through the middle of the specimen. The claim is made that this has a remarkable similarity to a human brain with “all the parts in the right place.” Compare that to the CT scan of an actual human brain below - it looks nothing like a human brain. There are no sulci or gyri, there are no ventricles, there are no midline structures - there is nothing that can be clearly related to a specific piece of brain anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the holes in middle left of the piece (in the shape of a frown) they would claim are the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles (fluid filled spaces inside the brain), but their shape is all wrong, and these holes exist entirely in the left “hemisphere” of this rock, rather than symetrically in both hemispheres. The two halves of the rock themselves are very asymetrical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the outside of the rock &lt;a href="http://www.petrifiedhumanbrain.com/TopPhoto.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  This is just a lumpy rock that happens to have a cleavage roughly down the middle, without anything that resembles a brain. The human brain doesn’t just have squiggles (gyri), it has a very specific pattern of gyri that can be identified and named and are organized into different lobes. No real anatomy is apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farther down they label parts of a section through the spinal cord - but they are just hallucinating, as surely as &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/wp-admin/Percival%20Lowell"&gt;Percival Lowell&lt;/a&gt; hallucinated canals on Mars.  It’s truly laughable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say that they should have had some real scientists take a look at the rock before embarrassing themselves with a website, but apparently they did. Unfortunately, they chose a bunch of creationists who were blinded by their enthusiasm. Dr. Shipley is quoted as saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More anatomy, I spent several years in medicine before obtaining my Doctorate in Theology. When I reviewed the x-rays of the rock and different brains, I chose incorrectly which was which!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Dr. Shipley, then you are an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Skelf, who obviously hand-picked his “experts” to give a predetermined opinion, now declares that his rock is “confirmed” as a fossilized brain.  He challenges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless they can disprove these medical experts, then they must rely on them biologically and on petrology as to the viability of the correct minerology for this to be a fossil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I don’t have to rely upon your panel of biased incompetents. The rock shows no specific anatomical features of a brain, nor any features that would confirm it is a fossil of any kind. It’s a rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the point of all this? Here’s a clue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fact is, nobody knows for sure how any natural fossil was created.&lt;br&gt;
Nobody knows for sure how long it takes.&lt;br&gt;
Nobody has ever witnessed it.&lt;br&gt;
We can only confirm or deny on sheer speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also have to love this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the largest part of geology is theory which by definition is&lt;br&gt;
unprovable and not disprovable, the theories  of  how this, or&lt;br&gt;
coprolites,  came into being are also not provable or disprovable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really - by definition theories are not disprovable? Actually, by definition a scientific theory must be disprovable, it must be something upon which evidence and reason can act.  Clearly Skelf thinks that science is all about “sheer speculation” - and that no one really knows how fossils form, therefore all those fossils scientists keep digging up could be from a young Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire purpose of this fossil brain charade is to attempt to drag real paleontology down to speculation and unfalsifiable “theory.” Therefore, this half-baked nonsense about a human brain fossil is just as good as anything the scientists have to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skelf and his phony experts are attempting to build a bamboo runway and tower of pseudoscience, and then use them to wave the cargo planes of science over to their primitive island. Or at least they wish to distract the planes off course so that the public will not get their cargo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That has been richly demonstrated over the last few years, particularly with her gauzy, praise-filled segments featuring such pro-woo luminaries as Jenny McCarthy, her frequently having physicians boosters of "alternative medicine" like Mehmet Oz and Christiane Northrup on her show, and her tight embrace of New Age "spirituality."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alarmed at the antivaccination nonsense being pushed on Oprah's show, &lt;a href="http://ecbt.org/"&gt;Every Child By Two&lt;/a&gt; has been circulating an e-mail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please Take The Time To Contact &lt;em&gt;The Oprah Winfrey Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been quite some time since Every Child By Two (ECBT) has asked you to take action on an issue related to immunizations.  I write to you today with an urgent request for your assistance in reaching out to the Oprah Winfrey Show to urge that she dedicate a show to the science behind the question of whether vaccines cause autism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than fourteen credible studies have been conducted worldwide exonerating vaccines and yet the media and entertainment industry continue to frame this as a debate.  ECBT and our public health partners have reached out to Oprah's producers countless times without success.  However, I recently had a lengthy conversation with one of the producers who recommended that we initiate a letter writing campaign by commenting within the Oprah.com feedback section of the website.  This information is tabulated to determine whether there is enough interest to conduct follow up shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I urge you to take five minutes to fill out the Oprah Winfrey Show online form by following the link below.  In your comments, please request that Oprah invite credible scientists and/or physicians to explain the science of vaccines to her viewers. We also would like her to invite parents who have suffered the loss of a child from a vaccine-preventable disease, and a parent of an autistic child who can speak on behalf of the many families that are frustrated over the continued focus on vaccines and their supposed link to autism and the therapies that focus on "repairing vaccine damage".  Please relate any personal experiences you may have with vaccine-preventable diseases or autism.  In addition, please refer the Oprah Winfrey Show to Amy Pisani, Executive Director of Every Child By Two, for any follow-up questions.  My phone number is (860) 443-1166.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, please forward this to your family and friends and request that they also reach out to the Oprah Winfrey Show.&lt;/p&gt;

We know it’s out there, and we even have a decent grasp of what it’s doing, but, maddeningly, we don’t know what it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know what it isn’t. It isn’t cold gas, or dead stars, or rogue planets (seriously), or mini black holes. There’s a long list of things it might be, and most of those items have been checked off. All that’s left are weird particles that are only theoretical. We think they might exist, but our particle detectors and accelerators haven’t turned them up yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are trying, though! In the LHC there is a special detector set up to look for dark matter. There are also other detectors spread out around the world looking for some sort of interaction of dark matter with normal matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Update: in this next paragraph, I originally had mistaken the Picasso group doing this work with the entire Observatory; I was corrected in the comments so I have fixed this paragraph.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such detector is in Canada. Or, rather, below it. The &lt;a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/"&gt;Sudbury Neutrino Observatory&lt;/a&gt; is an astronomical observatory located over a mile underneath the Canadian landscape. Shielded by solid rock, detectors there are designed to look at subatomic particles from space such as neutrinos, ghostly particles created during some particle interactions. In fact, a detector at SNO &lt;a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/articles/bahcall/"&gt;was crucial in solving the Solar Neutrino Mystery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it turns out &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/10/16/dark-matter.html"&gt;they may help solve the dark matter mystery as well&lt;/a&gt;! Basically, &lt;a href="http://www.ipp.ca/Program/PICASSO.html"&gt;the Picasso group at SNO&lt;/a&gt; is trying to detect one kind of proposed dark matter particle (a weakly interacting massive particle, or WIMP). The problem is, the signal from such a particle looks a whole lot like the signal they get from an everyday alpha particle — the nucleus of a helium atom, which is a common radioactive decay product. Differentiating between the two is really, really hard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, scientists with Picasso now think they’ve figured out a way to distinguish them: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we looked at our calibration data taken with neutrons and compared them with our alpha background data we saw a peculiar difference which we attributed first to some detector instabilities or gain drifts in our electronics,” said experiment spokesperson Viktor Zacek of the University of Montreal in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However when we checked the data and refined the analysis the discrimination effect became even more pronounced,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like trying to hear a friend (a WIMP) talking to you in a noisy bar, when someone else with a similar voice (an alpha particle) is shouting next to you. This new technique will allow scientists to essentially filter out the similar voice, allowing them to hear their friend’s voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this isn’t an actual detection of a dark matter particle, it’s a nice solid step in that direction. Remember, scientific progress isn’t usually just waking up one day and realizing you’ve overthrown the leading paradigm. It’s usually a series of small progressions, a journey of a thousand steps. Each movement forward is important, and when taken in total, they take you along the path to your goal: understanding the Universe. Lots of people say it’s not the goal, it’s the journey that’s important. While I think this goal is pretty important, in this case the journey itself can be cool, too.&lt;/p&gt;

Perhaps the most well known one is that Congress, in passing the CAN-SPAM Act, decided to exempt political messages from any forms of legal accountability.  And so the only practical limit on political spam is the public's willingness to shame candidates.  Here's an example worth shaming, sent on to me by a colleague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get political spam from McCain, and want to &lt;a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/unsubscribe/"&gt;opt out&lt;/a&gt;, here are your options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mccain.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/mccain.jpg" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that all of them imply that you support or have supported McCain!  They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I am a McCain Supporter but don't wish to be contacted until closer to the election.&lt;br&gt;
-I am a McCain Supporter but I am receiving too many emails. Please only send me newsletters and urgent alerts.&lt;br&gt;
-I am a McCain Supporter but do not wish to receive email any longer.&lt;br&gt;
-I am no longer a McCain Supporter and want to be taken off the email list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should add an option for me that reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I never signed up for your stupid email list. I never supported you, except when you passed McCain-Feingold, and I'd vote for Tina Fey before Sarah Palin.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODAY:&lt;/strong&gt; Tuesday, October 21: I’m doing a live TV news interview at Denver’s &lt;a href="http://www.9news.com/"&gt;KUSA&lt;/a&gt; (Channel 9) at 12:20 or so p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODAY:&lt;/strong&gt; Tuesday, October 21: I’ll be at &lt;a href="http://www.boulderbookstore.com"&gt;the Boulder Bookstore&lt;/a&gt; tonight at 7:30 to give a short presentation with a dramatic reading from the book. I’ll have a meteorite to show people, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODAY:&lt;/strong&gt; Tuesday night/Wednesday morning, October 21: I’ll be on &lt;a href="http://www.coasttocoastam.com/"&gt;Coast to Coast AM with George Noory&lt;/a&gt; from 2-5 a.m. Eastern time — check your listing. &lt;a href="http://www.coasttocoastam.com/info/wheretolisten.html"&gt;Lots of radio stations broadcast the show&lt;/a&gt; (it has 10 million listeners) and many stream it live as well.&lt;/li&gt;

The British Humanist Association, with the support of Richard Dawkins, has raised nearly £30,000 to place atheist posters on the side of buses. This is to counter the recent rash of religious advertising on buses, and I think it’s a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the slogan they have chosen, “&lt;strong&gt;There is probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life&lt;/strong&gt;” is poor. &lt;em&gt;(edit: thanks for the correction, guys)&lt;/em&gt; It’s preachy, and preachy doesn’t sell any more. That’s why religion has had to resort to advertising on buses. It’s patronising, and no-one likes that. It’s aggressive, and aggressive campaigns are not only high-risk, they’re niche audience. I do this sort of thing for a living, and my professional opinion is that the slogan is counter-productive and plays into the hands of those who offer a nice cup of tea and eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure who this is aimed at, but I don’t think it’s going to do what the BHA intends, which is a shame.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>tkingdoll</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224606134620"><id gr:original-id="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/10/field-notes-from-a-nature-conservancy-meeting/langswitch_lang/in">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7f996f1c2abc0d38</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Communicating Climate"/><category term="Reporting on climate"/><category term="Climate Science"/><title type="html">Field notes from a Nature Conservancy meeting</title><published>2008-10-21T16:14:48Z</published><updated>2008-10-21T16:14:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/10/field-notes-from-a-nature-conservancy-meeting/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to attend a three-day meeting of the &lt;a href="http://www.nature.org"&gt;Nature Conservancy&lt;/a&gt; last week in Vancouver.  I was there with my &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org"&gt;RealClimate&lt;/a&gt; hat on, to offer ideas and insight on blogging in particular, and public communication of science in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at the conference, I had a rare chance to see some of the inner workings of one of the world's largest and most successful environmental organizations (this was an invite-only conference, and only a handful of us were other than Nature Conservancy staff and trustees).  The Nature Conservancy has a reputation of being very non-partisan, and this was abundantly evident at the conference: There were representatives present from the Shell Oil Company, from the Christian Coalition, from Environmental Defense.  This broad level of buy-in of Nature Conservancy goals is perhaps not surprising, given that the main thing this organization is known for is its method of protecting land: buying it.  Neither free-market boosters (if there are there any remaining) nor lefty environmentalists have any trouble with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was news to me, though, was the extent to which the Nature Conservancy is also working towards influencing policy on climate change.  Getting serious about climate policy is no longer a partisan issue in the U.S.: both John McCain and Barak Obama are on record for supporting cap and trade carbon markets.   But one might well ask what climate policy has to do with the buy-the-land-to-protect it method of the Nature Conservancy.  As I learned at the conference, there are two rationales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the Nature Conservancy has a strongly &lt;a href="http://www.nature.org/tncscience/"&gt;science-based policy&lt;/a&gt; for making land-purchasing decisions.  They take into account things like the minimum viable ecosystem size in determining which acquisitions will actually have lasting impact.  Trouble is, for many areas, the conditions those decisions are based on may change.  Areas near sea level are an obvious example.  But so are the more than 10,000 acres of native tallgrass prairie that they have &lt;a href="http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/kansas/preserves/"&gt;protected in Kansas&lt;/a&gt;.  How much will that ecosystem change with the projected changes in precipitation in this region?  Obviously, the Nature Conservancy is taking into account such projections, as best they can.  But they have also decided that the risks of climate change to the world's ecosystems are too large to simply adapt to: hence their interest in helping to push governments to enact policies that will help mitigate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it turns out that the Nature Conservancy&amp;#39;s mission is — and has always been — much broader than is widely recognized.  As they note on their &lt;a href="http://www.nature.org/aboutus/howwework/"&gt;mission statement page&lt;/a&gt; they can&amp;#39;t possibly buy all the places they want to protect.  To achieve their mission — &amp;quot;to preserve the plants, animals and natural communities that represent the diversity of life on Earth by protecting the lands and waters they need to survive&amp;quot; — they will clearly have to do something much bigger.  The buzzword here is &lt;i&gt;sustainability&lt;/i&gt;, and the nature Conservancy is now launching what they call their &lt;a href="http://www.nature.org/aboutus/campaign/features/art26102.html"&gt;Campaign for a Sustainable Planet&lt;/a&gt;.  This means a serious focus not just on direct ecosystem protection but also on sustainable development.  International sustainable development goals, of course, are impossible to separate from international energy policy.  And one cannot today talk about energy policy without talking about climate policy.  It is therefore quite logical for the Nature Conservancy to be drawn into weighing-in on climate policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what does this have to do with RealClimate?  Well, the Nature Conservancy is interested in expanding their web-based communication toolbox.  They already have a great deal of information on their web page: see for example their article on climate change adaptation, &lt;a href="http://www.nature.org/initiatives/climatechange/features/art26188.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; but they&amp;#39;d like to do more.  And in particular, they are interested in getting more information out there from their scientists.  As I already pointed out, The Nature Conservancy — which has over 700 full time scientists working for it — prides itself on being strongly &lt;i&gt;science-based&lt;/i&gt;.  So do we here at RealClimate (read our &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/welcome/"&gt;welcome page&lt;/a&gt;).  Unlike us, whose day jobs are to produce and broadly disseminate scientific results (through teaching and publication), Nature Conservancy scientists don't necessarily publish their work.  There is no doubt a lot of really interesting and important work being done that doesn't get out to many other scientists, let alone the general public.  A blog, or something like it, could provide those scientists with a place to talk about their work.  Hence my attendance at the meeting, to offer a bit of advice and perspective.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at RealClimate, we look forward to seeing where Nature Conservancy goes with this, and wish them best success in their efforts.  [Watch this space for an announcement, if and when they launch something.]  For my part, I&amp;#39;ll be especially enthusiastic if the Nature Conservancy doesn&amp;#39;t limit itself to talking about its various projects around the world (interesting as those may be).  What I&amp;#39;d really like to see is a site that provides their perspective on some of the more difficult — but really important — questions in the area of climate change impacts.  How much danger are polar bears in, really?  How will agriculture in Asian monsoon regions be affected?  What are the broader effects of ocean acidification (beyond the immediate impact on coral reefs)?   The Nature Conservancy won&amp;#39;t be the last word on this — any more than RealClimate is.  But their perspective, from field scientists &amp;quot;on the ground&amp;quot;, could prove extremely valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One additional thought.  In several of the sessions I attended at the Nature Conservancy meeting, reference was made to the need to stabilize global temperature rise at no more than 2°C, and correspondingly to stabilize CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels at no greater than 450 ppm (strictly speaking, this should be 450 ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-radiative-equivalent; there is a big difference, and it is often neglected).  In each case, reference was made to the IPCC reports as the source of these numbers.  Yet these numbers really don't derive from the IPCC, which (rightly) shied away from being policy prescriptive.  Rather, they have their origin in a small number of documents, notably the 1995 report of the &lt;a href="http://www.wbgu.de/wbgu_sn1995_engl.html"&gt; German Advisory Council on Global Change&lt;/a&gt;, papers related to the  Exeter conference on &lt;a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/research/dangerous-cc/index.htm"&gt;"avoiding dangerous climate change"&lt;/a&gt; and in European Union Council decisions (see the 1996 and 2006 Presidency Conclusions &lt;a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=432&amp;amp;lang=EN&amp;amp;mode=g"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  Clearly, the 2°C/450 ppm numbers have completely permeated the policy-advocacy realm.  Yet while they are arguably derivable from the IPCC reports, it is actually not clear to what extent the larger scientific community really believes these are the right numbers.   There simply has not been a process to evaluate this that compares in depth and breadth with the IPCC.  A new and much more comprehensive analysis, by a much greater group of scientists, would be valuable at this juncture.  Scientists are fond of saying that they cannot summarize their projections with a small handful of simple numbers, but simple numbers are what are being discussed in policy circles.  If the "right" numbers are really so low as Jim Hansen believes (see our post on this, &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/04/target-co2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), then the Nature Conservancy has an even more difficult task ahead.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*[For those interested in slogging through it, there's a video of our session, &lt;a href="http://www.conexmeeting.org/ht/d/sp/i/713/pid/713"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It's not just about me.  There is also some really interesting stuff from Nature Conservancy staffer Jonathon Colman and from the folks who started the conservation clearinghouse and collaboration websites &lt;a href="http://www.conservationyellowpages.org"&gt;www.conservationyellowpages.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.wiserearth.org"&gt;wiserearth.org&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a demonstration (not altogether successful) of the emerging virtual reality conferencing technology which (when it works) might help all of us travel to conferences less often.  &lt;b&gt;A word of advice&lt;/b&gt;: skip all this and instead take a look at the Keynote lectures, by far better orators than me: &lt;a href="http://www.conexmeeting.org/ht/d/sp/i/1832/pid/1832"&gt;Mark Tercek, Nature Conservancy CEO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.conexmeeting.org/ht/d/sp/i/1833/pid/1833"&gt;Jerome Ringo, Apollo Alliance President&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.conexmeeting.org/ht/d/sp/i/1925/pid/1925"&gt;CARE C.O.O. Steve Hollingworth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people emailed me a ridiculous article on CNN’s site about what your zodiac sign says about your job. Because journalism is dead, CNN allows an advertiser (in this case, CareerBuilder.com) to hire a bonehead (in this case, Rachel Zupeck) to write an “article” that is really just a platform for promoting the business. Well guess what, CareerBuilder.com? Now thousands of rational people know you support bullshit, and will instead use Craigslist the next time they need a new job. Suck it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to link to the article, but first, I’d like to propose a fun game. CareerBuilder (CB) issued a survey, took the results, and confused correlation and causation. In other words, if the survey showed that slightly more people who are Virgos like to surf for porn at work, CB decided that must mean these people like to get pervy on the clock because they are Virgos. Never mind that all those people may have something else in common that is the actual cause of their porn-habit, like, say, not getting enough hugs from Dad as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, the results were split up by zodiac sign and then vomited into this “article.” I’ve taken the key career traits of each sign, removed the name of the sign, mixed them up, and printed them after the jump. Read through, and then comment below with the description you think matches you, along with what your sign really is. Then, you can click through to the article to see how close you were. Come back and tell us how you did. Be honest! It’s more fun that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Most XXX affirmed working in government, construction, hotel/recreation and education, according to the survey. As assertive, outspoken, confident and dynamic people, those choice professions should speak well to their characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX’s need a profession that keeps them motivated and interested — no two days at work should be the same. XXX from the survey reported working such jobs as art/design/architecture, nursing and personal care, sales, law enforcement, firefighting and machine operation — all of which are right up XXX’s alley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independent, humane, innovative, unconventional and visionary are all adjectives that describe XXX. Jobs suited for these character traits include astronomy, photography, aviation and computer technology. XXXs who responded to the survey reported holding jobs in sales, military, engineering, mechanics, food preparation, facilities management and transportation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX are diplomatic and sociable — they need human interaction in order to be happy in a career. They are also easy-going, cooperative and are able to reach a compromise easily. Taking all of these factors into consideration, XXX from the survey are on course as they work in government, social work, advertising, machine operation, law enforcement, firefighting, sales and education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX are spiritual, positive and ethical; they also love to travel and learn new skills. Editing/writing, marketing/public relations, entertainment, hotel/recreation, IT and military, the careers reported in the survey, are all fitting for XXX.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX are persistent, responsible and dogmatic; they thrive in positions of power and where you can apply your common sense. XXX reported working in art/design/architecture, nursing, science, IT, sales, farming and food preparation, which are all fitting to this zodiac.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX are empathetic, caring, unselfish and spiritual, which combine well with healing or compassionate professions like health care, social work or philanthropy. XXX in the survey are on the right track, reporting working in such careers as social work, personal care, IT and facilities management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX are reliable, practical and honest; they are methodical and work well in teams. Additionally, these folks like jobs that deal with artistic or extravagant things. Compatible professions include jobs in finance, accounting and interior design. Nursing, engineering, law, marketing, public relations and higher education also fit the bill for jobs attuned to XXX — good thing those are jobs they reported in the survey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX are energetic, kindhearted, imaginative and protective. Their personalities usually fare well in law, psychology, teaching or nursing. Survey respondents said they worked in government, legal services, advertising, higher education, machine operation, transportation and military, all of which are in line with XXX personality traits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analytical, intuitive and resourceful, XXX are drawn to mystery and all things complex and abnormal. Occupations well-matched to this personality are in science, investigation or politics. XXX from the survey said they work in such careers as legal services, engineering, science, education, construction and skilled trades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX are detail-oriented with a passion for knowledge and meaning. Careers that require accuracy and research are well-suited to these folks. Some professions XXX reported in the survey included social work, sales, editing/writing and food preparation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX have a true lust for power and leadership. They are confident, optimistic and charismatic — they have no problem winning people over with their charm. Government, legal services, art/design/architecture, engineering, entertainment, real estate and education, are all areas suited for XXX; luckily those are the professions reported in the survey, too.&lt;/li&gt;

Because journalism is dead, CNN allows an advertiser (in this case, CareerBuilder.com) to hire a bonehead (in this case, Rachel Zupeck) to write an “article” that is really just a platform for promoting the business. Well guess what, CareerBuilder.com? Now thousands of rational people know you support bullshit, and will instead use Craigslist the next time they need a new job. Suck it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to link to the article, but first, I’d like to propose a fun game. CareerBuilder (CB) issued a survey, took the results, and confused correlation and causation. In other words, if the survey showed that slightly more people who are Virgos like to surf for porn at work, CB decided that must mean these people like to get pervy on the clock because they are Virgos. Never mind that all those people may have something else in common that is the actual cause of their porn-habit, like, say, not getting enough hugs from Dad as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, the results were split up by zodiac sign and then vomited into this “article.” I’ve taken the key career traits of each sign, removed the name of the sign, mixed them up, and printed them after the jump. Read through, and then comment below with the description you think matches you, along with what your sign really is. Then, you can click through to the article to see how close you were. Come back and tell us how you did. Be honest! It’s more fun that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Most XXX affirmed working in government, construction, hotel/recreation and education, according to the survey. As assertive, outspoken, confident and dynamic people, those choice professions should speak well to their characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX’s need a profession that keeps them motivated and interested — no two days at work should be the same. XXX from the survey reported working such jobs as art/design/architecture, nursing and personal care, sales, law enforcement, firefighting and machine operation — all of which are right up XXX’s alley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independent, humane, innovative, unconventional and visionary are all adjectives that describe XXX. Jobs suited for these character traits include astronomy, photography, aviation and computer technology. XXXs who responded to the survey reported holding jobs in sales, military, engineering, mechanics, food preparation, facilities management and transportation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX are diplomatic and sociable — they need human interaction in order to be happy in a career. They are also easy-going, cooperative and are able to reach a compromise easily. Taking all of these factors into consideration, XXX from the survey are on course as they work in government, social work, advertising, machine operation, law enforcement, firefighting, sales and education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX are spiritual, positive and ethical; they also love to travel and learn new skills. Editing/writing, marketing/public relations, entertainment, hotel/recreation, IT and military, the careers reported in the survey, are all fitting for XXX.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX are persistent, responsible and dogmatic; they thrive in positions of power and where you can apply your common sense. XXX reported working in art/design/architecture, nursing, science, IT, sales, farming and food preparation, which are all fitting to this zodiac.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX are empathetic, caring, unselfish and spiritual, which combine well with healing or compassionate professions like health care, social work or philanthropy. XXX in the survey are on the right track, reporting working in such careers as social work, personal care, IT and facilities management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX are reliable, practical and honest; they are methodical and work well in teams. Additionally, these folks like jobs that deal with artistic or extravagant things. Compatible professions include jobs in finance, accounting and interior design. Nursing, engineering, law, marketing, public relations and higher education also fit the bill for jobs attuned to XXX — good thing those are jobs they reported in the survey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX are energetic, kindhearted, imaginative and protective. Their personalities usually fare well in law, psychology, teaching or nursing. Survey respondents said they worked in government, legal services, advertising, higher education, machine operation, transportation and military, all of which are in line with XXX personality traits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analytical, intuitive and resourceful, XXX are drawn to mystery and all things complex and abnormal. Occupations well-matched to this personality are in science, investigation or politics. XXX from the survey said they work in such careers as legal services, engineering, science, education, construction and skilled trades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX are detail-oriented with a passion for knowledge and meaning. Careers that require accuracy and research are well-suited to these folks. Some professions XXX reported in the survey included social work, sales, editing/writing and food preparation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XXX have a true lust for power and leadership. They are confident, optimistic and charismatic — they have no problem winning people over with their charm. Government, legal services, art/design/architecture, engineering, entertainment, real estate and education, are all areas suited for XXX; luckily those are the professions reported in the survey, too.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to research astronomer Phil Plait, the sky is full of danger, with seemingly endless varieties of calamities waiting to befall us.  In &lt;em&gt;Death From the Skies!: These Are the Ways the World Will End&lt;/em&gt;, Plait tackles these disaster scenarios with a healthy dose of humor and an easy, conversational tone that turns these bleak and often unfathomable topics into fun and interesting lessons on astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a situation that the HuffPo has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/a_science_section_for_the_huffington_pos.php"&gt;maintained&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/04/the_huffington_post_and_vaccines.php"&gt;the present day&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, on that day three years ago, I noticed that, right in among posts written by such mercury militia antivaccine apologists such as &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby" rel="nofollow"&gt;David Kirby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr" rel="nofollow&amp;quot;"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, there was also &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt;, who is currently very unhappy at having had a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/dr_jay_gordon_pediatrician_warrior.php"&gt;taste of not-so-Respectful Insolence yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, HuffPo's been so utterly, consistently bad that I've &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/a_science_section_for_the_huffington_pos.php"&gt;even ridiculed the very suggestion&lt;/a&gt; that it could ever have a credible science blogging presence. &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arthur-allen/"&gt;Arthur Allen&lt;/a&gt; and the occasional other voices of reason about vaccines just weren't enough to balance out the die hard antivaccine loons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after that roll call of anti-vaccine shame, whom could the HuffPo possibly add that would continue its tradition of catering to the antivaccine fringe? Who could join David Kirby, RFK, Jr., Deirdre Imus, and all the rest of the merry band of antivaccinationists there, as well as other varieties of woo-meisters, like Deepak Chopra?&lt;/p&gt;

Urban England seems like a strange place to start such a campaign; rural America needs it more, although the costs would be significantly greater, as they'd have to cover the replacement cost of all the buses that were set on fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can donate, too. The campaign opened just today, and their goal was to raise £5500 — I&amp;#39;m amused to see that they reached that goal by 10am the very first morning, and now have £17000, and the number keeps going up.&lt;/p&gt;

And one outlet for the high spirits is a really interesting slogan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started last Thursday, with a caller from Delaware on the XM Radio show &lt;em&gt;Baseball This Morning&lt;/em&gt;, who seems to have intended to &lt;a href="http://www.redsoxconnection.com/whynotus.html"&gt;borrow a slogan from the Red Sox&lt;/a&gt;, but added his own morphosyntactic twist (as &lt;a href="http://www.the700level.com/2008/10/on-the-xm-radio.html"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; on The 700 Level blog):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Boston did it. The White Sox did it. Why can't us? Why can't us!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest, as they say, is history, including a line of &lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.com/609design/6082920"&gt;T-shirts and other merchandise&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=30944943659"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;,  numerous blog posts ("&lt;a href="http://deadspin.com/5064575/overexcited-phils-fan-creates-grammatically-challenged-rally-cry"&gt;Overexcited Phils Fan Creates Grammatically Challenged Rally Cry&lt;/a&gt;", 10/16/2008; "&lt;a href="http://www.the700level.com/2008/10/why-cant-us-mov.html"&gt;Why Can't Us Movement is Spreading&lt;/a&gt;", 10/17/2008; etc.), and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The slogan neatly captures a certain, well, lack of a sense of entitlement, not to say bitterness and cynicism, that&amp;#39;s characteristic of Philly sports fans, and to some extent of the city itself. And all of the coverage assumes — and even celebrates — the idea that the slogan is grammatically incorrect, as a sort of self-subverting emblem of this attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here at Language Log, when it comes to grammar, we don&amp;#39;t complain, we explain. And if I didn&amp;#39;t have a meeting to get to, I&amp;#39;d explain what I think is going on in this case. Meanwhile, enjoy the resonant concision of this little gem of folk poetry…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224593592275"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=745">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/295ad81a0e689b7d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linguification"/><title type="html">Linguification and the myth of progress</title><published>2008-10-21T12:21:57Z</published><updated>2008-10-21T12:21:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=745" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that many of you will be wondering whether Language Log has been keeping up with the spread of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguification"&gt;linguification&lt;/a&gt;. We have, of course.  Teams of interns are combing the periodicals and amassing huge quantities of data that we do not really know what to do with (the data may all be eventually turned over to &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=683"&gt;Melvyn Quince in the Surveys department&lt;/a&gt;).  But just to assure you that we are keeping up with developments, let me show you the beginning of an article that recently appeared in an important UK magazine (and I should note that the article was actually written by a senior lecturer in creative writing — whom I will not embarrass by naming):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#AA0000"&gt; Among the dirty words in arts and humanities departments these days, "progress" is one of the dirtiest.  No one would dream of using it without irony or the qualifying phrase "myth of" as a prefix.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To check this, our in-house textual scientists did a Google search on &lt;tt&gt;progress&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;myth of progress&lt;/tt&gt; limited to UK academic sites (&lt;b&gt;.ac.uk&lt;/b&gt;), and these were the results:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border="" cellpadding="3"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;progress&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align="right"&gt;2,790,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;myth of progress&lt;/tt&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align="right"&gt;103&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any questions about that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won't confuse you with heavy statistical tests and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values here.  No calculus will be presupposed.  But in brief, the data show the hypothesis advanced in the quoted claim to be not just false but so overwhelmingly false that hypotheses as false as this hardly ever turn up in empirical science. Academic web pages containing &lt;i&gt;myth of progress&lt;/i&gt; make up 0.0037% of those containing the word &lt;i&gt;progress&lt;/i&gt;.  That leaves an awful lot of occurrences to be explained away as ironic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible that the linguified claim might do better if more specific searches were done on sites focusing on arts and humanities subjects, getting rid of the scientists and administrators; we have several interns working on that right now. I rather think it is just busywork, and they would be better employed washing coffee mugs in the Senior Writers' Lounge here at Language Log Plaza.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, I am not objecting to this strange figure of speech — this replacing of a possibly true claim about progress (something like &amp;quot;humanities academics tend to take a dim view of the notion of progress&amp;quot;) by a wildly false one about words (that the word &lt;i&gt;progress&lt;/i&gt; is never employed in its literal sense without the phrase &lt;i&gt;myth of&lt;/i&gt; immediately preceding it).  And I am not saying I cannot understand what the author meant.  I simply cannot see what desirable effect this rhetorical device could possibly be thought to achieve, or why the author should have chosen to make his point in such a strangely inept way, by transmuting it into what is (almost certainly) a staggeringly false claim about word token distributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;MEANING:&lt;br&gt;
verb tr.: To walk about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;ETYMOLOGY:&lt;br&gt;
From Latin ob- (towards, against) + ambulare (to walk). Ultimately from the Indo-European root ambhi- (around) that is also the source of ambulance, alley, preamble, and bivouac. The first print citation of the word is from 1614.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;USAGE:&lt;br&gt;
"We have often seen noble statesmen obambulating (as Dr. Johnson would say) the silent engraving-room, obviously rehearsing their orations."&lt;br&gt;
The Year&amp;#39;s Art; J.S. Virtue &amp;amp; Co.; 1917.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Anu promised more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;This week I have selected five words that appear to have been coined after this year&amp;#39;s presidential candidates (Obama, Biden, McCain, and Palin). These are all 100% dictionary words — they have been in the language even before these candidates were born.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, predictably, today's entry is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://wordsmith.org/words/bidentate.html"&gt;bidentate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (with its echo of "potentate", better than &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bidental&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; would have been).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm fairly confident that one of the remaining two will be &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;palinal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; ("Characterized by or involving backward motion, esp. of the lower jaw in chewing"), though there is some support out there for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;palindrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. But I can't think of anything plausible for "McCain". I mean, there's &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macanese&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; ("Of or relating to Macao"), and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meccan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mechanism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and so on, but none of these seem either orthographically or topically appropriate. Predictions? Ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[OT, I'm somewhat skeptical that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;obambulate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is always or even usually transitive, though this is more on the basis of analogy than any experience with the word, which I'm pretty sure I've never read or seen. The three examples in the OED are all intransitive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1614-15&lt;/strong&gt; J. BOYS &lt;em&gt;Wks.&lt;/em&gt; (1622) 597 Soules departed..doe not obambulate and wander vp and downe, but remaine in places of happinesse or vnhappinesse. &lt;strong&gt;1633&lt;/strong&gt; EARL OF MANCHESTER &lt;em&gt;Al Mondo&lt;/em&gt; (1636) 100 In the interim the Soule doth not wander and obambulate. &lt;strong&gt;1694&lt;/strong&gt; P. A. MOTTEUX &lt;em&gt;Wks. F. Rabelais&lt;/em&gt;(1737) v. 231 We..must still obambulate, Sequacious of the Court.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't occur in LIterature Online. There are only two hits in EEBO. One of them is in Blount's 1661 &lt;em&gt;Glossographia&lt;/em&gt; ("&lt;em&gt;Obambulate &lt;em&gt;(obambulo)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to walk against another, or about, to range or stray over"), where no examples are given, though the gloss does suggest transitive uses. The other is the OED's first citation, John Boys' 1615&lt;em&gt; An exposition of the festiuall epistles and gospels vsed in our English liturgie together with a reason why the church did chuse the same&lt;/em&gt;, where the fuller context confirms its intransitivity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Again, that al soules departed are in certaine receptacles vntill the generall iudgement, they do not &lt;strong&gt;obambulate&lt;/strong&gt; and wander vp and downe, but remaine in places and states of happinesse or vnhappinesse, either in the hands of God, or in the Deuils prison: and therefore all the daies of our life, but especially at the houre of our death, it behooueth vs to say and pray with S. Steuen, &lt;em&gt;O Lord Iesu receiue my spirit&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google books turns up a sort of usage note, in the context of another lexicographical joke, in &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8EK0R5fvsg0C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes and Queries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ("Medium of Inter-Communication for Literary Men, Artists, Antiquaries, Geneologists, Etc.") for January-June 1860:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Everyone knows the story of Dr. Littleton's introducing "condog" into his Latin &lt;em&gt;Dictionary&lt;/em&gt; as the equivalent of "concur," but it may not be equally well known that he was not the original inventor of the joke. In Cockeram's curious little &lt;em&gt;English Dictionary&lt;/em&gt; (a copy of the sixth edition of which, dated 1639, is now before me,) I find &amp;quot;concurre&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;condog&amp;quot; given as convertible with &amp;quot;agree&amp;quot;. Now, as the earliest edition of Cockeram was probably published fifty years before Littleton (which first appeared in 1678), a singular difficulty occurs. Could the learned Doctor have stolen this valuable discovery from Cockeram, and then basely covered the theft by fabricating the story about his boy, &amp;amp;c.? And another difficult question is this: How came the original inventor to hit upon the discovery? Had he a boy to help him? I pause for a reply to these momentous questions; but before I close, I may mention that our friend Cockeram anticiapted to some small extent another idea of modern times — that so ably carried out by Dr. Roget in his &lt;em&gt;Thesaurus&lt;/em&gt;. The second part of his Dictionary consists of a list of common words, explained, as he says, "by a more refined and elegant speech," by the use of which a person not satisfied with saying to his friend, "If you'll allow me I'll wake you early, and then we'll take a walk together," might refine his speech as follows: "If you'll approbate, I will matutinally espergefie you, and then we'll &lt;strong&gt;obambulate&lt;/strong&gt; together." This is absurd enough, but notwithstanding there are some very interesting matters n Cockeram. I should be greatly obliged by any information about the author himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absurd or not, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;obambulate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is clearly intransitive in this example as well. And I'm sorry to say that 148 years later, there is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Henry+Cockeram&amp;amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search"&gt;no entry for Henry Cockeram&lt;/a&gt; in Wikipedia. ]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224586309251"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1574">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cfa88bb917a536e4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Every Child By Two: Oprah, Jenny McCarthy et al</title><published>2008-10-20T20:00:32Z</published><updated>2008-10-20T20:00:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/426749616/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Kev</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224579810863"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/da93e4bbf9dc9621</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The State of Israel</title><published>2008-10-21T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2008-10-21T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/israel.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Did Barack Obama fail to mention Israel by name in either of the first two 2008 presidential debates?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224569819939"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/a_step_closer_to_efficient_sol.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4f4d8420574a95b6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Environment"/><title type="html">A step closer to efficient solar power?</title><published>2008-10-21T06:33:49Z</published><updated>2008-10-21T06:33:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/427156518/a_step_closer_to_efficient_sol.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/a_step_closer_to_efficient_sol.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have to confess that the title of this paper, &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/105/40/15247.short"&gt;The remarkable influence of M2δ to thienyl π conjugation in oligothiophenes incorporating MM quadruple bonds&lt;/a&gt;, is Greek to me, that the abstract was impenetrable, and the paper itself was thoroughly incomprehensible. I'm a biologist, not a chemist or materials engineer! Fortunately, there are a &lt;a href="http://www.tgdaily.com/html_tmp/content-view-39807-113.html"&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/fullspect.htm"&gt;summaries&lt;/a&gt; that simplify the explanation enough that I can understand the gist of it, and it's cool stuff. Researchers have made a new material that promises to greatly increase the efficiency of solar cells. It works by collecting photons over a wider spectrum of wavelengths and by using both fluorescence and phosphorescence to create an electron flow, allowing it to both collect more energy per unit area and facilitating the production of current.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is promising news, and also illustrates why we need to fund basic research — these are the kinds of discoveries that can&amp;#39;t be simply planned and forced into existence, but require the liberty of the research enterprise to explore new ideas freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get too excited just yet, though. The research has uncovered useful properties of a combination of molecules that have only been tested in minute quantities. It remains to be seen if it can be scaled up efficiently, if it can be made cost-effective, and whether it can be simply made to work at a practical level. It&amp;#39;s still an exciting idea — they&amp;#39;re talking about nearly 100% efficiency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/a_step_closer_to_efficient_sol.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/427156518" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224567275989"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/20/but-how-do-we-recover-from-jenny-mccarthy/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ddd3ff68accb16de</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/starred" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="starred"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">…but how do we recover from Jenny McCarthy?</title><published>2008-10-21T05:20:14Z</published><updated>2008-10-21T05:20:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/20/but-how-do-we-recover-from-jenny-mccarthy/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/20/stop-jenny-mccarthy/"&gt;I’m no fan of Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;. Her antivaccination stance is totally without merit, and in fact her status as a public spokesman for that movement constitutes a public health hazard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me take a moment here to say something very carefully. I am a parent. I love my daughter, and want to protect her as much as is healthy for her. I understand that instinctive need to care for a child. While I have not gone through what must be an agonizing experience for a parent of an autistic child, I’ve had my taste of such things when my own daughter was ill, or in an accident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about kids with autism is a topic filled with emotion. Any time a topic invokes a strong emotional response, critical thinking is the first victim. People are less likely to listen to hard evidence and more willing to accept anecdotal evidence — that is, stories that support their pre-existing beliefs, even if those beliefs are completely wrong. Ms. McCarthy and the antivaxxers have lots of anecdotes, but the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; evidence is totally against them. Remember, as hard as it is to talk about this, the ramifications are very, very real: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/08/22/antivaxxers-must-be-stopped-now/"&gt;outbreaks of diseases are on the rise&lt;/a&gt; because antivaxxers are scaring people into not vaccinating their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; talk about this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. McCarthy has an autistic son. Or, according to her, he &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; autistic; now she’s claiming her son has been cured of autism. She makes this claim &lt;a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/news/jenny-mccarthy-my-son-is-no-longer-autistic/"&gt;in an Us magazine interview&lt;/a&gt;, saying changing his diet by removing wheat and dairy products has cured him. In this puff piece, there is not a single medical person contacted (just a general statement saying &amp;quot;doctors have accused her of creating fear of necessary vaccines&amp;quot;), not a single mention that there is no evidence of a relationship between vaccines and autism and in fact strong evidence against such a relationship, and not a single statement that McCarthy might be wrong — &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/joom/swift/shes-completely-wrong.html"&gt;actually, is certainly wrong&lt;/a&gt; — about vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;em&gt;they didn’t even ask her if a doctor had corroborated her diagnosis that her son is cured&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not accusing Ms. McCarthy of lying; in fact I think she is a caring parent who loves her son, but who has taken the decidedly wrong path of science denial. But I am very curious about her saying her son was cured. While the press (in the form of Us magazine) has been positive over this, it has not been at all investigative of her claims. We have not seen any diagnoses of her son, for example. Again, I am not accusing her of lying, but let’s bear in mind the seriousness of her claim: &lt;em&gt;she is saying her son is no longer autistic, and that she cured him by changing his diet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;strong&gt;incredibly&lt;/strong&gt; serious claim, and she is the one using it not only as a weapon against vaccination, but also is de facto telling others to ignore medical advice and try this &amp;quot;alternative&amp;quot; therapy. The burden is therefore on her to show the evidence for her claims. This is absolutely essential: I expect the antivax movement will trumpet her claims loudly and often. But how much real evidence can be made to back up Ms. McCarthy’s claim? For example, there is a broad spectrum of autism disorders, and some research indicates children can do better naturally as they age. Could this be the case here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect very strongly that what Ms. McCarthy is engaging in is a mistaken way of thinking called &lt;em&gt;post hoc ergo propter hoc&lt;/em&gt;: because an event happens after something, it happened &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of that thing. Her son got autism after a vaccination, therefore he is autistic because of the vaccination. But vaccinations are given around the same time children can be first diagnosed with autism! So it makes a link, a &lt;em&gt;false&lt;/em&gt; link in a parent’s mind. Again, doctors have made very careful studies of this, and there is no link between vaccines and the onset of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now she is propter hoccing again. Let’s assume her son really is doing better. This happened after she changed his diet, so in her mind it happened &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of the diet. But it also happened after we invaded Iraq, and after Cassini reached Saturn, and after I left my last job. None of those things were related to her son’s illness, just as his diet almost certainly wasn’t either. And remember, it’s possible that his alleviation of autism symptoms was a natural aspect of his getting older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rail against uncritical thinking on this blog and in everything I do in life. The Moon Hoax, the Face on Mars, and other things like them may not have much of an impact in &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; life, &lt;strong&gt;but the same lack of critical thinking skills does affect us, &lt;em&gt;all of us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, especially when a celebrity with some notoriety is the one behind them, aided by an all-too-willing and credulous press. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are one of the greatest triumphs of medical science. Children can die from not getting vaccines. There is no evidence vaccines cause autism. Jenny McCarthy is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have questions on this, talk to your doctor. Do your research. But please, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt;, don’t just listen to what McCarthy says, or any of the antivaxxers. They’re dead wrong on this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224562789592"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/the_ethics_of_blog_anonymity.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e8bdf4c0ec5aa156</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="meta-blag"/><title type="html">The ethics of blog anonymity</title><published>2008-10-21T04:03:03Z</published><updated>2008-10-21T04:03:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/427079585/the_ethics_of_blog_anonymity.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/the_ethics_of_blog_anonymity.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I took on the ScienceOnline09 anonymity panel because I thought it might be interesting, but the conversation that has developed has turned this into a much deeper issue than I had anticipated.  I'm stepping into a big, brown pile of ethics here, and hopefully &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/"&gt;Janet&lt;/a&gt; won't make too much fun of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The science blogosphere, being a new medium, is slowly developing a set of practical normative ethics (geez, I hope that's the right term), and that this is a critical time to start to explicitly discussing these ethics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, it turns out that anonymity in blogging brings up a host of other issues related to online culture and its intersection with real life.  What moral meaning does anonymity have?

She had a student messing with a cell phone - and my "messing", I mean "texting her mom" - during class.  So my friend took the phone (to which the student objected, but eventually complied) as per the rules, to be returned at the end of the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A short time later, during the next class, a knock came on her classroom door.  It was the mother demanding that the daughter's phone be returned.  When the discussion made its way to the vice-principal's office, my friend got only mute non-support from the VP.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a couple of things going on here that I'd like to address.  The first is that the student was texting her fucking mother during class time, which means that the stupid mom knew her daughter was dicking around and not paying attention or doing work, and the mom is/was obviously ok with that.  We can immediately tag her with the "fucking moron parent" tag.  Done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, for the stupid mom to show up to the school to ask...no, wait, &lt;i&gt;demand&lt;/i&gt; that the phone be returned is such an affront to the teacher's authority and class control that it would be laughable were it not so numbingly, ignorantly, tragic.  We wonder why the standards of education are diminishing; it's due, in large part I think, to parents who believe their children already know everything and should be allowed to txt in cls.  CUL8R!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trust me when I say that the only thing these kids will be "c"ing L8R is a future as a Wal-Mart greeter with a possible promotion to the customer service desk.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thirdly, the lack of supervisor support is astonishing.  A school is not a store.  The parents are not always right.  In fact, sometimes they're downright handicapped.  No, wait, I've worked with the handicapped for a decade and that comment does them a disservice.  Sometimes the parents are just fucking stupid.  Too stupid, in fact, to realize that a school is intended to impart knowledge to their offspring - not be a place to hang out and socialize while mom does nails and dad rides the cubicle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People need to grow a pair an tell those slack-ass, illiterate, disrespectful parents to either support the teachers or take their self-important, gr8 kids out of school...so they can...you know...home school them.  Or at the very least introduce them to the semi-lucrative world of roadside mowing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That VP should be ashamed.  It's partly his fault that we're all going to be sitting around in 10 years wondering why the fuck no one knows how to build anything and why everyone who comes to our home to fix any sort of technical problem is a very polite, well-spoken Brown guy.  It's because Princess TextyThumbs can't put a sentence together and thinks "urban sprawl" is the new &lt;i&gt;Girlicious&lt;/i&gt; single.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to the 20-teens, folks.

Thinking that it is is subscribing to the Etymological Fallacy (see &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001256.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, among many other places). But even synchronically, you can't always trust what you see: derived lexical items are often specialized semantically (as are &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=437"&gt;noun-noun compounds&lt;/a&gt; and also combinations of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=479"&gt;non-predicating adjective&lt;/a&gt; plus noun). This is especially true of technical terms; as I am &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004227.html"&gt;fond of&lt;/a&gt; saying: labels are not definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to financial derivatives. &lt;em&gt;Derivative&lt;/em&gt; here is derived from &lt;em&gt;derive&lt;/em&gt;, right? So we can tell what it means in this expression from its morphological composition, right? Well, no. But people want that to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;So we get this letter to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; (19 October, &lt;em&gt;Week in Review&lt;/em&gt;, p. 11):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial industry's quant formulas are not beyond the layman's understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Derivatives" may sound familiar from high school calculus; they are functions whose value is derived from the value of another, known function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's true as far as it goes. But it is utterly uninformative. It tells us nothing about the meaning of &lt;em&gt;derivative&lt;/em&gt; in financial contexts. Or, in fact, about &lt;em&gt;derivative&lt;/em&gt; in calculus. The label is appropriate, but it's far from a definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For the record, the derivative f'(x) of a function f(x) in calculus is the function that provides the value of the rate of change of f(x). It's a very specific kind of "derivative". Financial derivatives have nothing in particular to do with rates of change.)&lt;/p&gt;

She is a leading spokesperson for the antivaccination antiscientific movement. These are people who think vaccines cause autism, &lt;a href="http://www.chop.edu/consumer/jsp/division/generic.jsp?id=84662"&gt;despite no evidence at all showing this to be the case&lt;/a&gt;, and a tsunami of evidence clearly showing there is no relation at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will have more to say about Ms. McCarthy soon — oh, &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; I — but for now I want to alert you to a new website called &lt;a href="http://www.site.stopjenny.com/"&gt;Stop Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;. It has information about her claims, and links to where you can find more and better information.

It’s been done quite a bit. And besides, I personally have learned more about history from the homeless man that throws trash at me every morning than from basic cable. It may not be totally accurate history, but if you can get past the smell of booze and mutant body odor when he comes around, not to mention the fact that he looks like the guy from the Oakridge Boys with the long beard, it’s at least as entertaining and as pertinent to the story of humans as many of the shows on the History Channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what the hell? Perhaps they deserve a little more ragging. And besides, Elyse sort of established a good vs. evil theme with &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3068"&gt;today’s Afternoon Inquisition&lt;/a&gt;. So let’s do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, the History Channel aired a program, called &lt;em&gt;God vs. Satan.&lt;/em&gt; The hour-long show (available on DVD for a mere $24.95) follows the battle between good and evil from Satan’s initial fall from grace through the “end of time”. The description of the program on &lt;a href="http://www.history.com/shows.do?action=detail&amp;amp;episodeId=358412"&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt; reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What will the battle of Armageddon look like? Will it take place at a battlefield in Meggido, Israel, as stated in the Bible? Take a tour of the final days on earth as envisioned by believers of the three Abrahamic religions; Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Examine the final chapter of the ultimate battle between good and evil from accounts in the Talmud, the book of Revelation and the Koran. Discover how these religions differ, where they agree and what might occur during this epic war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that description sounds a little more thoughtful than the show actually is. At least in the description, the History Channel hints that the material is merely the vision of religious believers, and therefore is open to interpretation or even outright dismissal. And in the show, the narrator does indeed ask direct questions about Armageddon, like “Will it take place at a battlefield in Meggido?”. But the producers never examine the possibility that an epic final battle may actually &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; take place at all. Nor do they speculate that the story of the fallen angel into hell, and that of the end-times, might just simply be elements in a collection of ancient legends and myths that were dreamed up by mad men?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, they don’t look at the &lt;em&gt;history&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material is presented as though the book of Revelations is a schedule of events we’re just waiting for. There are some references to believers in the three Abrahamic religions, but there is no critical analysis of those religions or the sources for the stories in their sacred texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the sad thing is, it wouldn’t be that difficult to point out some major problems with the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, God always kicks Satan’s ass. Always! In bouts with God, Satan is absolutely winless. It all started when Satan got too big for his britches in heaven way back before the rise of man, and was tossed out. From there, it was one ass-kicking after another. Even God’s kid got in on the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But according to Revelations, Satan is going to try to beat God again by taking over the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not evil personified. That’s &lt;em&gt;stupidity&lt;/em&gt; personified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He should know he can’t beat God. Christ, he friggin’ lived in heaven for thousands of years. Doesn’t he know by now that God is a bad ass? How many times does he need to be thrown out of one hyperphysical realm into another before he gets the hint? Doesn’t he know what the words “all powerful” mean? Are there no dictionaries in hell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even if there aren’t, doesn’t Satan know the minds of men?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to sit the guy down and say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, Satan, men have a book that says you’re going to lose. Not just once more, but &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; more! After the first time, you’re going to be chained up for a thousand years, and then when you try to beat God yet again, you will finally be dismantled for good. It says so right there in the book that God himself wrote! Don’t you read?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dude, just let it go. Take the missus and get away for a while. Do some traveling. Forget about God, and how much you hate him. It’s not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the History Channel doesn’t talk about this type of silliness in the program; this silliness that’s built right into the old stories. Even worse, they give zero air time to any critical voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they’re trying to give folks a bit of an entertaining fright around Halloween, but couldn’t they once have a good critical examination of this type of mumbo jumbo? Just once?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224534694047"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/20/get-some-death-help-some-jref/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0f33dc8bdacfdbb7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="DeathfromtheSkies!"/><title type="html">Get some Death, help some JREF</title><published>2008-10-20T20:05:17Z</published><updated>2008-10-20T20:05:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/20/get-some-death-help-some-jref/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: Well, that’s the power of the intertoobs: the JREF is out of copies!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2: The JREF plans on getting more copies. I’ll let you know when they come in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note: I’m getting some incredibly generous requests asking me how people can buy my book in a way to maximize the money I receive for it! That’s really very nice, and I appreciate the sentiment. The best thing you can do is simply send a box full hundred dollar bills to–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– wait, sorry? Oh, that was Mrs. BA yelling at me not to be a jerk. OK then. In reality, if you follow the link in the right-hand sidebar and click it to buy the book, I make a few extra pennies. But tell you what– the James Randi Educational Foundation bought a case to sell online. &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/joom/jref-store/5520.html"&gt;If you buy the book through that store&lt;/a&gt;, then the JREF makes some extra money, and they need it too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death&lt;/em&gt; at JREF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, the books are already signed! I took some JREF stickers and signed them, and mailed them down to the foundation where they were placed on the title pages of the books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who prefer, I found out &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-from-the-Skies/dp/B001FA0LY4/ref=pd_sim_kinc_1"&gt;it’s available on Kindle, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

On the other hand, let's not delude ourselves about this item. Palin's &lt;em&gt;verbage&lt;/em&gt; is not simply a term for "language" or "wording" that has been happily circulating in vernacular speech since it was first attested 200 years ago, in defiance of the assaults of prescriptivists. &lt;em&gt;Verbage&lt;/em&gt; is not colloquial English — I mean, people don&amp;#39;t go around saying, &amp;quot;Hey, Sparky — watch your goddamn verbage!&amp;quot; It arises as an approximation of a fancy-pants word that people have seen in print: it&amp;#39;s a lot more plausible to assume that people would misread &lt;em&gt;verbiage&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;verbage&lt;/em&gt; than that they would mishear it that way, particularly since this is a re-analysis favored by analogy. The fact is that in both its form and its meaning, &lt;em&gt;verbiage&lt;/em&gt; is a weirder word than most people — including the editors of the OED — realize.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One reason why the reanalysis of &lt;em&gt;verbiage&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;verbage&lt;/em&gt; is so easy is that it isn't obvious what that &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; is doing there in the first place. The root &lt;em&gt;verb&lt;/em&gt;- yields words like &lt;em&gt;verbal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;verbose&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;verbial&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;verbiose&lt;/em&gt;, and there's no reason why the suffix -&lt;em&gt;age&lt;/em&gt; should introduce an &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; (the &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;foliage&lt;/em&gt; comes from the Latin root &lt;em&gt;folium&lt;/em&gt;). Then too, why should the combination of &lt;em&gt;verb&lt;/em&gt;- + -&lt;em&gt;age&lt;/em&gt; imply prolixity? By all rights, the word should mean simply — and &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; — &amp;quot;wording,&amp;quot; as Palin assumes it does. (After all, &lt;em&gt;acreage&lt;/em&gt; doesn't mean "an excessive amount of land.")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, though, the word almost certainly &lt;em&gt;doesn&lt;/em&gt;'t come originally from &lt;em&gt;verb&lt;/em&gt;- + -&lt;em&gt;age&lt;/em&gt;, as the OED says it does. According to &lt;a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Rey"&gt;Alain Rey&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;em&gt;Dictionnaire Historique de la Langue Française&lt;/em&gt;, the word &lt;em&gt;verbiage&lt;/em&gt; first appeared in French in 1674. It was derived from the the Middle French verb &lt;em&gt;verbier&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;verboier&lt;/em&gt;, which he glosses as "gazouiller" ("chirp, warble") as applied to birds, and which he connects to a 13th-century Picardian &lt;em&gt;verbler&lt;/em&gt;, "warble, speak in singsong"  this in turn derived from Frankish *&lt;em&gt;werbilon&lt;/em&gt;, "whirl, swirl" (cf German &lt;em&gt;Wirbel&lt;/em&gt;, "whirl") "Since the 17th century," Rey writes, "the derived form &lt;em&gt;verbiage&lt;/em&gt; has been connected by popular etymology to &lt;em&gt;verbe&lt;/em&gt; and for its meaning to &lt;em&gt;verbeux&lt;/em&gt; [ = 'verbose, wordy']." Since the English &lt;em&gt;verbiage&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#39;t attested until 1721 (and then, as it happens, in Prior&amp;#39;s poem about Locke and Montaigne), it seems quite likely that it was borrowed from the French — this would explain both its idiosyncratic form and its unaccountably restricted original sense. Both morphological and semantic analogy, then, would favor a popular reanalysis of the form of the word as &lt;em&gt;verbage&lt;/em&gt; and of its meaning as "wording."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whatever the derivation, my guess is that the majority of literate speakers consider the &lt;em&gt;verbage&lt;/em&gt; pronunciation an error or an illiteracy, and that a smaller but significant percentage of them would also say that it was a mistake to use &lt;em&gt;verbiage&lt;/em&gt; to mean simply "wording" without any implication of wordiness, even though as the OED indicates, the word has been used in that sense by reputable writers since the early 19th century. It's too bad the &lt;em&gt;American Heritage&lt;/em&gt; didn't record that opinion or ask the members of its Usage Panel what they thought about that variant, in the interest of alerting its readers to the potential risks in using it (it isn't only the James Woods of the world who consider it an error, after all). I take some responsibility for the omission, since I was chair of the Usage Panel when the entry for this word was prepared. But it's in the nature of the lexicographical enterprise that you can't get around to everything, and  silence shouldn't always be equated with unqualified authorization.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoff Nunberg</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224527807231"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/20/i-turn-old-today/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/62b9a50a9b5324a2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="birthdays"/><category term="Daniel hamermesh"/><category term="retirement"/><title type="html">I Turn Old Today</title><published>2008-10-20T18:04:47Z</published><updated>2008-10-20T18:04:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/z0VMh4WNHP4/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/20/i-turn-old-today/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Dan and his wife in 1966.

At Work.</title><published>2008-10-20T17:13:00Z</published><updated>2008-10-20T17:13:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2008/10/annoying-stupid-magnetsagain-at-work.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/" type="html">I got a flyer with my Massage Today magazine that offered magnet therapy from a company called &lt;a href="http://www.bioflexmagnets.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bioflex&lt;/a&gt;.  The flyer announced on its front page five studies "Validating Efficacy of BIOflex  Medical Magnets".  I called bullshit in my head and came straight to ye ol' reliable computer.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, BIOflex magnets are different from all other magnets because:&lt;blockquote&gt;BIOflex offers Concentric Circle magnets, the only technology that ensures the accurate alignment of the magnetic field with the affected blood vessels...BIOflex works by design, not by coincidence! (from their flyer)&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, from an article on &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/consumers/market/files/health/magnets/index.html"&gt;CBC's Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, physicist Robert Park was asked about the "design" of magnets:&lt;blockquote&gt;Complete nonsense...Even lowly fridge magnets have alternating poles. They're made that way to make sure they are strong only at the surface.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Park said, "Now the reason they do that is to protect your credit cards," says Park. "You get too strong a magnetic field and those get erased."&lt;/blockquote&gt;BIOflex has a page about a &lt;a href="http://www.bioflexmagnets.com/cgi-bin/shop/sc_loadpagez.cgi?file=healthy_natural.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;study done at Baylor University&lt;/a&gt; that supposedly proves magnet efficacy. It comes with this lovely quote:&lt;blockquote&gt;In spite of the testimonials—and the $5OO million in U.S. sales of therapeutic magnets last year—the American medical profession remained skeptical. Anecdotal evidence was not enough.&lt;/blockquote&gt;No, asshole, it's never enough.  Get some education and realize that people are easy to fool and you can get other people to say whatever you want for financial gain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then we have the good ol' Galileo Gambit, writ strong:&lt;blockquote&gt;Franz Anton Mesmer became famous for his outlandish claims that he could cure everything from chest pains to blindness and mental illness with magnets, thus "mesmerizing" his audiences while doing it. But Mesmer's arrogance angered many powerful people. They declared him and his methods fraudulent. With Mesmer's fall from grace, magnets unfortunately became synonymous with quack cures, a belief still held in conservative medical circles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;...and the classic response - Galileo had the advantage of also being correct.  Mesmer was a douche who, according to a &lt;a href="http://www.trivia-library.com/a/biography-of-famous-scientist-and-hypnotist-franz-a-mesmer.htm"&gt;short bio&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;Freud and others would profit from his work, but he would mainly be remembered as a quack occult healer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Exactly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As usual, Stephen Barrett has an article on Quackwatch &lt;a href="http://quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/QA/magnet.html"&gt;rebutting the Baylor Study&lt;/a&gt;. I urge you to check it out, point, laugh, then have a nice burger and some root beer.  Here's the basic point:&lt;blockquote&gt;This study provides no legitimate basis for concluding that magnets offer any health-related benefit:&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here's a hilarious Bioflex testimonial relating to the Hall Effect:&lt;blockquote&gt;Last year, Scott Fischbach, of Frederick, MD., suffered an injury to his forearm that required four stitches. As the wound healed, a large hard lump of scar tissue formed and began pressing on the nerves an tendons in his arm, causing numbness in his fingers and hand. A relative suggested he try magnets. "I was amazed at the almost instantaneous results," he says. After only 4 hours of wearing a magnet band directly over the wound, Fischbach says his scar tissue decreased by 75 percent. By the end of that week, it was completely gone and his arm had returned to normal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The hilarious part is when you look at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect"&gt;The Hall Effect&lt;/a&gt;. - go about a 1/4 of the way down the page and guess if any of the scammers in Bioflex have a fucking clue what the equations mean.  Please leave in the comments your suggestions as to what they, what's that word..."think". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, Bioflex says about horses:&lt;blockquote&gt;many supporters point to the success of magnets with horses as strong proof of their effectiveness, since the placebo effect doesn't exist with animals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Right, but the handlers have biases and those show straight the fuck up in the testimonials.  Could someone, anyone, please tell these helmet-heads how to get a life?  That'd be dandy.  Thanks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BIOflex is endorsed by Dr. Ronald Lawrence of UCLA.  Great.  He also endorses &lt;a href="http://www.therapeutic-grade.com/refs/proEndorse.html"&gt;these assheads&lt;/a&gt; who make aromatherapy based on herbs found in the damn bible.  Oh, and let's not forget that he has a book entitled, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Magnet-Therapy-Pain-Cure-Alternative/dp/B000Q1C52E/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1224524103&amp;amp;sr=1-2" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Magnet Therapy: The Pain Cure Alternative&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Excellent pick.  That's like Deepak Chopra endorsing you - if he didn't already have all that shit at his own store.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Magnets, they're not just for your nutsack anymore.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; (excerpt)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Universe is trying to kill you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s nothing personal. It’s trying to kill me too. It’s trying to kill &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it doesn’t even have to try very hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Universe is an incredibly hostile place for life. Virtually all of it is a vacuum, so that’s bad right from the start.  Of the extremely few places that aren’t hard vacuum, most are too hot for chemical reactions to do very well – molecules get blasted apart before they can even properly form. Of the places that aren’t too hot, most are too cold – reactions happen too slowly to get interesting things to occur in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of the very few places that aren’t in vacuum, too hot, or too cold – and we only really know of one: Earth – there are all manners of dangers lurking about. Volcanoes blast megatons of noxious chemicals into the air, spew lava for miles, and cause vast earthquakes. Tsunamis rewrite huge sections of coastlines. Ice ages come and go, mountains pop up and change the global weather system, whole continents get subducted into the glowing rock of the mantle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those are just the &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; problems. Earth still sits in the incredibly hostile environment of space, and all kinds of disasters might befall us from there – literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, that’s what this whole book is about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Universe is a violent place. Stars explode. Stars like the Sun can die in milder events, but die just the same. Whole galaxies collide, igniting fireworks on a cosmic scale. Asteroids impact other planets; could they hit us? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we launched telescopes into space, we equipped them with cameras that could detect ultraviolet light, X-rays, super high-energy gamma rays. We saw a Universe that seemed actively trying to destroy us. Exploding stars are phenomenally dangerous, blasting out vast amounts of killing force and energy. Black holes are everywhere, lurking throughout the galaxy, devouring anything that wanders too close. Flashes of high-energy light from distant points in the Universe whisper of powers terrible and gross, enough to fry entire solar systems that get in the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth seemed to be the center of the Universe for much of mankind’s history. Now, however, the Earth seems fragile and impossibly small, a remote speck of dust lost in a Universe of frightening size and age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, the Universe cares not at all if we live or die. If a human were magically transported to any random spot in the cosmos, within seconds we’d die 99.999999999999999% of the time. At best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite all that (and quite a bit more still unsaid), &lt;em&gt;here we are&lt;/em&gt;. Billions of years in, countless times around the Sun, sitting at the crosshairs of dozens of cosmic weapons… our planet endures. Life not only survives, it &lt;em&gt;thrives&lt;/em&gt;. Numerous setbacks have occurred, for sure, but life itself continues on. As small and fragile and soft as humans are, we’ve managed so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we haven’t yet seen everything the Universe can unleash on us. A single asteroid impact could take out half of humanity without even breaking a sweat. A solar flare could wipe out our economy in seconds. And a nearby gamma-ray burst… well, that’s bad too. &lt;em&gt;Very&lt;/em&gt; bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love astronomy. I’ve devoted my entire life to it, to telling others about it, to writing about it. Astronomy is awe inspiring, it’s beautiful, it provides philosophical perspective and holds the secret answers to so many of our most profound questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I have no doubt whatsoever that astronomical events can kill us. In some cases, our study of astronomy can actually save us. In other cases it provides us with information about what might kill us, though unfortunately without giving us any ideas of how to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in many of those cases, there isn’t much we could do anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, I won’t hold back. The reality of a nearby gamma-ray burst puts the sweatiest fundamentalist religion’s Armageddon prose to shame, dwarfing it to mundanity. I will go over, in loving detail, the Earth’s atmosphere ripped away, the oceans boiled, and all life sterilized down to the base of the crust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But during all that, I will remind you that there is no star nearby capable of creating such a burst; and even if there were, the odds of it going off any time soon are tiny; and even if it did, the odds of it being aimed our way are tinier yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s still fun to think about “What if…?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you’re reading this book, you may feel like you’re watching a horror movie at the theater: it’s fun, jolting, and maybe even terrifying. During the scary parts you may want to turn away, or hide your eyes, or spill your popcorn, but I’ll make sure the actual facts of the case are there to calm you down a bit after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course (he says, chuckling low and with evil intent), there is a big difference: eventually the movie is over, you leave the theater, and laugh at the scary ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t do that in the real world. There are dangers out there, and we can’t avert our eyes from them. But as you read this book (hopefully with your eyes open) you’ll learn just what the dangers are, and more importantly what they aren’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What horror movie is still scary once the lights are on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you always have to keep in mind that &lt;em&gt;we’re still here&lt;/em&gt;. The Universe is a dangerous place, but again, we’ve gotten this far. We may just make it a while longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or we may not. I have to be honest. The Universe is vast beyond imagining, and wields mighty forces. For nearly all the events depicted here, it’s not a matter of &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;, it’s a matter of &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224525723089"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/well_maybe_it_is_exactly_like.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e9b1aad97bd3a124</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Well, maybe it is exactly like their brains</title><published>2008-10-20T18:42:51Z</published><updated>2008-10-20T18:42:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/426645877/well_maybe_it_is_exactly_like.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/well_maybe_it_is_exactly_like.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reader &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/creationists_gaming_kentucky.php#comment-1164482"&gt;wombat found a fascinating site&lt;/a&gt; in response to the creationist debate in Kentucky, led by Dr. Ben Scripture. It's an &lt;a href="http://www.petrifiedhumanbrain.com/"&gt;utterly bizarre page about a petrified human brain&lt;/a&gt;, and it is typical creationist tripe. They have gathered a collection of "authorities", where they make much of their pedigrees (don't blame me, the "Dr. X, Ph.D." is the redundant formula they use on the site.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Suzanne Vincent, Ph.D., a neuroanatomist(!) at Oral Roberts University&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Ross Anderson, Ph.D. of The Masters College&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Dr. Bedros Daghlian, M.D., a retired doctor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Dr. Ben Scripture, Ph.D. in biology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Dr. Travis Shipley, Ph.D. in theology (snort!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Dr. Frederick Trexler, Ph.D. in geology and Physics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photos show these people and others gushing over this lump of rock, with testimonials like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"It is scientifically impossible for this to not be a brain"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Clearly, this is the brain stem and spinal cord, see it wrapped around there? Everything right where it is supposed to be."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Dr. Daghlian checked microscopically, and confirmed residue to appear cellular."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;…I spent several years in medicine before obtaining my Doctorate in Theology. When I reviewed the x-rays of the rock and different brains, I chose incorrectly which was which!&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all that, you'd expect to find some remarkable degree of similarity, wouldn't you? It convinced a neuroanatomist, after all, and surely all those people with their fancy degrees couldn't be fooled. But then they show us a close-up photo of this "brain".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="rock.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/20/rock.jpg" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They've got to be kidding. That's a lumpy rock. It's no brain; I've seen a lot of brains in my time, from fish to frogs to lizards to birds to all kinds of mammals, and that looks nothing like any of them. Here, in case you haven't seen one, is a photo of a human brain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="brain.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/20/brain.jpg" width="400" height="306"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/blast_from_the_past_a_visit_from_ed_conrad_circa_1996/"&gt;Ed Conrad&lt;/a&gt; effect. Hand some ignorant people a random lump of rock, tell them it&amp;#39;s a fossil, and their imaginations will do the rest. There is no excuse for these &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot;, though — the author of the page claims that &amp;quot;It has been examined and determined to be a petrified human brain by many people with high degrees in several different fields of study and occupation.&amp;quot; That just goes to show that even the most qualified people in creation &amp;#39;science&amp;#39; have to be flaming idiots.&lt;/p&gt;

Our speaker is Sid Rodrigues of London Skeptics in the Pub. He’ll be talking about that, plus something about Tigger losing his boing, which I believe is something perverted. Also, he has a funny accent. So please come and enjoy! Here’s the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=763995704&amp;amp;v=feed&amp;amp;story_fbid=29573114905#/event.php?eid=30633813423&amp;amp;ref=ts"&gt;Facebook event page&lt;/a&gt;, if you like that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the business is out of the way, allow me to use this space to thank all of you for the birthday wishes here on Skepchick, on Twitter, on Facebook, in person, and through the mail! Today I stopped by the post office and picked up two packages: one was from Peggy Skemp, an amazingly talented jewelry designer who made me a beautiful silver necklace depicting two earthworms &lt;em&gt;doing it&lt;/em&gt;. Yes, doing the nasty. Making the earthworm with two backs. Etc. It’s amazing. Thank you Peggy! I’ll take a photo of myself wearing it at some point tonight, and if all of you who fall in love with it can contact me and I’ll let you know where you can buy one like it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other package was from my friend Surly Amy, and contained MORE JEWELRY! So sweet. Amy, you completely outdid yourself. This batch had me cooing: robots, rockets, puns, and more, all on her super cool ceramics. Thank you, thank you, thank you! The rest of you can go buy Surly Amy’s jewelry at her &lt;a href="http://surly.etsy.com"&gt;Etsy shop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lest I forget, thanks to my fellow Skepchicks for giving me shoes. Delicious, beautiful, sexy hot shoes. Rock on, I love you chicks! Special shout out to Maria and Amanda for making the trek out to celebrate my bday in person. You are awesome. I’m out of adjectives. (And of course, thanks to the other local Boston skeptics for coming to celebrate as well!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I’m finished gushing. Last tidbits: I’m mentioned in Skeptical Inquirer’s latest issue, so go buy it! Also, those of you in Milwaukee should pick up the &lt;a href="http://www.altdash.com/"&gt;local Alt - Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, where I’m interviewed. Those of you outside Milwaukee can read the article &lt;a href="http://www.teakrulos.blogspot.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Skeptics,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been listening to the podcast for quite some time and I really appreciate all that you’ve done to educate me and teach me to think skeptically. You’ve really done a lot to change the way I think about the world around me and to appreciate how incredible the ACTUAL (as opposed to the supernatural/fake-o) world is. I love reading your blogs, and you’ve exposed me to a whole other world of people like you, who I now follow as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on to my question. Although he doesn’t listen to the podcast, my boyfriend gets a lot of second-hand skeptical thinking from me. We enjoy watching all of the crap on the History Channel (Bible Code, Monster Quest, the list goes on…) and the other night, we sat down in front of the TV to watch a show on UFOs. When I started trying to debunk some of the things we were seeing, my boyfriend balked. He said that he believes that there is intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. I explained the difference in what he was saying and what the people on the show were saying, agreeing that intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is possible (if not probable), but that there’s no good evidence for intelligent life visiting our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went around in circles for a while, and he finally came to the conclusion that belief in UFOs and aliens visiting earth didn’t actually hurt anything, so there was no use in exerting skeptical energy in debunking them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the verdict on that? How do you make an argument against a statement like “Well, it isn’t hurting anyone…” I couldn’t come up with a good argument because, unlike homeopathy, belief in psychics, belief in ghosts, and all of the other supernatural woo crap out there, I couldn’t come up with any group of people that UFOs actually harm. That’s not to say that I agree with his view, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what DOES a belief in UFOs hurt?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that “belief in UFOs and aliens visiting earth didn’t actually hurt anything” is an unstated major premise - a logical fallacy. The fact that the listener’s boyfriend follows it up with “so there was no use in exerting skeptical energy in debunking them” is pretty evident that he’s made up his mind on the matter. From the listener’s description, it would seem that her boyfriend has drawn his conclusion based on his own set of beliefs, first and foremost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am best reminded about how to answer the listener’s questions from something that James Randi once said. About 10 years ago, Randi was here in Connecticut giving a lecture at Yale, and the opening segment of the lecture was a 10 minute montage of television clips and appearances featuring The Amazing One. In that montage is a clip from an interview, when Randi was asked “What is the harm” in belief of the paranormal. Randi answered (and I am paraphrasing) that belief in the supernatural is a very dangerous thing. First you accept that something unreal is real, and before you know it, you wind up believing in all sorts of things that are untrue. In some cases, people have lost their entire fortunes sinking them in to irrational beliefs. And in some cases, it has cost people their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most famous UFO-death related cases is that of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Humphrey"&gt;The Heaven’s Gate Cult&lt;/a&gt; back in 1997. Amongst the many insane notions that this cult embraced was the notion that there was an extra terrestrial craft in the tail of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Hale-Bopp"&gt;The Hale-Bopp Comet&lt;/a&gt; that was visible in our skies for several weeks. According to the cult’s beliefs, the alien ship was there to transport away the souls of the cult members upon their mass suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s not forget our friends &lt;a href="http://rael.org/rael_content/index.php"&gt;The Raelians&lt;/a&gt;. They too have much of their beliefs based on the notions of extra terrestrial activity. And perhaps the best known of them all, &lt;a href="http://www.scientology.org/"&gt;The Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt; and their entire view of the universe is heavily centralized on the belief of alien visitations to earth. Anyone who has been lured into these cults, becasue of the all-too attractive cultural UFO phenomena that our species is suffering through, is a victim of their beliefs in UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am of the opinion that the majority of people who have a belief in a specific pseudoscientific topic do not limit themselves to that lone “sacred cow” of theirs. People tend to believe in a host of related pseudosciences. For instance, those that believe that UFO’s are alien spacecraft tend to also put stock, to varying degrees, in the notions that alien are abducting humans and experimenting on them, government conspiracies that are covering up “real” UFO phenomenon, other alien attacks (for example, in the form of cattle mutilation), crop circles that are being created by alien visitors, alien technological or mental powers such as telekenisis or anti-gravity, and so on. Believers tend not to compartmentalize these notions as individual phenomena by saying that “this one is true, but that one is not”. Rather, they tend to accept the notion that all of these possibilities are plausible to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though mass suicide is the extreme end of the spectrum of possible harm in believing that UFO’s are aliens, there is other harm at work that is perhaps not as apparent, and that is the harm of deception. Whether it is self-deception, deception by another, or a combination of both (such as the case of cults), the damage brought about by deception can be extensive. Physically, people stand to lose money and resources, or even suffer physical harm to their person. Mentally, a mind that can be led to believe that UFO’s might be aliens can also be led to believe in many other fantastic ideas. The pain of the relatives or friends of their loved ones that have fallen viticm to cults or other groups of believers is very real.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of deception should never be underestimated, and the best antidote for deception, in my opinion, is scientific rational skepticism. A mind that is more apt to question the notion that UFO’s are aliens is better able to defend itself against an ocean of pseudoscience that floods the real world.  &lt;/p&gt;

Often, mainstream news stories focus on the notion of people “waking” from coma, or recovering from what was thought to be a permanent injury. This tends to hype the important, but subtle, progress that is being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news-1/Patient-roused-from-coma-by-a-magnetic-field-27374-1/"&gt;The latest such story is of Josh Villa&lt;/a&gt;, a 26 year old gentleman who suffered a severe head injury in 2005 from a car accident. The injuries resulted in coma - the inability to be consciously awake - which evolved into a persistent vegetative state (PVS). By description, Josh was able to open his eyes but not respond to any external stimulation or interact with his environment. This meets the clinical definition of PVS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His doctor, Theresa Pape, enrolled him is a study of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS uses strong magnetic fields to either induce or inhibit electrical activity in brain neurons. Therefore the technique can be used to turn off part of the brain, or stimulate it to be more active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case TMS was used to stimulate the dorsolateral cortex in Villa - a part of the brain active in arousal. The hope was that by increasing activity in the dorsolateral cortex Villas entire brain would be more active, improving function. After 15 sessions of TMS over 6 weeks Villa was able to turn his head to someone speaking to him. After the treatments he contingued to slowly improve and eventually was able to say simple words like “help” and fragments like “erm”.Villa was then given another round of TMS treatments, but with no further improvement.  He has since been stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Villa’s current condition is best described as a minimally conscious state, which is one notch above PVS. In fact, patients in a minimally conscious state are not uncommonly misdiagnosed as PVS if subtle signs of activity are missed on exam. The question now is - how to interpret Villa’s improvment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not implausible that TMS can produce the improvements observed in Villa. Essentially what is happening is that a damaged brain, which is close to the line of just barely being able to generate wakefulness, is being stimulated so that it functions a bit more. Specifically, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17505794?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;TMS may result in hypersynchronization &lt;/a&gt;- neurons firing together, which may reinforce their activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased activation has been shown before with &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8065486?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=4&amp;amp;log$=relatedarticles&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;deep brain stimulation &lt;/a&gt;- implanting electrodes in the brain that provide an extra kick to the cortex and make it a bit more active. The brain normally requires such activation to be awake, so such artificial stimulation may be replacing lost activation is some cases, or simply increasing the levels of activation in others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While useful, such techniques should not be considered “healing” - they are not healing the brain, just squeezing a bit more activity out of it. Can TMS cause actual healing? Villa’s improvement persisted even after the TMS sessions ended (although he did lose a bit of ground, some improvement remained). Therefore his increased function cannot be attributed entirely to active stimulation, although hypersynchronization would endure beyond stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But an alternate hypothesis  is the intriguing possibility that the stimulation increased repair of actual damage, perhaps by stimulating the activity of natural brain stem cells. Right now we have no way of knowing if this occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that Villa improved on his own, and would have improved the same amount even without the treatments. He was only a year out from his injury, well within the window where natural repair mechanisms could have produced the observed improvement in function. The TMS may have produced a temporary improvement over the background repair that was happening on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that this is only one case, and with one case we cannot control for variables. What this study suggests is that there is a possible benefit from TMS and so further research is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMS does have stronger evidence for benefit with neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and tremor, but in these cases TMS is being used to inhibit brain activity, not increase it. The basic concept here is that there are systems in the brain where various structures provide feedback activation or inhibition to other structures so that a certain balance is maintained. If one structure is disease and not functioning, this can be partially compensated for by inhibiting another structure to help restore something closer to normal balance. Again - such an application does not “heal” damaged or diseased brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnetic Healing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been careful to discuss the mechanisms by which TMS may have clinical benefit, in patients with coma and other applications, partially because it is helpful to understand how an intervention might work. But also because magnetic therapy is a common type of unscientific or fraudulent treatment being sold to the public. Magnets are sold with a variety of medical claims, such as treating pain or arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMS in no way relates to these dubious claims for magnet therapy. There are two primary differences. The first is that TMS uses a magnetic field much more powerful than the typical “refrigerator magnets” found in magnetic insoles or wraps. The plausibility of a biological effect from a magnetic field is directly tied to the strength of the magnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is that TMS is being used to affect the brain, which is an electromagnetic organ. While all cells have an electrical field potential across their membrane, the brain’s function depends upon cells evolved to use this electrical potential to actually conduct electrical signals. Therefore, the fact that magnetic stimulation can have a functional effect on the brain cannot be extrapolated to other tissues or organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, the other tissue that uses electrical conduction as a key component of its function is muscle - heart, skeletal, and smooth muscle. The heart can also be treated with electrical stimulation - with a pacemaker or with cardioversion. Muscles can be stimulated electrically also. There is simply no analogy with the liver or pancreas, however. And (although I know many have pointed this out before) the iron in blood is not magnetic and does not respond to a magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details matter, and a therapeutic benefit from TMS of the brain for any specific indication should not be used to support TMS for other indications, or for magnetic therapy is general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMS is an interesting tool to explore brain function, and may have a therapeutic role as a means of providing stimulation to damaged brains to improve function. However, the data so far is preliminary. Further, there is no evidence to suggest that TMS actually heals brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am intrigued and hopeful about recent research into treating coma victims, but results so far (from various forms of brain stimulation) have been modest. Generally speaking, patients improve one or two notches in brain function, and this may take them over a threshold where they can communicate better, but they remain profoundly neurologically damaged. It remains to be seen what the limits of brain stimulation as a therapeutic approach to coma are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, it’s been shipping for a week or more now, and some bookstores have had it for days. But today, October 20, was the official day from the publisher, and that’s the date I’ve had in mind for many months now. So here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been quite a long haul to get here: leaving a salaried job, moving across the country, new school for The Little Astronomer, new job for Mrs. BA. Then sitting in my office and writing, phoning astronomy friends and strangers, downloading scientific papers, reading them (many times having to make more phone calls and to figure out what the paper was saying), writing, editing, rewriting, rewriting, rewriting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through it all I have had the support of my friends, my family, and the team of people at Viking and Penguin Publishing. Thanks to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to you guys, too: the BABloggees, who have tolerated my endless pimping of this book. I have to admit that won’t stop immediately; there’s more to say. In fact, in my next post I’ll put up an excerpt from the Introduction to give you a taste of the book. I’ll also post an update of my schedule, which includes a handful of radio shows (and a local TV station Tuesday) as well as a couple of public talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, thanks to everyone for making this possible for me. It was, quite literally, a life-changing event, and I’m glad so many of you were here for it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224513830451"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/20/a-new-kind-of-campaign-advertising/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c95fdcdd0d3793e0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="2008 election"/><category term="manipulation"/><category term="predictions markets"/><title type="html">A New Kind of Campaign Advertising?</title><published>2008-10-20T14:13:15Z</published><updated>2008-10-20T14:13:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/rSnjEzLyGVA/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/20/a-new-kind-of-campaign-advertising/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">An anonymous Intrade investor poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into McCain futures, inflating the market's prediction that Sen.

They say the intent is to legitimately explore the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is part of the mission of the Scripps Howard Center to conduct public forums," said Mark Neikirk, the Center's executive director. "I've heard President Votruba state many times that a college campus should be a safe place for difficult conversations." Neikirk said that while the evolution/creation science debate is a difficult and polarizing topic, the mock trial format is designed to provide structure for a civil, informative exploration of the public policy questions raised by the debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to call bullshit on that. What this really is is an attempt to contrive a debate between science and superstition in which the superstition side gets to pretend they have equal status. And, of course, science issues are not settled in a courtroom, ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, though, is the way they're planning to resolve the issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first 200 people in attendance will have an opportunity to serve as jurors, using small remote control clickers to register their opinions both before and after the trial. At the conclusion of the proceeding, they will decide the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, right…in &lt;i&gt;Kentucky&lt;/i&gt;. The local churches will bus in a mob, retired godbots with nothing else to do will get in line early, and they'll all have predetermined (and blessedly ignorant) views of the outcome before they get started. The theological lackwit they have babbling the case for the supernatural can come in half-drunk and still count on 'victory'. This fight has been thrown before it even gets started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#3366ff"&gt;Hearing her being interviewed by Sean Hannity, on Fox News, almost made one wish for a Republican victory in November, so that her bizarre locutions might be available a bit longer to delve into. At times, even Hannity looked taken aback; his eyes, slightly too close to each other, like the headlamps on an Army jeep, went blank, as if registering the abyss we are teetering above. Or perhaps he just couldn’t follow. The most revealing moment happened earlier, when she was asked about Obama’s attack on McCain’s claim that the fundamentals of the economy are sound. “Well,” Palin said, “it was an unfair attack on the verbage that Senator McCain chose to use, because the fundamentals, as he was having to explain afterwards, he means our workforce, he means the ingenuity of the American people. And of course that is strong, and that is the foundation of our economy. So that was an unfair attack there, again, based on verbage that John McCain used.” This is certainly doing rather than mere talking, and what is being done is the coinage of “verbage.” It would be hard to find a better example of the Republican disdain for words than that remarkable term, so close to garbage, so far from language.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a parody of a highbrow sneer, this is brilliant work.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We all know that Wood, who recently &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2008/06/23/080623crbo_books_wood"&gt;praised&lt;/a&gt; a novel's "contribution to the Hamsun-Bernhard tradition of tragicomic first-person unreliability", and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Fiction-Works-James-Wood/dp/0374173400/"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that "one can accept Barthes's stylistic proviso without accepting his epistemological caveat", doesn't really believe that Gov. Palin's (admittedly awkward) extempore explanation was so difficult to understand that Hannity "just couldn't follow".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, those of us with access to web search know that "verbage", far from being a new coinage, has been a &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=verbage+peeve&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search"&gt;staple gripe of peevologists for years&lt;/a&gt;, and that even the end-rhyme with "garbage" is an old joke, recorded for several decades  &lt;a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/V/verbage.html"&gt;in the jargon dictionary's entry&lt;/a&gt; "A deliberate misspelling and mispronunciation of &lt;em&gt;verbiage&lt;/em&gt; that assimilates it to the word ‘garbage'".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we also know that the joke is a rather weak one, since the American Heritage Dictionary gives two pronunciations for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/4/V0060400.html"&gt;verbiage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (with no usage note), of which the second is the one that Gov. Palin used. (&lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/verbiage"&gt;Merriam-Webster&lt;/a&gt; also offers her pronunciation as a second option, again without doing their readers the courtesy of pointing out that this pronunciation may lead Eton-educated literary critics to make fun of you.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the end, those of us with access to the Oxford English Dictionary (and surely the New Yorker offers this service to its writers?) can learn that the earliest attested instance of the variant spelling "verbage" was 221 years ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1787&lt;/strong&gt; POLWHELE &lt;em&gt;Engl. Orator&lt;/em&gt; III. 770 As the flippant Phrase Glides from his hollow Tongue, tho' oft debas'd By low commercial Verbage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, by simple Gricean reasoning, we're forced to the conclusion that Wood has crafted a merciless parody of a smug, careless, ignorant snob. Because, of course, we can reject out of hand the hypothesis that he is one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: Putting irony aside, let me try to clarify what's going on here. I don't agree with many of Sarah Palin's political views, to the extent that she has any beyond expediency. But I think it's a catastrophic and unnecessary mistake to throw her into the linguistic briar-patch as a representative of those who have a provincial accent, sometimes use stigmatized idioms or non-standard pronunciations, and don't speak in well-polished paragraphs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what Jacob Weisberg did with the whole &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=Bushism+site%3Aitre.cis.upenn.edu&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search%22%22"&gt;Bushisms&lt;/a&gt; industry, and look how well that worked. If you set up a political choice between the people who talk like Sarah Palin and the people who talk like James Wood, guess who wins? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also believe that it's also morally wrong to try to win an argument by making fun of non-standard speech and lack of formal linguistic polish. As Colin Powell &lt;a href="http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=news-000002976656"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; about another irrelevant argument, "I understand what politics is all about. I know how you can go after one another, and that’s good. But I think this goes too far." ]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224507717692"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/sometimes_ink_is_just_ink.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8e3e0db83f1e2546</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Sometimes ink is just ink</title><published>2008-10-20T13:38:22Z</published><updated>2008-10-20T13:38:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/426391460/sometimes_ink_is_just_ink.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/sometimes_ink_is_just_ink.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;At first, I was a bit disappointed in this result, but then I realized it's actually rather interesting in a negative sense. Investigators &lt;a title="Ink squirts make squid swim for their lives - earth - 17 October 2008 - New Scientist Environment" href="http://environment.newscientist.com/article/dn14970-ink-squirts-make-squid-swim-for-their-lives.html"&gt;tested the effects of squid ink on other squid&lt;/a&gt;; the entirely reasonable idea being that it could contain an alarm pheromone that would have the function of alerting neighboring squid in the school of trouble.  It works — adding ink to a tank of Caribbean reef squid sends them scurrying away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when they removed the pigments from the ink and added that, the squid couldn't care less. That says there is no chemical signal, only a visual signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That makes sense, I suppose — oceans are big and would dilute any chemical signal fairly rapidly, so pheromones would only work well over a fairly short range (although some fish certainly do have extremely sensitive olfactory senses, so it could be done). Still, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/11/lobster_vs_sea_hare.php"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; eject some potent chemical signals with their secretions&lt;/a&gt;, which work when directly squirted into the face of a predator, so there was a chance the cephalopods might have evolved something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact we didn't even know what it was.  When you stride off, what is it that you've done?  How would it be described?  Have you strided?  Have you strode?  Have you stroded?  Have you stridden? Have you strodden?  We realized that we hadn't a clue.  None of them sounded familiar or even mildly acceptable to us as native speakers. And this odd gap had some potential for theoretical significance.  Let me explain why.  And then I'll tell you how the world's most distinguished English grammarian stumbled across a real-life sentence that seemed to clear up the mystery.  And I'll fill in a bit of subsequently discovered history as well.  But first, before you read on, write down what you think is the correct form for the past participle of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;stride&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in English as spoken by you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you simply haven&amp;#39;t a clue what to write down, then that supports what Deirdre Wilson and I originally wanted to make out of this strange case of a defective paradigm.  Let me explain why.  There is a small way in which it could be theoretically important whether, in a language with verbs and participles, there can be some verbs that accidentally lack certain participles.  You see, in the 1950s and 1960s it was standard to assume — following Charles C. Fries&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Structure of English&lt;/i&gt; (1952) and Noam Chomsky's &lt;i&gt;Syntactic Structures&lt;/i&gt; (1957) — that modal auxiliaries — &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, etc. — are members of a special part of speech called ‘Modal’, quite distinct from Verb.  But not all linguists believed that.  Otto Jespersen (perhaps the greatest grammarian of the first half of the 20th century) had regarded the modals as anomalous tensed verbs.  And by the 1970s various more recent linguists (John R. Ross, James D.  McCawley, and Rodney Huddleston, to name but three) had published arguments that the modals should instead be treated simply as verbs.  Deirdre and I thought this latter Jespersenian view was the correct one.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It cannot be disputed that the modals are highly irregular verbs, of course.  They utterly lack the usual 3rd person singular &lt;i&gt;-s&lt;/i&gt; of regular verbs (it's &lt;i&gt;he may&lt;/i&gt;, not *&lt;i&gt;he mays&lt;/i&gt;).  And they have no plain forms or participles at all — none of what &lt;a href="http://www.cambridge.org/uk/linguistics/cgel"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; calls secondary forms. The modal verbs have only primary (tensed) forms: a present tense form and a preterite form.  Note, for example, the contrast between the regular verb &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; meaning "seal into airtight metal canisters" and the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; we're talking about here, which means "be able to":&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="3"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;small&gt;LEXICAL VERB&lt;/small&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;small&gt;MODAL VERB&lt;/small&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="right" valign="top"&gt;&lt;small&gt;PRESENT TENSE&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We're proud that we &lt;u&gt;can&lt;/u&gt; our own plums every year.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top"&gt; &lt;i&gt;We're proud that we &lt;u&gt;can&lt;/u&gt; take vacations in Europe every year.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="right" valign="top"&gt;&lt;small&gt;PRETERITE TENSE&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We were proud that we &lt;u&gt;canned&lt;/u&gt; our own plums back then.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We were proud that we &lt;u&gt;could&lt;/u&gt; take vacations in Europe back then.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="right" valign="top"&gt;&lt;small&gt;PAST PARTICIPLE&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have often &lt;u&gt;canned&lt;/u&gt; our own plums.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top"&gt; *&lt;i&gt;We have often &lt;u&gt;canned&lt;/u&gt; take vacations in Europe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="right" valign="top"&gt;&lt;small&gt;GERUND PARTICIPLE&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Canning&lt;/u&gt; plums is very pleasant.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top"&gt;*&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Canning&lt;/u&gt; take vacations in Europe is very pleasant.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the notion that the so-called Modal items are really just irregular verbs might be thought to gain a tiny piece of extra support if there are ordinary lexical verbs lacking participles.  It means you have to allow for verbs that have missing parts of their paradigms anyway, regardless of whether you include the modals among the verbs, so it makes the modals look not quite so special among the verbs.  That would be the relevance of discovering a verb that simply didn't have a past participle, which is what &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;stride&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; seemed to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deirdre and I made this point in a 1977 paper (Geoffrey Pullum and Deirdre Wilson, "Autonomous syntax and the analysis of auxiliaries", &lt;i&gt;Language&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;53&lt;/b&gt;, 741-788).  If &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;stride&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; doesn't have a past participle, then a verb without a past participle is not a hitherto unknown circumstance, and thus if the modals all lack past participles it doesn't necessarily mean that they aren't verbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, quite coincidentally, and unknown to us at the time, it turned out that the defectiveness of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;stride&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; had been independently mentioned by Archibald A. Hill in an obituary for Albert Henry Marckwardt published in the very same journal as our paper, &lt;i&gt;Language&lt;/i&gt;, the year before (&lt;b&gt;52&lt;/b&gt; [1976], 667-681 — it appeared after our paper was in press).  Hill had been asked about the missing past participle by Marckwardt some fifty years before. Said Hill: &amp;quot;I have been listening ever since for an example of this curiously non-existent form&amp;quot; (p. 668).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a quarter of a century, and the inflectional morphology chapter of &lt;a href="http://www.cambridge.org/uk/linguistics/cgel"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (page 1605) said that the answer might be &lt;i&gt;stridden&lt;/i&gt; but the form was "very dubious and may not occur".  So various people had been unsuccessfully watching for the occurrence of this word form for at least 70 years. At &lt;a href="http://www.vocaboly.com/forums/ftopic406.html"&gt;Vocaboly&lt;/a&gt; a small amount of subsequent research was done on this by David Picton, who concludes that &lt;i&gt;I have strode&lt;/i&gt; may be taking over from &lt;i&gt;I have stridden&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, Rodney Huddleston, the world's most distinguished English grammarian, recently got back from his vacation in the Andes (his idea of relaxing in his seventies is to hike up to Machu Picchu), and was relaxing a couple of weeks ago by reading a detective novel by Elizabeth George (&lt;i&gt;Careless in Red&lt;/i&gt;, 2008) when he suddenly came upon this (p.109):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#BB0000"&gt;Alan said he'd fetch someone at once to see what Cadan was meant to be doing. He'd stridden off after unlocking the front door, letting them both in, and pocketing the keys with the air of a man who knew exactly where his place was in the scheme of things.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After more than thirty years, Rodney had found a naturally attested example of &lt;i&gt;stridden&lt;/i&gt; (settling the question of whether we were right to say in &lt;i&gt;CGEL&lt;/i&gt; that it "may not occur" anymore: we were not right, it does sometimes occur).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is hardly anything new under the sun, however. Unknown to Huddleston and Palmer, and to me until just the other day when a lucky Google hit turned it up on Jstor, an article had been published on the topic some 28 years ago as a follow-up to Hill's remark: "The past participle of &lt;i&gt;stride&lt;/i&gt;" by H. B. Woolf (&lt;i&gt;American Speech&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;55&lt;/b&gt; [1980], 298-301).  Woolf cites a number of other instances of past participle forms for &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;stride&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that he was able to track down in Merriam-Webster's files.  They confirm the existence of a certain amount of variation and uncertainty.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1902, Merriam-Webster had found a citation of Owen Wister in &lt;i&gt;The Virginian&lt;/i&gt; writing "Illness had stridden upon him", but from 1936 they had found Rebecca West in &lt;i&gt;The Thinking Reed&lt;/i&gt; writing "So from youth he had strode through the twenty-four hours at the pace of a Marathon race".  From 1950 there is a &lt;i&gt;Publishers' Weekly&lt;/i&gt; article with "had strode down the aisle", and from 1951 an essay by Robert Lynd with "had strode past her", but in 1970 they find Loren Eisley writing in &lt;i&gt;Playboy&lt;/i&gt; "he had stridden up the stairs".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the past participle suddenly noticed by Rodney Huddleston, as he sat reading on the back patio of his house overlooking the South Pacific at Noosa in Queensland, was not utterly without precedent. &lt;i&gt;Stridden&lt;/i&gt; does naturally occur, just occasionally.  And it is the commonest form: &lt;i&gt;strode&lt;/i&gt; (universally accepted as the preterite tense form, of course) is somewhat rarer as the past participle according to Woolf (though if &lt;a href="http://www.vocaboly.com/forums/ftopic406.html"&gt;Picton&lt;/a&gt; is right this is slowly changing).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even &lt;i&gt;stridden&lt;/i&gt; is very rare.  I myself had been waiting since the Ford administration to encounter an occurrence on the hoof, in naturally occurring speech or writing, and I still have never spotted or heard one in natural use myself.  Nor have I heard &lt;i&gt;have strode&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one or both are to be counted as occurring in Standard English, there is a tiny little piece of potential support to be subtracted from the case for treating Modals as verbs (though it doesn't matter much: in my view there is a massive case for that analysis anyway).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But looking back, I see that it probably never was good enough evidence.  As our colleague Frank Palmer pointed out to Huddleston and me by email, there is a difference between the modals and the verb &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;stride&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.  When you read something like &lt;i&gt;He'd stridden off after unlocking the front door&lt;/i&gt; you find yourself thinking "Oh, so that's the past participle of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;stride&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;", if you even notice it at all; but if you were to read *&lt;i&gt;He'd mayed work from home since negotiating a telecommuting agreement several months before&lt;/i&gt;, you just think "Unh??".  The former is very rare but we feel it is at least possible; the latter seems impossible. For modals like &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, the participles are not just unusual but absolutely nonexistent and impossible.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there are any lexical verbs that lack certain participles, it is merely by historical accidents of participles falling out of use.  It isn't like that the case of the modals.  They represent a special kind of verb that lacks participles completely, systematically, and irredeemably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

In light of this claim, would some Christians care to give the posters here at DC a working definition of Christianity? Or is there really no standard definition believers can agree on? &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Statements like “It’s a belief in God” or “It’s a belief in Jesus” are so vague that the character Satan could be a Christian too. And again, statements like “It’s trusting Jesus Christ for salvation.” fails too in that hundreds of denominations who believe this attack one another as false religions (some weird oxymoron isn‘t it?).&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A case in point:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A so called “Christian” commenter here at DC who goes by the name Jason tells me there are no righteous dead in Heaven be they Enoch, Elijah, or Moses, neither are there any wicked / unsaved dead in Hell, nor is there any Great White Throne Judgment where the lost or cast into a Lake of Fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Jason can deny clear orthodox Biblical teachings and still be a Christian, exactly how much of the Bible can one deny and still be “saved” or salvation just a subjective term that can have over 20,000 sectarian or denominational meanings which make it basically meaningless?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason has stressed in comments to my posts that the “saved” or “righteous” dead or just like the “lost” or “unsaved” dead; in their graves. So be you Christian or atheist, your fate at death is the grave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By rejecting historical orthodox dogma as traditional historical Christianity has always felt the Bible clearly teaches, is Jason a Christian while John and I never were?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A. What makes one a Christian?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;B. How much of the Bible can one deny and still be a Christian?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;C. What is the difference between historical orthodox doctrinal denial and Biblical denial?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All comments welcomed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Dad of Cameron of &lt;a href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/"&gt;Autism Street&lt;/a&gt;) and Orac. Feel free to tell which parts were written by whom.:-)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Jenny McCarthy's latest book, &lt;em&gt;Mother Warriors: A Nation of Parents Healing Autism Against All Odds&lt;/em&gt;, contains a foreword penned by "pediatrician to the stars' children", &lt;a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Gordon (or, as he often refers to himself, Dr. Jay), is the pediatrician for Jenny McCarthy's son Evan, whose autism McCarthy blames on vaccines and whom she has also claimed to have "cured" of autism with so-called "biomedical interventions. Dr. Gordon has frequently shown up on this blog, mainly to complain piteously whenever he is criticized for being "anti-vaccine" because he not only parrots anti-vaccine pseudoscience but &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/06/green_our_vaccines_celebrity_antivaccina.php"&gt;gives speeches to antivaccine rallies&lt;/a&gt;, along with Jenny McCarthy, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Boyd Haley, and other luminaries of the antivaccine movement. We've never quite understood why Dr. Gordon gets so upset at being labeled "anti-vaccine" when his words are apologetics for the anti-vaccine movement, and his actions give it aid and comfort. If past &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/dr_jay_gordon_pediatrician_to_the_stars.php"&gt;internet exchanges&lt;/a&gt; with Dr. Gordon are any indication, one could expect that this foreword would be replete with pseudoscience and "&lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=106"&gt;brave maverick doctor&lt;/a&gt;" posturing. Readers are not likely to be disappointed in this regard. In fact, Dr. Gordon has surpassed himself in giving in completely to the dark side of the anti-vaccine movement. Aside from completely unsupported claims of fact like, "Vaccines can cause autism," and "hyperbaric oxygen works," to assertions of "tremendous increase in autism," Dr. Gordon has laid out quite a spread of logical fallacies and pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/dr_jay_gordon_pediatrician_warrior.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/dr_jay_gordon_pediatrician_warrior.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/426152953" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224482510888"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/literal_pop.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8cb8c101dd73ad70</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Literal pop</title><published>2008-10-20T06:05:44Z</published><updated>2008-10-20T06:05:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/426086514/literal_pop.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/literal_pop.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the 80s, when MTV actually played music videos, and pop bands all had weird concept videos that didn't seem to have much to do with the song, but were just productions to make you look at them?

CERN, the agency in charge of the LHC, &lt;a href="http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2008/PR14.08E.html"&gt;has released its preliminary findings of what happened&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current flow in the LHC depends critically on it being a superconductor. That means the electricity flows with almost no resistance (think of it like water flowing in a pipe that has no friction). For some reason — why it happened is still unknown — a small patch of resistance developed in the circuit. If left alone, something like this can cause massive damage; for example electricity flow can generate a vast amount of heat in such a patch. However, the LHC automatic safeguards kicked in, and appeared to work as designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However again, an electric arc was triggered, and we’re not talking about a little spark. It was big enough to punch a hole in the  dewars containing the liquid helium needed to cool the magnets down to superconducting temperatures. The helium leaked out, and started to fill a region of the LHC which is supposed to be kept in vacuum. It also leaked out into the tunnel holding the LHC itself, causing some damage to the structure, including partially tearing the 1 ton magnets out of their brackets holding them down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes. So there is some mechanical damage, but it’s limited to where the problem occurred (other magnets appear to be fine). About 30 magnets were damaged, and they lost &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/19/cern-releases-preliminary-failure-analysis/#comment-126814"&gt;about six tons of helium&lt;/a&gt;, which needs to be replaced. The repair will take some time, as will figuring out exactly what happened, and, more importantly, why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re being cautious about this, as you might expect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the cause of the initial growth of connection resistance has not yet been established, and knowing that a similar event has not occurred in the test of all other sectors and of their thousands of connections, it has nonetheless been decided that additional measurements to generate early warnings and interlocks, improvements in pressure relief devices and in external anchoring of the quadrupole [magnet] cryostats with vacuum barrier will be implemented before any further powering of the LHC circuits at high current.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they will proceed carefully, but I’m guessing they will have it up and running in a few months time, certainly sometime next year. This is a major setback for the program, of course, and will cost them time, money, and some PR, no doubt. But they &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; get it back up to speed, and soon they’ll be back in the business of science, poking and prodding the Universe on a quantum scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224469651337"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10900970.post-4502840804067738122">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/59389c848018bc39</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Letter to Editor</title><published>2008-10-19T04:21:00Z</published><updated>2008-10-19T04:21:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2008/10/letter-to-editor.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/" type="html">In response to a letter to the editor titled &lt;i&gt;"Nothing wrong with spiritual values"&lt;/i&gt; in the Toronto Star stating these bits of glorified wisdom:&lt;blockquote&gt;"...in rejecting religion, (&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lionsgate.com/religulous/"&gt;Religulous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; star Bill) Maher merely substitutes his opinion as the true religion...The flawed thinking that we can get by, and even progress, without religion and morals is the very thing that got America and the rest of the world into the current financial mess."&lt;/blockquote&gt;I wrote the following letter:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After reading (the author's) letter of Oct. 7th, 2008, I have to say that I am disheartened.

&lt;p&gt;This question may seem unanswerable, but in this case, McCarthy may have gotten it half right regarding Dennis Leary.  The headline at MSNBC delcares:&lt;strong&gt; McCarthy calls Leary 'obviously stupid'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know much about Leary, but like many comedians he has said something that he will probably regret and move on.  In attempting to be funny, Leary scored an epic fail (you can tell it's an epic fail because Jenny did get it half right):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is a huge boom in autism right now because inattentive mothers and competitive dads want an explanation for why their dumb-ass kids can't compete academically, so they throw money into the happy laps of shrinks . . . to get back diagnoses that help explain away the deficiencies of their junior morons. I don't give a [bleep] what these crackerjack whack jobs tell you - yer kid is NOT autistic. He's just stupid. Or lazy. Or both."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, in or out of context, not very funny.  Autism is a serious neuro-developmental disorder, and his unfunny pseudo-Scientological riff doesn't help advance the cause of autism diagnosis and treatment.  So Jenny is right (if somewhat non-specific and unsophisticated) in calling him "stupid".  But Leary is up against some serious competition, and when it comes to bringing the stupid, no one does it quite like Jenny McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"My fight isn't with Denis Leary, my fight is with the government -- a bigger fish to fry. So I'm still gonna work on the vaccines and I'm still working on pediatricians and Denis Leary can go hopefully be more educated by every mother that stops him from this day forward to give him a piece of their mind," she said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd argue that Leary's comments are an opportunity for public education.  To minimize a public figure's idiotic comments about autism in favor of a fight against "the government and vaccines", is a level of stupid unique to Jenny.  The only conspiracy in Jenny's world is her own conspiracy of ignorance.  He's is a conspiracy that prepares fertile soil for other real conspiracies---those by quacks and charlatans who give parents false hope, steal their money, harm their children, and distract from real autism research.&lt;/p&gt;

The reason? Our friend Davescot confused citrate with the Lac Operon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Davescot Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is contrary to Lenski’s hypothesis that a series of dice throws, each making a small change towards ability to digest &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;lactose&lt;/span&gt; citrate, accumulate until&lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt; lactose&lt;/span&gt; citrate digestion is fully switched on. Darwinian gradualism is denied once again and we see a front loaded genome switch to a new mode of operation through a saltational event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, Davescot made two mistakes in a single posting: first he confused citrate with the Lac operon and secondly, he incorrectly claims that ‘Darwinian gradualism’ is denied once again, because, after all, a stochastic event affects whether E. coli can digest lactose versus glucose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the ID ‘argument’, since chance and regularity can in fact explain the Lac Operon’s switch, any design inference has been prevented. Which is why Davescot, calls it ‘front loading’ or a ‘saltational’ event.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s first spend some time educating our confused Intelligent Design friends about the two studies, one which involve the work by Lenski et al&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zachary D. Blount, Christina Z. Borland, and Richard E. Lenski &lt;strong&gt;Historical contingency and the evolution of a key innovation in an experimental population of Escherichia coli&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.&lt;/em&gt;  June 10, 2008   vol. 105  no. 23  7899-7906 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The role of historical contingency in evolution has been much debated, but rarely tested. Twelve initially identical populations of Escherichia coli were founded in 1988 to investigate this issue. They have since evolved in a glucose-limited medium that also contains citrate, which E. coli cannot use as a carbon source under oxic conditions. No population evolved the capacity to exploit citrate for &amp;gt;30,000 generations, although each population tested billions of mutations. &lt;strong&gt;A citrate-using (Cit+) variant finally evolved in one population by 31,500 generations, causing an increase in population size and diversity&lt;/strong&gt;. The long-delayed and unique evolution of this function might indicate the involvement of some extremely rare mutation. Alternately, it may involve an ordinary mutation, but one whose physical occurrence or phenotypic expression is contingent on prior mutations in that population. We tested these hypotheses in experiments that “replayed” evolution from different points in that population’s history. We observed no Cit+ mutants among 8.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; ancestral cells, nor among 9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; cells from 60 clones sampled in the first 15,000 generations. However, we observed a significantly greater tendency for later clones to evolve Cit+, indicating that some potentiating mutation arose by 20,000 generations. This potentiating change increased the mutation rate to Cit+ but did not cause generalized hypermutability. Thus, &lt;strong&gt;the evolution of this phenotype was contingent on the particular history of that population&lt;/strong&gt;. More generally, we suggest that historical contingency is especially important when it facilitates the evolution of key innovations that are not easily evolved by gradual, cumulative selection.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This paper was also &lt;a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/06/historical-cont.html" rel="external "&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; at Pandasthumb by PZ Myers and by &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn14094-bacteria-make-major-evolutionary-shift-in-the-lab.html" rel="external "&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the paper clearly describes that it is discussing the evolution of E. coli’s ability to digest citrate and not the Lac operon. Then again, scientific accuracy has never been a major concern amongst Intelligent Design Creationists and it help us explore how Intelligent Design fails to gain scientific relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the second paper which discusses the Lac Operon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul J. Choi, Long Cai, Kirsten Frieda, and &lt;a href="http://bernstein.harvard.edu/" rel="external "&gt;X. Sunney Xie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A Stochastic Single-Molecule Event Triggers Phenotype Switching of a Bacterial Cell&lt;/strong&gt; Science 17 October 2008: 442-446. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;By monitoring fluorescently labeled lactose permease with single-molecule sensitivity, we investigated the molecular mechanism of how an Escherichia coli cell with the lac operon switches from one phenotype to another&lt;/strong&gt;. At intermediate inducer concentrations, a population of genetically identical cells exhibits two phenotypes: induced cells with highly fluorescent membranes and uninduced cells with a small number of membrane-bound permeases. We found that this basal-level expression results from partial dissociation of the tetrameric lactose repressor from one of its operators on looped DNA. In contrast, infrequent events of complete dissociation of the repressor from DNA result in large bursts of permease expression that trigger induction of the lac operon. Hence, a stochastic single-molecule event determines a cell’s phenotype.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This paper is also discussed by &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14980-throw-of-a-dice-dictates-a-bugs-life.html?DCMP=ILC-hmts&amp;amp;nsref=news6_head_dn14980" rel="external "&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt; and the reference to the work by Lenski may have confused Davescot. This confusion could have been easily avoided by actually reading the papers involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have established that these were two very different studies: one involving the relevance of historical contingency in the evolution of E. coli’s ability to digest citrate and the other involving the Lac operon switching from Lactose to Glucose digestion, a step which involves a stochastic (chance) component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s address Davescot’s second flawed argument that the switch is a ‘saltational’ event. Let’s first describe the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lac_operon" rel="external "&gt;Lac Operon&lt;/a&gt; in a bit more detail so that we can understand the ID creationist’s confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lac Operon is an operon which controls the switching between glucose and lactose digestion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its natural environment, lac operon is a complex mechanism to digest lactose efficiently. The cell can use lactose as an energy source, but it must produce the enzyme β-galactosidase to digest it into glucose. It would be inefficient to produce enzymes when there is no lactose available, or if there is a more readily-available energy source available (e.g. glucose). The lac operon uses a two-part control mechanism to ensure that the cell expends energy producing β-galactosidase only when necessary. It achieves this with the lac repressor, which halts production in the absence of lactose, and the Catabolite activator protein (CAP), which assists in production in the absence of glucose. This dual control mechanism, along with the ability to use lactose analogues in experiments, has lent itself to be studied in a laboratory setting extensively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lac operon story is pretty straightforward, in the absence of Lactose, a repressor protein, encoded by the Lacl gene, which is always expressed, is allowed to bind with the Lac Operon, inhibiting the expression of the Lac genes. Thus during low Lactose availability, the Lac Operon is turned off. When Lactose is available in sufficiently high concentrations, a lactose metabolite binds with the repressor protein which now cannot block the expression of the Lac operon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is an intermediate condition where both Lactose and Glucose are present. How does E. coli efficiently deal with this situation: if all E. coli switched to Glucose, an important energy source, Lactose, would remain unused, and if all E. coli maintained Lactose, the Glucose energy source would remain unused. But how to achieve this since all the bacteria are copies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terry at Prometheus Untenured &lt;a href="http://tdj.livejournal.com/1616814.html" rel="external "&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="width:606px"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://pics.livejournal.com/tdj/pic/001ptqww" alt="" width="600px" height="136px"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That grey widget shaped like a bone binds the DNA and prevents the operon from being expressed into mRNA. Occasionally one end of it will unbind, and you’ll get a short burst of expression - but even more occasionally, it’ll escape entirely, and once it does it takes a while before it can again “find” the DNA it binds to (by diffusing about randomly), and there are very few of these grey repressors about in the cell. Because of this, there’s an element of chance involved - only some of the cells will have a complete escape followed by a large burst of mRNA. Cleverly, the cell proteins made during that burst of mRNA to tie up the grey repressor so that the cell continues to be lactose-munching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, no saltational events, and in fact no ‘front loading’ either, just an example of a common repressor gene, with a twist that allows the bacteria to benefit in situations where both glucose and lactose are present. Thus resolving a question mentioned on Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The repressor is an allosteric protein, i.e. it can assume either one of two slightly different shapes, which are in equilibrium with each other. In one form the repressor is capable of binding to the operator DNA, and in the other form it cannot bind to the operator. According to the classical model of induction, binding of the inducer, either allolactose or IPTG, to the repressor affects the distribution of repressor between the two shapes. Thus, repressor with inducer bound is stabilized in the non-DNA-binding conformation. However, this simple model cannot be the whole story, because repressor is bound quite stably to DNA, yet it is released rapidly by addition of inducer. Therefore it seems clear that repressor can also bind inducer while still bound to DNA. It is still not entirely known what the exact mechanism of binding is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the authors describe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Why do complete dissociation events give rise to large bursts? Our group has recently shown that if a repressor dissociates from DNA, it takes  a time scale of minutes for the repressor to rebind to the operator because the repressor spends most of its time binding to nonspecific sequences and searching through the chromosomal DNA. In addition, there are only a few copies of the  tetrameric repressors . Such a slow repressor rebinding time, relative to transcript-initiation frequencies, would allow multiple copies of lacY mRNA to be made following a complete repressor dissociation event. Furthermore, in the presence of inducer, the nonspecific binding constant remains unchanged, but the affinity of 
the inducer-bound repressor to the operator is substantially reduced, rendering specific rebinding unlikely. The large burst that results from slow repressor rebinding is an example of how a single-molecule fluctuation under out-of-equilibrium  conditions can have considerable biological consequences, which has been discussed theoretical- 
ly in the context of cell signaling and gene expression but has not previously been experimentally observed. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, once a rare occurrence of full disassociation happens under lactose/glucose conditions, it takes significant time for the repressor to ‘find’ the LacZ site and rebind. During this period of time, the Lac operon expresses significant bursts which then can cause additional binding of the lactose metabolite with the repressor protein and thus the cell switches to Lactose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus, science advances our knowledge while ID? Well, ask yourself how does ID explain this? By confusing it with citrate? Or by calling it ‘saltational’ or even ‘front loading’? What better term to hide one’s ignorance. But remember that they cannot call it ‘design’ since chance and regularity very well explain the Lac Operon’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Davescott Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge John E. Jones on the other hand is a good old boy brought up through the conservative ranks. He was state attorney for D.A.R.E., and Assistant Scout Master… extensively involved with local and National Boy Scouts of America, political buddy of Governor Tom Ridge (who in turnis deep in George W. Bush’s circle of power), and finally was appointed by GW himself. Senator Rick Santorum is a Pennsylvannian in the same circles (author of the “Santorum language”) that encourages schools to teach the controversy) and last but far from least, George W. Bush hisself drove a stake in the ground saying teach the controversy. Unless Judge Jones wants to cut his career off at the knees he isn’t going to rule against the wishes of his political allies. Of course the ACLU will appeal. This won’t be over until it gets to the Supreme Court. But now we own that too.&lt;/p&gt;

 Psychics working for the TruTV (“Not Reality. Actuality.”) network claim to have some very specific information about the abductor of little Madeleine McCann, the four year old English girl who disappeared in Portugal in May 2007. The &lt;a href="http://www.trutv.com/shows/haunting_evidence/about.html"&gt;“Haunting Reality”&lt;/a&gt; program apparently features “psychic profiler Carla Baron, medium John J. Oliver and paranormal investigator Patrick Burns” who, I imagine, make the usual guesses about the nature of various unsolved crimes. But here they have gone further than the usual vague guesses. Get a load of what they claim to know: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;What the abductor looks like – and they have released a drawing of him &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The abductor’s first name, &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The actual address of an apartment where the abductor was supposed to have stopped&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The location of Madeleine’s body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;From the British &lt;a href="http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/66896/EXCLUSIVE-FBI-psychics-turn-up-face-of-Maddy-killer-"&gt;Sunday Express&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, you can read the usual vague guesses that are either trivial or impossible to verify (“He took her to his car. There were people walking who saw him but he just looked as if he was a father carrying a sleeping child and they didn’t take any notice.”) But some of the more specific information was also published. Sensibly, the actual addresses given to police were not reported. The supposed abductor’s drawing &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; published though (which is irresponsible in my view. I refuse to do so, although I have saved the drawing for such time as the actual abductor is caught.) But there were some more specific pieces of information that I want to put on record: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;…the man has a pronounced accent and looks and sounds Middle Eastern, possibly Egyptian, and drives a mid-sized dark silver car with a parking permit or some other identifying sticker inside the windscreen on the driver’s side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[…] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…the man is known as Steve or Stav and took the child to a summer rental apartment in the nearby village of Lagos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[…] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[The abductor had a] dark silver car, which may have had even darker or black trim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Oliver said he believes that the abductor may have stopped briefly at a deserted farmhouse east of the town before driving to his eventual destination – a ­furnished room rented out during the summer in nearby Lagos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;(“May have”? How can they say “may have” if they have given police the actual address?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, here we have a fairly clear cut case with some fairly specific information given by the psychics. A name, a picture, even supposedly two addresses. Let’s see how useful this psychic information turns out to be. Let’s see if “Steve or Stav”, looking like the drawing, is actually found. Let’s see if Madeleine’s body is found where the psychics say it is. Shouldn’t take long. This is a high profile case where this lead will be investigated pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9px;font-family:Trebuchet MS"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e2010535925d60970b-pi" style="float:left"&gt;&lt;img alt="Haunting Evidence" border="0" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e2010535925d60970b-800wi" style="margin:0px 5px 5px 0px" title="Haunting Evidence"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Historical studies are fraught with all kinds of difficulties when it comes to what happened in the past. History does not give up its truths easily. What we have are glimpses and hunches and guesses about a great majority of questions concerning what happened in the past, along with how we can best understand the writings of the past. This is quite evident in what has transpired when it comes to whether Jesus was a historical person who was a failed apocalyptic prophet behind the myths surrounding him. This is obvious to me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is NOT the case then, that God has confirmed his revelation in the past. Even if God did so to the people in the past, this confirmation does nothing for us living in the present. We do not know what to believe even about the most fundamental question for the Christian set of beliefs, i.e., whether or not a historical person named Jesus even existed in the first place. I think he did. But I could be wrong, as I said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I claim it's patently false to say that if someone comes to a different conclusion he is motivated by some sort of desire to reject God. Historians dispute the conclusions of other historians on a host of mundane questions which have nothing to do with the desire to reject God. They just want to know what probably happened, that's all. And since this is the case about mundane questions, it provides strong evidence that it's also the case when it comes to whether or not Jesus existed. Historians who disagree on this question merely disagree, and that's all there is to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, if we can reasonably doubt this fundamental non-miraculous question about the existence of Jesus (which it is) then how much more so will we have doubts about the claims of the miraculous in the past. We dispute the miraculous claims of the present, so how much more is it the case that we doubt the miraculous claims of the past. God has not confirmed to people living in today's world his revelation in the past, period. As an omniscient God he should know better. Is he stupid, or what?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How does the Christian reconcile his or her claim that God is omniscient with the fact that God was stupid with regard to confirming his revelation in the past? I know my answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One Christian answer is that I have made an unreasonable demand upon God. That “God doesn’t do what I want.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In one sense this is true, but I’d rephrase it differently, I’d say God doesn't do what is needed for people like me to believe. The past is irretrievable for the most part. Believers seek merely to confirm what they were raised to believe, including the Mormons, and Muslims. But I need sufficient reasons and sufficient evidence in today's world to believe. This is who God supposedly created me to be as an intelligent human being. I am a person who needs sufficient reasons and evidence to believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, in order to satisfy the demands I have for reasons and evidence as a thinking person, God should’ve met my so-called “demands.” In the first place, either God should've created humans with a greater intelligence to better figure out the mysteries of the faith, like why there is intensive evil if he exists, or how Jesus could be 100% God and 100% man without anything leftover, or how Jesus' death actually atones for our sins....OR he could've explained these mysteries in a "mother of all philosophical papers." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Short of doing that he should've given us sufficient present-day evidence to believe. The location of Lot’s wife who was turned into a pillar of salt, would still be miraculously preserved and known by scientific testing to have traces of female DNA in it. There would be non-controversial evidence that the Israelites lived as slaves in Egypt for four hundred years, conclusive evidence that they wandered in the wilderness for forty years, and convincing evidence that they conquered the land of Canaan exactly as the Bible depicts. But there is none. I could go on and on, but you get the point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I don't think this is an unreasonable request at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another Christian response is that God hides himself…he’s a hidden God. Well, if so, he’s doing a great job of this given the numbers of people who are not Christians.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But why should I believe in a God who hides himself in the bushes, so to speak, and then who will punish us if we don't find him? And how does he expect us to find him if he’s hiding from us. If he fails to show us his true love and we reject him because of the presence of the massive amount of suffering in the world, then we have merely rejected a caricature of him and not the real God. How can he be upset with us for this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One last Christian answer to this problem is that God reveals himself, not through the historical evidence, but through the “inner witness of the Holy Spirit. I’ve recently dealt with this answer &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/10/william-lane-craig-answers-my-follow-up.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/10/william-lane-craig-is-epistemological.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/10/william-lane-craig-is-epistemological_15.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But let me summarize what I’ve said and offer a dilemma for the Christian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What propositional content does this inner witness provide the Christian with?...that Jesus was born of a virgin as a historical person living in the 1st century AD? William Lane Craig claims Christians do not need any other evidence but the inner witness of the Spirit, and that it's rational to believe even if the evidence is against it. Convenient, eh, especially when the Mormons claim the same thing with regard to their faith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best that Alvin Plantinga can say is that IF Christianity is true THEN it's rational to believe. But how does he make the case that Christianity is true? He doesn't even attempt this as far as I can see. Craig does, of course, but his actual case doesn't hold up to the evidence (a subject for another time). But to show Christianity to be true requires dealing with the historical evidence, for no one can come to the conclusion that Jesus was born of a virgin via philosophical argument. This then, is the problem for such an argument. At least that's what I think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, the best that Plantinga can show us is that IF Christianity is true THEN it's rational to believe. But what if his arguments concerning the proper basicality of the God-hypothesis were found to be circular, uninteresting and trivial, or false? Then what? Would you as a Christian still maintain your faith? Does your faith now depend upon his arguments or not? If so, then you believe based upon an argument after all! If not, then what basis do you have for believing?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Friedman&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; op-ed column today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globalization giveth — it was this democratization of finance that helped to power the global growth that lifted so many in India, China and Brazil out of poverty in recent decades. Globalization now taketh away — it was this democratization of finance that enabled the U.S. to infect the rest of the world with its toxic mortgages. And now, we have to hope, that globalization will saveth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three things to comment on here. The use of obsolete verb endings in the first place. Then the extension of them to contexts where they're historically incorrect, as in &lt;em&gt;will saveth&lt;/em&gt; (and by Friedman, an accomplished writer). Finally, the snowclone (actually, snowclone family) GivethTaketh ("X giveth and X taketh away"), which we haven't looked at here on Language Log and doesn't seem to be anywhere in the &lt;a href="http://www.snowclones.org/"&gt;Snowclone Database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Obsolete verb endings (like 3sg &lt;em&gt;-eth&lt;/em&gt;) are often used in attempts to represent the speech or writing of earlier times, but they're also used in a humorous way, conveying mock high seriousness. Friedman's use of &lt;em&gt;giveth&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;taketh&lt;/em&gt; is not quite either of these (I'll get to &lt;em&gt;saveth&lt;/em&gt; in a while): it's presumably intended as a play on the biblical quotation "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the presumed biblical quotation. This is how most people remember it, but as Michael Macrone's &lt;em&gt;Brush Up Your Bible!&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.gracecathedral.org/enrichment/brush_excerpts/brush_20050607.shtml"&gt;excerpted&lt;/a&gt; on the Grace Cathedral website) explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lord Gave, and the Lord Hath Taken Away&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,&lt;br&gt;
And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
– Job 1: 20-21 (KJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will not find the phrase, &amp;quot;The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away&amp;quot; in the King James Bible — nice try with the Renaissance conjugations, but still a misquotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not even clear Job intended to make the sweeping generalization we do. The Hebrew verb translated as "gives" might really mean "gave," in which case Job is talking about only one particular incident, though admittedly it's a doozy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(There are other English variants of the Job quotation, for instance "The lord he giveth, taketh away" &lt;a href="http://www.lortie.net/?p=133"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, popular belief trumps textual accuracy in many circumstances, especially when the popular version can be seen as an "improvement" on the original. So &lt;em&gt;giveth … taketh away&lt;/em&gt; it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Amendment of 20 October: I erred in taking Macrone to be authoritative, so I didn't search for the history of the giveth-taketh version. But others have; the 19 October entry on &lt;a href="http://segalbooks.blogspot.com/"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; takes it back to the service for the burial of the dead in the first Book of Common Prayer (1549). Meanwhile, people on &lt;a href="http://azdak.livejournal.com/66417.html?view=933745#t933745"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; are pillorying me for being arrogant and ignorant.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Friedman didn't stop with the play on the Job quotation. He extended it playfully (possibly hoping to lighten the grim topic a bit), using &lt;em&gt;-eth&lt;/em&gt; as a mere marker of archaism, attaching it even to a base form of a verb (in &lt;em&gt;will saveth&lt;/em&gt;). Modern speakers, for the most part, don't appreciate that &lt;em&gt;-eth&lt;/em&gt; is historically appropriate only for 3sg present tense verb forms, and so use it ornamentally. (More examples to come.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman had &lt;em&gt;globalization&lt;/em&gt; (rather than &lt;em&gt;the Lord&lt;/em&gt;) as the subject of &lt;em&gt;giveth&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;taketh&lt;/em&gt;, which suggests that we're looking at an instance of a snowclone. And so it is. There are several variants. Closest to the Job version: "X giveth (and) X taketh away":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com: The Street Giveth…and the Street Taketh Away: Cat Mother &amp;amp; the All Night News Boys (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Street-Giveth-Taketh-Away/dp/B000001EZ3"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast Giveth—Comcast Taketh Away (&lt;a href="http://www.geofffox.com/MT/archives/2008/09/30/comcast_givethcomcast_taketh_away.php"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed Giveth, The Fed Taketh Away (&lt;a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/96049-the-fed-giveth-the-fed-taketh-away"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;including some with ornamental &lt;em&gt;-eth&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Brother will giveth and Big Brother will taketh away … [base-form -&lt;em&gt;eth&lt;/em&gt;] (&lt;a href="http://www.usavanguard.com/news/2005/04/06/Opinion/Big-Brother.Will.Giveth.And.Big.Brother.Will.Taketh.Away-2620014.shtml"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The nerds giveth and the nerds taketh away. [3pl &lt;em&gt;-eth&lt;/em&gt;] (&lt;a href="http://clicked.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/04/23/935103.aspx"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then without the subject repeated: "X giveth (and) taketh away" (most without the conjunction):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For industrial automation users, technology giveth and taketh away. (&lt;a href="http://www.electronicsnews.com.au/Article/Get-on-the-Bus-USB-in-Industrial-Applications/198261.aspx"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google giveth, taketh away. Pity poor KinderStart.com. (&lt;a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/buzz/archives/102101.asp"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM giveth, taketh away. (&lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/01/19/news/companies/ibm/index.htm"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;including some with ornamental &lt;em&gt;-eth&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Feds Giveth, and Taketh Away [3pl &lt;em&gt;-eth&lt;/em&gt;] (&lt;a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/02/05/edbudget"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Traders Giveth, Taketh Away [3 pl &lt;em&gt;-eth&lt;/em&gt;] (&lt;a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/25379257"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also some more complex cases, but there are a great many like the ones above, based very closely on the Job quotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also examples with a somewhat different pattern: "X giveth with one hand (and) taketh (away) with the other", with many further variants. My favorite example (clearly intended to be funny) so far is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Universe giveth with one hand and bitchslappeth with the other. (&lt;a href="http://chibi-trillian.livejournal.com/192245.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;though this one, with a past participle ornamental &lt;em&gt;-eth&lt;/em&gt; and a base form ornamental &lt;em&gt;-eth&lt;/em&gt; as well, and with &lt;em&gt;giveth&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;taketh&lt;/em&gt; reversed, is pretty good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government has Taketh with one hand and will Giveth with the other in May with the perhaps-very-ill-named Economic Stimulus Act. (&lt;a href="http://www.nolanchart.com/article3491.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of these variants is unclear to me, though the idioms "one hand gives, the other takes (away)" and "to give with one hand and take away with the other" are certainly involved in it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Arnold Zwicky</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224441385320"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/where_will_you_be_after_youre.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5cd5d3279b7f723b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Where will you be after you're dead?</title><published>2008-10-19T19:02:44Z</published><updated>2008-10-19T19:02:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/425675903/where_will_you_be_after_youre.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/where_will_you_be_after_youre.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jesse Bering has an interesting article on &lt;a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=never-say-die"&gt;why many people have so much difficulty holding a realistic view of death&lt;/a&gt; — why they imagine immortal souls wafting off to heaven, and why they can&amp;#39;t imagine their consciousness ceasing to exist. He&amp;#39;s trying to argue that these kinds of beliefs are more than just the result of secondary indoctrination into a body of myth, but are actually a normal consequence of the nature of consciousness. We never personally experience the extinction of our consciousness, of course, except for the limited loss of sleep — and we always wake up from that (at least, until the last time), so we at least have personal evidence that would inductively imply immortality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also a set of beliefs that are remarkably pervasive. Our language and culture and habits of thought make the idea of survival after death continually crop up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/where_will_you_be_after_youre.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/where_will_you_be_after_youre.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/425675903" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224438357038"><id gr:original-id="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/?p=664">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1e9a49cc087da15a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Experts versus Equations</title><published>2008-10-19T16:15:25Z</published><updated>2008-10-19T16:15:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2008/10/19/experts-versus-equations/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Are expert predictions more accurate than predictions generated by computer analysis of data?

&lt;p&gt;In a very short time, you will be given the chance to exercise one of the greatest and gravest responsibilities for citizens of the world's most successful democracy.  On that day, you will be choosing between two candidates, both tireless public servants whose personal stories show our nation's ability to nurture the success of people who have had diverse and remarkable personal journeys.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As often happens during a heated campaign, there has been some divisive rhetoric and appeals to some of our baser natures.  I wish to make it perfectly clear that at a time when our nation engages in its 44th peaceful transition of executive power, in a time of economic uncertainty and international instability, our nation cannot afford to appeal to our lowest common denominator.  In a few months, one of us will sit in the Oval Office and be the chief executive of &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; Americans.  If my journey to this seat of power requires me to appeal to our deepest fears, to mine our deepest prejudices, I do not want your vote.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you vote for me to show your hate of someone else, I do not want your vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you vote for me to show your hate of another group, another religion, another race, I do not want your vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want your vote because you think that my ideas are better.  I want your vote because you agree with my vision for our nation.  I want your vote because of your confidence in me to lead us through these difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want your vote if you are a Christian.  I want your vote if you are a Jew.  I want your vote if you are a Muslim.  I want your vote if you are not religious.  But I don't want your vote if you are voting &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; a particular religion or culture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the personal histories of both of us show, there are many ways to serve.  You can organize your neighborhoods to reduce violence and poverty and home.  You can defend your country as a member of the military.  You can even, from humble beginnings, become a Senator and help make the laws that keep our country great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fellow Americans, in a very few days you will engage in a very simple, yet vital act.  You will elevate one of us to a position of great power and great responsibility.  I encourage you all to look at our words, our deeds, and those of our surrogates.  If you believe in what I stand for, vote for me.  If you do not, vote for my opponent.  But vote you must, as it is your sacred duty as an American. Do not vote for the man you fear least, but the one who can lead you best.  I hope and believe that that man is me, but I respect your choice, as an American, to disagree.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Judith Moore in New Mexico (www.cropcirclesrevealed.com) received information about June 21st at noon being the Time Shift in the Galactic  Mayan Calendar. She was told by the 13 grandmothers that a note would go out creating the sound harmonic that would shift the Earth into the new dimnsion on that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She received information that the Time Shift spoken of in the Galactic Mayan calender will happen on June 21st, 2008 when the harmonic overtone is created. One overtone aligns all the galactic suns, solar codes and the One Harmonic of Source.  There is an essential need for one vibration on this planet to be attuned through the consciousness of the lightbodies that have reached a capacity for harmonic union. Through this communion of souls Earth will be lifted beyond the risk of exceeding her limits to stabilize. There must be one harmonic overtone generated from the masses of Awakened Beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one harmonic overtone must be calibrated in a wave that moves across the planet to create one tone at noon June 21st 2008. One overtone must be created simultaneously to the opening of a solar code from the Great Central Sun. That solar code creates a new language pattern  of quantum mechanics, quantum energy planes.  The tone must be communicated through the Galactic Grail Unified field in harmonic overtone. This tone will be communicated through superconsciousness to six billion humans on the planet creating a wave form that accelerates the space/time continuum of Earth.’ ( by permission Judith Moore )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My request is for the lightworkers of the Earth to unite our hearts  at noon on June 21st 2008 with the intention of shifting Gaia into her New Form of Love, Oneness,  Peace and Harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to use sound, prayer, visualization as your heart calls.Just go into stillness,into your heart and you will hear the note that unites us all in the One Love.  If possible organize groups to meet at that time to amplify the energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my early articles for the NESS (before blogs and podcasts) was about &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/articles.asp?id=30"&gt;The Anatomy of Pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt;, in which I list the typical features of pseudoscience including “Utilize scientific sounding, but ultimately meaningless, language.” I can think of no better example than the e-mail above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not only a feature of good science, but a general intellectual virtue, to be clear and unambiguous language. Language reflects (in fact, shapes) thought and concepts, and our ideas can only be as precise as the language allows. It is therefore important in any intellectual endeavor to use terms that are unambiguous and have a clearly defined meaning. Lacking that, the use of terms should be specifically defined. Occasionally it is even warranted to come up with a new term to represent a more specific concept that current words allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, it is the hallmark of dishonesty and deception to use misdirection and ambiguity in order to confuse and befuddle. Con artists use words like magicians use slight of hand. One form of this verbal legerdemain is to use technical or scientific terminology but in a vague and innappropriate manner. This is crafted to create the impression of deep knowledge and understanding where none exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at all the meaningless terms in the above letter. What, exactly, is a “Time Shift,” “Galactic Grail Unified field in harmonic overtone,” or a “quantum energy plane?” These, of course, mean nothing. But they contain some of the latest scientific jargon that the average person is likely not to understand but will recall vaguely as scientific. In paticular, “unified field” and especially “quantum” are commonly stolen from legitimate scientific theories and sprinkled upon nonsense, like spraying heavy perfume on a pile of donkey turds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more example, check out the link in the e-mail to cropcirclesrevealed. Judith Moore tells us about herself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My          channeled transmissions are telepathically received from the Star Beings,          via Laiolin, a Cosmic Being of Light. She is extraterrestrial and multi-dimensional.          Throughout the years she has referred to communications with the Mother          Ship. She is a member of the Galactic Federation and the Council of Aboraha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mother ship?” Really, is that the best she can do? This is not even original nonsense - it’s just recycled nuggets from the wackiest of new age culture. It is a string of cliches. You can never know what someone really believes, but this is the kind of thing that would be written by someone who is not even trying to be creative. This could be written by someone who has a very low opinion of their “marks” and is just trying to press all the traditional buttons of new age spiritual woo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extreme examples like this are often useful in making a point. Readers should be wary of more subtle forms of using deliberately vague but impressive-sounding words to obfuscate rather than inform. They can be found in advertising, for example, especially of dubious products and services. We are currently in a political cycle in the US, and therefore most of us have been bombarded recently with political speech meant to press our emotional buttons, without saying anything specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The take-home message is that while confronting any claim it is a good practice to demand clear and unambiguous definition of all terms and phrases. It is a necessary solid foundation upon which to build, rather than the shifting sands of pseudoscientific babble.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224426739028"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-376523731784691470">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4d69908c9af479ea</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Death to Apostates?</title><published>2008-10-19T13:37:00Z</published><updated>2008-10-19T22:27:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/10/death-to-apostates.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/376523731784691470/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=376523731784691470" title="3 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> There was a conference in the UK where a number of former adherents of Islam talked about the fact that rejecting Islam is a very serious offense.

&lt;p&gt;I may regret this in the morning, but here goes…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.printculture.com/item-1844.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/thumb_20080317-vampirella.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Because reedbraden thought that &lt;em&gt;monsters, magic, and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;boobs&lt;/em&gt; was the topic of my previous post I would like to point out that all three of these things &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; available in fantasy and scifi, in any combination that you like. I have my own boobs, so I’m not generally on the lookout for boobs in fiction, however. But since it was brought up, I figured I’d look into it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not surprised to discover that vampire stories, especially, are rife with female breasts. I found this out simply by searching for “vampire boobs” and “sexy vampires” in Google. Some of the interesting (possibly more interesting for those of you who don’t have your own boobs) things I discovered are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 2004 film, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sexy-Adventures-Helsing-Vampires-Seduction/dp/B0002IQD4W"&gt;Sexy Adventures of Van Helsing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.desolateangels.net/"&gt;Desolate Angels&lt;/a&gt;, the illustrations of Greg Louden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://paranormalromanceblog.wordpress.com/2008/01/29/why-are-vampires-such-popular-heroes/"&gt;What Makes Vampires Sexy?&lt;/a&gt; on Harlequin’s Paranormal Romance blog (yes, this is real!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed that in recent fiction, vampires have become able to have sex. In the older vamp novels I read, such as &lt;a href="http://www.annerice.com/Bookshelf-VampireChronicles.html"&gt;Ann Rice’s classics&lt;/a&gt;, the vampire feeding frenzy was akin to orgasm and vampires were not able to have intercourse with each other or with humans. That’s changed in recent fictions such as &lt;a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/moonlight/"&gt;Moonlight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.twilightthemovie.com/"&gt;Twilight&lt;/a&gt; (hope that’s not a spoiler for anyone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interesting (to me anyway, since, as I’ve said, I have my own boobs so I don’t need to obsess about vampire boobs so much, which is not to say that I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; fantasized about vampire boobs), I have also noticed that in recent vampire stories, there is an attempt to create scientific explanations for vampirism based on medicine and genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t entirely new. The oldest story I’m aware of that uses this technique, rather than supernaturalism, to explain vampires is the 1954 novel, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Legend"&gt;I Am Legend&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt; series does the same thing. What seems like magic to unsuspecting humans is explained by science by the vampires. There’s not &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; actual science in the books, but the idea that things need to be explained scientifically is prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being that it’s me writing, thoughts about vampirism inevitably lead to thoughts about Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both magic and a need to rationalize have also become part of Christian fundamentalism over the past few decades. In the late 70s and early 80s, I was involved in what was called the Word of Faith movement. In this flavor of fundyism, we believed that whatever we said would come to pass. That belief came from the Bible verse where Jesus said, “If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.” Many mainstream and fundamentalist groups condemn the Word of Faith movement for being a kind of practical magic. But even though they outwardly reject the doctrine, it seems like most fundy groups have adopted it, perhaps unconsciously. We can even see this type of thinking in George W. Bush’s way of saying only what he wants to be true. It is like the power of positive thinking on steroids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, and ironically at the same time, rationality, or the need to have science back up beliefs, has also become a part of fundamentalism, and this is why places like the &lt;a href="http://www.creationmuseum.org/"&gt;Creation Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;s&gt;Kansas&lt;/s&gt; Kentucky and the &lt;a href="http://www.icr.org/"&gt;Institute for Creation Research&lt;/a&gt; in California exist. In a way, this need for scientific validation is historically a part of Christianity, and it heeds back to the Catholic church’s beef with Galileo. In another way, this is a new way to look at faith, where mysticism must submit to logic. Although many of the premises on which this new Christian logic is built are faulty, the ideal of building a philosophy on a foundation of science is sound. I often wonder whether this desire can be used to create a form of Christianity (or religion in general) that is not based on belief in the supernatural, but rather on an appreciation for all that is natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, enough musings for today. As usual, I have more questions than answers. Go enjoy some vampire boobs, sink into philosophical thought, or visit your local church. Whatever floats your boat. Happy Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>writerdd</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224424890671"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/radio_reminder_31.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e4edc838ed6e6cd9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Radio reminder</title><published>2008-10-19T14:31:17Z</published><updated>2008-10-19T14:31:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/425476541/radio_reminder_31.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/radio_reminder_31.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Don't miss this one!

If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.” So, on the one hand we are told God loves the world only to be again told for Christians not to love the love. Since, in both cases the Greek word here is κόσμον, one is feed a flat out contradiction especially in light of the statement of Jesus “Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” Perfection is not contradiction!&lt;br&gt;Secondly, if God really loves the world, he would not have destroyed it in the flood of Noah. Love and destruction are totally antonyms.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deception 2:&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;em&gt;that He gave His only begotten Son,&lt;/em&gt; (In Genesis 6:2 we are clearly told: “that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose.” Just as the Hebrew states: בְנֵי־הָאֱלֹהִים וַיִּרְאוּ God already had “sons” plural! So one must wondered, even if the Hellenistic Greek writer of John did not understand the Hebrew text, he surly had the LXX which clearly states “οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ θεοῦ”. While Christians get all choked up about God giving his only son, Jesus, they need to read and believe their Bibles more!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deception 3:&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;em&gt;that whoever believes in Him shall not perish,&lt;/em&gt; (The problem posed here is the fact that orthodox Christian dogma states ( as based on Jesus and the New Testament) that the soul of the non-believer will suffer for eternity in the fires of torment. The Greek word here is “ἀπόληται” clearly means “to destroy fully (reflexively, to perish, or lose), literally or figuratively -- destroy, die, lose, mar, perish”. So which is it?  The dead according to both atheists and Jehovah Witnesses are simply fully destroy meaning no eternal soul / nothingness. So, we could say that John 3:16 supports the ahteist view of life too!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deception 4:&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;em&gt;but have eternal life.&lt;/em&gt; (The propaganda sold in this verse is to an ancient world where the average person making it to the age of 30 was considered old where a simple abscessed tooth could mean certain death, to work miracles and not die was to be like the gods themselves (to argue that “ζωὴν αἰώνιον” means that the dead believer lives forever in Heaven is not only a contradiction of terms, but really begs the question all over again as to what not being destroyed and living forever plainly means). When one considers the older Hebrew stories of Enoch, Moses and Elijah along with the Greek story of the miracle worker Apollinus of Tyana who is claimed also to have never died. The false claim in eternal life in John 3:16 is given even more credence as it was preached to the superstitious and mostly literate masses of the Greco-Roman empire to gain fast converts in a ancient world that swam in a sea of religions and promises of hope. End the end, it was Christianity which out sold its fellow religions with verses like John 3:16 which gave more hope to its superstitious world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, we must understand that hope need not be true; it only needs to be hope; thus John 3:16!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The case is now at the Supreme Court after an appeals court said that the Hutterians were within their constitutional rights to be pic-free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To get this privilege you have to prove your membership in a registered religious organization and provide, &lt;i&gt;"actual scriptural passages"&lt;/i&gt; to support your request.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, what is this &lt;i&gt;"scriptural passage"&lt;/i&gt; stuff?  For the Hutterians, it's nothing less than the damn second commandment from the damn Bible!  Yeah, of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_CommandmentsAl"&gt;10 Commandments&lt;/a&gt;.  For those not in the know, that's the &lt;i&gt;"make none of them goddamn graven, idol type images"&lt;/i&gt; commandment.  No images of anything that layeth upon the Earth.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Ok, so I found where it actually says that you should make no:&lt;blockquote&gt;likeness of what is in Heaven above or on earth beneath or in the water....&lt;/blockquote&gt;So there.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking a picture of yourself is, apparently, making an idol (much to Simon Cowell's copyright chagrin).  I really don't want to slippery-slope this, but, I mean, if you made a shirt out of sheep's wool with some dandy bone buttons, good on you.  That shirt would now, however, be an object "on earth".  But...if you were to tear that shirt and needed a new one, would you be able to make another?  Wouldn't that new shirt be a copy of an object on earth?  Somebody straighten me out here because this just sounds retarded.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be clear, I'm not a fan of excessive security.  The airports are ridiculous now, banning goddamn toothpaste.  However, with so many drivers and so much potential for abuse (not by the Hutterites, by other assholes pretending to be Hutterites), having a photo driver's license is something I agree with...just in case you were about to give a shit about what I think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one is hindering the Hutterians ability to practice their religion, but at what point do we, as a rational society, get to say, &lt;i&gt;"Ok, we understand that you think pictures are bad, but your beliefs are ludicrous."&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check this out though:&lt;blockquote&gt;(The) Canadian Civil Liberties Association, maintains that “tearing apart the fabric of a religious community and ending their communal way of life exacts too high a price for the benefit of including 252 Hutterites in Alberta's data base.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;How in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;fuck&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is getting them to have a picture on their driver's licenses going to possibly, in any way at all, "end(ing) their communal way of life"?  Overstate much?  These folks are fine, but what they believe is demonstrably stupid, so put on your helmets and get with the program.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really see no difference between this an a grown man saying, &lt;i&gt;"Well, I can't go into the DMV to get my photo done because my religious beliefs are such that I know the floors of all DMVs are lava.  Sure, everyone else walks on the floors, but to &lt;b&gt;ME&lt;/b&gt;, they're lava."&lt;/i&gt;  We, as a society, are treating this as if it has some intellectual merit and are "respecting their religious beliefs."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, we're caving in to silliness.  Practice whatever stupid ass, archaic, Bronze-age retardedness you want - power to you - but when you show up to the rest of us grown-ups and demand that we respect your crazy beliefs, don't be shocked when we giggle, pat your head, and ask you to either play by the rules or go home.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the point (in &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=732#comment-11330"&gt;responding&lt;/a&gt; to another comment) that "there were historically two distinct endings, a present participle suffix -inde or -ende and a nominalizing suffix -ung. These merged to -ing in certain middle-class dialects, while remaining separate in both lower-class and (until recently) aristocratic forms of English".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Kabala asked: "&lt;em&gt;How hard is the evidence in favor of the statement than &amp;quot;g-dropping&amp;quot; is really &amp;quot;non-g-adding?&amp;quot; It seems remarkable to me that such a wholesale revolution in pronunciation […] could (at least in reading aloud and most formal speech) conquer so thoroughly. Gerunds and particuiples (unlike &amp;quot;often&amp;quot; and even more unlike &amp;quot;forte&amp;quot;) are used so frequently that it surprises me that there is not more of a mark in the historical record of a linguistic dispute of such importance.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change is amply documented in the historical record. But there was no &amp;quot;dispute&amp;quot;, because this happened before the time when people argued — at least in public — about whose version of the English language was correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the OED's etymology for -ing&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;suffix forming verbal derivatives, originally abstract nouns of action, but subsequently developed in various directions: […] In OE. the more usual form was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;-ung&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; (inflected &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;-unge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;), but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;-ing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; also was frequent, esp. in derivatives from original &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;ja-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; verbs […] In early ME., &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;-ung&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; rapidly died out, being scarcely found after 1250, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;-ing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; (in early ME. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;-inge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;) became the regular form.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from the discussion of -ing&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;suffix of the present participle, and of adjs. thence derived, or so formed; an alteration of the original OE. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;-ende&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; […] Already, in later OE., the ppl. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;-ende&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; was often weakened to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;-inde&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;, and this became the regular Southern form of the ending in Early ME. From the end of the 12th c. there was a growing tendency to confuse &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;-inde&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;, phonetically or scribally, with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;-inge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;; this confusion is specially noticeable in MSS. written by Anglo-Norman scribes in the 13th c. The final result was the predominance of the form &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;-inge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;, and its general substitution for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;-inde&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; in the 14th c.  […] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy Vaughn's &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=733#comment-11340"&gt;comment on another post&lt;/a&gt; is relevant here: "&lt;em&gt;I was really interested to notice that Old Sportscaster Sarah Palin's g-dropping seems to be restricted to verbs only - so we get doin' and hittin', but fighting and training. This interests me because I come from a region of the US where dropping gs is fairly commonplace if not standard, but I can't recall whether or not it is universal to all occurrences of -ing or restricted to verbs like Palin's seems to be."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't looked in detail at the videos in question, but this sounds like the traditional form of "g-dropping", where the -in' form is limited to the verbal participles, and the -ing form is retained for deverbal nouns. I don't know the geographical and social history in detail, but apparently the 14th-century merger took place in southern England, and was resisted in the north and in Scotland (though the modern forms in Scots are -an and -in, at least according to the OED's description).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A form of the older distinction was also retained throughout England by the rural "huntin' and fishin'" aristocracy. In a post a few years ago ("&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000878.html"&gt;The Internet Pilgrim's Guide to G-dropping&lt;/a&gt;", 5/10/2004), I quoted a passage from John Galsworthy's 1931 novel &lt;em&gt;Maid in Waiting&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;'Where on earth did Aunt Em learn to drop her g's?'&lt;br&gt;
'Father told me once that she was a school where an undropped "g" was worse than a dropped "h". They were bringin' in a country fashion then, huntin' people, you know.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this pattern is the historically older, more conservative one, it&amp;#39;s a plausible joke to call it &amp;quot;non-g-adding&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;g-dropping&amp;quot; — though again, nothing is being either added or dropped except in the spelling.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224377990840"><id gr:original-id="tag:typepad.com,2003:post-57185485">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fa7c70d43a63f89a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Anti-Vaccination Hysteria" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Autism" scheme="http://sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><category term="Jenny McCarthy" scheme="http://sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><category term="Vaccines" scheme="http://sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><title type="html">Stop Jenny McCarthy</title><published>2008-10-19T00:37:51Z</published><updated>2008-11-03T00:50:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/10/stop-jenny-mccarthy.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/10/stop-jenny-mccarthy.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" xml:lang="en-US" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com/" style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Stop jenny mccarthy" border="0" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e201053597671d970c-800wi" title="Stop jenny mccarthy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Becoming a parent of an autistic child is a huge job, but that does not make Jenny&amp;#39;s google research and interpretation of the experiences more valid than others who have had the same experiences and come to different conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ask that Jenny re-evaluate her assertions, and ask all parents to learn about the issue in depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A nice idea but somehow I don&amp;#39;t think she will &amp;quot;re-evaluate her assertions,&amp;quot; because they are just that - assertions.  Jenny&amp;#39;s views on vaccines were not arrived at following a rational review of the evidence.  And that which is not arrived at through reason is unlikely to be reasoned away.  Still, I think the idea of the Stop Jenny McCarthy site is a good one - not to &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot; her per se, but at least to provide a site that will counter Jenny&amp;#39;s ridiculous claims for anyone who is actually researching the topic.  (You know Oprah won&amp;#39;t do it.)  In future, anyone Googling &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com/"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; will now find at least &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; site presenting facts and rationality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224375956860"><id gr:original-id="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=76">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bb7926eefa984499</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Easy marks"/><category term="Miseducation"/><title type="html">Shocking ignorance</title><published>2008-10-19T00:25:32Z</published><updated>2008-10-19T00:25:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=76" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://autism-news-beat.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shock comedian Denis Leary does not learn from other people’s mistakes. It seems he would know better than to insult autistic children after the shellacking that shock jock Michael Savage took for a similar rant just three months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his new book, &lt;a href="http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/books/1224488,CST-FTR-autism16.article"&gt;Leary writes&lt;/a&gt; parents “want an explanation for why their dumb-ass kids can’t compete academically,” so they consult psychologists. “I don’t give a fuck what these crackerjack whack jobs tell you, yer kid is NOT autistic. He’s just stupid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=70#more-70"&gt;Savage said&lt;/a&gt; in July:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ll tell you what autism is. In 99 percent of the cases, it’s a brat who hasn’t been told to cut the act out. That’s what autism is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savage’s vapid analysis was met with howls of protest from parents and autism advocacy groups, and sponsors fled his insipid Savage Nation radio show. Parents and advocacy groups also piled on Leary, exposing his ignorance and selfishness. Leary quickly held a press conference so he could explain that by “kids” he really meant “adults”, then he plugged his book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proving that there’s plenty of ignorance to go around, &lt;a href="http://www.myfoxboston.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=7655202&amp;amp;version=1&amp;amp;locale=EN-US&amp;amp;layoutCode=VSTY&amp;amp;pageId=1.1.1"&gt;a Boston Fox News affiliate&lt;/a&gt; turned to Mark Blaxill, a biased and ill-informed anti-vaccine activist for a “fair and balanced” view on Leary’s skewed world view. Blaxill is vice president of &lt;a href="http://www.safeminds.org/home/about.html"&gt;Safe Minds&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit organization that falsely characterizes autism as “a novel form of mercury poisoning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blaxill believes that we are in the throes of an autism epidemic. In fact, nearly everything he says assumes that is true. “The reality of the autism epidemic is very, very real,” he told the equally credulous reporter. “And to make light of that is really a bad idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Blaxill has been making light of published science for years, as he tap dances around inconvenient facts and reams of data. Speaking at an &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbgw41OAk7E"&gt;AutismOne media roundtable discussion&lt;/a&gt; last spring, Blaxill called on his favorite straw man when asked to defend the epidemic - “There is (sic) no data that it’s better diagnosis. That’s just something people say to make themselves feel better,” said Blaxill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blaxill is partly right. Changes in diagnostic criteria alone are not enough to explain the rise is autism. But nobody is saying that. D’oC at Autism Street explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classic straw man argument. No one is saying that it’s only better diagnosis - so it’s unlikely that there would be any data presented to that effect - ever. What’s being said is that there is no evidence of any autism “epidemic”, and that better, earlier, and very different diagnoses are taking place than in previous years. Here’s a quick summary of my take on what’s really being said by the scientific community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. There is no scientific evidence of an autism “epidemic” - not from CDDS autism caseload data, not from special education data, and not from the descriptive epidemiology.&lt;br&gt;
2. The diagnostic criteria have changed.,&lt;br&gt;
3. Average age of diagnosis is decreasing.&lt;br&gt;
4. Better awareness and recognition are likely (if not certain).&lt;br&gt;
5. Diagnostic substitution has taken place.&lt;br&gt;
6. There are probably numerous other factors influencing the number of autism diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropologist and author Richard Grinker &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/2007-06/radford.html"&gt;makes a more thorough case&lt;/a&gt; against the epidemic in his book&lt;em&gt;Unstrange Minds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blaxill’s argument for an autism epidemic comes down to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you believe that it’s always been with us then, something, a population epidemiologist, or a population statistician once calculated that were, before 1930, there were, uh, a 100 billion born, in the history of the world. Homo Sapiens. You know, rough calculation. If you take 30 per 10,000, 60 per 10,000, 70 per 10,000 that means that before Leo Kanner discovered autism, there would have been 300 million, 600 million, 700 million people born in the history of the world with autism. You don’t miss these children, you don’t miss these people. Where were these people before 1930? They did not exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not very convincing. Most of the people who ever walked the earth lived out their nasty, brutish, short lives before Columbus set sail. It’s hard for us pampered moderns to really understand what life was like before antibiotics, vaccines, public sanitation, refrigeration, and surgery, much less even a rudimentary understanding germs, nutrition and disease processes. The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_mortality_rate_(2005)"&gt;worst infant mortality&lt;/a&gt; rate today for children under five is 28%. What chance would a two-year-old with classic autism have in, say, a 12th century peasant family in northern Europe? Or a west African hunter gatherer clan? Furthermore, he conflates classic autism, which comprises one-third of the autism spectrum, with higher functioning forms such as Asperger’s syndrome. Blaxill’s “evidence” is ludicrous, sloppy, and dishonest.&lt;/p&gt;

Usually along the lines of “are you good in bed?” or “is your career stalling?” they offer the unsuspecting a reader a summary and sage advice from someone who is presumably Hugh Hefner. Stereotypes are often true &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt;, but individually, rarely are. So to force us into a stereotype and, worse, make a judgement on it, based on a multiple choice quiz is a half-step from astrology and a quarter-step from pointless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Which is precisely why it’s hilarious fun to make a skeptic one! What better way to parody dumbass quizzes while also acknowledging that they’re curiously fun to take? Without further ado, I present…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How &amp;quot;spooky&amp;quot; &lt;a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1804838.ece"&gt;is this&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1804838.ece"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/10/pareidolia_aquarium.jpg" alt="Face in the tank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story, &amp;quot;reported&amp;quot; by The Sun, says that a woman took this picture at an aquarium in Hull, East Yorkshire, using a phone cam, and that she only noticed the face when she got home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we all know how much I love pareidolia, the psychological ability for humans to see faces in random patterns. But look at that one! We see hair, eyes, nose, mouth, cheeks, even ears, and they’re all in the right place! So is this pareidolia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update: ScottH, in the comments below, shows pretty conclusively that this is a fake, a Photoshop. My conclusions about it being a reflection in the next paragraph are, evidently, in error.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be easy to say that maybe the woman who took the picture is putting us all on, that this is a hoax. But honestly, isn’t it a little bit likely that there was someone else at the aquarium that day, maybe standing behind her, whose face was reflected in the glass? Note that the face is looking up. What’s the most obvious thing in the overall picture? A shark swimming… and note too that we see its belly, meaning anyone standing there would be &lt;em&gt;looking up&lt;/em&gt; at the shark. It’s blue because the water is blue; a white face reflected in the glass would have the blue glow of the water diffused through it. Etc. etc. A reflection explains every single aspect of this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… except for the breathless headline and uncritical reporting. The first paragraph of the tabloid article says, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT’S just what you’d expect to see in a snap from an aquarium. A shark, blue water — and a disembodied HUMAN HEAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Disembodied?&amp;quot; O RLY? How did the writer come to that conclusion? The picture cuts off right where the neck would be, so saying this is disembodied is a stretch to say the least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really obviously just a reflection of another aquarium-goer. And as dumb as this is, I am spending time on it to remind you, my dear BABloggees, that this is what counts for news in many papers. The Sun is a notoriously bad paper, akin to the Weekly World News or The Star: gossip, photoshop, and dumbosities. But this kind of stuff is reported in the mainstream media as well — remember the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=gas+station+ghost"&gt;gas station ghost&lt;/a&gt; (which turned out to be an insect illuminated by IR LEDs and rendered blue by the IR capabilities of the camera)? Or any of the dozens of Virgin Mary/Jesus/Allah sightings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as this stuff is reported uncritically, we all have our average credulity magnified, and our ability as a group to think critically decreased.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr Imad Hassan  claims to have &lt;a href="http://www.shajaracode.com/index.html"&gt;proven Darwinian theory from the Qur'an and the Bible&lt;/a&gt;. Only…his version of Darwinian theory is a bit eccentric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we disclosed that the word 'Adam' is a simple Arabic term for 'convertible' or 'adaptable'. It is a collective description by God in the scriptures for a species of lower creatures which became 'adaptable' for radical change after long evolutionary processes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We followed the description of modifying the 'Adams' and arrived at the conclusion that there were many individuals, males and females, who were converted to intelligent 'humans' by direct detailed divine intervention. This is the missing link in Darwin 's theory!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The 'Adams' were then given an induction period in the divine custody, in a specific garden on the earth, a few miles away from the location of conversion which was the same location where the first ever living cell was created! In their induction period, the 'Adams' were allowed freedom except from approaching the forbidden tree, which is 'Shajara' in Arabic! As a result of their failure to keep the commands, some of the female 'Adams' got pregnant from 'eating' from the Shajara! The whole group was then expelled to take the role for which they were created as intelligent beings on the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think this is awfully unlikely, if you didn't know that Darwin was inspired by Muslim philosophers, that he had access to a decrypted series of messages from the Qur'an, and in fact &lt;a href="http://www.shajaracode.com/pageID_4689899.html"&gt;died a Muslim&lt;/a&gt;, something we noisy atheists don't recognize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In his new delusional short-sighted religion, Richard Dawkins has adopted the work of Charles Darwin as the prophetic message on which the new dogma - 'There is no God' - is based. Despite the apparent respect and appreciation of his work, no one could harm Darwin as much as those who unlawfully associate his name with their atheism. The idea of Charles Darwin of the 'Evolution and the law of natural selection' was an 'evolution' of ancient Islamic theories, not innovation! In his Creation and/ Or Evolution, T O Shanavas provided enough evidence that: attributing the concept of evolution to Darwin alone is a 'gigantic rip off'! Over 800 years ago, Ibn Arabi proposed the idea that the monkey was the last animal and first human in the evolution ladder. It was Darwin 's grandfather who studied these ancient Islamic theories that inspired Chares to find the proof for that. Charles Darwin was so honest that he described only what he could proof, leaving the missing link very prominent in his incomplete evolutionary work. That missing link, to the dismay of Dawkins who misused the work of Darwin , is now confidently and astonishingly proved by the very God that Dawkins struggled to deny. The process of evolution is described in a series of coded messages in the Qur'an, the divine book that somebody like Dawkins would be too reluctant to challenge, as he can only challenge the man-made, outdated misconceptions attributed to God in the translated Bibles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Just by way of a footnote to &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=732#more-732"&gt;that post&lt;/a&gt;, I did &lt;a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nunberg/authenticity.html"&gt;a "Fresh Air"&lt;/a&gt; piece on accent and authenticity last week which ended with some comments on the development of Palin's g-dropping (with video clips) and concluded she has learned over the years to do it in roughly the same sorts of contexts that Obama does. Here's the last part of that piece:&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a part of our moral slang, &lt;em&gt;authentic &lt;/em&gt;is laced with condescension. It usually implies quaintness or local color — it&amp;#39;s a word we use for creole cooking, not haute cuisine. And when people talk about authentic accents they&amp;#39;re not thinking of the way people speak on the TV news or middle-class suburbs, but of the speech in places like South Philly and Fargo, not to mention Hot Springs, Arkansas and Wasilla. Nobody would ask whether Brian Williams&amp;#39;s accent is authentic– actually a lot of people would say he doesn&amp;#39;t have an accent at all. (When I hear someone described as having no accent, I think of those pinkish Crayola crayons we used to have that were labeled &amp;quot;flesh.&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;So like Bill Clinton, Palin can signal authenticity simply by refashioning her original accent, rather than acquiring a new one. You can actually hear how this developed if you pull up the Youtube video of Palin as a 24-year-old Anchorage sportscaster fresh from her broadcasting classes in college. She wasn't in control of her accent back then: she scattered the desk with dropped &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;'s: "Purdue was killin' Michigan"; "Look what they're doin' to Chicago."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/WehZBADtyjw%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=311&amp;amp;height=251" width="311" height="251"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;It's strikingly different from the way she talks now in her public appearances, not just because she's much more poised, but because she's learned how to work it. When she talks about policy, her &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s are decorously in place — she never says &amp;quot;reducin&amp;#39; taxes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;cuttin&amp;#39; spendin.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt; 									&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/njBh3lKa6tQ%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=311&amp;amp;height=251" width="311" height="251"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;But the g&amp;#39;s disappear when she speaks on behalf of ordinary Americans — &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DQQqZ7ay9INg%26feature%3Drelated&amp;amp;ei=_Uf1SNvILoK2sQO7ufiYDA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGCigkNPl6b0WzBFexdNA32U184uQ&amp;amp;sig2=YYkGJ03Ci_a6SmTs4vlhpw"&gt;Americans are cravin' something different&lt;/a&gt;" or "People… are hurtin' 'cause the economy is hurtin'." It's of a piece with the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;you betchas, doggones and the other effusions that are meant to signal spontaneous candor.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt; 								&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/QoyF-8ZwU_g%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=311&amp;amp;height=251" width="311" height="251"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Now there are clearly a lot of people who find this engaging, but I can't imagine that anybody really supposes it's artless. What it is is a stone-washed impersonation of a Mat-Su Valley girl. I wouldn't be surprised if Palin and her friends perfected this way back in high school. There's no group that's so unselfconscious that its members don't get a kick out of parodying their own speech: most Brooklynites do a very creditable Brooklyn, and every Valley girl can do a dead-on Valley girl. And with all credit to Tina Fey, she wouldn't be so brilliant at doing Sarah Palin if Sarah Palin weren't so good at doing herself.&lt;/p&gt;

At 103 beats per minute, the Bee Gee’s disco hit “Stayin’ Alive” has almost the perfect rhythm for CPR chest compressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;border:10px solid black" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/blog-images/SaturdayNightFever_300x298.jpg" alt="Stayin Alive"&gt;The University of Illinois medical school recently did a small study where both doctors and students maintained almost the ideal number of chest compressions per minute while listening to the song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association recommends 100 bpm for CPR chest compressions.  Following the study, and without the music, students were achieving an average of 109 bpm.  Dr. David Matlock from the University of Illinois said that this is more than recommended but that when it comes to trying to revive a stopped heart, a few extra compressions per minute is better than too few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Matlock plans to present his findings at an American College of Emergency Physicians meeting in Chicago this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association has been using the song for the last two years as a training tip for CPR instructors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vinay Nadkarni said “Stayin’ Alive work wonders in classes where students were having trouble keeping the right beat while practicing on mannequin” When he turned on the song, “all of a sudden, within just a few seconds, they get it right on the dot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of this discovery I’d like to share my list of close-to 100 bpm songs that would ironically also work with this technique&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one Bites the Dust - Queen&lt;br&gt;
Where Could I go but to the Lord - Elvis Presley&lt;br&gt;
Goodbye Cruel World - Pink Floyd&lt;br&gt;
Heart Attack Man - Beastie Boys&lt;br&gt;
Wake Up Dead - U2&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy is a genius, I just about plotzed, and the narration by Patrick Stewart is awesome.  I also love it in terms of what denialism blog has always talked about.  The problem with the people who believe this stuff is that they simply have no gauge of reality, no ability to judge what evidence makes sense or not.  Shirley beats them over the head with this fact for hours at a time and they just can't figure it out.  True, it's sad, but damn is it funny.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/dont_let_him_defecate.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/424681228" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224339665353"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/orac_gets_more_mail_how_could_natural_se.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d4b275490382bfb4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Saturday morning mailbagl: How could natural selection "do it" without some intelligence?</title><published>2008-10-18T14:47:20Z</published><updated>2008-10-18T14:47:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/424633752/orac_gets_more_mail_how_could_natural_se.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/orac_gets_more_mail_how_could_natural_se.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Orac gets e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of it's just brief notes with a link that someone thinks I should check out (and possibly blog about). Even though I occasionally make sarcastic remarks about being deluged with one story or other from time to time, I actually do appreciate those. Many have been the times when I didn't really have anything that floated my boat enough to blog about that a juicy tidbit sent by a reader prevented the blog from going dark for a day. Whether that's always a good thing, I leave to the reader to judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, I get mail profusely praising the blog. Affectation of an egomaniacal computer from a late 1970s British science fiction show notwithstanding, my first thought in receiving such e-mail is the famous line from &lt;em&gt;Wayne's World&lt;/em&gt;: "We're not worthy, we're not worthy!" Whether I'm worthy or not, Ieave to the reader to judge. Not surprisingly, given the prickly nature of the Orac blog persona, some mail is equally profusely negative, often with numerous spelling errors, long sections of ALL CAPS, and references to homeopathy curing cancer and suggestions that God will strike me down one day. (Given that we all eventually die, doesn't that mean God, if he exists, eventually strikes each and every one of us down, regardless of our righteousness as perceived by fundamentalist loons?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then occasionally  I get mail like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/09/weekend_mailbag_orac_is_a_bad_bad_man.php"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Or like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/orac_gets_more_mail_how_could_natural_se.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/orac_gets_more_mail_how_could_natural_se.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/424633752" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224335820959"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-6783490481487066318">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/37b5d7a60bdc807b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="&quot;closer to the truth&quot;" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Closer to the Truth  Looks at the Big Questions</title><published>2011-02-07T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2011-02-07T12:46:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/UF_Nms7rfUE/closer-to-truth-looks-at-big-questions.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/6783490481487066318/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=6783490481487066318" title="2 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/10/closer-to-truth-looks-at-big-questions.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">Navigate around at &lt;a href="http://www.closertotruth.com/"&gt;Closer to the Truth&lt;/a&gt;.

Bush is engaging in "conscious linguistic slumming" when he uses the pronunciation commonly written as "nucular". Geoff argued that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;George Bush … can&amp;#39;t be exculpated for saying &amp;quot;nucular.&amp;quot; After all, it isn&amp;#39;t likely that that version was frequently heard at Andover, Yale, or the Kennebunkport dinner table. In his mouth, it&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve described as a &amp;quot;faux-bubba&amp;quot; pronunciation. … And … deliberately down-shifting to a misanalyzed pronuncation of &lt;em&gt;nuclear&lt;/em&gt; is a lot more culpable as linguistic slumming goes than merely dropping a &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; now and again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Steve countered that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;People generally end up with the accents of their late childhood and early adolescent peers, so Midland and Houston were the formative influences on Bush's accent, rather than Kennebunkport and Andover.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no instinct about the relative culpability of "going nucular" and "g-dropping". But I do feel that the pronunciation of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;-ing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is much more useful as a sociopolitical variable than the pronunciation of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;nuclear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is — it&amp;#39;s much commoner, in the first place, and it&amp;#39;s also much more likely to vary. Furthermore, it allows us to balance our discussion in partisan terms, because the current candidate who deploys this variable in the most politically interesting way is Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, a few words about "g-dropping" in general. (For additional background, please refer to the "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/000878.html"&gt;Internet Pilgrim's Guide to g-dropping&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, 5/10/2004.)  To start with, nothing is ever really dropped, and there are no g&amp;#39;s involved — we&amp;#39;re talking about the choice between a coronal nasal and a velar nasal — IPA [ɪn] vs. [ɪŋ] — in pronouncing the inflectional suffix &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;-ing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In the second place, nearly every native speaker of English, all around the world, chooses the coronal nasal — the &amp;quot;g-dropping&amp;quot; version — some fraction of the time. And in the third place, that fraction varies with social class, formality, gender, affect, and many other variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that many of these factors co-vary in a coherent way. Other things equal, the rate of "g-dropping" goes up with lower social class; goes up with greater informality; and goes up with more positive affect (e.g. joking vs. arguing). Without using a loaded word like "slumming", and indeed without raising the question of consciousness at all, we should note that every one of us is making many choices about self-presentation every time we open our mouth, and in particular we add  a brush-stroke to our self-portrait every time we choose a pronounciation for the English gerund-participle suffix &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;-ing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first 40 minutes of the first presidential debate (&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/26/debate.mississippi.transcript/"&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://download.npr.org/anon.npr-mp3/npr/news/2008/09/20080926_news_debate.mp3"&gt;mp3&lt;/a&gt;), Senator Obama used 84 gerund-participles, and dropped 8 g&amp;#39;s. A g-dropping  rate of about 10% is not at all out of line for someone in his position — in comparison, in the same period of the same debate, Senator McCain dropped 10 g&amp;#39;s in 66 opportunities. (In both cases, I&amp;#39;ve left out all instances of the sequence &amp;quot;going to&amp;quot;, which is especially interesting but also behaves in a special way.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key thing, though, is not the percentage but the positioning. Here are Senator Obama's first four (non-&lt;em&gt;going-to&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;-ing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; words, one of which gets the coronal nasal that people call "g-dropping":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, "Ole Miss," for &lt;strong&gt;hosting&lt;/strong&gt; us tonight. I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country. You know, we are at a &lt;strong&gt;defining&lt;/strong&gt; moment in our history. Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are &lt;strong&gt;going&lt;/strong&gt; through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And although we've heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;strugglin'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the (non-consecutive)  sentences containing his next four dropped g's (along with five &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;-ing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; words pronounced with a velar nasal that happen to be picked up in the same net):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there's a crisis for uh folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they've got a little financial crisis &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;goin'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on. They're &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;havin'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments. We haven't been &lt;strong&gt;paying&lt;/strong&gt; attention to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;And that means that the ordinary American out there who's &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;collectin'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a paycheck every day, they've got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is &lt;strong&gt;killing&lt;/strong&gt; them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are &lt;strong&gt;doing&lt;/strong&gt; well, and you are &lt;strong&gt;neglecting&lt;/strong&gt; people who are really &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;strugglin'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;workin'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; every day, who are not &lt;strong&gt;getting&lt;/strong&gt; a tax cut, and you want to give them more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, at least from this evidence, Senator Obama's "dropped g's" tend to occur in verb forms whose subjects are "ordinary Americans", and whose meaning has something to do with the struggles of ordinary life. For some confirmation of this trend, we can look at his opening statement in the third debate, which has 14 (non-&lt;em&gt;going-to&lt;/em&gt;) gerund-participles. He pronounces one of them with a &amp;quot;dropped g&amp;quot; — and I bet you could guess which one it is, even if I didn&amp;#39;t write it &lt;em&gt;-in'&lt;/em&gt; as I have below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Uh I think everybody understands at this point that we uh are &lt;strong&gt;experiencing&lt;/strong&gt; the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  And the financial rescue plan that Sen. McCain and I supported is a important first step. Uh and I pushed for some core principles: &lt;strong&gt;making&lt;/strong&gt; sure that taxpayers can get their money back uh if they're&lt;strong&gt; putting&lt;/strong&gt; money up. &lt;strong&gt;Making&lt;/strong&gt; sure that CEOs are not &lt;strong&gt;enriching&lt;/strong&gt; themselves uh through this process.  Uh and I think that it's going to take some time uh to work itself out. But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.  Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before uh this latest crisis. So I've proposed four specific things that I think can help.  Number one, let's focus on jobs. I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are &lt;strong&gt;shipping&lt;/strong&gt; jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that's &lt;strong&gt;creating&lt;/strong&gt; a job right here in America.  Number two, let's help families right away by &lt;strong&gt;providing&lt;/strong&gt; them a tax cut — a middle-class tax cut for people &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;makin'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; less than $200,000, and let's allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they're &lt;strong&gt;experiencing&lt;/strong&gt; a crisis.  Uh now Sen. McCain, I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners. That's why we included in the financial package uh a proposal to get uh homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages. I disagree with Sen. McCain in how to do it, because the way Sen. McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we're &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;buying&lt;/span&gt; full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less, and we don't want to waste taxpayer money. And we've got to get the financial uh sit- uh package &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;working&lt;/span&gt; much quicker than it's been &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;working&lt;/span&gt;. Last point I want to make, though. We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with. We've got to fix our energy policy that's &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;giving&lt;/span&gt; our wealth away. We've got to fix our health care system and we've got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Obama's empathetic &lt;strong&gt;-in'&lt;/strong&gt; is congruent with the general tendency of &amp;quot;g-dropping&amp;quot; to correlate with lower SES, greater informality, and more positive affect. But it&amp;#39;s not the only way to deploy a limited fraction of dropped g&amp;#39;s — and for an example of a different style, we don&amp;#39;t have to look beyond his opponent, Senator John McCain, who drops g&amp;#39;s at a similar rate, but in a somewhat different set of circumstances. In particular, in the first debate, Sen. McCain dropped four of his first nine g&amp;#39;s — and all four are part of verbal constructions with first-person subjects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#650000"&gt;I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for &lt;strong&gt;hosting&lt;/strong&gt; us tonight. And Jim I- I- I've been not &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;feelin'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; too great about a lot of things lately, so have a lot of Americans who are &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;facing&lt;/span&gt; challenges. But I'm &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;feelin'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a little better tonight,  and I'll tell you why. Because as we're here tonight in this debate, we are&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt; seeing&lt;/span&gt;, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together,&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt; sitting&lt;/span&gt; down,  &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;trying&lt;/span&gt; to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we're in.  And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. And we're not &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;talkin'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; about failure of institutions on Wall Street, we're &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;talkin'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; about failures on Main Street …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[It&amp;#39;s interesting that in front of a rather different sort of audience, at the recent Alfred E. Smith dinner in New York, neither Senator Obama nor Senator McCain dropped a single g, as far as I can tell from a quick listen… (&lt;a href="http://primebuzz.kcstar.com/?q=node/15091"&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5SWQJWm6Tg"&gt;Obama video&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjAtYqczkk"&gt;McCain video&lt;/a&gt;)]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what I&amp;#39;ve given you so far is a mildly quantitative anecdote. But you can easily find a lot of recorded speeches and interviews by these two men (and many other politicians), from which you could gather the data for a more serious and meaningful study. So if you&amp;#39;re looking for a term project for a (certain sort of) course in linguistics, or political science, or rhetoric — the answers are Out There.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Note in passing: Peggy Noonan apparently agrees with Geoff Nunberg's faux-bubba theory, and thinks that even one dropped &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; is too many ("&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122419210832542317.html"&gt;Palin's Failin'&lt;/a&gt;", 10/17/2008):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;More than ever on the campaign trail, the candidates are dropping their G's. Hardworkin' families are strainin' and tryin'a get ahead. It's not only Sarah Palin but Mr. McCain, too, occasionally Mr. Obama, and, of course, George W. Bush when he darts out like the bird in a cuckoo clock to tell us we are in crisis. All of the candidates say "mom and dad": "our moms and dads who are struggling." This is Mr. Bush's former communications adviser Karen Hughes's contribution to our democratic life, that you cannot speak like an adult in politics now, that's too austere and detached, snobby. No one can say mothers and fathers, it's all now the faux down-home, patronizing—and infantilizing—moms and dads. Do politicians ever remember that in a nation obsessed with politics, our children—sorry, our kids—look to political figures for a model as to how adults sound?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An increase in Gross National G-Dropping is not among the more serious dangers now threatening the republic, it seems to me. But do politicians deploy linguistic variants for tactical advantage? They'd hardly be human if they didn't.]&lt;/p&gt;

It's clearly wrong, as many and more people have explained to them at great length in small, easily understandable words for a long time now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've begun to wonder if maybe it isn't a claim made to prove their point but rather a massive red herring that goes unnoticed as such.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, if it was a red herring, that would require that somebody knows it isn't true and is throwing it out there with the intention to distract us and derail the debate. I have no illusions that your average fundie is anything but 100% behind this argument as a point-prover, and has no ulterior motive. Your average fundie is merely ignorant, authoritarian, and good at saying things he's been told over and over again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I think it's entirely possible that somebody high up in the hierarchy of some of these churches, a dark Karl Rovian figure who sits in a high-backed, leather-upholstered chair while steepling his fingers atop an antique wooden desk and chuckling quietly to himself at the sheer breadth of his cunning, &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; the line is bullshit, but knows it has rhetorical value as a Diabolical Derailing Device for the American secularist train. It would have to be a very cynical, power-hungry person, but the world's never had a shortage of those.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first reason I began to think this might be the case (and mind you, I'm certainly not claiming it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;, only that it's a thought I'm entertaining) is the overwhelming falseness of the claim itself. Sure, the ignorant masses can attach themselves to something that stupid and beat it like a dead, red-headed stephorse, but there have to be churches with some very smart people who are still defending the nonsense of the Christian Nation myth. Why would they? It is, of course, entirely possible that they've put ideology ahead of reason and reality. It happens all the time to non-dumb people. But then there's Karl Rove, an opportunistic, evil little man who is apparently an atheist but still pushes the Christian Nation line for his own personal benefit and self-aggrandizement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wondered if he might not be the only one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a white light shined upon my brain and I realized what a &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; red herring the Christian Right has in their Dominionist revisionist history. Every time it comes up, a legion of secular-minded folks spring to the defense of our secular nation with facts: Constitutional wording, legal precedent, letters and official documents showing the intent of the founding fathers, and so forth. We waste such time mounting a defense of America's in-built legal secularness, and for what?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They never seem to listen, even when the secularist is a Christian him or herself. We are about as effective as people trying to topple the Great Wall with quail eggs. Our words are wasted and the faithful move on and annoy another group of secularists. For our part, we just refine our sources and our wording and hope that next time somebody will listen to us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But why?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's all very well and good to have that massive defense against the Christian Nation myth, because that is Step One in defeating it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Step Two is something I don't think I've ever seen an American secularist do: follow the recitation of verifiable fact with a "But even if, for the sake of argument, America &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a Christian Nation, how do any of the things you want follow?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's where the derail comes in, if it comes in at all. We waste so much breath trying to convince them that they're wrong that we never even realize that it wouldn't matter if they were right. None of the stuff they think a "Christian Nation" entails is necessarily entailed by a Christian Nation. If we assume, for the sake of argument, that America was founded on Christian principles, by Christians, and was intended to have Christianity as its official religion, it still does not follow that America should outlaw abortion, enforce strict speech codes, make non-Christians into second-class citizens, teach false non-science in science class, restrict the sale of alcohol or any narcotic drug, persecute homosexuality, stymie efforts toward potentially fruitful scientific research, or anything else that might come up in a Sarah Palin stump speech.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First off, none of those things are logically entailed by the premise "America is a Christian Nation." You could play around with definitions, but the problem is that there are too damn many denominations for any one of them to be unqualifiedly correct. Even then, however, if you refine the premise to "America is a nation founded on conservative Christian Dominionist ideals," there's still no way, based on that, to entail the necessary structure of the American government or legal system. It's that pesky is-ought problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, it's pretty damn obvious to anyone who knows anything about the rest of the world that being a "Christian Nation" means about dick as far as necessary policy. I submit as evidence:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;The United Kingdom&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Denmark&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Switzerland&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finland&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sweden&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;And those aren't the only ones. Hell, the only "Christian Nation" I'm &lt;i&gt;sure&lt;/i&gt; bases its legal structure around the damn religion is Vatican City, which is ruled by a geezer with a stick in a funny hat (the geezer's in the hat, the stick is not) elected by a small group of other geezers in slightly less funny hats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So why don't we point this out to them more often? Why don't we let them see that, even if they &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; right, it still doesn't mean that we should stop teaching Evolution in schools. Fine, fine, whatever, America was founded on Christian principles. Creationism &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; isn't science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not sure the fundies would know what to do with that. Their "understanding" of science is so inextricably tied to their religion and politics that I imagine they'd do something like say "Uh huh!" and then fume for a while.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If anyone in the upstairs hierarchy of a Dominionist church knows both of these things, that the Christian Nation claim is a myth, and that it wouldn't entail the policies promulgated by its claimants if it wasn't, it might be the case that he's pushing the myth because it gets us so worked up that we can only focus on how very &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt; it is (and it is &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; wrong) and never take that extra leap to connect the European dots. He's throwing out a giant red herring and we're falling for it every time. It's understandable, though: if the claim is wrong, of course the country has no business enforcing religious doctrine. But even if the claim is &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt;, the country doesn't necessary have any business doing that, anyway. And it's not like the fundies are ever going to believe us on the first count.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wonder what a fundie would do if we told him "You're wrong, but it wouldn't matter if you were right."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess we won't know until we try.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, this has been kicking around in my head today, and it might be complete and total bullshit. Well, not the part that "Christian Nation" doesn't entail what they think it does. That's pretty true. That somebody somewhere knows that and intentionally uses the myth as a rhetorical dodge. Any thoughts?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224318172415"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=731">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f37980889b219a9b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and politics"/><category term="Phonetics and phonology"/><title type="html">Nucular riposte</title><published>2008-10-18T08:16:39Z</published><updated>2008-10-18T08:16:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=731" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=730"&gt;Steve Pinker&lt;/a&gt; understates the case when he says that there&amp;#39;s a master&amp;#39;s thesis in &amp;quot;nucular&amp;quot; studies: I envision dissertations, conferences, endowed chairs, journals, broken marriages…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Actually, I want to comment about just one argument Steve makes, this in passing, about George W. Bush&amp;#39;s speech. Steve says that &amp;quot;People generally end up with the accents of their late childhood and early adolescent peers.&amp;quot; There&amp;#39;s clearly an important sense in which this is true: it depends on what the meaning of &amp;quot;accent&amp;quot; is. Certainly some basic phonological pattern is fixed by late adolescence, along with lexical classes — my upbringing in the New York suburbs left me with different vowels in &lt;em&gt;dog&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;frog, long &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;gong,&lt;/em&gt; and in the initial syllables &lt;em&gt;of hamburger&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;hamlet&lt;/em&gt;, for example, and that&amp;#39;s going to persist in whatever particular phonetic realization I give those words. But my range of variation has broadened a lot since then — I get more general American (or general East Coast) on some occasions, and more sidewalks-of-New-York on others. And I don&amp;#39;t think it makes sense to think of these variations as add-ons, corrections, affectations, or in any way less &amp;quot;authentic&amp;quot; than what I grew up speaking. It all feels like me by now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this connection, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s likely that W grew up speaking as he does. For one thing, his Texas accent is a lot more prominent that of his brother Jeb, even though Jeb also grew up in Midland and Houston and moreover stayed in Texas to do his college and law school while W went to Yale and Harvard Business School. They may have the same basic Texas phonology — the raising of front vowels before nasals, the backing of /a/ before /r/, for example — but  W &amp;quot;drops his g&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; more often, takes monophthongization of /ay/ much further, and generally conveys a more down-home impression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt; &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/XvPdsKDWfV8%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=306&amp;amp;height=246" width="306" height="246"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Mp4vLBvU1bA%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=306&amp;amp;height=246" width="306" height="246"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while it's of course possible that Jeb is the one who has corrected or adapted his speech, I think it's more likely that W adapted his to the west Texas norm, particularly after he was defeated for Congress in 1978 by an opponent who depicted him as an Easterner out-of-touch with local values. But I &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; think W&amp;#39;s accent is &amp;quot;fake&amp;quot; — that&amp;#39;s part of who he is now, and I imagine it&amp;#39;s how he&amp;#39;d sound if you woke him up in the middle of the night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess — and of course I have no direct evidence for this — is that W&amp;#39;s adoption of &amp;quot;nucular&amp;quot; also came around this time. The fact is that his dad doesn&amp;#39;t say it that way, and it&amp;#39;s a word that would have been a lot more common around the G. H. W. Bush place than in the average American household. (You wonder how his parents would have reacted if W had ventured the &amp;quot;nucular&amp;quot; pronunciation around the family dinner table.) And it doesn&amp;#39;t seem plausible that W would have adopted the &amp;quot;nucular&amp;quot; pronunciation from his adolescent peers in Midland — I mean, how often are they going to be using that word in the first place?  But on reflection, maybe &amp;quot;faux bubba&amp;quot; was unfair. At least, if you woke him up in the middle of the night he&amp;#39;d probably he&amp;#39;d say &amp;quot;nucular,&amp;quot; too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(One reason why this business of "authenticity" is important is that I think you can make a similar point about Obama's "blackcent," as some people have called it, &lt;a href="http://www.cjr.org/essay/politics_with_drawl_1.php?page=all&amp;amp;print=true"&gt;criticizing&lt;/a&gt; him for adopting a form of speech the circumstances of his upbringing don&amp;#39;t entitle him to. I don&amp;#39;t know how much of that he might already have had in Hawaii — certainly g-dropping wouldn&amp;#39;t have been an alien feature, even to students at Punahou — but even if he acquired it all in Chicago, that doesn&amp;#39;t make it fake or inauthentic. Why should our linguistic self-fashioning have to stop in adolescence while the rest of it can persist over a lifetime? And why should &amp;quot;inauthenticity&amp;quot; be held against you only when you&amp;#39;re shifting away from the standard? But maybe this point deserves a more ample discussion than a parenthetical allows…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of other small points.  Re Steve&amp;#39;s observations about the pronunciations he heard at the Naval War College: As I think I mentioned, the &amp;quot;nucular&amp;quot; pronunciation is also common among military and defense people who almost certainly know it&amp;#39;s considered incorrect. My sense is that for at least some of these people, this is a sort of anti-affectation — by which I mean that if you ask them about it, they&amp;#39;ll say they damn well know how the word is supposed to be pronounced. I have an old college friend, an upper-middle-class New Jerseyite with an MIT PhD who works for the DOE, who makes a point of saying &amp;quot;nucular.&amp;quot; When I asked him if he referred to &amp;quot;nucular families,&amp;quot; as well, he said, &amp;quot;No, I only use &amp;#39;nucular&amp;#39; when I&amp;#39;m referring to nukes.&amp;quot; And in this connection, I wonder if &lt;em&gt;nuke&lt;/em&gt; mightn't in fact have influenced the pronunciation of at least some of these speakers, even if it couldn't be responsible for, say, the way Eisenhower said the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter actually says something like "nukeeuh," which is probably more loss of the "l" in his Georgia speech than a variant of "nucular." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and Richard Lowenberg has posted a &lt;a href="http://www.radlab.com/information/nucular_names.html"&gt;list of well-known people&lt;/a&gt; who "should know better" who have been heard to say "nucular." &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoff Nunberg</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224314171280"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-803890069755191368">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4f91caed81501b3a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Frankly, Just What Good is Christianity Anyway?</title><published>2008-10-18T03:18:00Z</published><updated>2008-10-18T04:46:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/424273381/frankly-just-what-good-is-christianity.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/803890069755191368/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=803890069755191368" title="4 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/10/frankly-just-what-good-is-christianity.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">Apart from the hobby / fellowship nature of Christianity and apart from the apologetic mental gymnastics believers use to keep this ancient concept of reality spinning on the modern stick of logic; just what does Christianity offer over and above that the basic secular world does not give? &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stimulus for this post was a church bulletin I saw announcing “Flu Shots” and listed the times Christians could receive their secular protection from this virus. But why would God fearing, Jesus believing, Bible claiming church members need the same secular protection just as the non-religious / anti -religious secular world would?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m an atheist who, as a former Christian, overtly has renounced both God and the Bible. I work with sincere Christians who received free flu shots given at work while I refused it. Over the course of last winter, a number of these Christians became sick with the flu (both those who got the shot and those who did not) and were out of work for a week while this non-believing secular atheist never even got a cold that year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul states in 1 Corinthians 11:30 (&lt;em&gt;For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;number sleep&lt;/em&gt;.) as a supernatural reason why many believers at Corinth were sick and even died was that it was a curse from God for misusing the Lord’s Supper. (This &lt;strong&gt;Biblical “Fact&lt;/strong&gt;” implicitly states that God was active in either attacking his own faithful or, as in the case of Job, used Satan to do his dirty work.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short we are told that God actively engages the health of his “children” (remember, he is the Dad…”Our Father who art in Heaven…”) as proof he exists even to the point of sickness and death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So just what good is Christianity other than a mental apologetic argument used to peddle magical promises to uninformed people understood as “Lost" or "Unsaved” to the believers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Preachers (ordained and endorsed by an ecclesiastical authorities and lead by the Holy Spirit ) and Christians are arrested for sex crimes, thefts, murders, frauds and just about any and everything the worst anti-Christian could be arrested for even though most minsters make a very good living announcing (preaching) the “absolute truths” of God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;, Christians are given a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Great Commission&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Jesus to tell &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; the wrong religion and the non-religious world that they are indeed wrong and must submit to the promises of God (as stated in the Bible). If one rejects the Gospel of Jesus, then God will also attack the non-Christian (just as he attacked &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; allowed the Christian to be attacked in Corinth) at the Great White Throne Judgment; this despite the fact that Biblical promises for Christians for the here and now are failures (just as I’ve pointed out above) .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Christians, it’s time to pull the only strings you have to make God appear logical and loving…use your apologetic mental gymnastics and to tell us at DC just why the reality we live with everyday is not the truth and that that mountain Jesus tells us can &lt;strong&gt;really be moved&lt;/strong&gt; and cast into the sea &lt;strong&gt;can be done&lt;/strong&gt; if only we have the oh-so-pure Christian faith (but the size of a mustard seed).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And finally, if the Bible has promises which, in order to keep them true, must be understood as allegories, exactly &lt;strong&gt;what is the difference between an allegory and a flat out lie?&lt;/strong&gt; Or, to put it another way, if God and the Bible are caught with their proverbial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;pants down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, can you apologetic defenders now convince us at DC that you and your God of absolute truth have the gift of deception…that the Bible REALLY does not say what it means?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creationists &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;The Discovery Institute&lt;/span&gt; must have drooled when they heard a paper had been published by the respected journal, &lt;em&gt;Animal Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;, which apparently reported that peahens did not prefer peacocks with more elaborate trains.  Takahashi et al. (2008) appears to  contradict several well-known studies that reported the opposite, and which have been cited as evidence for sexual selection in peafowl. Since the peacock’s tail is a venerable symbol of runaway selection for a secondary sexual trait, &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;the DI&lt;/span&gt; ARN jumped on the &lt;a href="http://www.arn.org/blogs/index.php/literature/2008/04/01/sexual_selection_falsified_in_the_case_o" rel="external "&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;, crowing, with breathless excitement: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The alleged amazing powers of natural selection are much diminished as a result of these findings. The argument that it is “powerful enough” to maintain the feather display against the negative effects of attracting predators must be dropped. Furthermore, it appears not powerful enough to remove the display when it becomes an “obsolete signal”. Darwinists need to think very hard about the way they do science. This is a clear example of how a Darwinian hypothesis has become accepted as scientific fact, yet now has been disproved by some rigorous empirical research. This is a falsified prediction. This means that numerous textbooks and web sites need to be revised. More importantly, Darwinists should cease giving the impression that they have the keys to understand the natural world. So much of this ‘understanding’ is like peacock feathers - lots of show and no substance. Richard Dawkins extols Darwinism as a beautiful theory, but whenever we look closely, it fails to account for the observed data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;the DI&lt;/span&gt; ARN, their enthusiasm for this paper may be premature, as I noted in a guest entry on Denis Ford’s “&lt;a href="http://blog.lib.umn.edu/denis036/thisweekinevolution/2008/06/guest_blogger_the_peacocks_tal.html" rel="external "&gt;This Week in Evolution&lt;/a&gt;”. Essentially, the paper has two major problems (my article deals with some other minor ones as well):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The authors used a different methodology to determine male reproductive success than the other studies, which makes comparing them very difficult. While the British and French studies measured male reproductive success by &lt;em&gt;observed&lt;/em&gt; successful copulations, the Japanese one &lt;em&gt;estimated&lt;/em&gt;  the number of successful copulations, based on female pre-copulatory behavior.&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;li&gt;The genetic variance in tail morphology in all of the studies was very low (Takahashi et al.’s study had the lowest), which only magnifies the differences in methodology. Small differences in number of successful copulations have greater weight because the very low variation makes determining any kind of selection very difficult.&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 
The main thrust of my article is that the differences in methodology for determining male reproductive success were magnified by the very low variance in the trait, invalidating comparison between the studies. It should be noted that Marion Petrie and Adriane Loyau, primary authors of two of the three major studies confirming peahen’s preference for more elaborate male trains, are in the process of publishing a reply to Takahashi et al’s paper. One wonders if &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;the DI&lt;/span&gt; ARN will mention that.&lt;/p&gt;

Have at it.  --PalMD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been writing quite a bit about "questionable" illnesses, shameless quacks and the like, but there are reasons that people seek out odd diagnoses and cult doctors.  They feel crappy, and they haven't yet found someone who can make them feel less crappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, some people will never feel OK.  That's just human nature.  But almost everyone can be helped to feel better in one way or another.  What are some of the ways physicians approach difficult-to-treat patients?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, there are many syndromes that involve unexplainable pain.  These include fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and others.  These diseases are painful, but have no clear pathologic correlate, meaning all the tests in the world don't clearly explain why the person is in pain.   This doesn't mean the patient is "faking it"---they really do feel miserable.  We just don't understand the cause.  The other thing about these syndromes is that they are not life or limb threatening.  Unlike, say, heart disease, they can hurt without causing physical damage to the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some patients have clear "somatization" or "psychosomatic" disorders... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/so_whats_the_good_news.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/so_whats_the_good_news.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/424183942" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224292907088"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/the_secret_meaning_of_coffee_c.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/767b0766e9777896</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">The secret meaning of “Coffee &amp;amp; Cigarettes”</title><published>2008-10-18T01:32:11Z</published><updated>2008-10-18T01:32:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/424181402/the_secret_meaning_of_coffee_c.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/the_secret_meaning_of_coffee_c.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the chorus of the Michelle Featherstone song acquires new depth and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing is amusing. Intermittently, Matthews tries to pin her down in her blanket screeds against liberals, and asks her to state specifically whether some Democrat is actually, literally anti-American. You can see her expression lock in place, her eyes stare blankly out, and you can imagine her tiny brain doing little shuddery spasms of confusion in the vast and roomy vault of her cranium…then &amp;lt;click&amp;gt; &amp;lt;reset&amp;gt; &amp;lt;reboot&amp;gt;, she glides right past the question and continues her imprecatory rant.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, I have been filling my head with monsters, magic, and fantasy. Over the past couple of weeks, I read all four of &lt;a href="http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/twilight.html"&gt;the Twilight novels by Stephenie Meyer&lt;/a&gt;. And two of my favorite authors have come out with new books that I’ll be reading over the weekend: &lt;a href="http://www.gregorymaguire.com/books/lionamongmen.html"&gt;A Lion Among Men&lt;/a&gt; by Gregory MaGuire and &lt;a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/works/Books/The+Graveyard+Book/"&gt;The Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; book by Neil Gaiman. I don’t know why, but it seems like a lot of skeptics are fans of the supernatural in fiction. Is it because of or in spite of the fact that we don’t believe in the supernatural in the real world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with all that fantastical reading, I’ve had time to get some great books lined up for the next few reading selections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=62-0688149200-0"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/imagedbcgi.jpeg" alt="" width="120" height="171"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First, to stick to the ghostly lineup of my personal reading, and to celebrate Halloween, we’ll be reading &lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=62-0688149200-0"&gt;The Ghost on Saturday Night&lt;/a&gt; by Sid Fleischman. This is a children’s book, so it’ll be a quick read that you should be able to fit in this month, even though we’re getting a very late start. Instead of interviewing the author, I’d like to post some input by parents who are readers of this blog. Please contact me if you’d like to share your thoughts about reading materials for kids. I have some things to say on this based on my own childhood, but I’d like to include input from parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few more books that we’ll be digging into this winter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Age-American-Unreason-Susan-Jacoby/dp/0375423745/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1214009272&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;The Age of American Unreason&lt;/a&gt; by Susan Jacoby, the author of &lt;em&gt;Freethinkers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The conservative columnist &lt;a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/2447021/the-culture-war-for-the-white-house.thtml"&gt;Melanie Phillips has an explanation&lt;/a&gt; for our current economic problems, for drunkenness and drug abuse, for rudeness, for psychopathic killers, and for the wholesale collapse of Western culture. What could possibly be the single root cause of so many catastrophic consequences? Why, &lt;i&gt;atheism&lt;/i&gt;, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see this financial breakdown, moreover, as being not merely a moral crisis but the monetary expression of the broader degradation of our values - the erosion of duty and responsibility to others in favour of instant gratification, unlimited demands repackaged as 'rights' and the loss of self-discipline. And the root cause of that erosion is &lt;b&gt;'militant atheism'&lt;/b&gt; which, in junking religion, has destroyed our sense of anything beyond our material selves and the here and now and, through such hyper-individualism, paved the way for the onslaught on bedrock moral values expressed through such things as family breakdown and mass fatherlessness, educational collapse, widespread incivility, unprecedented levels of near psychopathic violent crime, epidemic drunkenness and drug abuse, the repudiation of all authority, the moral inversion of victim culture, the destruction of truth and objectivity and a corresponding rise in credulousness in the face of lies and propaganda -- and intimidation and bullying to drive this agenda into public policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Let me summarize some of the main arguments so far concerning what I've previously called &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/01/most-asinine-christian-argument-ive.html"&gt;The Most Asinine Christian Argument I've Probably Ever Heard&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have argued that the more often the Christian has to resort to background beliefs—the more he has to resort to his overall worldview to defend an issue—then he’s actually already admitting that the issue is weak. I realize we all retreat to background beliefs here and there to support a weak plank in our worldviews, an anomaly, so to speak. But the more one has to do this then the weaker his whole position is. And I claim that on any given issue I wrote about in my book, one after another, a Christian cannot defend that issue on its own terms. Instead he must resort to his background beliefs to do so, time after time, after time. THAT'S why I say my case should be judged as a whole. It's because it will become crystal clear that the Christian cannot fall back on any background belief since I attack each and every major background belief he has, one after another, from the existence of God, to miracles, to the resurrection of Jesus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to the problem of evil I made an argument that a Christian must deal with based upon what he believes, not upon what I believe. Based upon what he believes about God and this world he must reconcile the two on its own terms. It’s an internal problem to his belief (not mine) about the existence of a perfectly good God given the massive amount of suffering there is in this world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is my argument:&lt;blockquote&gt;If God is perfectly good, all knowing, and all powerful, then the issue of why there is so much suffering in the world requires an explanation. The reason is that a perfectly good God would be opposed to it, an all-powerful God would be capable of eliminating it, and an all-knowing God would know what to do about it. So the extent of intense suffering in the world means for the theist that either God is not powerful enough to eliminate it, or God does not care enough to eliminate it, or God is just not smart enough to know what to do about it. The stubborn fact of intense suffering in the world means that something is wrong with God’s ability, or his goodness, or his knowledge. I consider this as close to an empirical refutation of Christianity as is possible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Is this a logical argument? Yes, even though it's written for the average college student and not for the professional philosopher. Is it an evidential argument? Yes, since I'm looking at the evidence in this world. This whole distinction between a logical and evidential argument is blurred. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The way Drew describes an "internal critique" means I must show his beliefs to be logically impossible by use of deductive logic based solely on the things he believes. And he maintains that an "external critique" depends on my having ultimate standard for objective morals (a separate problem I have dealt with head-on without skirting the issue). So Drew thinks he has me choosing between two horns of a dilemma where I reject BOTH horns. It's a false dilemma. On the one hand, I reject the claim that my logical argument (above) must show his beliefs to be logically contradictory. That's a near impossible standard that isn't required of most ideas we reject. On the other hand, I reject his notion that by offering a so-called "external critique" of his present beliefs means I must have some sort of ultimate standard for objective morals to do so as an atheist, since my argument is not an atheist argument at all; it doesn’t led to atheism. It's an argument that Drew needs to consider in reconciling all that he believes, since he believes God is the author of all truth. Regardless of whether as an atheist I press this argument against him or not, and regardless of whether he agrees with me or not, he must still consider my argument to reconcile his beliefs. This is evidenced by Christian thinkers who have become process thinkers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This stuff is elementary to me. I think he's been informed by ignorant people who feel the need to justify ignorant beliefs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drew said: &lt;em&gt;While both approaches can be affirmed by a single atheist, they are separate critiques and cannot logically be combined into one argument.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes they can! I use a cumulative case argument that uses both approaches to come to the same conclusion. As I said, it’s one argument, a comprehensive one, utilizing many other arguments, both logical and inductive. Yes, each one is separate argument. That’s correct. But since no single argument can topple your whole worldview, or anyone’s for that matter, these separate arguments, while seemingly defective on their own terms, present a comprehensive and cumulative whole case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drew said: &lt;em&gt;Note: If the atheist says of the Christian’s definitions, “Those definitions are just wrong.  Christians have defined God (evil/gratuitous/greater good) incorrectly,” then the atheist has entered evidence outside the Christian worldview, and has therefore switched to an external critique.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What you must remember, is that the argument from intensive suffering is not an atheist argument. An atheist uses it, of course. But since it does not lead to atheism, it’s not an atheist argument at all. Process theologians, deists and pantheists can look at that argument, agree with it, and conclude that the Christian conception of an Omni-God is improbable while retaining some belief in God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it's just false to say that as an atheist I’ve entered into an external criticism of your faith by arguing with you about the correct definitions of God and evil. Because every single argument I offer has been considered by a thoughtful Christian who wants to reconcile his own conception of God based on the evidence of suffering. Some of these thinkers will remain Christians after having thought through this, while others have become process thinkers and/or atheists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I’ve argued in my book on page 58 in my book, it is a solid Christian principle that “all truth is God’s truth.” Experience, for instance, has always been a check on Biblical exegesis and theology, whether it comes to Wesleyan perfectionism, perseverance of the saints, second coming predictions, Pentecostal miracle workers, and so on. While experience is not the test for truth, the Christian understanding of the truth must be able to explain personal experience. The whole science/religion discussion is an attempt to harmonize the Bible with what scientists have experienced through empirical observations of the universe. My contention is that other disciplines of learning, including experience itself, continually forces the believer to reinterpret the Bible and his notion of God, until there is nothing left to believe with regard to either of them. Is this external? It cannot be. For according to a Christian “all truth is God’s truth.” He's supposedly the creator, so he must be the author of all truth! No Christian can possibly say that all truth—all truth—is found in the Bible. Is rocket science found in the Bible? So my argument is neither an external one, nor is it an atheist argument.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What exactly is an external argument given the Christian view of truth? If an external argument is merely one that the Christian doesn't accept at the present time then that’s irrelevant, for Christian theology has adjusted itself numerous times by arguments and evidence that the previous generation did not accept. Christians should adjust their views here too, just like they’ve done with a rigorously literal view of the Genesis creation accounts in the light of modern science. They should adjust, just like they've adjusted to liberal views on women when compared to Christians of earlier centuries. They should adjust, just like they've done by condemning racism and slavery, unlike Christians who justified these things in the American South. They should adjust, just like they do with their liberal views of hell when compared to the Middle Ages. They should adjust, just like they do with regard to their liberal and heretical ideas of a free democracy when compared to earlier times of the divine rights of kings. They should adjust, just like Christians have done who no longer think the Bible justifies killing people who disagree. If these previous Christians replied to the evidence, as you do now, that such arguments are external to their faith, you'll see my point. Since Christians have historically changed their views based on this so-called “external evidence,” what they believe is now considered to be internal to their faith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drew said: &lt;em&gt;If the atheist is making an external-evidential critique, then the atheist’s worldview must account for that evidence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At some point, yes, and I think I have. But I do not need to make that argument before I make my case based upon the suffering in this world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drew said: &lt;em&gt;Overall, it looks like the internal critique, but he refers to the “extent of intense suffering”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I cannot force the believer to look at what we find in the world itself to show his beliefs wrong, then that believer lives in la la land. You might as well be a solipsist. You MUST look at the world that exists and reconcile it with your beliefs about God. This problem, even though I point to the world that exists, is still an internal one for your beliefs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am distinguishing what I think about evil from what a Christian thinks. I’m claiming intensive suffering is a problem for the Christian theist. This is not my problem. It’s yours. I’m arguing that this kind of suffering is what you should consider an “evil.” That’s what this debate is all about at this point. I’m trying to argue that it is an evil from YOUR perspective. What counts as a moral evil from MY perspective can and is much different. For instance, the law of predation is not considered by me to be a moral “evil” at all. This is what I expect given evolutionary biology. But I’m arguing that it is an evil from your perspective. I think it’s you who is confused here about that which I’m arguing about. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I cannot convince you that your faith is improbable then that does not matter. I claim it is. I use your standards to do so. Why you don’t see it is strange to me. As I former Christian I became persuaded of these things, so why is it impossible for you to do so? The answer is that it is not impossible for you to see that you’re wrong, just like I did. That’s how we change our minds, and we all do. Who knows, you might end up a panentheist after further considerations of these arguments. Who knows, right? THEN what will you say about my arguments? You will say they helped you to see the improbability of your prior beliefs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You cannot answer YOUR problem by skirting the issue. You cannot say “you too” when you must answer an argument that you must deal with even if NO ONE pressed it against you! You must think about this problem for your faith on your own. The beliefs of a person who makes this or any argument are absolutely and completely irrelevant to the problem you yourself face. Again, if you believe all things can be reconciled by your faith then you and you alone must do the reconciling. You can say you have done so all you want to, but since human beings have an overwhelming tendency to intellectually defend those beliefs they have been brought up in, and since they treat those things they believe with an insider perspective, they must come to grips with the arguments of outsiders just to test what they believe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ll have to admit Drew is tenacious, something that’s both annoying and at the same time rewarding. It’s annoying that I have written so much about the internal/external problem without any success with you. It’s rewarding because it forces me to go deeper and deeper with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drew responds by saying…&lt;blockquote&gt;An internal argument assumes the truth of the worldview, position, or argument in question in order to derive a contradiction from that assumption. Loftus is completely incapable of supporting [his arguments] with anything other than either (1) evidence of evil that is external, or (2) some other evidence against God that is unrelated to the problem of evil. If Loftus chooses option (1), then he must account for that evidence on his own worldview.  If he chooses option (2), then he’s making a tacit admission that his position is weak [per what I, John, argued above with regard to retreating to background beliefs supporting a weak plank in what we believe]. The point is, explanation of how the Christian worldview accounts for certain facts is not in any way “presupposing” what one is trying to prove. If it is, then Loftus is guilty of the same thing every time he explains some feature of his worldview in order to defend it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loftus then argues against hell, attempting again to do it internally.  His basic argument is that the “punishments don’t fit the crimes”. (p. 256) He also says that the reality of the majority of people suffering in hell is “incompatible with the theistic conception of a good God.” (p. 256)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had to read that statement a couple times. The Christian theistic conception of God holds that He does condemn some people to hell.  What “theistic conception of a good God” is Loftus talking about here? It’s not the Christian one. If the Christian conception of a good God conflicts with Loftus’ conception of a good God, or anyone else’s for that matter, so what? I know he’s trying to make it an internal argument by claiming there’s an incompatibility, but he keeps jumping outside the Christian worldview when he says things like, “the punishment doesn’t fit the crimes.” I have to ask, “by what standard?”  Not the Christian one, so which one?  And why is that standard true?&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here’s the problem Drew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My particular argument in chapter 12 is not directed at the Calvinistic conception of God, per se. As I’ve already admitted, I dismiss such a Calvinistic conception of God. And it’s not supposed to be a defeater of the whole Christian worldview, since my case is a cumulative case, even if I say it’s an “empirical refutation” of such a God (which is rhetoric, although I believe it). Nor is it a logical disproof of the theistic God, although it is a logical argument. Therefore, your criticisms of my arguments are not aimed properly against that which I am arguing against. In that sense there should be several occasions where you would be found saying: “Yes, John is absolutely correct, given the nature of that which he’s arguing against.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even at that, I take a swipe at your conception of God when I shared John Beversluis’s argument: &lt;blockquote&gt;“If the word ‘good’ must mean approximately the same thing when we apply it to God as what it means when we apply it to human beings, then the fact of suffering provides a clear empirical refutation of the existence of a being who is both omnipotent and perfectly good. If on the other hand, we are prepared to give up the idea that ‘good’ in reference to God means anything like what it means when we refer to humans as good, then the problem of evil can be sidestepped, but any hope of a rational defense of the Christian God goes by the boards.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;As I said, there is no real distinction between an internal and external criticism given that you believe all truth is God’s, for you must still account for the external evidence of intense suffering in this world. Besides, in any deductive argument ABOUT THE WORLD (in contrast with abstract entities) there is always an appeal to induction from the evidence found in the world, while in any inductive argument there is always some deduction that must be concluded from the evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reductio ad absurdum&lt;/em&gt; arguments can either be used to show what you believe is &lt;em&gt;logically impossible&lt;/em&gt; or they can be used to show that your beliefs commit you an &lt;em&gt;improbabilities&lt;/em&gt;. I’m saying something like this, “Let’s suppose you are right. If so, these are the absurd consequences. My argument is that your beliefs commit you to accept improbably absurd consequences. I’m not arguing that your beliefs are internally contradictory. Now let’s say you deny or reject the consequences that I point out. Okay. Fine. That does not mean I haven’t used a &lt;em&gt;reductio ad absurdum&lt;/em&gt; argument. It’s clear that I have. But in order to reject my arguments you must retreat into other background beliefs to do so, and that’s when I say “the more you retreat into background beliefs the less likely your faith is true.” When it comes to the problem of intense suffering I maintain this is just another example of you retreating to these background beliefs. Once I make this point let’s move on to the next chapter, and the next and the next, until I make my whole case that you have no probable background beliefs from which to fall back on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so I find it completely ignorant for you to still maintain that the force of a particular argument depends on the beliefs of the one making it. Just show me one other argument that depends on the beliefs of the one making it. There is a widely accepted strategy called “the Devil’s Advocate” in which the arguer merely argues for the sake of seeing how someone responds. It would do absolutely no good once it’s realized that someone was playing the devil’s advocate to dismiss his objections at that point, for his arguments must still be met and dealt with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, as I have said, no single argument can debunk a whole Christian worldview. Yet you claim that “an internal critique must assume one's worldview at the outset for the sake of argument.” The argument I’m making in my chapters about suffering is narrowed to this problem alone. I am not taking on your whole worldview at this point. Given the nature of worldviews I can’t do that…no one can. I’m dealing strictly with one aspect of your worldview. Other chapters, such as the arguments for the existence of God, are dealt with elsewhere. If I had to abide by your rule and assume your whole worldview with everything in it, then you have given me an impossible task when dealing with any single belief in your worldview. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Worldviews, anyway, are almost but not quite incommensurable, if you know what I mean. They are elusive to an outsider’s criticisms. They account for nearly everything within it as insiders. That’s why I also argue for the “Outsider Test for Faith.” To use the insider language of a whole worldview would make it near impossible to offer any outsider criticisms of that worldview. Have you ever tried to critique pantheism as an insider? Try it. In the meantime read what Christian philosopher James Sire said about it in his book &lt;em&gt;The Universe Next Door&lt;/em&gt;. Here’s a snippet: &lt;blockquote&gt;“What can Westerners say? If they point to its irrationality, the Easterner rejects reason as a category. If they point to the disappearance of morality, the Easterner scorns the duality that is required for the distinction. If they point to the inconsistency between Easterner’s moral action and amoral theory, the Easterner says, ‘Well, consistency is not virtue except by reason, which I’ve already rejected.’…If the Westerner says, ‘But if you don’t eat, you’ll die,’ the Easterner responds, ‘So what? Atman is Brahman. Brahman is eternal. A death to be wished.’ It is, I think, no wonder Western missionaries have made so little headway with committed Hindus and Buddhists. They don’t speak the same language, for they hold almost nothing in common.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;That’s exactly how I feel with you. We live in different worldviews. I cannot critique your whole worldview by criticizing one issue, and we don’t speak the same language. You must simply “See” things differently. If I cannot help you to see things differently then I’ve still done the best I can. I do the best I can to bridge the worldview gap between us that I think is possible, despite your insistence that my arguments are not consistently internal (or inside) to that which you believe. I maintain they are the best that an outsider can do (they are the best I can do anyway). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let me put this into perspective, Drew. You say God is sovereign and can do whatever he wants to with us as human beings because we’re sinners deserving of hell. This does not make him less than perfectly good, you maintain. He’s perfectly good. We deserve what he sends our way as punishment. We have done this to ourselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That, in brief, if I understand it properly, is your Calvinistic position…your theodicy. Granted there is much more to it, okay?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have already argued that since we cannot behave differently, or desire to do to differently, or even believe differently than what we do, this defeats the whole notion of the God you believe. But leaving that insurmountable problem to the gerrymanderers, since it seems perfectly clear we do not deserve the treatment God punishes us with, &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/07/calvinism-explains-everythingand.html"&gt;there's more to say about this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How then can I make you see the improbability of your beliefs? It reminds me of James Sire’s discussion above with a pantheist. You see the problem now? We see things differently. To assume this whole explanation of yours as a basis for my argument about intense suffering in this world is to assume too much for one argument. I dispute these other assumptions of yours in other parts of my book. I dispute the existence of God. I dispute the claim that we alone are responsible for our sins because God supposedly created us. And I dispute the whole notion that our sins deserve punishment in such draconian ways as we experience on earth and later in hell. I dispute the concept of hell. I dispute the concept of Satan. I even argue that you should approach your faith as an outsider.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of these arguments converge against you when attempting to dispute my rejection of Christianity, plus more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s the best anyone can do. It is certainly the best I can do. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So it’s simply false that I must assume your whole worldview (an impossible task) when disputing any single tenet insider your worldview. Such a task cannot be done when looking at any single tenet inside your worldview. But I have examined each major tenet you believe in the many other chapters in my book, all which converge to make the over-all case that your faith is delusionary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I said, you must continually retreat, over and over, on each and every issue I write about, to background beliefs to defend a weak plank in your worldview. You must do it for each chapter I write about. You’re doing this here on the problem of suffering. You will do it when it comes to the resurrection (since you will say miracles are not impossible if God exists). You will do it when it comes to the existence of God (since I cannot prove God does not exist). You will do it with regard to my chapter on miracles (since if God exists this would not be impossible for him). And so on and so on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have I made my case about the problem of suffering and the existence of God? I think so, as an outsider. But whether you think so will depend on what you think of my whole over-all case against Christianity. As I said, you must deal with my book as a whole. Maybe you’ll do that, I don’t know. But what I’ll look for is how many times you must retreat to background beliefs to support the each and every chapter in my book, beliefs which I debunk in subsequent chapters, one after another. The more you do this then the more circular your approach becomes and the less likely it has explanatory power in defending what you believe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I didn’t consider any comments left in response to this month’s birthday challenge, since that winner will get an actual prize at a later date. So, this week’s winner was nominated multiple times for &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3467#comment-35387"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt;, in response to an Afternoon Inquision about food:&lt;/p&gt;

@&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://skepchick.org/?p=3467#comment-35386"&gt;Detroitus&lt;/a&gt;: It’s true. I saw a non-peer-reviewed case study published last month about this very topic. According to their findings, baptism can reduce the nutrient content of babies’ souls by as much as 30%! Although I hear the nutrients are preserved by the flash-baptismal process. So if you can’t afford fresh baby souls, buy canned. Don’t get sucked in to that brand name nonsense though. “Baby No Name” is just as good as “Cannibal’s Choice”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, Kimbo Jones! For your helpful and economically-savvy post, you win a lifetime’s supply of Heathen Heaven Minced Baby Souls, canned in baby juice for freshness that lasts long after the apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a reminder that this Monday is the next &lt;a href="http://www.bostonskeptics.com"&gt;Boston Skeptics in the Pub&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/event.php?eid=30633813423&amp;amp;ref=ts"&gt;guest speaker Sid Rodrigues&lt;/a&gt;!

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/very_peculiar.php"&gt;Steve Jones might think human evolution has stopped&lt;/a&gt;, I have to say that that is impossible. If human technology removes a selective constraint, that doesn&amp;#39;t stop evolution — it just opens up a new degree of freedom and allows change to carry us in a novel direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting potential example is the availability of relatively safe Cesarean sections. Babies have very big heads that squeeze with only great difficulty through a relatively narrow pelvis, so the relationship in size between head diameter and the diameter of the pelvic opening has been a limitation on human evolution. We know this had to be a factor in our evolution: the average newborn mammal has a cranial capacity that is roughly 50% of the adult size, chimpanzee babies have heads about 40% of the adult size, but human babies have crania that are only 23% of what they will be in adults. While our brains have gotten larger over evolutionary time, they have not gotten proportionally larger in utero, because large-headed babies increase the difficulty of labor and cause increased mortality in childbirth. If childbirth could bypass the pelvic bottleneck, that would allow for fetal heads to grow larger without increasing the risk of killing mother and/or child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And childbirth is a risky proposition for women; 529,000 die every year from this natural process (although only about 1% of those deaths occur in places where women have access to good, modern medical facilities — hooray for modern medicine). About 8% of those deaths occur from obstructed labor, where the fetus is unable to proceed through the birth canal for various reasons, and these are the kinds of birth problems that can be circumvented by C-sections. In practice, teaching health care workers how to carry out emergency C-sections has been tested in regions in Africa, where it has actually worked well at reducing maternal mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the subject of an article by Joseph Walsh in the American Biology Teacher, which suggests that C-sections will have an effect on human evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution." This was the title of an essay by geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky writing in 1973. Many causes have been given for the increased Cesarean section rate in developed countries, but biologic evolution has not been one of them. The C-section rate will continue to rise, because the ability to perform a safe C-section has liberated human childbirth from natural selection directed against too small a maternal pelvis and too large a fetal head. Babies will get bigger and pelves will get smaller because there is nothing to prevent it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence so far is entirely circumstantial, but Walsh makes an interesting case. There are several correlations that &lt;i&gt;imply&lt;/i&gt; an effect, but I can't help but think there are alternative explanations that may swamp out any heritable, evolutionary effect. The kinds of evidence he describes are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A known trend for increasing birth weight in the US, by about 40 g over 18 years in one study. It&amp;#39;s there, all right, but these studies don&amp;#39;t demonstrate a genetic component to increased size — it could be a consequence of better nutrition and medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increasing frequency of C-sections. Again, this isn't necessarily genetically based at all, but could be a consequence of fads in medicine, or social factors, such as an increase in the likelihood of medical malpractice suits making doctors more cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walsh describes a couple of studies that seem to show that cephalopelvic disproportion (small pelvis or large babies or both together) does have a genetic component. So at least it is likely that there are heritable variations in these parameters that could influence the likelihood of obstructed labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is statistical variation in neo-natal mortality that varies with birth weight in a suggestive way. Low birth weight clearly puts infants at risk, and there is an optimum weight around 3600 grams for newborns that minimizes mortality. Death rates also rise with increasing birth weight above the optimum. There is some data that suggest that availablity of modern medical care and C-sections reduces infant mortality at larger birth weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That increasing availability of C-sections might lead to an evolutionary shift towards increasing cranial capacity at birth is a reasonable hypothesis, but I'm not convinced that it has been convincingly demonstrated yet. There are too many variables that effect brain size at birth to make a clean analysis possible; in addition, many of the measures are indirect. Often, we use birth weight as a proxy for cranial capacity, and that means the numbers and correlations are sloppier than they should be. Many of the measurements made are of factors that are readily influenced by the environment, which makes it difficult to imply that these are the product of genetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the idea is weakly supported, but tantalizing. Even as a purely theoretical exercise, though, what it does say is that it is obvious that human culture cannot end human evolution…all it can do is shape the direction in which it can occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That nearly 3/4 chunk of the cosmic budget is &lt;em&gt;dark energy&lt;/em&gt;, the mysterious force (or pressure, really) that appears to be making the expansion of the Universe accelerate. We’ve known the Universe is expanding since the early 20th century, but everyone assumed, logically, that the combined gravity of all the objects in space was slowing the expansion, like tension in a rubber band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in 1998, two independent teams of astronomers and physicists found out that not only is the Universe &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; slowing its bloating, but in fact is bloating ever-faster. This turned physics on its head and even now, on this 10th anniversary of the discovery, we’re still trying to figure out the basics of the phenomenon. We don’t know what’s causing the acceleration, we don’t know what this energy is, what form it takes, nothing. All we can do is observe its effects and speculate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re confused about all this, it’s totally OK– we are too. But we do have &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; clue about what’s going on, and there’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; going on. People, smart people, are on the case, and plans are being made. Telescopes targeted to study dark energy’s effects are in the works, for example. Particle accelerators like the LHC may reveal clues. Your tax dollars (and others’) are at work here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way scientists are spending money is on making sure you, the public, know as much about this as you can. So NASA created the &lt;a href="http://jdem.gsfc.nasa.gov/general.html"&gt;Joint Dark Energy Mission website&lt;/a&gt;, which has info on this matter. JDEM is a space-based astronomical mission that will involve both NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy — because they have a lot of expertise in the field of particle physics and the basic forces ruling the Universe– and will be designed to look to the farthest reaches of space where the effects of dark energy are easiest to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website is still a little sparse, but it does have links to sites with more information about the history of the discovery of dark energy (which is actually pretty interesting) and the science of it as well. It’s Friday, and admit it: you’re bored at work. Why not investigate one of the biggest current mysteries in all of science? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addendum: I know this’ll sound like I’m making it up, but I’m not: it was only after writing this that I realized I do talk about dark energy &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Skies-These-Ways-World/dp/0670019976/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220913560&amp;amp;sr=8-8/badastronomy"&gt;in the new book&lt;/a&gt;, since it has a huge role in how the Universe evolves over trillions of years, and even longer periods of time. &lt;strong&gt;Much&lt;/strong&gt; longer. I don’t go into huge detail in the book, but I explain how this plays into the eventual death of the cosmos itself… and maybe even its rebirth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224256850600"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/i_dont_believe_you_bill.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9f6a956dffa1459b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">I don't believe you, Bill</title><published>2008-10-17T15:38:10Z</published><updated>2008-10-17T15:38:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/423781637/i_dont_believe_you_bill.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/i_dont_believe_you_bill.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bill Donohue is at it again.

&lt;p&gt;October is already half over. It seems like all I’ve been doing is trying to get my resume seen by people and preparing for my over-the-top Pirate Halloween party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t just throw up some cheesy decorations and call it a day. I tend to go all out for these parties. I haven’t had or gone to one in 3 years because I was running a professional haunt. With this year off, I felt compelled to throw one and start decorating my basement once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My buddy came over last night and helped me finish my pirate deck. I think it looks pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the link to have a preliminary look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogimages/Blog-PirateDeck.JPG" alt="" width="433" height="334"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/images/blogimages/Blog-PirateDeck.JPG"&gt;It&lt;/a&gt; still needs work. I plan to add a mast and sails this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other two areas of my basement will be a pirate torture area and the treasure room. Let me know if you’re at all interested and I’ll post some pics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I love Halloween though, October isn’t just about that holiday to me. I love the whole fall season from the crispness in the air to the fall foliage. This year, the foliage seems especially gorgeous, doesn’t it? Well, at least in Connecticut it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife has been known to say that she doesn’t like the fall that much because she sees death wherever she looks. As cool and macabre as that notion is I must disagree. It’s true that the leaves are dying but so what. I ask her if she sees death when she looks at people’s heads. Hair is dead after all isn’t it? The uppermost epidermis layers of our skin are pretty much dead as well. As long as the person or tree is alive underneath, I say…just enjoy the ephemeral beauty that death is affording us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year I say that I wish the leaves looked this beautiful all the time. I plan in the future to genetically engineer trees to make that so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do the leaves change anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall, trees shut down their food factories called leaves because there isn’t enough light or water for them to continue photosynthesizing. The tree enters a resting phase and lives off its stored reserves. As the bright green chlorophyll starts disappearing, yellow and orange colors become noticable since they were already present in the leaves in small amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red and purple colors, on the other hand, are created after photosynthesis stops. Maple trees for example begin trapping glucose in their leaves which reacts with the sunlight and the chilly nights to produce the beautiful red colors we see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brown color of oak tree leaves are actually created by the wastes that builds up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who would think that leaf excrement could be so pretty.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bob Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224253977552"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/freak-shots-time-to-break-out-the-valpak/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/570574d355290f42</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="discounting"/><category term="finance"/><category term="photography"/><title type="html">FREAK Shots: Time to Break Out the Valpak?</title><published>2008-10-17T13:43:23Z</published><updated>2008-10-17T13:43:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/1gLdWArnjTw/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/freak-shots-time-to-break-out-the-valpak/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Not surprisingly, coupons are making a comeback recently - and some shoppers claim they're cutting their grocery bills in half, reports National Public Radio.

&lt;p&gt;Well, it's sort of time, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, it's been over three months since I last indulged in my little Friday exercise known as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/skepticismcritical_thinking/friday_woo/"&gt;Your Friday Dose of Woo&lt;/a&gt;. At the time it was because I couldn't get myself into the appropriately light-hearted but nonetheless just vicious enough frame of mind to do the exercise after we had to have our dog put to sleep.  In retrospect, however, it was clear to me that the whole feature had been running on fumes for a while before that. It had become a bit stale and, I thought, could &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/your_friday_dose_of_woo_will_be_on_hiatu.php"&gt;benefit from a hiatus&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, I hadn't planned for the hiatus to last more than a few weeks, but somehow it stretched into a few months. In fact, even as of yesterday I hadn't been sufficiently inspired and had been planning on something else entirely, although I had intended to bring back YFDoW on an occasional basis beginning...well, soon, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, NaturalNews.com didn't let me down. It shook me out of my lethargy and, let's face it, just plain farting around about this. No, it wasn't Mike Adams, but it was one of his woo-acolytes, a woman named Louise Mclean. Not just any woman, though, but a homeopath. OK, it's not as delightfully woo-filled as some of my previous targets--I mean subjects--for this, but it becomes worthy by its content and by the fact that homeopathy is the granddaddy of woo. After all, it depends upon nothing more than the most amazing of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/05/doctor_strange_and_the_only_way_to_make.php"&gt;magical thinking&lt;/a&gt; in the form of its core concepts of "like cures like" and that dilution with succussion can make remedies stronger. No matter how much homeopaths and their supportive woo contingent try to handwave about the "memory of water" or even "quantum homeopathy," at the end of the day, it's all just woo. But what woo it can be! What reminded me of this and inspired me to begin the process of resurrecting YFDoW is an amazing article by Ms. Mclean entitled &lt;a href="http://www.NaturalNews.com/024512.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Presenting 50 Facts About Homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;. After reading it, my only reaction was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh. My. God.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We all know the story of the Miller-Urey experiment. In 1953, a young graduate student named Stanley Miller ran an off-the-wall experiment: he ran water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen in a sealed flask with a pair of electrodes to produce a spark, and from those simple building blocks discovered that more complex compounds, such as amino acids, were spontaneously produced. Stanley Miller died in 2007, and in going through his effects, the original apparatus was discovered, and in addition, several small sealed vials containing the sludge produced in the original experiment were also found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t too surprising. I’ve gone through a few old scientists’ labs, and you’d be surprised at all the antiquities they preserved, all with notes documenting exactly what they are. It’s habit to keep this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the cool part, though: the scientists who unearthed the old samples ran them through modern analysis techniques, which are a bit more sensitive than the tools they had in the 1950s. In 1953, Miller reported the recovery of five amino acids from his experiment. The reanalysis found &lt;em&gt;twenty two&lt;/em&gt; amino acids and five amines in the vials. He was more successful than he knew!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="width:406px"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/16/miller.jpg" alt="miller.jpg" width="400" height="506"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Moles (relative to glycine = 1) of the various amino acids 
detected in the volcanic apparatus vials. Amino acids underlined have not been previously 
reported in spark discharge experiments. Values for amines are minimum values because of loss due to their volatility during workup.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know that Miller’s reducing atmosphere is no longer considered to be an accurate representation of the ancient earth’s atmosphere. However, the experiment still supported a key idea: that the synthesis of these organic compounds did not require any kind of guiding hand, but would naturally emerge from unassisted chemical reactions. Furthermore, the authors of this paper argue that while it was not a good model of the &lt;em&gt;global&lt;/em&gt; atmosphere, it might still model local conditions in isolated areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geoscientists today doubt that the primitive atmosphere had the highly reducing composition Miller used. However, the volcanic apparatus experiment suggests that, even if the overall atmosphere was not reducing, localized prebiotic synthesis could have been effective. Reduced gases and lightning associated with volcanic eruptions in hot spots or island arc-type systems could have been prevalent on the early Earth before extensive continents formed. In these volcanic plumes, HCN, aldehydes, and ketones may have been produced, which, after washing out of the atmosphere, could have become involved in the synthesis of organic molecules. Amino acids formed in volcanic island systems could have accumulated in tidal areas, where they could be polymerized by carbonyl sulfide, a simple volcanic gas that has been shown to form peptides under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So good work, Dr Miller!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=673"&gt;Geoff Nunberg&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;i&gt;nucular&lt;/i&gt; pronunciation is not the result of a phonetic process that applies across the board in these dialects. It's a lexical phenomenon, though one with a phonetic motivation, and I didn't distinguish the two in my &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt; Op-Ed piece. In this regard I think it's related to &lt;i&gt;Febuary&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;jewlery&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;iurn&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;purty&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Kirsten&lt;/i&gt; (from Christine). I also agree that there is an analogical attraction to words like &lt;i&gt;binoculars&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;particular&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;circular&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;vascular&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;muscular&lt;/i&gt;, but it is one that may have prevailed because the weak perception of the order of the adjacent sonorants in &lt;i&gt;nuclear&lt;/i&gt; failed to resist the tug. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I don't agree with other aspects of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't hear a &lt;i&gt;yu&lt;/i&gt; in the middle syllable of &lt;i&gt;nucular&lt;/i&gt;, but rather a schwa; I suspect the perception of the &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt; is influenced by the spelling. Nor is it clear that this is a faux-bubba disaffectation (both great words, by the way), or a sign of ignorance. Jimmy Carter, during his 1980 debate with Reagan, boasted that he was a nucular engineer, and both Eisenhower and Mondale have been credited with the pronunciation as well. Last Friday I spoke to the Strategic Studies Group at the Naval War College in Newport, RI, and heard the pronunciation from two of the senior analysts there. According to &lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nuclear"&gt;Merriam-Webster&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;Though disapproved of by many, pronunciations ending in [kyələr] have been found in widespread use among educated speakers including scientists, lawyers, professors, congressmen, United States cabinet members, and at least two United States presidents and one vice president.  While most common in the United States, these pronunciations have also been heard from British and Canadian speakers.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I also doubt that &lt;i&gt;nucular&lt;/i&gt; represents conscious linguistic slumming by Bush or Palin. People generally end up with the accents of their late childhood and early adolescent peers, so Midland and Houston were the formative influences on Bush's accent, rather than Kennebunkport and Andover. (It seems unlikely that Bush is faking his entire Texan accent.) And I wonder whether &lt;i&gt;nucular&lt;/i&gt; is enough of a bubba shibboleth to grant a politician more points than he or she loses among the mainstream pundits. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since my op-ed came out I've received many emails with other analyses. One suggested that &lt;i&gt;nucular&lt;/i&gt; involves a back-formation incorporating &lt;i&gt;nuke&lt;/i&gt;, but the timing is wrong: &lt;i&gt;nucular&lt;/i&gt; dates back to the 1950s, but &lt;i&gt;nuke&lt;/i&gt; was still unfamiliar in the mid-1970s. (In 1976, a Harvard graduate-school friend of mine saw the bumper sticker "No Nukes" and thought that it was a racist slogan!) Another correspondent suggested that nucular betrays an ignorance of the connection to nucleus. But do we know whether these speakers also pronounce &lt;i&gt;nucleus&lt;/i&gt; as &lt;i&gt;nuculus&lt;/i&gt;? And do we know whether a &lt;i&gt;nuclear-sayer&lt;/i&gt; could give a clearer explanation of the relation between an atomic nucleus and nuclear power than a &lt;i&gt;nucular-sayer&lt;/i&gt;? We all use technical terms with pronunciations that obscure their original composition, such as &lt;i&gt;helicopter&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;helico&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;i&gt;pter&lt;/i&gt;, "spiral wing"), &lt;i&gt;fax&lt;/i&gt; (from &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;fac&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;imile&lt;/i&gt; "make similar" transmission), &lt;i&gt;modem&lt;/i&gt; ("&lt;u&gt;mo&lt;/u&gt;dulator-&lt;u&gt;dem&lt;/u&gt;odulator"), and so on. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think we can all agree that there's a master's thesis in here for someone: we lack good data on the regional, class, and age distribution of the two pronunciations, and the linguistic and psychological factors that they correlate with. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

After composing countless songs and albums, and with over twenty years of experience in creating enchanting Christian melodies, Sivori was just about to give up.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He wasn’t happy with the way his career was going. This gifted composer/conductor/songwriter/singer/trombone player had seen what he felt was only mediocre sales and impact from his work. But on bended knee, he went to the Lord in prayer and asked for guidance. Upon standing again, he realized that he had at least one more song left in him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Lord promised me that if I would just let go and speak his word in my last song, that it would be a hit and many people would be led to the truth of Jesus Christ. I had faith, and the prayer was answered.” Sivori said. That song is now a Christian classic, which also proved to be Mr. Sivori’s last work before succumbing to pneumonia complications in his Baton Rouge apartment and dying last Thursday evening. The song was called &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Water From a Jawbone&lt;/span&gt;, based on the life of Samson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With permission from &lt;a href="http://ionianspirit.net"&gt;Saving Mythology Records&lt;/a&gt;, the lyrics of this short-but-powerful Christian hymn are reprinted below…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Between Zorah and Eshteal was a strong man, a strong man.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Between Zorah and Eshteal was a man given to lust and whores, lust and whores. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Oh, sun man Samson!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Oh, sun man Samson!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;He killed many men and bragged about it, slew them without thinking about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Oh, sun man!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Oh, mighty sun man!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Just like Hercules, a product of mythologies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Oh, sun man Samson!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Oh, sun man Samson!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;He slew a thousand men with the jawbone of an ass, and then God gave him water to last. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Oh, oh, oh, water from a jawbone! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;There was water from a jawbone!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;When he was alone, there was water from a bone!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;There was water from a jawbone, saving water from a jawbone!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Amennnnnnnnnnnn!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;The song was a huge success. Many Christians praised it. It went triple platinum within the first month of its release. But while the majority of the Christian world praised the work, there were some disgruntled voices that could be heard in their midst.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first criticism was that Sivori was dishonoring God by associating the story of Samson with paganism. Sivori defended the song thusly: “God is an inclusive God. His grace works among the pagans as well as us. This is why there were a number of virgin-born savior-god-men, like Hercules and Perseus, well before Christ’s time. Church father Justin Martyr even admits this in his work Apologia I. The name ‘Samson’ actually means ‘sun man’, meaning his character was brought over from paganism. He was a sun god made into a man, but God wanted the story in the Bible to show how inclusive he can be. Besides, the Bible is a book that is 95 percent mythology. The very first book of the Bible has angels getting boners for earth girls (Genesis 6:1-4). With such silly heathen myths found all throughout our holy book, how can we but be diligent in using these occurrences to demonstrate to the pagans that Jesus Christ died for their sins?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what of the charge that his song denigrates God and puts him on the level of a violent thug? Mr. Sivori says: “There’s really not much I can say about that. All one has to do is pick up the Bible and open it to absolutely any page and they can see for themselves somewhere on that page just how vicious, vindictive, and openly violent God is. God was happy having Samson carry out his divine will by slaughtering a thousand men and then bragging about it (Judges 15:15-17). One has to be pretty stupid to miss the fact that the most righteous men in the Bible are unequivocally the bloodiest. Take David, for example; he was God’s favorite Old Testament saint, but even he had so much blood on his hands that Father God decided that he couldn’t build his house for him” (I Chronicles 22:8).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr. Sivori went on to say…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“The lesson is, instead of finding fault with God and trying to change him, as I had tried to do in my earlier songs, we need to accept his character and who he really is. Jesus Christ is the most merciful side of God there can be, but the savior with outstretched arms himself is more than willing to cast us into a lake of fire where there ‘shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth’ (Matthew 13:50). For years, I gave it my all, like so many Christians do, to make God look more presentable, to make him look nicer. But that was wrong of me. God is not nice. Nobody needs to hear about John 3:16 and lovey-dovey passages that falsely portray God as some gentleman with a beard and a timepiece. No, God is a mauling warrior, with sinews for bootlaces and skulls for beverage containers, and he must be portrayed as such (Exodus 15:3).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Having left us a rich musical treasure chest of angelic tunes, Mr. Sivori is now resting in the sweet bosom of Jesus. His music mentor was another great composer, that sweet singer of Israel, King David, who was arguably God’s first big-time music maker...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.” (Psalm 59:13)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;(JH)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know the story of the Miller-Urey experiment. In 1953, a young graduate student named Stanley Miller ran an off-the-wall experiment: he ran water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen in a sealed flask with a pair of electrodes to produce a spark, and from those simple building blocks discovered that more complex compounds, such as amino acids, were spontaneously produced. Stanley Miller died in 2007, and in going through his effects, the original apparatus was discovered, and in addition, several small sealed vials containing the sludge produced in the original experiment were also found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't too surprising. I've gone through a few old scientists' labs, and you'd be surprised at all the antiquities they preserved, all with notes documenting exactly what they are. It's habit to keep this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the cool part, though: the scientists who unearthed the old samples ran them through modern analysis techniques, which are a bit more sensitive than the tools they had in the 1950s. In 1953, Miller reported the recovery of five amino acids from his experiment. The reanalysis found &lt;i&gt;twenty two&lt;/i&gt; amino acids and five amines in the vials. He was more successful than he knew!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="miller.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/16/miller.jpg" width="400" height="506"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moles (relative to glycine = 1) of the various amino acids 
detected in the volcanic apparatus vials. Amino acids underlined have not been previously 
reported in spark discharge experiments. Values for amines are minimum values because of loss due to their volatility during workup.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know that Miller's reducing atmosphere is no longer considered to be an accurate representation of the ancient earth's atmosphere. However, the experiment still supported a key idea: that the synthesis of these organic compounds did not require any kind of guiding hand, but would naturally emerge from unassisted chemical reactions. Furthermore, the authors of this paper argue that while it was not a good model of the &lt;i&gt;global&lt;/i&gt; atmosphere, it might still model local conditions in isolated areas.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geoscientists today doubt that the primitive atmosphere had the highly reducing composition Miller used. However, the volcanic apparatus experiment suggests that, even if the overall atmosphere was not reducing, localized prebiotic synthesis could have been effective. Reduced gases and lightning associated with volcanic eruptions in hot spots or island arc-type systems could have been prevalent on the early Earth before extensive continents formed. In these volcanic plumes, HCN, aldehydes, and ketones may have been produced, which, after washing out of the atmosphere, could have become involved in the synthesis of organic molecules. Amino acids formed in volcanic island systems could have accumulated in tidal areas, where they could be polymerized by carbonyl sulfide, a simple volcanic gas that has been shown to form peptides under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So good work, Dr Miller!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Dr Moore.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Moore is not only a well rated teacher of biology and evolution but his approach ensures that evolution is taught as the unifying element of modern biology. Recognizing that the fact of evolution is well supported through evidences from a variety of specialties, Dr Moore observes that no controversy exists among biologists that evolution occurs. In addition, Moore observes, correctly, that while there are some disagreements about the relevant importance of the various mechanisms, there exists no alternative scientific explanation which captures the empirical data as well as evolutionary theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For nearly 30 years, Dr. Moore has based his teaching of biology explicitly on evolution. His introductory biology courses, for example, do not treat evolution as a stand-alone or discrete topic. Rather, his instruction incorporates evolution as a unifying element of modern biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The evidence supporting evolution is overwhelming and comes from diverse disciplines, such as molecular biology, paleontology, comparative anatomy, ethology, and biochemistry. There is no controversy among biologists about whether evolution occurs, nor are there science-based alternative theories,” states Dr. Moore. “Evolution is a unifying theme in biology; teaching it as such is the best way to show students what biology is about and how they can use evolution as a tool to understand our world. [Evolution] is as important an idea as there is in science - it is a great gift to give to students,” says Dr. Moore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to teaching his students, Dr Moore has helped K-12 teachers to develop the skills necessary to effectively teach science. Dr Moore’s dedication to science is exemplified by the fact that he is a founding member of the Minnesota Citizens for Science Education, a grassroots organization that defends the teaching of evolution in local schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Moore has worked beyond the classroom to improve public understanding of science and to help K-12 teachers continue to develop skills that help them effectively teach science. He has taught several summer workshops for K-12 teachers, has spoken to local groups of teachers and school districts, and has organized a Learning Abroad course titled “Evolution and the Biology of the Galapagos.” Additionally, Dr. Moore was a founding member of the Minnesota Citizens for Science Education, a grassroots organization that defends the teaching of evolution in local schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Moore understands the importance of building a dialogue between science and religious groups, even though he also strongly opposes the teaching of creationism in science classes, both on pedagogical as well as legal grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Moore has worked to build dialogue between science and religious groups. “I grew up with, understand, and respect religious traditions. I strongly oppose the teaching of creationism in science classes, not only because it is not science, but it is unlawful,” says Moore, “&lt;strong&gt;Distorting science to placate particular religious views is not only bad pedagogy; it also belittles faith.&lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randy Moore is also author of “Educational Malpractice Why Do So Many Biology Teachers Endorse Creationism?”, &lt;em&gt;Skeptical Inquirer&lt;/em&gt; Nov, 2001 in which he explores the situation surrounding the teaching of evolution in public schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition Dr Moore  has published a variety of scientific papers, and a number of books, including &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157607420X/103-9156826-5356664?v=glance&amp;amp;n=283155" rel="external "&gt;Evolution in the Courtroom&lt;/a&gt; (2001), &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0072472898/103-9156826-5356664?v=glance&amp;amp;n=283155" rel="external "&gt;Principles of Botany&lt;/a&gt; (2001) and &lt;a href="http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/GR3292.aspx" rel="external "&gt;Evolution 101&lt;/a&gt; (2006).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In addition, according to PZ Myers, Dr Moore also received the much coveted Discovery Institute Award: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/congratulations_to_randy_moore.php" rel="external "&gt;The Award for Most Dogmatic Indoctrinator in an Evolutionary Biology Course. &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Senator Obama's support for preventative medical care is another little noted but important key point of difference with Senator McCain that emerged from the debate. Under Obama it is far more likely that insurance plans will cover alternative medicine, including acupuncture, therapy, and government approved herbs and vitamins. This category alone could more than double the current spending by pharmaceutical companies, and would give a boost to local market media as Alternative Care centers compete with traditional medicine. Again, a McCain presidency is likely to bring this windfall to a screeching halt.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the hell did Jack Myers get this idea from? This is the first time I've heard anything like this. Myers seems to equate woo with "preventative" care, and he doesn't explain on what basis he concludes that Obama's plan is more likely to cover woo.

&lt;p&gt;November looks like being a big month for TLS though. In particular, there are four big developments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Praxis returns to its home blog for the first time on November 15th.&lt;br&gt;
2) Due to a stroke of luck I'll be hosting the Carnival of the Liberals on U.S. Election night.&lt;br&gt;
3) I can finally start working on a reimplementation of the BPSDB code, with new features in the pipeline.&lt;br&gt;
4) I'll be starting a new, "professional" blog on the side.&lt;/p&gt;

First, I got a little worked up during last night's debate because, when discussing health problems, both candidates gave shout-outs to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/voteforscience/2008/09/what_diseases_do_the_candidate.php"&gt;relatively rare conditions rather than to the big killers&lt;/a&gt;.  My second mistake was more grievous.  I read &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deirdre-imus/to-the-presidential-candi_b_133721.html"&gt;something in HuffPo&lt;/a&gt; written by Deirdre Imus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one brings the stupid quite like Deirdre.  When she talks about health, it's like a 12th century peasant talking about quantum mechanics----most of the time, she's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong"&gt;not even wrong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deirdre's upset.  She's upset that the candidates haven't addressed children's healt issues.  That's reasonable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Anticipating the lack of attention always given to children, last April I sent a questionnaire to both Senators McCain and Obama in order to elicit their positions and strategies "to address children's health issues."

&lt;p&gt;Despite numerous calls to both campaign offices, neither has had the courtesy to respond to a few specific questions that are critically important to millions of parents and could garner millions of votes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the candidates don't care about kids.  Or perhaps the candidates strategically feel that these issues won't get them the votes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe they just think Imus is a crackpot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was upset about not hearing back from the candidates, so she posted her questionnaire online.  After reading it, I'm pretty sure I understand why it was ignored.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/health_priorities.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/health_priorities.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/423164158" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224198434583"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-6148825491303394469">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d5453c4b987e73a0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnival" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Tangled Bank #116</title><published>2008-10-16T23:04:00Z</published><updated>2008-10-16T23:06:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/10/tangled-bank-116.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/6148825491303394469/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=6148825491303394469" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The latest issue of Tangled Bank has been published on Pro-Science [116th Tangled Bank].&lt;br&gt;Welcome to the 116th edition of the Tangled Bank.

As I recounted the patient's ER course, the intern stopped me and said, "Pal --- trust no one."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sounded a little harsh to me, but the intern was nice enough to explain further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Look, you're going to be taking calls from doctors and nurses the rest of your career.  They are going to give you information about a patient, but it's &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; who will be responsible for everything that goes right and wrong.  Do you want to hang yourself on someone else's evaluation?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As any internist knows, there is a perpetual tension between ER and internal medicine docs.  ER docs need to save lives and move meat.  The snapshot the ER doc gets is sometimes inconsistent with the bigger picture the internist sees, leading to some conflict.  It's inevitable, really, that how the patient looks in the ER will differ from how they are up on the floor several hours later.  And this is what my intern was conveying to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients will often complain about the parade of students, interns, residents, and attendings who seem to ask the same set of questions, but this was my intern's point: things change, stories change, clinical facts change, and you better make sure the facts you report are the facts you verified.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(As an aside, it's a not infrequent occurrence that a patient's story will change significantly with the length of the white coat.  The indigestion the student hears about becomes the crushing sub-sternal chest pain the attending rushes to the cath lab.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also remind patients that they don't know which one of us might be called to their bedside in the middle of the night, so it's best tolerate us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is my long-winded way of getting to the issue of trust.  There are ER doctors who I've worked with for years and I know pretty well.  I know their quirks, and I know that what they tell me is how it is (at that particular moment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I get an ER call from someone I don't know, I will listen politely, but I'm probably going to see that patient first and re-check everything myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So "trust no one" isn't precisely the dictum, but it's a start.  Clearly level of trust is influenced by many different factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At January's &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Conference_Program/"&gt;ScienceOnline09&lt;/a&gt; conference, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2008/10/the_pseudonymity_laboratory_do.php"&gt;Terra Sig's Abel Pharmboy&lt;/a&gt; and I will be hosting a session on blogging and anonymity.  It's a topic particularly important to us as bloggers of medical science.  A number of months ago, I "unmasked" myself and never really explained to anyone why.  Pseudonyms are a big part of blog culture, and I preferred to keep mine while no longer guarding my real identity (for various reasons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would argue that in the blogosphere, there are three levels of identity: real name identity, pseudonymity, and anonymity.  Real name identity is still not the "real person".  People write and behave differently online.  Pseudonymity (my particular choice) involves using a pseudonym, but having one's true name generally known or available.  Anonymity is just that---the attempt to keep your real life identity completely secret.  Each of these levels has different implications on both how the writer behaves and how the reader perceives.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abel has brought the issue of trust forward---both the reader's trust of the blogger, and the blogger's trust in the reader.  At our session (which we'd love to have you at, but will probably blog about, or better yet, maybe we'll live blog it and take questions) I'm sure we'll address lots of these issues, but we'd like to hear from denizens of the blogosphere.   Abel's question was, "do you trust me?"  My question to you is, "Do you consider blogger identity when reading, and if so how?  And do you find there to be a difference in the three levels of identity?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or of course, ignore my question, and say whatever you wish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/10/who_the_hell_are_these_blogger.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/423105725" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224195625292"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/drinking_liberally_in_morris.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5b564116c65bc0be</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Drinking Liberally in Morris!</title><published>2008-10-16T22:03:36Z</published><updated>2008-10-16T22:03:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/423065147/drinking_liberally_in_morris.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/drinking_liberally_in_morris.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a long hiatus, we're having a Drinking Liberally event at 7 tonight, at Old #1.

&lt;p&gt;What is this article missing? Any sort of idea that &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/astrology.html"&gt;astrology is total and utter nonsense&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, at the very end there is a single anecdote about how one astrologer was wrong once, and the client lost money. But the first 90% of the article is all about astrology, and how many financial astrologers there are, and how much they charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It never once uses the word &amp;quot;fraud&amp;quot;, more’s the pity. Amazing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, if you are concerned over this market, and you decide to go to an astrologer to get advice, this I will guarantee: you will lose money… the amount charged by the flim flam artist. But I bet the financial news is great for astrologers, because there will always be people lined up to pay them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I love the way the article ends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t seen any successful studies or back testing or white papers on the subject to sway me,” [Steven Kaye, president of the American Economic Planning Group in Watchung] said. “But who knows? It’s probably better than listening to a tip from your brother-in-law’s foreman.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I’m quite sure it is precisely no better at all. It’s just as random, just as ill-informed, and just as silly.&lt;/p&gt;

Outwith mechanical intervention, pain management is about all there is, and even then, the painkillers can have side effects and long term effects that aren't much fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Put yourself in that position - constant chronic pain, only slightly eased by medication - and suddenly old wives tales, exotic berries and other natural products seem to hold the answer.  We can't hope for pill-pushers and nonsense therapy merchants to have much proof, because people buy the dream, not the evidence.  We need medicine and knowledge that is evidence-based to be able to base our pain-management approach on treatments that have been shown to be effective. Otherwise, we're throwing our money at the moon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We start the rosy story off with the Daily Mail, providing another excellent candidate for &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2007/09/theory-1.html"&gt;Dr* T's First Theory&lt;/a&gt; as it announces:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-462608/Are-rose-hips-remedy-agony-arthritis.html"&gt;Are Rosehips a Remedy from the agony of arthritis?&lt;/a&gt; 18/06/2007&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's funny that the Daily Mail should put this in question form - it had already claimed they '&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-378719/Herbal-remedy-reduce-arthritis-agony.html"&gt;may reduce arthritis agony&lt;/a&gt;' in March 2006, '&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-423256/Rosehips-help-tackle-inflammatory-diseases.html"&gt;tackle inflammatory diseases&lt;/a&gt;' in December 2006 and '&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/you/article-500316/A-hip-remedy-helps-joint-pain.html"&gt;helps joint pain&lt;/a&gt;' in December 2007 - maybe they weren't sure, but just to drive the point home, they decided it was worth telling everyone again in September 2008 that they &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1059240/Rosehips-protect-joints-arthritis.html"&gt;'protect the joints from arthritis'&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why so many touts for the humble hedgerow habitant, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;rosa canina&lt;/span&gt;? Well, it should take you less than 5 seconds to realise that the connection between all the touts is a product called LitoZin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XSCXYE5_zNo/SPeeTzgIS-I/AAAAAAAAADg/lWEPj2Lj3sY/s1600-h/aq2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XSCXYE5_zNo/SPeeTzgIS-I/AAAAAAAAADg/lWEPj2Lj3sY/s200/aq2.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Here are a few quotes from the Daily Mail report:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A herbal medicine made from rosehips may regenerate joints in people crippled by arthritis, say scientists.&lt;br&gt;Studies show it can protect the cartilage cells which facilitate joint movement. Researchers claim the red hips - one of nature's richest sources of vitamin C - also improve activity levels by damping down an over-active immune system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Swiss studies looked at the action of the sugary fatty acid GOPO, the active ingredient in the rosehip supplement LitoZin. Researchers from the department of human nutrition and health in Basle, Switzerland, measured the effects of different doses on human cartilage cells.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Department of Human Nutrition &amp;amp; Health in Basel, eh? Which university is that associated with, or indeed, why doesn&amp;#39;t it say the name of the organisation? That&amp;#39;s probably because the scientists are part of the Department of Human Nutrition &amp;amp; Health at DSM Nutritional Products, Basel, who manufacture i-Flex (nothing to do with Apple) which is marketed in Europe as  .... LitoZin. (Press release &lt;a href="http://www.dsm.com/en_US/html/dnp/news_items/23_09_2008_i-flex.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What a surprise. Now why was that bit left out of the Daily Mail report? The &lt;a href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/madrid?madridnum=M806005"&gt;trademark&lt;/a&gt; is actually held by Dansk Droge, a Danish company, and perhaps why a lot of the Daily Mail articles refer to scientists in Copenhagen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now let me make two important points - firstly, the research may be of an astounding quality and impeccable beyond reproach. However, the fact that Daily Mail hides this information makes me think maybe it isn't. Also the fact that it is "announced at the Osteoarthritis Research Society's International World Congress in Rome" rather than in a peer-reviewed research journal means it's difficult to find out what went on. Secondly, there may well be some active ingredient in rosehips worth looking at, but, as I said above, with products like these, good research does little to enhance the sales, because people are buying a dream, regardless of the evidence. (I'll also remind you that &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2008/10/only-people-who-think-glucosamine-works.html"&gt;we arthrites seem to be particularly susceptible&lt;/a&gt; to placebo). Why bother putting together a large well-run trial, when the same sales can be achieved by 2 or 3 small irrelevant ones?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So to recap, Daily Mail has published, on &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;5 separate occasions&lt;/span&gt; PR fluff from DSM (or their UK distributors - LanesHealth www.litozin.co.uk, or online from www.arthritis-relief.co.uk) citing little/no firm evidence but being suspiciously cagey about where the evidence came from. Such is the state of &lt;a href="http://engineroomblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/word-of-day-churnalism.html"&gt;churnalism&lt;/a&gt; in the UK press - the stories we read are there because they help line the pockets of the pill peddlers (and their PR agents) and nothing to do with public service, furtherance of scientific advances or importantly, helping people suffering from arthritis, except to empty their wallets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One organisation who decided the evidence is absent, is the bastion of company's claims in print and other media, the &lt;a href="http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/"&gt;Advertising Standards Authority&lt;/a&gt;. I've &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/search?q=asa"&gt;written about the ASA&lt;/a&gt; on a number of occasions, and praise them from the rooftops. My angst with them is that they have no power and no bite, save producing indirectly a few bits of negative PR.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Healthy Marketing Ltd (trading as &lt;a href="http://www.woodshealth.com/acatalog/Woods_Supplements.html"&gt;Woods Supplements&lt;/a&gt;) came up against the &lt;a href="http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_45163.htm"&gt;ASA this week&lt;/a&gt; (15th Oct 2008). A direct mail catalogue had a claim, headlined "Rose-Hips may Ease Arthritic Pain ... ", appearing next to an image of the Daily Mail article headlined &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-462608/Are-rose-hips-remedy-agony-arthritis.html"&gt;"Are rose-hips the answer to the agony of arthritis?"&lt;/a&gt;, which stated rose hips had an unknown active ingredient that affected the blood cells involved in inflammatory and immune responses. The catalogue contained a myriad of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;en vogue&lt;/span&gt; health supplements which you can enjoy at your leisure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the adjudication, Woods Supplements provided information, abstracts or the references of studies related to the properties of each supplement, including the Rosehip pills, to which the ASA summed up as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We noted some references to clinical trials but that there was not enough information for us to assess whether the trial was valid or supported the claims.  We therefore considered the information provided was insufficient to substantiate the claims made about the benefits of the supplements.  We concluded the claims had not been substantiated and were therefore misleading.&lt;/blockquote&gt; So there you have it. Unsubstantiated and misleading. In the interests of disclosure, I should mention that I eat rosehip syrup quite often. Not for arthritis, but because rosehip syrup is &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2006/oct/21/recipes.dessert"&gt;easy to make&lt;/a&gt;, cheap and fantastically tasty with greek yoghurt. Maybe one day the pill peddlers will carry out a well-run clinical trial on rosehips which will warrant me to really indulge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:78%"&gt;&lt;a href="http://layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;BPSDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Thinking Is Dangerous</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224188915943"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/our-daily-bleg-your-inaccurate-statements-please/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b9eaa2b6828c2475</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="bleg"/><category term="fred shapiro"/><category term="quote"/><title type="html">Our Daily Bleg: Your Inaccurate Statements, Please</title><published>2008-10-16T20:06:31Z</published><updated>2008-10-16T20:06:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/JltDDuXocu8/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/our-daily-bleg-your-inaccurate-statements-please/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Our resident quote bleggar Fred Shapiro, editor of the Yale Book of Quotations, is back with another request.

It is an excellent demonstration of exactly what we are trying to accomplish with the SGU - at least one of our goals, which is to give skeptics the tools to be better skeptics and to help spread critical thinking. Thanks for the feedback, Joreth (if that is your real name &lt;img src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;———–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear SGU Members:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank you and let you know your efforts are not in vain.  I credit you with directly contributing to the turning of an autism-comes-from-vaccines believer.  Here’s the story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was at work the other day and someone asked what the device was on my arm.  I told him it was my iPod.  He asked what I was listening to and I said “The Skeptics Guide To The Universe”.  He asked what it was about and I gave a brief summary that included something to the effect of “using science and skepticism to debunk popular myths and pseudo-science”.  He said something like “you mean like how vaccines cause autism?”  I rolled my eyes and immediately launched into a tirade of how that just isn’t true.  He started quizzing me.  To my surprise, I was able to answer each point and counterpoint he threw at me clearly, concisely, and rationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the conversation (which lasted about an hour), he confided in me that he had a son with autism and that it was his son’s physician who identified the cause as vaccines.  I immediately blushed and frantically reviewed the conversation to see how insensitive I had been in my debunking statements.  But he said that, having a personal interest in the matter, he has gone out of his way to review every claim made on the issue and he often goes back and forth over whether or not vaccines are linked to autism.  He was currently on the side of “yes they do” when he met me.  His doctor was the primary reason for this.  The doctor pointed to images of his son’s blood, identified elements as various heavy metals in the blood, and said, conclusively, “this is the cause of your son’s autism and it came from vaccines”.  This coworker didn’t see any reason why a medical doctor would say something conclusively like that if there was any question that it might be wrong (I pointed out that any individual in the scientific community is just as likely to be prone to biases and misinformation, and that it’s the community as a whole, and their consensus, that should be given more weight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that I was the first person he had met who had clear answers for all his challenges, and that I seemed informed, whereas everyone else was simply repeating what they had heard without understanding why it was true, much like those they accuse in the True Believers side (my words, not his).  He said that I had swung him back to the No side with my arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all those arguments I got from you guys.  Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some backstory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already on this side of the argument before I began listening to your show.  But I couldn’t argue my position.  The way my brain seems to be working as I get older is that I can understand what I’m being taught, and I can understand it pretty thoroughly, but over time (and it’s not a very long time), if I don’t re-teach or use the information regularly, the details of the lesson will begin to get fuzzy and eventually I’m left with just my impression of the conclusion, not how I arrived there.  This makes debating difficult, since all I can say is “I can’t tell you why, but trust me, the evidence was convincing!”  It’s a bit distressing, because when I was school-age, I had a nearly-photographic memory and could recite just about anything I read, word for word, and could often even repeat things I heard, down to the vocal inflection, making all my boyfriends at that age dread any kind of argument with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a civil rights activist (I promise, this is related), and my areas of special interest are sexuality and personal freedoms.  I am gradually becoming a leader in the local community in this fight.  The strategy that I believe is the first, and most important step, is education.  I engage people in conversation that challenges their assumptions and educates them on the myths of their ideas, such as, humans are naturally monogamous and heterosexual and that the opposite orientations are “choices” (I’m making sweeping statements for the sake of simplicity, since this letter isn’t about these topics).  I also am a female in a male-dominated industry, so I am constantly challenging assumptions made about gender, using scientific studies to back up my claims, not just saying what I want to be true since I am female, or anecdotal evidence.  The goal with civil rights education is not necessarily to “convert” someone into whatever minority group I’m defending, since that’s really not possible, but to clear up misconceptions so that people do not fear the minority group and accept that they have equal rights and responsibilities as American citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the process of growing into this role as educator and community leader, I’ve had to tackle issues of politics and science as my debate opponents get progressively more sophisticated as I move up the ladder.  My journey has even taken me in the direction of media attention, so I’ve been attempting to polish my presentation to soundbite answers that are more palatable to the media and also harder to take out of context.  This, I found, makes my overall debate tactics more difficult to penetrate, although I feel I am still a novice with much to learn.  I’ve also been working on some attempts to handle amateur Gish Gallop tactics, which is what a great deal of uninformed people use.  I think it’s because of their lack of understanding of the subject, they string together all sorts of unrelated issues to form one big ball of stupid, although I think Gish uses his tactic intentionally to confuse and disorient his opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this journey of mine, I have come to broaden my interests to other scientific topics, such as the vaccine debate, evolution, bigfoot, etc.  I’ve reached the position where credulity pisses me off.  So in the meandering way of the amateurs, these other topics come up in debate too, but these are topics that I do not have regular practice in defending.  When I started getting into them, it was mainly online and I could just send people links, so I would refer them to my friends and partners who were polished in these subjects.  I began listening to your show, going all the way back to the beginning (and I’m still only in 2006), because it came so highly recommended by those friends I was routinely referring to in science debates.  As your show matured, it seemed to emphasize skepticality as a skill, a tool to use in the fight against ignorance and began to actually teach us some of those skills, rather than just advocate them, starting with your 10 Most Common Logical Fallacies and adding segments to your show that honed those skills, like the logic puzzles and Guess That Logical Fallacy and even with the first one, Science Or Fiction.  I made a conscious decision that I needed to work on my presentation and my debate skills in all of these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So by the time this debate happened a few days ago, I had already heard several episodes that touched upon the vaccine debate, and I had just decided to start studying the logical fallacies.  I was able to use more thought-out responses, in a clear manner that my opponent could understand, and I was able to point out the flaw in his own positions.  He left the debate with a strong interest in finding your podcast and website, and a renewed belief that vaccines do not cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thank you, and here’s hoping you get a new listener soon!&lt;/p&gt;

As you may recall, a few months ago he was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/john_mccain_panders_to_the_mercury_militia.php"&gt;tripped up by the antivaccine fearmongers&lt;/a&gt; who think, despite an absence of scientifically compelling evidence supporting their view, that vaccines cause autism. Now that Sarah Palin is on the ticket, he's doing it again, this time in the context of discussing her qualifications to be President. As part of a response to a question about why the country would be better off if his choice of a running mate became President compared to Barack Obama's choice (Joe Biden), he &lt;a href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=205"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;She'll be my partner. She understands reform. And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families. She understands that autism is on the rise, that we've got to find out what's causing it, and we've got to reach out to these families, and help them, and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of a question about special education, he said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;And I just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children -- precious children who have autism. Sarah Palin knows about that better than most. And we'll find and we'll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism. And we'll care for these young children. And all Americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/multimedia/pulsar_stills.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/10/pulsar_illustration.jpg" alt="Illustration of a pulsar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a &lt;font size="-4"&gt;(Bruce)&lt;/font&gt; banner moment for NASA’s &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/gr_pulsar.html"&gt;new Fermi satellite&lt;/a&gt;: it’s found a pulsar that emits only gamma rays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brief background: when a massive star explode, its core collapses. If it has enough mass, the core shrinks down into a black hole. If it doesn’t have quite that much oomph (if it has about 1 - 2.8 times the mass of the Sun) it forms a weird object called a neutron star. As massive as a star but only a few kilometers across, a neutron star is incredibly dense, rapidly rotating, and has a magnetic field intense enough to give you an MRI from a million kilometers away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, I made that last one up, but in fact it sounds about right. The point: neutron stars are &lt;em&gt;seriously&lt;/em&gt; awesome, right on the edge of matter as we understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supercharged magnetic field channels a tremendously powerful flow of energy away from the star in twin beams like a lighthouse. And, like a lighthouse, as the star rotates these beams sweep around. If they’re aimed at Earth we see a pair of pulses every time the star spins around once. So, duh, we call these special neutron stars &lt;em&gt;pulsars&lt;/em&gt;. You can see a way cool animation of this on &lt;a href="http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a010000/a010200/a010205/index.html"&gt;NASA’s Conceptual Image Lab web page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, the beams from these pulsars contain light from all (or nearly all) across the electromagnetic spectrum. We seem them in radio waves, visible light, ultraviolet, even X-rays and some in gamma rays. The processes that create these beams are pretty fierce and weird, and the type of light emitted depends on the process. However, in general, if we see high energy light (like X- and gamma rays) from a pulsar, we tend to see it in lower energy light (optical and radio) as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Fermi found an oddball! Located about 4600 light years away in the constellation of Cepheus, CTA-1 is a supernova remnant, the expanding debris from an exploding star. But that expanding junk is only from the outer layers of the detonated star: the core collapsed down into a neutron star, and that’s what Fermi detected. This newly discovered gamma-ray-only pulsar spins three times per second — think on that; an object with the mass of an entire star spinning at that rate! — and is blasting out gamma radiation &lt;em&gt;with 1000 times the Sun’s entire energy output&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all of it in super-high energy invisible gamma rays. The Hulk has nothing on this pulsar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, let’s pause for just a sec. Is it sunny outside? Good. Go outside, and hold your hand up. Feel the warmth? That’s just a bit of optical light warming your hand. Now think about how much energy is falling over the entire Earth itself, a gazillion times the size of your hand. Now think about how much energy the Sun is emitting in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; directions; the entire Earth only intercepts about one-two billionths of that light. Now think about &lt;em&gt;one thousand times&lt;/em&gt; that much energy. Now think of all that energy being only in the form of DNA-shattering gamma rays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, now you’re getting it. This object is seriously freaky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know of about 1800 pulsars, and all of them emit radio waves. &lt;em&gt;All but this guy&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a brand new category of object (well, a sub category, but still), a new character on the cosmic stage. But why does it &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; emit gamma rays? Hey, good question. I don’t know the answer (and the press release doesn’t say, in fact). I suspect the answer right now is, &lt;em&gt;we don’t know&lt;/em&gt;. This object was only discovered a little while ago, and worse, gamma rays are really difficult to study. That’s why we launched Fermi in the first place! Worse even than that, without being able to look at this object in radio, optical, or any other form of light really hobbles our ability to study it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I think we’ll have to rely on Fermi’s observations and then look at theoretical models. I imagine there will be astronomers all over the world pouncing on this, trying to figure out how the magnetic fields of the star can be so choosy (maybe they’re elitist). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But until then, as usual, I have to wonder: if we only just now found this object, what the heck &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; is floating around out there just waiting for us to find?&lt;/p&gt;

So far, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/servicing/SM4/news/status_update_20081016.html"&gt;things look good&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the night of Oct. 15, Space Telescope Operations Control Center engineers at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center turned on and checked out Side ‘B’ of Hubble’s Science Instrument Control and Data Handling (SIC&amp;amp;DH) system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) and Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) instruments were retrieved from safe mode to establish that each has a working interface to the Side B SIC&amp;amp;DH. The instruments were then commanded back into safe mode, and will remain in that state until the SI C&amp;amp;DH begins issuing commands to them later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around noon today commands to recover Hubble’s science instruments from their safe modes will begin and internal exposures and calibrations of the telescope’s science instruments will occur before midnight Thursday.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, they’re so confident things are going well that they have exposures scheduled for Friday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore should complete their review of the internal exposures by noon on Friday, October 17. […] A full schedule of science observations with the WFPC2 camera, ACS’ Solar Blind Channel camera, and the Fine Guidance Sensors will resume early Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W00t!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Note to NASA: thanks for getting this news up in a timely fashion.

The Hive Overmind has been notified, but in the meantime here is the post again. I hope you can see it! But if you’re reading this note, you can see it, and if you can’t read this note, then why am I sitting here talking to myself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/09/15/john-mccain-literally-antiscience/"&gt;a little while back&lt;/a&gt;, John McCain made an ill-advised crack about planetaria (that’s the plural of planetarium), calling them &amp;quot;foolishness&amp;quot;. It was ill advised because it raised the hackles of lots of science-loving folks, including those who want to — gasp, horror! — educate kids about astronomy and science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time I suspected it was just a wedge in which to attack Barack Obama, but his use of the word &lt;em&gt;foolishness&lt;/em&gt; really caught my attention. I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, but does he really dislike such things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, last night removed any doubt, when McCain — twice — used Obama’s requested earmark of three million dollars for Adler planetarium as a bludgeon, trying to pin Obama as another pork-barrel politician. He disdainfully said the money was for an &amp;quot;overhead projector&amp;quot;. Those are his exact words. Here’s what he said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks he [Senator Obama, or &amp;quot;that one&amp;quot;] voted for nearly $1 billion in pork barrel earmark projects. Including $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois. My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, shock of shocks — it turns out McCain’s characterization of this was all wrong. In fact, I would call it a lie. He knows it wasn’t for an overhead projector, a piece of classroom equipment that costs a couple of hundred dollars. That money was for Adler’s &lt;a href="http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/aboutus/index.shtml#facts"&gt;Zeiss Mark VI star projector&lt;/a&gt;: a venerable piece of precision fabricated equipment that projects the stars, constellations, and other objects inside the planetarium dome. Adler’s Zeiss is 40 years old, and desperately needs replacing. These machines are pricey, and replacing them difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adler needed money to do this. They asked local politicians, and eventually were able to get a request in a budget submitted by Obama. However, Obama never even voted on that budget, and Adler never got that money — thus making, again, McCain a liar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, Adler wasn’t thrilled with this characterization of their beloved Zeiss. &lt;a href="http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/pressroom/pr/2008_10_08_AdlerStatement_aboutdebate.pdf"&gt;They issued a statement to that effect&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get opinions all over the place: &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2008/10/08/of-overhead-projectors-and-planetarium-foolishness/"&gt;Universe Today&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://thespacewriter.com/wp/2008/10/07/who-knew-a-planetarium-was-a-political-weapon/"&gt;SpaceWriter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://theperfectsilence.com/?p=417"&gt;Davin Flateau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/space/my-take/mccain-obama-planetarium-projector.html"&gt;Discovery Space&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://wonkette.com/403365/barack-obamas-3-million-overhead-projector-made-of-pork"&gt;Wonkette&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2008/10/obama-adler-on-defense-after-mccain-criticism.html"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;, even &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/politics/2008/10/that_planetarium_earmark.html"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have posted about this before (&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/07/i-told-you-so/"&gt;just last night&lt;/a&gt;, in fact). The comments on my statements have been all over the place, from support to some fairly ridiculous complaints. My favorites have involved something along the line of, &amp;quot;Where in the Constitution does it say the federal government has to send money to planetaria?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good question. But where does it say the government will repair roads, provide clean water, create public schools, fund the space program?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look: there are some things the government does for the greater good. This is where libertarians and I part company. &lt;strong&gt;Government isn’t always bad.&lt;/strong&gt; In many cases, it takes the money it gets in taxes and does fantastic things with it, like sending probes to Mercury and funding autism research. It makes the roads drivable, and makes sure companies don’t pollute our air (well, it &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to do that). You can complain all you want that earmarks get abused — and they certainly do — but they also get used to fund projects that are starved for cash, and that richly deserve to have life breathed into them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree with McCain here as well. He wants no earmarks at all. I think that’s ridiculous. It would be far better to have regulation of them, instead of the &lt;em&gt;laissez-faire&lt;/em&gt; attitude the government has now. Or, if not overt regulation, some sort of throttle on them, instead of them being free passes to bridges to nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, I want to reiterate what I said in my first post on this topic: I love planetaria. Love love love. &lt;em&gt;They educate kids&lt;/em&gt;. That is among the finest and most honorable goals anyone can have. People who work at planetaria across the country and the world do it because they love it. They don’t get rich doing it, they don’t get fame doing it, they hardly even get accolades doing it. But we owe so much to them! Kids learn in planetaria– and not just about the stars over their heads on a given night; planetaria are evolving into the digital age, bringing incredible programs to the public (&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2006/01/31/the-other-side-of-infinity/"&gt;I know what I’m talking about here&lt;/a&gt;). And it’s not even just astronomy. The projectors can give all kinds of lessons: biology, history, local lore… anything you can create digitally can be projected in a planetarium, and &lt;em&gt;kids can learn&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For McCain to use this as a political zinger is insulting, and for him to call it &lt;em&gt;foolishness&lt;/em&gt; is beyond the pale. The honorable thing for him to do now is to admit he was wrong, admit he mischaracterized both the planetarium and Obama’s stance, and then issue a public apology to planetarians and science-lovers across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next debate is in one week. I bet a lot more pro-science folks will be watching, too. Closely.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224174011391"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/bidlack_for_congress.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/74081812f2c0802f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Bidlack for Congress</title><published>2008-10-16T15:53:04Z</published><updated>2008-10-16T15:53:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/422754840/bidlack_for_congress.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/bidlack_for_congress.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;That guy &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/"&gt;Phil&lt;/a&gt; is complaining that none of the big sites like Daily Kos or Crooks &amp;amp; Liars are covering the political campaign of &lt;a title="Lt.

A detailed-enough response to the several long comments is worthy of its own entry, so here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I want to point out that I greatly appreciate when readers post contrary opinions on my blog. Agreement (while also appreciated) is boring and does not advance the discourse. If I am missing an important piece of information, or my logic is flawed, I love having it pointed out - that way I can make corrections. I want my arguments to be both valid and as complete as possible, so corrective feedback is very valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also greatly enjoy sparring with those who have used logic and evidence to come to a different conclusion from me. A constructive discourse can only be a learning experience all around. I find I understand a topic much better after having to defend my position to someone adverse to it and who is using every argument they can muster to take it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even those who are closed-minded and ideological can serve a purpose, if only as a spur to discuss real science, and as an example of how thinking can go wrong (creationists are the poster-child for this, but there are plenty of examples).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chiropractors who have posted here recently bring up many common points, and so readers are likely to encounter them elsewhere. “Cause and Effect” writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, many posts could be quoted to the “Anecdotal” nature of us Chiropractors. In MY OPINION, if you were a true scientist, you would commend these anecdotes and suggest further research, rather than write them off as here-say and folly. All good scientists produce their proof or lack-there-of from a single thought. Such was the case in the early 1900’s with the advent of medication to relieve ailments. It began as a thought, was promoted by those in business and has remained as such since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A certain red flag for medical quackery is the unqualified defense of anecdotal evidence. It is an appeal for a lower quality of evidence to trump a higher quality of evidence, and significantly downplays the serious limitations of uncontrolled observations. Cause and Effect defends it by attacking a straw man - that my position is that anecdotal evidence is all written off as “folly” and should not even be used as a basis for further research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written a thorough entry just on this topic over at Science-Based Medicine, called &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=33"&gt;The Proper Role of Anecdotes in Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.  Briefly, I acknowledge that anecdotal observations are properly used as a starting point for generating hypotheses that can later be tested by controlled experiments. However, they are too low-grade a type of evidence to be used as a basis for a scientific conclusion. Promoters of unscientific medicine are often profoundly confused about the difference between generating hypotheses, and forming conclusions upon which it is reasonable to base therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another consideration that must be added to anecdotal observations in generating hypotheses is plausibility. Not all ideas in science are equal. Prior probability is an important consideration in determining how scarce research resources should be allocated, and also in what experimental therapies to which it would be ethical to subject patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also notice the common ploy Cause and Effect uses of framing their position as just advocating for research - what can be more reasonable than that - and trying to say that I am not scientific because I am against more research. There are many problems with this position, however. First - I recognize the utility of anecdotes in deciding what is worthy of research (put in the proper context of plausibility), so it is a straw man. Second, there has been research on many of the basic premises of chiropractic and specific therapies. True-believers simply ignore negative evidence and endlessly call for more research - it’s nothing more than a ploy to keep the game going for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last sentence regarding medication is also very telling: “It began as a thought, was promoted by those in business and has remained as such since.” Cause and Effect is missing an important step in this process - testing the “thoughts” with well-controlled clinical trials to see if they are actually true. Most are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cause and Effect writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, If you were to witness for yourself a patient with any of these conditions change at the hands of a Chiropractor….For instance, let’s say a child who is instantly relieved of his or her seizure…A common anecdote of a Chiropractor…would you agree that research is warranted? Or would you write it off as coincidence? What if it happened time and time again as it does on a regular basis in Chiropractic offices? Would it be a series of co-incidences and anecdotes or would you then agree that research to the benefits of ADJUSTMENTS (not manipulations) are warranted?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that mean to be “instantly relieved” of a seizure?  This is an incoherent statement. Seizures are events. They last 1-3 minutes typically, which means they stop spontaneously. So anything you do during a seizure will be followed rapidly by the seizure stopping. Coincidence alone is enough to explain the occasional, even frequent, association between an intervention (like an adjustment) and the end of the seizure. Only statistical information would be able to tell if the seizure duration were actually decreased, since you can’t know how long the seizure would have lasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only exception to the fact that seizures stop on their own is status epilepticus (a continuous seizure) and it is gross malpractice to treat status epilepticus with anything other than accepted emergency protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the anecdotal observation of seizures stopping is very problematic. If there were any plausibility to such an observation, that might warrant a pilot study - gathering some statistical data - to see if more elaborate research were indicated. But there is no plausibility to a specific effect from a chiropractic adjustment to altering the course of an electrical event in the brain. There may be non-specific effects from generic sensory feedback (depending upon the type of seizure), but even that is highly questionable. In some patients stimulating part of the brain may prevent the spread of a focal seizure (a seizure that is occurring in just part of the brain, not the whole brain), but it does not stop the seizure instantly. It is also highly unlikely that an adjustment would provide the specific type of brain activation that would have this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that not everything that shakes is a seizure. One hallmark of a seizure is that it cannot be stopped by interacting with the patient, and this is often done to help distinguish a true seizure from a non-epileptic mimicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, there are no controlled studies supporting the use of chiropractic to treat epilepsy (reduce the frequency of seizures) or to treat seizures in progress. There are only case reports and aggregates of those case reports. Chiropractors have made no progress in research - they have not explored any plausible mechanism, and they have not established that there is a real effect. They are stuck in the starting box - presenting anecdotes. They claim that this justifies further research, but then never do that research. Rather, they use anecdotes to justify treatment, which is completely inappropriate, even unethical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if a pharmaceutical company tried to market a drug for seizures and offered as supporting evidence only uncontrolled anecdotes. Imagine further that they dismissed reported cases of liver failure occurring after taking their drug as coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we are given anecdotes about asthma:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I myself was a medical “failure.” As a teen, I was diagnosed with “Asthma” and was told there is no cure, but it can be controlled and treated with medication. That was a risk/benefit decision that I choose to take, although against my judgment. After multiple years of medication, I found a Chiropractor who adjusted my neck subluxations and my asthma went away; I threw away my medications and haven’t looked back since. The only change I made was to be adjusted. Even today, in our Chiropractic office, people with “asthma” find they no longer need their medications, breathe easier and enjoy life to the fullest potential they dream of. Doesn’t that warrant further investigation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact same criticisms apply - there is no plausible mechanism, and all we have are anecdotes. Also, asthma attacks, like seizures, are unpredictable events and are subject to a host of psychological and lifestyle factors. This means they are very susceptible to false-positive observations - it is easy to think there is an effect from an intervention when there isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of asthma, however, we actually do have some clinical trials. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15846609?ordinalpos=6&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A recent Cochrane systematic review&lt;/a&gt; (which I should note does not factor in the lack of plausibility) of manual therapy for asthma concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is insufficient evidence to support the use of manual therapies for patients with asthma.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15330012?ordinalpos=8&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;Another review &lt;/a&gt;in the Annals of Allergy Asthma and Immunology from 2004 concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is currently no evidence to support the use of chiropractic SMT as a primary treatment for asthma or allergy”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the single best designed study of chiropractic and asthma was published in 1998 in the NEJM -&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9761802?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_RVAbstractPlus"&gt;A comparison of active and simulated chiropractic manipulation as adjunctive treatment for childhood asthma.&lt;/a&gt; This study was well-designed and was a collaboration among chiropractors and MDs. The results were dead negative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In children with mild or moderate asthma, the addition of chiropractic spinal manipulation to usual medical care provided no benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, after the results were in chiropractors complained, and of course no study is perfect so there were nits to pick. But this study represents the best evidence to date - and don’t forget the recent systematic reviews that also show no evidence. If this were a mainstream medical intervention, it would be dead in the water. If proponents of the treatment did not want to give up, then the onus would be on them to design better and more definitive studies and show a real effect, or admit defeat and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiropractors did what non-science-based practitioners do - they complained but then never did the follow up studies. Instead they went backwards, doing pilot studies and case reports. The high quality evidence was against them, so they went back to low quality evidence where false-positives are common.  What they did not do was stop promoting adjustments for asthma - the one adjustment they did not make was adjusting their practice to the best scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead we get the endless cycle of anecdotes and cries for more research, all the while practice continues without change. Again - imagine a pharmaceutical company doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cause and Effect next writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is the treatment that is of concern to the Chiropractor, as we do not “treat.” For example, Hypertension…a typical medical scientific approach is to administer a medication to lower blood pressure….at least that is what my patients and friendly MDs tell me…but why? To lower the “number?” Why not then lower the BP when a person is exercising? The body has driven it up to accommodate the need of increased blood flow (due to exercise); but it is now “not normal” according to medical standards; it is above “normal.” Hypertension is the same…the body reacting to an increase in “exercise;” a situation that requires increased blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a juicy straw man - attacking a childish caricature of modern medicine rather than actual practice. This is not to say that there are no bad doctors out there, of course there are. But they do not represent the standard of care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, good clinical practice includes avoiding the temptation to simply treat numbers. I teach this to medical students all the time - what are you actually treating? Are you just trying to make yourself feel good by making the numbers better, or will this help the patient?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with blood pressure, we do treat the number. That is because high blood pressure is the “silent killer” - it usually causes no symptoms but it increases the risk of strokes and heart attacks. This increased risk correlates with the number - so yes, we treat the number as a preventive measure. This is real, effective, preventive medicine based upon rock solid scientific evidence and plausible and well-established mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the further silly straw man he includes: “Why not then lower the BP when a person is exercising?” This represents a gross misunderstanding of the standard of care. Hypertension is diagnosed on the basis of chronically increased blood pressure at rest. In fact, the diagnosis of hypertension needs to be confirmed by multiple measures. We even worry that the patient’s blood pressure might be artificially elevated because they are anxious about their doctor visit, so-called “white coat hypertension.” We do not want to treat blood pressure that is physiologically elevated due to normal sympathetic activity, from exercise or even anxiety, only primary hypertension - “primary” means it is not secondary to a normal physiological cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the rest of Cause and Effect’s comment has to do with a misunderstanding of risk/benefit analysis. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people DIE due to medication, liver damage is due to medication, kidney failure is due to medication…When proper medical protocols are followed and people DIE…when the wrong organ is removed, or the wrong knee is operated on…when does the risk/benefit need to be re-evaluated? The ratios are minimal, yes, but so to are the ratios of Chiropractic and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is, that risk/benefit ratios are constantly evaluated and re-evaluated in medicine.  And (this is an important bit) medical practice actually changes in response to such analysis. For example, felbatol was a new anti-seizure drug that came on the market about a decade ago. It was demonstrated to be safe and effective in large double-blind clinical trials. There was far more evidence for the safety and effectiveness of this drug than for chiropractic neck manipulation for any indication. Once on the market, however, there were reports of a number of cases of liver damage. &lt;a href="http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/felbamate.htm"&gt;The FDA says&lt;/a&gt;: “THE REPORTED RATE IN THE U.S. HAS   BEEN ABOUT 6 CASES OF LIVER FAILURE LEADING TO DEATH OR TRANSPLANT PER 75,000   PATIENT YEARS OF USE.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resulted in the immediate suspension of the drug while the data was reviewed. Then the FDA decided that a black-box warning was indicated, with liver monitoring in patients on felbatol. Prescriptions for felbatol plummeted, as the new risk/benefit assessment favored the use of other safer drugs for most patients. I have not seen a patient on this drug in the last 10 years, especially since there are now newer anti-seizure drugs with no reported liver or other organ toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were fewer cases of liver failure from this drug than reported cases of stroke following chiropractic neck manipulation, so why hasn’t the chiropractic community responded in a way similar to the medical community? Some chiropractors rail against the risks of mainstream medicine, ignoring the benefits, while they promote treatments without proven benefit and ignore their own risks.  They then have the nerve to accuse physicians of applying a double standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another chiropractor, carpdc, writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good neurologists pontificating is one example of the deity complex that has gotten medicine to be so mistrusted by the average consumer today. We are continuing to fund good studies in chiroipractic and I would welcome you to my practice with open arms so that we can come together and do what serves patients best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dismissal of legitimate criticism as “pontificating” from a “deity complex” is a classic ad hominem logical fallacy.  While referring vaguely to “good studies” carpdc only offers anecdotes to support his practices. He offers to have me visit his practice, so that I can add my own anecdotal observations to the mix - missing the point that my anecdotal observations are no better than anyone else’s. How about some controlled clinical data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, while offering to “come together” he then writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s leave medicine to what it can competently treat which is acute trauma and life threatening situations. Medicine must do better though. It is vastly inadequate in answering the rise of degenerative diseases and woefully inadequate in the maintenance of health. This is where chiropractic is FAR superior to allopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is dismissing all of medicine that does not deal with trauma or acute life-threatening situations, which is most of medicine and just about all of my practice as a neurologist.  Of course medicine can and should do better - this will always be the case. But he is implying that our approach to health maintenance is misguided or wrong, which is based upon nothing but propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then follows up with the outrageous claim that chiropractic is “FAR” superior to “allopathy.” Allopathy is not a meaningful term. It is a derogatory term invented by Hannheman, the inventor of the fairy tale known as homeopathy, to denigrate the practices of the time. Modern medicine does not have much relationship to what he dismissed as “allopathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I challenge carpdc to provide adequate evidence to show that chiropractic is superior to science-based medicine for anything, let alone far superior for all health maintenance and degenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these statements, I can only conclude that carpdc is insincere in his offer to “come together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Nwtk2007 joined the frey with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ratios in chiro are much, much better than in medicine when chiro is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bloggers here only admit to benefit for uncomplicated low back pain but evidence has been posted supporting chiro for neck pain and HA, but they refuse to even read it or consider it, thus they feel there is never a good reason to do cervical manipulation based upon their assessment of the “risk to benefit” ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, an unsubstantiated claim for chiropractic superiority, and an unwarranted ad hominem.  In fact, I and my colleagues at Science-Based Medicine, as well as many other science bloggers, make a specific effort to read and review published evidence. And again, I have nothing against manipulation as a treatment modality, I just want it to be science-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While  Nwtk2007 accuses us of refusing to look at evidence, he does not provide anything specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, TheTruth (I admit I always have a negative reaction to anyone attempting to grab the mantle of “Truth”) does offer a specific reference - &lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/news/20070316/chiropractic-cuts-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/news/20070316/chiropractic-cuts-blood-pressure.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small (50 subjects) pilot study - even the study authors label it as such in the title. A small pilot study of an implausible treatment is not convincing. This is not a double-standard - I would not be compelled by such evidence for any implausible treatment, and not even for a plausible treatment if that was all there was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual studies, or small numbers of pilot studies, are simply not compelling. Remember the &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=8"&gt;research of John Iaonnidis&lt;/a&gt; - he convincingly showed that most published medical studies are later refuted by better studies. Also, the risk of this increases with the implausibility of the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What science-based practitioners rely upon are studies that are well-designed and reproducible - the kind of studies that eventually evolve out of those pilot studies.  Chiropractic has not been able to produce such studies for any of the medical claims made for it. There have been enough studies to show a symptomatic benefit for uncomplicated lower back pain, but no better than other standard treatment modalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for asthma, seizures, blood pressure, headaches - no. Just mixed results from small studies, and chiropractors cherry pick the positive ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the quality of the arguments put forth by the chiropractors trying to defend their profession speak for themselves. But further, I am struck by the hypocrisy of whining about evidence-based criticisms of chiropractic in the same comments that make outrageous and unsupported attacks on mainstream medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

Let's pick them up again, because the economic downturn gives all sorts of businesses the opportunity to play the "Bear Market" card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We know something needs to be done [to cut emissions], but we've got to get the economy on its feet before we do something economically irrational," said Mike Morris, chief executive of American Electric Power Co. of Columbus, Ohio. Mr. Morris and other executives fear lawmakers will use revenue from pollution permits to pay down the federal deficit.

&lt;p&gt;"The likelihood that they would try to take these revenues for other purposes, particularly in an economic downturn, is great," says James Rogers, chief executive of North Carolina-based Duke Energy Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not feel so bad for these guys, because when the markets are up, they play "Bull Market."

If you are too busy or lazy to make your own case forward a link to this page to your friends. Or just copy and paste it into an email. Or paste it into your own website and claim it as your own. Improve upon it. Edit it, cut out the important bits. There is no vanity and acclaim wanted here. Steal this content and spread it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Advice on writing a good letter:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First and foremost writing anything is better than nothing. A single line saying you oppose the Communications Data bill, is infinitely better than not sending anything. The more people who email the stronger they will gauge public opinion to be against this. However if you have more time do the following... &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make it clear in no uncertain terms that they will lose your vote in the coming election if they support this bill in any shape and form. (Obviously don't mention that you didn't vote for them last time if &lt;span&gt;that's&lt;/span&gt; the case). This normally rattles them and gets you a reply about how nice they are really.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Request a response. Add something like "please respond clarifying your position on this." Lots of them pretend that if they are not asked directly then no response is needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't insult them, sound like a die hard fan that is going to turn to the other side over this. They don't care if some &lt;span&gt;hippy&lt;/span&gt;/yuppie still dislikes them, they only care about their voter base, so pretend to be a fawning fan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;State that you read about the plans for the Communications Data Bill and that you consider it an assault on your civil liberties and thus unacceptable. Then explain that as your representative you wish your MP to take every action available to prevent this plan coming to fruition. His job is to represent you after all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't assume they are for the bill and attack them personally, focus purely on the bill, your MP might agree with you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look at the example letters below, but don't use them verbatim, as that will &lt;span&gt;merely&lt;/span&gt; activate the mass mailing filters and get your email trashed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;MPs&lt;/span&gt; are often too old to really understand the &lt;span&gt;internet&lt;/span&gt;. Don't use jargon, and if you are good enough, try to explain why the &lt;span&gt;internet&lt;/span&gt; needs to stay as it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Example Short Letter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear WHOEVER&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've recently become aware of the Communications Data Bill announced on Thursday. A database recording enough of our actions to trace every member of our society to an extent &lt;span&gt;unprecedented&lt;/span&gt; in any democratic country. This is outrageous enough to warrant what is typically the hyperbole term 'Orwellian.' I fear that as most &lt;span&gt;MPs&lt;/span&gt; are too old to have grown up with the &lt;span&gt;internet&lt;/span&gt; they do not fully grasp the nature of their actions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As my representative in Parliament I wish for you to strongly oppose this plan in every way available to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please respond stating what your views of this plan are, and what actions you will take to oppose (or support) them. As, despite being a fan of yours, this is the final straw. Labours continued assaults on my civil liberties is enough for them to lose my vote in the coming election. &lt;span&gt;In fact&lt;/span&gt; it is seriously making me consider voting Tory in the next election, despite the widespread damage it would cause, just to ensure essential civil liberties are preserved. Voting Tory was idea unthinkable until recently, but I will no longer support you if you support this plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yours sincerely,&lt;br&gt;YOUR NAME&lt;/blockquote&gt;See I've used voting Tory as a threat. Make it clear that you would go to any length to avoid this happening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Example Long Letter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Mr MP,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday the Home Secretary announced plans for a huge central database to retain details of who contacted whom online, where and when.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This will constitute a database recording enough of our actions to trace every member of our society. To know who our friends are, what we buy online, what we believe in politically or religiously, what our sexual preferences are. The level of insight into our private lives this will give to the users of the database will be frighteningly wide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prospect of such an Orwellian tool being provided to the government raises a number of specific and important questions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) Lord &lt;span&gt;Carlile&lt;/span&gt;, the government's own independent scrutineer of counter-terror legislation, has warned that "the raw idea [of a central database] is dreadful. The devil will be in the detail." He has warned against the misuse of this database for "fishing expeditions" whereby the users of the database will mine the data, for anything of interest, no matter how minor. If this database is created, how will access to this database be controlled, and such patent misuse of this panoply of information be prevented?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2) Ms Smith has said that "nor are we going to give local authorities the power to trawl through such a database in the interest of investigating lower level criminality under the spurious cover of counter terrorist legislation." However, a similar promise was made in relation to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act - quote "...such legislation is required to combat terrorism and its use will be restricted to such terrorist related cases..." . As we all know, &lt;span&gt;RIPA&lt;/span&gt; is now routinely used by local authorities in respect of such weighty matters as school catchment areas, dog fouling and use of dustbins. What assurances can we possibly have that the same will not happen with this new tool?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3) How does the government intend to meaningfully mine the mind-bogglingly large amount of data that this scheme would amass every single day? It simply will not happen. This will create a very, very big haystack with a very small number of interesting activities and we don't even know if they are the needles the security services want. We will not therefore be able to identify new terrorist threats from this pile of data. What, then, is the point?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(4) Quite aside from the threat that this database poses to the innocent populace, I would also question its necessity. In her speech, Jacqui Smith noted that since 2004 communications data has been used "as important evidence in 95 per cent of serious crime cases and in almost all Security Service operations". Such a statistic raises the question of why more powers are needed. With Ms Smith herself stating that the current measures are actually good enough to provide a good rate of conviction, why do we need another expensive set of potentially intrusive and probably functionally useless monitoring tools?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(5) Finally, what assurances can we have that this vast store of data will not be mislaid in the same manner as the now embarrassingly large catalogue of data handling failures that have occurred under this government? The government seems unable to cope with the databases it has now, so how can it possibly hope to ensure the security of the contents of a database containing the details of every single phone call, &lt;span&gt;internet&lt;/span&gt; access and mobile text message sent by the 60 million citizens of this country?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As my representative in Parliament I therefore wish for you to strongly oppose this plan in every way available to you. As such I would request that you please respond stating what your views of this plan are, and what actions you will take to oppose them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite being a Labour supporter and a fan of yours, this is the final straw. Labour's continued assaults on our civil liberties are enough to lose them my vote in the coming election. I am now seriously considering voting Conservative in the next election, despite the widespread damage a Tory government would otherwise cause, just to ensure essential civil liberties are preserved. Voting Tory was a repellent idea until recently, but I will no longer support you if you support this plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yours sincerely,&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;The original version of this letter was written by 'Mr Chris' to his MP. As he is excellent. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Be sure to edit any letter you base on it to ensure you do not set of duplication filters and stop all this mail being read.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/33112888-5233514864370803760?l=www.skeptobot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Bill)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.skeptobot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.skeptobot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Skeptobot</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skeptobot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224166846499"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-4152578554759185947">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9b7c224b2be3efac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Canada" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Fair Vote Canada Election Results</title><published>2008-10-16T14:02:00Z</published><updated>2008-10-16T14:20:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/10/fair-vote-canada-election-results.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/4152578554759185947/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=4152578554759185947" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Here&amp;#39;s what the result would have been with a nation-wide proportional system from Fair Vote Canada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conservatives - 38% of the popular vote: 117 seats (not 143)&lt;br&gt;Liberals - 26% of the popular vote: 81 seats (not 76)&lt;br&gt;NDP - 18% of the popular vote: 57 seats (not 37)&lt;br&gt;Bloc - 10% of the popular vote: 28 seats (not 50)&lt;br&gt;Greens - 7% of the popular vote: 23 seats (not 0)I don&amp;#39;t favor such a system.

If you realise the scale of the attack on your freedoms today skip ahead to &lt;a href="http://www.skeptobot.com/2008/10/uk-citizens-spend-5-minutes-to-keep_16.html"&gt;step 2&lt;/a&gt; - how to complain to your MP from within your browser, in less than 5 minutes.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This text is released to the public domain (obviously) you are actively encouraged to steal it, edit it, improve it, forward it, rehost it and share it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today Home Secretary Jacqui Smith finally &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7671046.stm"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the  &lt;a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/UKgovernment/Parliament/DG_078075"&gt;Communications Data Bill&lt;/a&gt;  in order to make the largest Orwellian communication database ever seen in a free country. Terrifyingly this isn't hyperbole. This new plan will do the following (commentary in italics, sources in square brackets):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Government will record the &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;times&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;dates&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;locations&lt;/span&gt; of mobile phone calls, numbers called (previously they had to go get those details when required off the company concerned). &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7671046.stm"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt; This means they will triangulate your location everytime you use your phone to contact a cell tower.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Government will record &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;every&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;website&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;visit and every address you email&lt;/span&gt;.  (Previously they had to go get those details when required off the company concerned). &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7671046.stm"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The Gov having a record of every site you've ever visited is ridiculously open to abuse, exploitation and blackmail - if I need to explain to you why, then you've not used the internet for more than about an hour.  Also considering the amount of dataleaks we've had imagine if your viewing habits were made public. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will be kept for&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt; two years&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7671046.stm"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;To begin with remember.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7671046.stm"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As currently planned it &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;won't&lt;/span&gt; keep the content of your emails, texts or chats. &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7671046.stm"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;(Obviously, once the database exists that is mearly baby steps away, and if they know the html address of where you are visiting the content your upload is easily obtained.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Security and intelligence agencies, and other public bodies, will be allowed access personal data using a wide range of internet sites, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;including social and gaming networks&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/oct/16/internet-uksecurity"&gt;[2] &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;(Basically they want access to your facebook, that way they can know all your friends - so much so that a Whitehall security official source said  "&lt;/span&gt;People have many accounts and sign up as Mickey Mouse and no one knows who they are", a senior Whitehall security source said. He added: "We have to do something."&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt; Seems anonimity on the web shouldn't be allowed anymore.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remember there is also a seperate database (coming online this january)  to record 50,000,000 car number plates a day.  Cameras will pinpoint the precise time and location of all vehicles on the road. Initally senior officers promised the data would be kept for two years. But after a Freedom of Information Act request the Home Office has admitted the data is now being kept for five years. &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/sep/15/civilliberties.police"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;This is not the actions of a free country. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Right, if this bothers you (and it should) &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;go straight to step 2, and complain&lt;/span&gt;. It will take 5 mins of your time, and you don't have to leave your browser.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it doesn't bother you and you think it's just some loons on the internet getting their knickers in a twist read some quotes from people who aren't loons on the internet:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7671046.stm"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;"The government's Orwellian plans for a vast database of our private communications are deeply worrying."&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ministers claim the database will only be used in terrorist cases, but there is now a long list of cases, from the arrest of Walter Wolfgang for heckling at a Labour conference to the freezing of Icelandic assets, where anti-terrorism law has been used for purposes for which it was not intended." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our experience of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act suggests these powers will soon be used to spy on people's children, pets and bins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-weight:bold"&gt;"These proposals are incompatible with a free country and a free people."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Conservative Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7671046.stm"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; : &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"These proposals would mark a substantial shift in the powers of the state to obtain personal information on individuals," he said, adding: "The government must present convincing justification for such &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;an exponential increase in the powers of the state.&lt;/span&gt;" &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;The director of Privacy International, Simon Davies&lt;/span&gt; (on the car tracking database)&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/sep/15/civilliberties.police"&gt; [3]&lt;/a&gt;  :&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"extraordinary powers of surveillance"&lt;br&gt;"&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;This would never be allowed in any other democratic country&lt;/span&gt;,"&lt;br&gt;"This is possibly one of the most valuable reserves of data imaginable."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SOURCES:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7671046.stm"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; BBC News article - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7671046.stm&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/oct/16/internet-uksecurity"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; Guardian News article - http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/oct/16/internet-uksecurity&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/sep/15/civilliberties.police"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; Guardian News article - http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/sep/15/civilliberties.police&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/uk/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0pt" src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/2.0/uk/88x31.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span href="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text" rel="dc:type"&gt;UK citizens spend 5 minutes to keep your freedoms - step 1 making the case&lt;/span&gt; is licensed under a &lt;a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/uk/"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 UK: England &amp;amp; Wales License&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;First of all, his gripe about the $3 million &amp;quot;overhead projector&amp;quot; simply marks him as an idiot — and not just an ignorant idiot, but the kind of idiot who ignores readily available evidence. What he is dismissing is a &lt;a title="Make McCain see stars | Bad Astronomy | Discover Magazine" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/15/make-mccain-see-stars/"&gt;tool for &lt;i&gt;science education&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Take a look at what the &lt;a href="http://shop.adlerplanetarium.org/catalog/display.php?product_id=983"&gt;sky projector&lt;/a&gt; looks like — your teacher didn&amp;#39;t have one of those babies to flash her transparencies up in the classroom. And while you&amp;#39;re there, you can always donate to the Adler Planetarium. The other thing McCain leaves out of his complaint is that the projector was not funded, and they&amp;#39;re still hurting for a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The other trumped-up lie and pseudo-scandal that irritates me is the ACORN mess. ACORN is an organization that works to help the poor, which of course makes it about as anti-Republican as you can get. They &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; had some incidents of attempted fraud, but &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2008/10/facts_about_acorn_and_alleged.php"&gt;the fraud was against ACORN itself&lt;/a&gt;, with workers attempting to cheat to get paid for submitting falsified registrations. Furthermore, it was ACORN itself that caught these fake registrations and notified government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the ACORN nonsense is all about is a preemptive attempt by the Republican party to cast doubt on the election. I predict we&amp;#39;ll hear much more about this if Obama wins…while the Diebold bias will be ignored, and the unfair policy of using the most unreliable voting machines in the poorest districts will continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on past performances, I expected the NLCS to be more exciting than the debate. And there's this nifty &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=663"&gt;method for summarizing debates&lt;/a&gt;: for each participant P, rank the words that P uses more than 10 times according to the ratio of P's count to the opponent's count. And CNN publishes an &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/15/debate.transcript/index.html"&gt;instant debate transcript&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I felt that I should pay at least some attention to what was going on at Hofstra University. So my solution involved a couple of radios, a TV with picture-in-picture, and several sites that were live-blogging one or the other event. In the end, the &lt;a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20081016_Dominant_Phillies_claim_the_pennant.html"&gt;Phillies won the game&lt;/a&gt; 5-1, and will be going to the World Series. What about the debate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here's John McCain's word list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;McCain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obama&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;obama&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;55&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;some&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;34&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the abstract, "Obama business wants wealth" vs. "here economic McCain policies" seems like a plausible account of a debate between these two men. Alas, this misses (what most people took to be) the big stories of the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, it's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?uploaded=d&amp;amp;search_query=Obama+McCain+debate"&gt;all on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, including pre-digested thematic excerpts or collections, from the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao5V66m5FaA"&gt;size of Joe the Plumber's health-care fine&lt;/a&gt; to Senator McCain's "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VswkUaaAXuM"&gt;I'm not Bush&lt;/a&gt;" line,  the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGZOyxfiNoU"&gt;"health of the mother" exchange&lt;/a&gt;, the whole &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGzfYOp34d8"&gt;exasperation factor&lt;/a&gt;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I think my trivial word lists are not entirely without interest. In particular, I'm curious about something less down-to-earth than &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;plumber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: why did Barack Obama use the little words &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; more than three times as often as John McCain did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's some data: the sentences using &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; from the CNN transcript for &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/ObamaIf.txt"&gt;Obama&lt;/a&gt; and for &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/McCainIf.txt"&gt;McCain&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; sentences for &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/ObamaSome.txt"&gt;Obama&lt;/a&gt; and for &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/McCainSome.txt"&gt;McCain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s some more data — a comparison of counts across all three debates for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (at least according to the CNN transcripts):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;McCain&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Debate 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Debate 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;37&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Debate 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;44&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(some)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Obama&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;McCain&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Debate 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Debate 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Debate 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;34&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a set of observations like this, we could come to several different sorts of conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's a meaningless, random statistical fluctuation. After all, there are lots of words, and people vary randomly in how often they choose different words on different occasions, and the way I've gone about this analysis is likely to turn up some differences that arise purely by chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, maybe the difference (between individuals or across occasions) is real, but reflects  a stylistic difference in the way messages are framed (e.g. "If we want to do X, we need Y" versus "In order to do X, we need Y"), rather than a difference in the underlying distribution of messages. If the difference is a stylistic one, it might be a stable feature of the different individuals involved, or it might reflect a more temporary priming effect, whether lexical or semantic or rhetorical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps the observation reflects a genuine difference in the kinds of ideas that the two candidates are presenting, or at least the spin they want to put on these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I first discovered the antivaccination movement that is utterly convinced, despite all evidence to the contrary, that mercury from the thimerosal preservative that was in many vaccines until the end of 2001 or, more recently, vaccines themselves cause autism, I've been amazed at the panoply of dubious ideas proposed about how vaccines might bring this about. There is, of course, the claim of neurotoxicity from mercury, even though the symptoms of mercury toxicity do not come close to matching those of autism. Then, of course, there is the related claim that somehow there are disorders in glutathione metabolism and mercury are involved, or that there are some sort of genetic predisposition to mercury toxicity or defects in mercury excretion that somehow let the tiny amount of mercury in vaccines to cause autism.There's also the claim that somehow vaccines cause an immune reaction that does--well, something in the brain. Or, even more ridiculous from a scientific standpoint, there is the claim, promulgated by Mark and David Geier, that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/02/why_not_just_castrate_them_1.php"&gt;testosterone somehow binds to mercury in the brain&lt;/a&gt; and makes it inaccessible for chelation therapy to remove. The latest of these dubious scientific bits of handwaving designed to link vaccines somehow to autism is the claim that somehow mitochondrial disorders are related to autism in an attempt to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/the_hannah_poling_case_and_the_rebrandin.php"&gt;rebrand autism&lt;/a&gt;. Never mind that there is no good scientific evidence to support any of these "explanations" linking vaccines to autism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To match all this dubious science is a panoply of equally or even more dubious "treatments" for autism. As &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1428"&gt;Kevin Leitch&lt;/a&gt; points out, there are at least &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/kurtz2.pdf"&gt;150 scientifically unsupported treatments&lt;/a&gt; for autism out there costing loads and loads of money. These range from total woo such as homeopathy to chelation therapy, to intravenous vitamin C, to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=249"&gt;hyperbaric oxygen therapy&lt;/a&gt;, to intravenous glutathione, to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/02/why_not_just_castrate_them_1.php"&gt;Lupron&lt;/a&gt;, to even energy medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to make it at least 151, it would appear.

It's a good movie. You'd like it." I asked what it was about. "It has Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman plays his autistic brother."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Artistic?" I said. "Like he draws?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"No, autistic."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Oh." Later on, I asked my mom what "autistic" meant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her response was one enormous misconception, and one that I've since seen elsewhere since entering the skeptical blogosphere and becoming informed on ignorant, anti-vax autism nonsense. "Autism is when a person's brain doesn't work right, so they can't interact with the world like we do. They're trapped inside their own heads."&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is how I thought of autism for a long time after that. An autistic person is the victim of a malfunctioning brain, and there's a "whole" person inside there somewhere that could come out if only we could fix their brain. Somewhere in there, a personality is watching everything their body does, but is unable to interact properly because their brain, due to its malfunctioning, is not letting them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't pretend to be any kind of expert on autism. In fact, I do believe this is the first post I've written about the autism "debate," precisely because I'm so damn ignorant about it. While I may not know very well what autism &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;, however, it doesn't take a rocket scientist (or, in this case, a neurologist) to know what it is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What autism is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; is a homunculus living in a broken house.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't say with any level of certainty how widespread this misconception is, but that it exists is certain enough. I think it's fair to say that it's one of those thing's that's &lt;i&gt;not even wrong&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After all, where does one begin a dissection? The complete misunderstanding of how the brain functions? The tacit insult to autistics everywhere? The ignorance of modern neurology's understanding of autism?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I, useless philosophy major that I am, prefer to start with the unspoken assumption that provides the metaphysical basis for the myth: the assumption of dualism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broken-brain misconception relies upon the idea that the brain and the mind are separate entities, and that the latter somehow supervenes on the former. The &lt;i&gt;mind&lt;/i&gt; of the autistic person is what we are told is perfectly intact. It has full access to all of the perceptions of the body in which it is situated. Through these perceptions, this mind has developed at the same rate as a person without autism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;i&gt;brain&lt;/i&gt;, on the other hand, the actual physical object, doesn't work properly. This means that the mind inside of it has only limited access to outside interactions. It tries its best, but because the brain (presumably it is thought to act as some sort of conduit between the mind and the world) has a malfunction, it can only break through in limited ways, and the autistic person appears to have developmental problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a model of autism that requires one accept dualism if it is to make any sense at all. Moreover, it requires that one accept a homunculus argument, an almost-literal "little man" inside the brain, an idea that, while I'm sure has some currency with some philosopher somewhere, is considered &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonculus#Homunculus_argument_or_fallacy_in_the_philosophy_of_mind"&gt;fallacious&lt;/a&gt;. The broken-brain model of autism is thus rendered scientifically useless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Modern neurology neither requires or uses dualism. Looking at the model from a scientific, materialistic point of view, it is completely incomprehensible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has become increasingly clear over time as our understanding of the brain and consciousness has grown, that consciousness is an emergent property of perfectly physical neurological function. One of the many lines of evidence for this is that when the brain undergoes significant physical changes, &lt;a href="http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/ghost.html"&gt;the &lt;i&gt;person&lt;/i&gt; undergoes significant physical changes&lt;/a&gt;. The classic example of this is 19th century railroad worker &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage"&gt;Phineas Gage&lt;/a&gt;, who became a radically different person after traumatic brain injury on the job. He is far from the only piece of evidence, however.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gage's case and others serve to falsify, in any meaningful scientific sense, the mind/body dualism hypothesis. If the mind were separate from the brain, then damage to the brain would not necessarily cause damage to the mind, or to the personality. Moreover, it should not be the case that, reliably and repeatably, damage to part A of the brain always causes malfunction A in the mind. This, however, is very much the case due to the compartmentalization of brain function. Damage to Broca's Area, for example, always causes speech problems, collectively known as Broca's Aphasia. Because Broca's Area controls speech function, however, sufferers of Broca's Aphasia rarely suffer any lack of speech or language comprehension. They can still understand &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; just fine, and they can write the same as they wrote before. They merely have problems &lt;i&gt;speaking&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is exactly what one would expect if the brain alone is responsible for personality, consciousness, and the self. Large reams of evidence like this demonstrate that the mind is not separate from the brain and have made dualism an untenable scientific hypothesis. Any attempt to work a separate, dualistic mind back into it would perforce be in the form of an unfalsifiable hypothesis, which is completely scientifically useless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is exactly what we see with the trapped-mind autism myth. It is reminiscent of an argument by analogy put forth by some for the existence of the soul in light of modern scientific understanding: the soul exists inside the body as a person might exist inside a closed house from which they cannot exit. If the house is well-maintained, the person can open the windows and let in the breeze and make birdcalls and see the sunset and wave to his neighbors. If the house is ill-maintained, his ability to interact with anything outside of it is limited. Thus does the soul (or in our case, the mind) exist within a broken brain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is, to all external appearances, brain damage reliably causes mental damage and specified brain damage reliably causes specified mental damage, but that's only because breaking the right-side window will always restrict the view of the right-side neighbors. It &lt;i&gt;appears&lt;/i&gt; as if materialism is true, and all evidence will always point to materialism being true, but it's really not. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It sounds all right (really, it's not a wonderful analogy, but let's accept it for the sake of argument), but it presents a case where the soul becomes completely superfluous from a scientific standpoint. If all evidence will always point to the materialistic hypothesis, i.e. everything looks the same with or without the soul in the equation, then why posit the soul's existence in the first place? Moreover, in this situation, it is completely impossible to falsify the existence of the soul, because no matter what experiment you design to do so, the soul exists in such a way that it appears not to exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember when I said this was not even wrong?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Autism is not and cannot be a developed person trapped in a broken brain. That, put simply, is just not how the brain works. At all. A damaged brain is a damaged person. Period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People who hold to this myth, as I said earlier, implicitly insult autistics by doing so. They are making the claim that autistics are broken people that need to be fixed so they can be normal.This idea can be cast in sharp relief when we look at other mental conditions, like, for example, Down's Syndrome. Nobody is looking desperately for a "cure" for Down's. Nobody thinks that a Down's sufferer is a "whole" person trapped in a handicapped brain. They understand that people with Down's are mentally handicapped and that's who they are. You don't cure it, you work with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why can people think this way about people with Down's, but fail so often and so spectacularly to recognize the exact same thing about people with autism?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short, the trapped-mind conception of autism is a failure on multiple fronts. It requires one to assume a scientifically untenable proposition, it posits a rudimentary homunculus inhabiting the brain, and it is offensive to anyone who has autism. What only adds to the preposterousness of the idea is that most people who hold it probably have &lt;i&gt;no idea&lt;/i&gt; that it requires these prior intellectual commitments. It makes it easier for them to labor under such a gross, inaccurate simplification than to look, really &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; into the science behind it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may be harder to accept that your autistic son is who he is and you need to accept him for it than to hold out for a magical "cure" that will bring his inner homunculus out for all to see, but the former is true, and it's better, in the long run, for the child in question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/08/mccains-planetariophobia/"&gt;McCain is not up on his intertoobs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have said all I can about McCain’s ridiculous lies about this topic. I’m done being negative about this particular subject. Y’all will get a chance to be positive about it on November 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why wait? Turns out, the Adler planetarium in Chicago &lt;a href="http://shop.adlerplanetarium.org/catalog/display.php?product_id=983"&gt;has a page where you can donate to help them renovate the Zeiss&lt;/a&gt;. I suggest you do what you can; remember, despite what McCain has implied, Adler never got any money for this much needed upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of kids go through that theater, and they learn about the wonder of the sky, the fun of science, and the sheer joy of understanding. Some people don’t get that. &lt;/p&gt;

The study in question has been published in the &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v455/n7215/abs/nature07189.html" rel="external "&gt;Journal Nature&lt;/a&gt; (1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Neil Shubin’s team that found the &lt;a href="http://tiktaalik.uchicago.edu/" rel="external "&gt;Tiktaalik&lt;/a&gt;, as they had predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shubin said Tiktaalik was “still on the fish end of things, but it neatly fills a morphological gap and helps to resolve the relative timing of this complex transition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, fish have no neck but “we see a mobile neck developing for the first time in Tiktaalik,” Dr. Shubin said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carl Zimmer has an interesting article on The Loom &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2008/10/15/the-shoulder-bones-connected-to-the-ear-bone/" rel="external "&gt;The Shoulder Bone’s Connected to the Ear Bone…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Carl Zimmer Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In some respects, Tiktaalik’s skull was still fish-like. It had a hinge down the middle that allowed the front and back ends to bend. Later in the evolution of tetrapods, that hinge hardened, making the skull stiffer. But other parts of the skull had already evolved to be more like our own. For example, in our close aquatic relatives, there’s no neck to separate the head and shoulders. A boomerang-shaped bone called the hyomandibula was located there instead. Some muscles attaching to it controlled the opening and closing of the gill flaps, while it also buttressed the bones of the skull as they opened and closed when the fish fed. In Tiktaalik, the hyomandibula has become shorter and no longer makes contact with the gill flaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This change suggests that by the time Tiktaalik evolved, the ancestors of tetrapods had already begun to rely less on gills for breathing. Living in shallow coastal waters, Tiktaalik may have used its powerful front limbs to do push-ups in order to breathe air instead. And once the hyomandibula was liberated from the shoulders, it could evolve to specialize for new roles. As other fossils reveal, the hyomandibula would evolve in a small bone that came into contact with the skull, able to transmit vibrations from the air. In other words, it became the stapes. A diagram below shows some stages in this transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s particularly cool about the evolution of our ear is that it was assembled over hundreds of millions of years from other parts. Tiktaalik helps reveal how the stapes evolved some 370 million years ago, but there are other bones in the ear-the incus and malleus-that transmit vibrations in our heads. They only evolved 150 million years later from some bones in the back of the jaw. They too were liberated from old jobs, and free to take on new ones. The ear was not an overnight invention, but the product of an inconceivably long evolutionary tinkering.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, science is slowly unraveling the transitions from fish to tetrapod in exquisite detail. Don’t you wish ID had something similar to contribute to our scientific understanding? I agree, that may be wishful thinking. All Intelligent Design proponents seem to be able to contribute is quote mining research and claim that the Tiktaalik was a poor fossil, when in fact, the fossil shows extensive and important details of the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

Shubin, &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v455/n7215/abs/nature07189.html" rel="external "&gt;The cranial endoskeleton of Tiktaalik roseae&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 455, 925-929 (16 October 2008) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt; Among the morphological changes that occurred during the ‘fish-to-tetrapod’ transition was a marked reorganization of the cranial endoskeleton. Details of this transition, including the sequence of character acquisition, have not been evident from the fossil record. Here we describe the braincase, palatoquadrate and branchial skeleton of Tiktaalik roseae, the Late Devonian sarcopterygian fish most closely related to tetrapods. Although retaining a primitive configuration in many respects, the cranial endoskeleton of T. roseae shares derived features with tetrapods such as a large basal articulation and a flat, horizontally oriented entopterygoid. Other features in T. roseae, like the short, straight hyomandibula, show morphology intermediate between the condition observed in more primitive fish and that observed in tetrapods. The combination of characters in T. roseae helps to resolve the relative timing of modifications in the cranial endoskeleton. The sequence of modifications suggests changes in head mobility and intracranial kinesis that have ramifications for the origin of vertebrate terrestriality.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new view shows gills in transition too. They’ve lost the fishlike bone flap, the operculum, which enhances the flow of water over gill tissues. “Tiktaalik was already specializing in breathing air,” Shubin says. And that shift to air was playing an important role in gradually changing the old fish head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I like Bill; very much so. And I respect him as a person. I don't mean to pick on him. It's just that he is one of the world's leading apologists for the Christian faith and he writes something each week on his website, some of which is worthy of further consideration by me. I have challenged Christian apologists to do what I did in the opening chapter of my book, to tell us the initial conditions and reasons why they became Christians in the first place. Bill does so &lt;a href="http://www.reasonablefaith.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;amp;id=6651"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. Let me comment...&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm thankful for his openness and honesty with this. I've argued that people who first choose to believe do not initially have sufficient reasons to do so. I've argued that the initial choice to believe is like putting on "God Glasses," from which all other evidence is subsequently viewed and forced to fit, much like a person who has been brainwashed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was only later after having examined my faith more thoroughly that I realized these initial reasons were not good ones to believe. From reading his story I don't think Bill had good initial reasons to believe either. What do you think? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notice in his personal story his need for happiness, love, genuineness, significance and meaning. Notice also the fact that he read the Bible uncritically along with some Christian books. But think about this. How does someone properly investigate whether a claim is true or not? A person doesn't do it by only reading the literature of the people who advocate it. He does so by also reading the best critiques of the people who disagree with it, and Dr. Craig now knows this. By now he also knows there is a lot of hypocrisy and unhappiness among church people. He was personally "shocked" when a particular pastor friend of a church he attended was caught in adultery nearly 20 years ago, or so. As a Christian I was unhappy for periods of time, and also hypocritical. Surely this has been Bill’s experience as well. It's a human problem that Christianity does not solve. That's why people come to church weekly to get an emotional boost. They come because they are unhappy and hypocritical. Does this subsequent experience of his cause him to doubt the initial youthful rush of friends and the happiness he felt at the time? I suspect so, or it should. By now he also knows the need for significance and meaning isn't a good reason for believing a religious story, since there are many to choose from. He also knows that the Bible was pieced together from several different authors and sources. I'll bet he also can pick up those very same Christian books he first read and find several large holes in their arguments, since apologists disagree with themselves. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the question I have is whether Bill would've believed in the first place if he knows what he does now. Remember, back then he didn't have any “God Glasses” on, so he was merely investigating the Christian faith as "an outsider." The difference is that the “God Glasses” he now has on provide him with a presumption which causes him to view all of the evidence from that presumption. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I dare say that if he knew what he does now and hadn't already chosen to put on the “God Glasses” he would not have chosen to believe in the first place.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Why?  You have not been honest about the most important thing about you:  the fact that you are a born-again charismatic on a mission from God.   Most people who have never been entrenched in the subculture of fundamentalist Christianity may not understand what this really means, but I do.  Like you, I was raised in the Assemblies of God and I was a zealous part of the Jesus Movement.  Like you, my life was consumed with seeking God's will for my life and awaiting the imminent return of Jesus. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Former fundamentalists like me know that your worldview is so encompassing, authoritarian, and powerful that it defines who you think you are, the way you view the world, history, other people, the future, and your place in the world.  It defines you far more than hockey mom, wife, woman, hunter, governor, or VP candidate.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You believe that every bit of the Bible is God's perfect word.  You have a supernatural view of reality where Satan is a real entity.  You believe that alongside our material plane of existence, there is a more important spiritual plane where good and evil beings are engaged in "spiritual warfare" (Ephesians 6:12).   As a leader in the war against evil, you believe that God has "called" you and "anointed" you to do his will.  This is why you have accepted blessing for office through the "laying on of hands" and prayer to protect you from witchcraft.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what does this mean for governing?  What could Americans expect with you at the helm?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You cannot affirm basic human decency or capability, because according to your dogma, we are sinful, weak, and dependant on God. And so, your decisions would not be based on expert advice or even your own reasoning, but on your gut-level, intuitive interpretation of God's will.   This would allow you to do anything and claim you were led by God. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your thinking necessarily is black or white.  People and policies are either good or bad.  After all, Jesus said, "He who is not with me is against me" (Matt. 12:30).  Under your leadership, diplomacy and cultural nuance would be less important than not blinking.  In a spiritual war, you don't negotiate with the devil. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding social policy, as a believer in individual salvation, you would have an individual approach emphasizing morality and responsibility, not a community approach emphasizing structural solutions.  You would be judgmental and controlling of personal behavior like sex, reproductive choice, and books borrowed from the library instead of addressing global warming, poverty, and world peace.  Your belief in eternal hell-fire, your deference to a literally perfect Bible despite its cruelties, and your indoctrination to disbelieve your own compassionate instincts, may leave your moral core numb.  You might recall the verse, "If a man will not work he shall not eat" (2 Thess. 3:10).  However, faith-based initiatives would be okay because they would use caring to evangelize.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How about science?  As it has in your governorship, your interpretation of the Bible would trump scientific scholarship and findings.  You would deny the human role in global warming because God is in control.  More importantly, you would not make the environment a priority because you do not expect the earth to last.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;International affairs?  Since your subculture has identified the establishment of Israel in 1948 as the beginning of the end, you would see war, epidemics, climate change, natural disasters, and water shortage, all as hopeful signs of Jesus' return.  You would be a staunch supporter of Israel and deeply suspicious of countries like Russia identified with the antichrist in the end times literature.  (You have publicly said that you expect Jesus to return in your lifetime and that it guides you every day.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Christian fundamentalism that has shaped your thinking teaches that working for peace is unbiblical and wrong because peace is not humanly possible without the return of Jesus (1 Thess. 5:2,3).  Conflict, even outright war is inevitable, for Jesus came not to bring peace but a sword (Matt: 10:34-37).  Like millions of fundamentalist Christians, you may actually find joy in global crises because these things portend His return (Luke 21:28). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all of this certainty and fantasy in today's complex world is dangerous, Sarah.  There was a time when all of humanity thought the world was flat.  Today, the stakes for such massive error are much higher. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My message for you, Warrior Princess for God, is from all of us who know what you are about.  How dare you presume to take responsibility for our country and our planet when you, in your own mind, do not consider this home?   I mean home for the long haul, not just until your rescue arrives from space.  How dare you look forward to Christ's return, leaving your public office empty like a scene from the movie, Left Behind?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What if you are completely wrong and you wreak havoc instead with your policies?  If you deny global warming, brand people and countries "evil," support war, and neglect global issues, you can create the apocalypse you are expecting.  And as it gets worse and worse, with worldwide crisis all around you, and you look up for redemption, you just may not see it.  What then?  In that moment, you and all who have shared your delusion may have the most horrifying realization imaginable.   And it will be too late.  Too late to avoid destruction and too late to apologize to all the people who tried to turn the tide and needed you on board. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And you, John McCain, how dare you endanger all of us for the sake of your politics?  How dare you choose a partner who is all symbol and no substance, preying on the fears of millions of Americans.   Shame on both of you.   &lt;br&gt;Leave this beautiful, fragile earth to us, the unbelievers in your fantasy.  It's the only heaven we have and you have no right to make it a hell. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;Marlene Winell&lt;br&gt;October 15, 2008 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marlene Winell is a Bay Area psychologist who specializes in recovery from fundamentalist religion.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dianne, PAL:

&lt;p&gt;I'm out of my depth here, so could you address what the ethical boundaries are for describing a case (even without personal identification) on an open board?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've always dealt with that one by Just Don't -- and I know it's overly conservative. And I promise to not take you as too authoritative, but it's an interesting subject ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posted by: D. C. Sessions | October 15, 2008 9:09 PM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, it's an interesting issue. Generally, cases are fine to present as long as enough details are changed. Given that I've lived/practiced in a number of different cities/states, and that the only real identifying info is that the patient is a male in his 60s (which may or may not be true), and i've presented a picture that may or may not be the actual patient, the ethics seem to be in my favor.

&lt;p&gt;NEJM, for example, is a publicly available journal, and regularly presents cpc's without identifying info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curse/bless you for bringing this up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case presentations are not in and of themselves unethical. The ethical issues involve what is in the patient's best interest. If a patient is not identifiable, there should be no ethical issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except when there is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some would argue that a patient can be ethically harmed even if they are not identified, as the information about them belongs to them, and is theirs to hold or release. This, I think, is where the issue of mixing up case details comes in. If the details are not traceable to a particular patient, then there is no harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since I am talking about a path report, one could argue that there is an ethical problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a question as to what benefit a patient may or may not derive...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm...&lt;/p&gt;

This could be awful. I'm just hoping that McCain is feeling desperate and will do something that's bug-eyed crazy to change the status of the election. Go ahead, say what you think in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCain brought up the "overhead projector" again! He really is an anti-science loon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;After claiming that Obama was running a negative campaign, McCain than tried to defend the ugly attempt to tar Obama by association with Ayers. Hypocrite alert!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;My final opinion: McCain didn't blow up as I hoped, making it a somewhat boring debate. Instead, McCain spent the whole hour and a half being &lt;i&gt;creepy&lt;/i&gt; — I don&amp;#39;t want another president who makes me want to gag every time his face appears on TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McCain also seemed to lie incessantly. The claim that Obama has been negatively campaigning coming out of 100%-negative-McCain was a low point for him.

&lt;p&gt;I can't seem to get this whole "morgellons" thing out of my head (which gives me something in common with the sufferers).  Lots of the "literature" on morgellons focuses on the "fibers" which supposedly infest these people.  If you google it, you can get pictures galore of these fibers.  The advocacy websites are also full of stories of "fiber analysis" from law enforcement.  I'm not much for crime lab analyses when it comes to human pathology.  Show me the tissue! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If morgellons were a disease as such, it would cause pathologic changes in the tissue affected.  These should be visible on both a gross an microscopic level.  Let me show you what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just heard &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/JonStrickland/statuses/961250212"&gt;via Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that there is a report that an object, possibly a meteorite, has hit a car in north Las Vegas. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/BreakingNewsOn/statuses/961246485"&gt;All it said was&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; An unknown airborne object, rumored to be a small meteorite, has struck a car in North Las Vegas; no injuries reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s all I know&lt;/em&gt;. They don’t give any sources, any quotes, nothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll see what I can find here, and update this when I get something.&lt;/p&gt;

And when that music comes in the form of a bluegrass banjo virtuoso, it’s like awesome with cheese on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you may have seen &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/AheadoftheCurve/story?id=5941480&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; recently (video included). Jen posted a link in the Quickies a couple days ago, but I thought it was worth a full post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eddie Adcock, whose fast picking and unconventional style made him world famous as a bluegrass banjo innovator, suffered an essential tremor, which is an involuntary trembling in the head or hands that afflicts 10 million Americans. Doctors thought brain surgery could correct the hand tremors that were threatening Adcock’s music career, not to mention his well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after applying only local anesthesia and tuning Adcock’s strings for him, they went to work. That’s right, Adcock was &lt;em&gt;awake&lt;/em&gt; during the surgery! And not only was he awake, but he was playing the banjo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adcock picked his banjo while doctors fiddled with his gray matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea was to reduce the brain signals causing the tremors and to dial in to a point where his banjo playing abilities matched those he had before the essential tremor set in. They had to be careful not to stop short and leave traces of the trembling, or go too far to where he had no motor skills at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a procedure called “deep brain stimulation”, they place an electrode into Adcock’s thalamus and connected it to a type of pacemaker. When the pacemaker is activated, a bolt of energy jams the tremor, allowing Adcock to regain control of his hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you think of the banjo playing spectrum as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Ogden&lt;/strong&gt; –&amp;gt; First year student –&amp;gt; Avid practitioner –&amp;gt; Steve Martin –&amp;gt; Roy Clark –&amp;gt; The inbred kid from &lt;em&gt;Deliverance&lt;/em&gt; –&amp;gt; Earl Scruggs –&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Eddie Adcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had to listen to him play while they operated and take cues from him about how he felt to verify how much to jam the tremors. If his skill level dipped toward the &lt;strong&gt;Sam Ogden&lt;/strong&gt; end of the spectrum, they knew they had not jammed enough of the signal, and they made adjustments. They listened to him play and adjusted the settings until they zeroed in on the &lt;strong&gt;Eddie Adcock&lt;/strong&gt; end of the spectrum, and then set the energy-emitting device at that level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Adcock can control the tremors with a switch on his new “pacemaker”. He can literally turn his talent back on.&lt;/p&gt;

Remember, I had claimed he was an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemological_solipsism"&gt;Epistemological Solipsist&lt;/a&gt; and as such, similar arguments against both viewpoints apply. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/10/william-lane-craig-is-epistemological.html"&gt;I made my argument here&lt;/a&gt;. Let me further comment on what he just wrote...&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Craig wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;...most of our beliefs cannot be evidentially justified. Take, for example, the belief that the world was not created five minutes ago with built-in memory traces, food in our stomachs from meals we never really ate, and other appearances of age. Or the belief that the external world around us is real rather than a computer-generated virtual reality. Anyone who has seen a film like The Matrix realizes that the person living in such a virtual reality has no evidence that he is not in such an illusory world. But surely we're rational in believing that the world around us is real and has existed longer than five minutes, even though we have no evidence for this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I find these examples to be strange ones, very strange. So let’s see if I can put this into perspective. He's arguing that since it’s rational to believe we’re not in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; or that we have not been created five minutes ago, it’s also rational to believe in God without evidence. Is there truly no evidence against our beliefs that we were not created five minutes ago or that we're not living in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;? These examples are bandied about among philosophers as if they are self-evident, including the evil demon and dream conjectures of Rene Descartes. We are told there is no evidence for what we believe about such things &lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt; we are told by Reformed Epistemologists like Plantinga and Craig that these examples parallel their belief in the “great truths of the gospel.” Let’s look at these things in turn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, I think there is evidence to suggest we were not created five minutes ago, depending on what we mean by evidence. &lt;strong&gt;Evidence in its broadest conception includes anything and everything used to demonstrate the truth of a claim, which includes our arguments based on the things we’ve experienced&lt;/strong&gt;. What we believe will be based on the probability of the evidence, all of it, as broadly defined. As such, I think there is evidence against the existence of a creator God. The arguments for the existence of God are not persuasive. I do not think such a God could create the first moment in time if he is somehow “outside of time.” And I do not think a spiritual Supreme Being could create a material world. Even if a creator God exists I find no evidence that he would create us into such a massively deceptive world five minutes ago anyway. Therefore there is evidence against our having been created five minutes ago. Now, could it be possible that we were created five minutes ago? Maybe. But if so, this is an very very slim possibility given the evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The demon hypothesis of Rene Descartes, in which there might be a demon who is deceiving me right now, fails because of the same evidence just mentioned above with regard to God creating us five minutes ago. Descartes uses his extreme method of hypothetical doubt like a massive sword. The mere possibility that there is such a demon was enough to cast doubt on his knowledge about the external world. But why must we base what we believe or don’t believe on a mere possibility? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to the question of whether I’m dreaming right now a good case has been made by Norman Malcom [in his book &lt;em&gt;Dreaming and Skepticism&lt;/em&gt;], and Bernard Williams [in his book &lt;em&gt;Descartes&lt;/em&gt;], that there is a difference between dreams and our waking experience. The fact that we can distinguish between them presupposes we are aware of them both and of their differences. It’s only from the perspective of being awake that we can explain our dreams. Hence we can only make sense of this distinction if we are sometimes awake. And since this is the case, all of our experiences throughout our entire lives cannot be made up merely of a sequence of dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What about the world depicted in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; film? There are several responses to such a radical scenario which would upstage most every belief we have about our existence in this world. Such a scenario is a mere possibility, if it is possible at all, and a very unlikely one at that. I’d have to refresh myself on the story line but the story is just implausible. I see no reason why there would be any human resistance or knowledge of the Matrix at all by people living in the Matrix, since it determines all of their experiences…all of them. I also see no reason why a pill or a decision by Neo could make any difference at all while inside the Matrix. Apart from the story line itself I see no reason for the Matrix in the first place, and I see no reason why our bodies are better at fueling it than other sources. I’d have to watch the movie again to say more about it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As David Mitsuo Nixon argued, “The proper response to someone’s telling me that my belief could be false is, “So what?” It’s not possibility that matters, it’s probability, So until you give me a good reason to think that my belief is not just possibly true, but probably false, I’m not changing anything about what I believe or what I think I know.” [“The Matrix Possibility” in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix and Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;, ed. William Irwin (p. 30)]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So even if the Matrix is a possibility, it’s an extremely unlikely one. To overturn nearly everything we believe in order to believe it would be to go against the overwhelming evidence (as defined above) about that which we claim to know. In fact, it would be self-defeating to believe it, for if we did come to believe in the Matrix then how do we know that THAT world isn't just another kind of Matrix? That is, if the belief in the Matrix leads us to distrust most everything we experience, then what reason would Neo have for trusting the experiences he had while supposedly outside the Matrix in the so-called “real world?” When it comes to Neo knowing the real world in distinction from the Matrix he has been given no reason to think one world is real and the other is illusionary. The red pill could have been nothing more than a hallucinogenic drug, for instance. So Neo would have no basis for trusting those experiences supposedly outside the Matrix in the real world, and as such he would end up as an “epistemological solipsist,” not having any reason for trusting there is a world outside his mind, something I accuse William Lane Craig of being. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Here’s what Professor Craig additionally said…&lt;blockquote&gt;Plantinga does not to my knowledge clearly commit himself to the view that the witness of the Holy Spirit is an intrinsic defeater-defeater. Such a thesis is independent of the model as presented. But I have argued that the witness of the Spirit is, indeed, an intrinsic defeater of any defeaters brought against it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is in this sense that I argue Craig is an epistemological solipsist. He claims that no other evidence can convince him or any other believer that they are wrong…none...apart from this so-called inner witness of the Holy Spirit, which always serves as &lt;em&gt;an intrinsic defeater-defeater&lt;/em&gt; to this evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Craig also wrote…&lt;blockquote&gt;Many of the things we know are not based on evidence. So why must belief in God be so based? Belief in God and the great truths of the Gospel is not a blind exercise of faith, a groundless leap in the dark. Rather, as Plantinga emphasizes, Christian belief is part of the deliverances of reason, grounded in the inner witness of the Holy Spirit, which is an objective reality mediated to me from God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Notice the impossibly huge leap Craig makes here. From the fact that we cannot be absolutely certain &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(a) that we were not created five minutes ago, or &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(b) that we are not living in a Matrix,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Craig claims, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(c) we can know with some real assurance that the Christian God exists and that the gospel is true. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think a proper conclusion from what he’s argued can only lead him to conclude that since it’s possible that (a) and (b) obtains, it’s therefore possible that (c) obtains. But this is extremely problematic. As I’ve argued in my book, Christians repeatedly retreat to the position that what they believe is “possible,” or “not impossible,” rather than what is probable. When they do this they are admitting the evidence is not on their side. They’re trying to explain the evidence away. Just because all of these things are possible he cannot conclude that what he believes is probable. A possibility is not a probability. How he slips in a probability because of a possibility is beyond me. The inference does not follow. It's a huge non-sequitur.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just look at the analogous belief he thinks he has assurance about. In &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/10/do-you-want-to-debate-me-on-existence.html"&gt;my debate challenge&lt;/a&gt; I asked what a potenital Christian opponent would like to defend. Here is what Craig must be assured of, depending on how he answers each question:&lt;blockquote&gt;Would you like to defend the existence of the social Trinitarian God (versus an anti-social Trinitarian God) of the Bible (which had a long process of formation and of borrowing material from others) who never began to exist and will never cease to exist (even though everything we experience has a beginning and an end), who never learned any new truths, who does not think (for thinking demands weighing temporal alternatives), who is not free with respect to deciding his own nature, who revealed himself through a poor medium (history) in a poor era (ancient times), who condemns all of humanity for the sins of the first human pair, who commanded genocide, who allows intense suffering in this world (yet does not follow the same moral code he commands believers to follow), whose Son (the 2nd person of the trinity) became incarnate in Jesus (even though no one has ever made sense of a person who is 100% man and 100% divine) to be punished for our sins (even though there is no correlation between punishment and forgiveness) who subsequently bodily arose from the dead (even though the believer in miracles has an almost impossible double-burden of proof here) and now lives embodied forever in a “spiritual” human body to return in the future, who will return to earth in the parousia (even though the NT is clear that the end of all kingdoms and the establishment of God's kingdom was to be in their generation), who sent the 3rd person of the trinity to lead his followers into "all truth" (yet fails in every generation to do this), who will also judge us based upon what conclusions we reach about the existence of this God and what he has done (paralleling the ancient barbaric thought police), and who will reward believers by taking away their freedom and punish the dammed by letting them retain their freedom?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interesting hypothesis, if so. This is such a large claim. The larger the claim is, the harder it is to defend it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In my book I marshal a great amount of evidence against that which Craig believes. I think I have more than adequately debunked any claim he has to believe &lt;strong&gt;AND ALONG WITH IT&lt;/strong&gt; any degree of assurance that he has an inner witness of the Holy Spirit. What will he do with that evidence? Argue against it, of course. But what if he cannot argue against me on any issue that undermines a key belief of his? Will he continue to believe against it, despite the evidence? He claims he can and he will continue to believe. I think he should follow the evidence by rejecting his so-called inner witness of the Spirit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly Craig does say something about the evidence, when he writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;What is true is that evidence, as it is defined in these discussions, plays a secondary role compared to the role God Himself plays in warranting Christian belief. Should we, then, ignore strong evidence if it shows that our faith is probably false? Of course not! My work as a philosopher exemplifies the effort to confront objections to Christian belief squarely and to answer them. But most Christians in the world don't have that luxury. For them they may have to hold to their Christian belief even though they lack an answer to the alleged defeater. What I insist on is that, given the witness of the Holy Spirit within them, they are entirely rational in so doing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In essence what Dr. Craig is saying is that the inner witness of the Holy Spirit gives him all the evidence anyone needs to believe, even if he cannot show this evidence leads to God, and as I argued earlier, even if he cannot sufficiently defend the whole concept of the inner witness of the Holy Spirit (which I find extremely puzzling, but this follows from what he says, because this so-called inner witness trumps even his own attempts to argue sufficiently on its behalf). So, does Craig ignore the other evidence? No. But this other evidence is "secondary." He believes that the other secondary evidence confirms what he already knows to be true by the primary evidence of this so-called inner witness of the Holy Spirit. When it comes to this other evidence, believers do not need it to believe, period, even if this other evidence does not support the Christian witness of the Spirit. No Christian needs supporting evidence to believe, not him…not anyone. That’s his position and why I claim again he’s an epistemological solipsist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

But as it turns out, the story of "green behind the ears" has some unexpected intricacies, including a surprising parallel in German.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I'm not entirely sure "idiom blend" is the right term to describe what is happening here. In canonical idiom blends (as described by &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9046870"&gt;Cutting &amp;amp; Bock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001737.html"&gt;Mark Liberman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://literalminded.wordpress.com/2005/08/14/on-the-cutting-of-breaks/"&gt;Neal Whitman&lt;/a&gt;, and others), two elements from idiomatic phrases are combined in a "one from Column A - one from Column B" style. Thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;It's not &lt;strong&gt;rocket&lt;/strong&gt; science&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;It's not brain &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;surgery &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;= &lt;em&gt;It's not &lt;strong&gt;rocket surgery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;He's &lt;strong&gt;under&lt;/strong&gt; the gun &lt;/em&gt;+ &lt;em&gt;He's behind &lt;strong&gt;the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;eight ball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;em&gt;He's &lt;strong&gt;under the eight ball&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;That's another &lt;strong&gt;kettle&lt;/strong&gt; of fish + That's another can &lt;strong&gt;of worms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;That's another &lt;strong&gt;kettle of worms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of "green behind the ears," there's no obvious idiomatic phrase involving the word &lt;em&gt;green&lt;/em&gt; for "wet behind the ears" to combine with in this fashion. The closest I can think of is "green around the gills," but that relates to a different sense of &lt;em&gt;green&lt;/em&gt;: 'queasy-looking' rather than 'immature, inexperienced.' The queasy connotation of "green around the gills" does seem to be a contributing element to an early example I found for "green behind the ears," in  the 1911 book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GhRIAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA119"&gt;The Compleat Oxford Man&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by A. Hamilton Gibbs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these people have &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; needle what a remarkable change comes over them. Some tremble and look  green behind the ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the other examples of "green behind the ears" I've collected, up to and including Obama's usage,  &lt;em&gt;green&lt;/em&gt; appears to take the place of &lt;em&gt;wet&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;not dry&lt;/em&gt;) in the traditional "behind the ears" idiom without involving another competing phrase. Rather, it's simply providing a new metaphorical basis for the expression, moving away from the founding image of "a newly born animal, as a colt or a calf, on which the last spot to  become dry after birth is the little depression behind either ear" (as Charles Earle Funk explained the expression in his 1948 book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060513292?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=thevisualthes-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0060513292"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Hog On Ice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my Word Routes &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/1572/"&gt;column&lt;/a&gt;, I suggest that the replacement of &lt;em&gt;wet&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;green&lt;/em&gt; doesn't necessarily imply an accidental mix-up or a humorous play on words. Rather, it could be a serious historical transformation of the idiom, since the original image of wet-eared livestock might not be a familiar one to many in our urbanized world. In this regard it's similar to &lt;a href="http://blog.oup.com/2007/07/eggcorn/"&gt;eggcorn substitutions&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;free reign&lt;/em&gt;, since the equestrian idiom of &lt;em&gt;free rein&lt;/em&gt; has become less relevant as the automobile has replaced the horse as our favored mode of transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot thickened when an anonymous Visual Thesaurus commenter pointed out that German has the exact same idiomatic variations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(noch) nicht trocken hinter den Ohren &lt;/em&gt; = not (yet) dry behind the ears&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(noch) feucht hinter den Ohren&lt;/em&gt; = (still) wet behind the ears&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(noch) grün hinter den Ohren&lt;/em&gt; = (still) green behind  the ears&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrigued, I reached out to Chris Waigl, keeper of the &lt;a href="http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/"&gt;Eggcorn Database&lt;/a&gt; and illuminator of &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003022.html"&gt;cross-linguistic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=357"&gt;peculiarities&lt;/a&gt;. Chris left a richly detailed comment, which I reproduce in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parallel with German the first anonymous commenter pointed to calls for a bit of Google sociolinguistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in German there are three idioms available, in order of  frequency (web hits): &lt;em&gt;grün&lt;/em&gt; [green] / &lt;em&gt;nicht trocken&lt;/em&gt; [not dry] / &lt;em&gt;feucht &lt;/em&gt;[moist] or &lt;em&gt;nass &lt;/em&gt;[formerly spelled &lt;em&gt;naß&lt;/em&gt;, wet] &lt;em&gt;hinter den Ohren&lt;/em&gt;. German  has other expressions based on 'green = new[born], ie lacking  experience', in particular the extremely common &lt;em&gt;Grünschnabel&lt;/em&gt; [green  beak]. Grimms' &lt;em&gt;Wörterbuch&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/3lsmet"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/3lsmet&lt;/a&gt;) has a cite from 1726, and like other sources bases the metaphor on "the  green or yellow skin seen around the beaks of newly hatched birds". &lt;em&gt;Gelbschnabel&lt;/em&gt; [yellow beak] is now rare, but used to be available,  too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;em&gt;X hinter den Ohren&lt;/em&gt; set of idioms, it looks to me as if the  development in German was pretty much parallel to that in English,  except that the 'green' variant ended up as a perfectly unremarkable  option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Books is quite helpful looking for how far back the variants go,  presuming the datings are fine. Most old hits come from dictionaries or  collections of sayings and proverbs, interestingly often bi- and  multilingual ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;nicht trocken&lt;/em&gt; has the oldest Google Books hit in a beautiful  German-Dutch dictionary by Abrahamus van Moerbeek, Matthias Kramer,  Adam Abrahamszoon van Moerbeek, published in Leipzig by Johann  Friedrich Junius in 1768 (&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://tinyurl.com/4dabmp"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/4dabmp&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for &lt;em&gt;naß&lt;/em&gt;, we have a non-dictionary cite from a 1765 Samuel Butler  translation (Hudibras: Ein sathrisches Gedicht wider die Schwermer und  independenten zur Zeit Carls des ersten in neuen Gesängen &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://tinyurl.com/4vbpew"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/4vbpew&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; for &lt;em&gt;feucht&lt;/em&gt;, we only go back to the mid-19th century (a 1851 novel, &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://tinyurl.com/4byqrg"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/4byqrg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;grün&lt;/em&gt;, finally, is present in a 1861 collection of popular speech  (slang, if you will): &lt;em&gt;So spricht das Volk: Volksthümliche Redensarten  und Sprichwörter&lt;/em&gt;, by Franz Sandvoss (&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://tinyurl.com/4on89h"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/4on89h&lt;/a&gt;). The entry also mentions &lt;em&gt;Grünschnabel&lt;/em&gt;, and the pretty &lt;em&gt;ein grünnäsiger junge&lt;/em&gt; [a green-nosed boy].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, more careful research would certainly find antedatings of all of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I'm not sure if for German an idiom-blend is at at the  origin of the green-behind-the-ears idiom: on the one hand, it is  likely to be significantly later than the 'not dry/wet behind the ears'  version; on the other, it is just one out of a bigger set of idioms  combining greenness with various body parts to denote newbiedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's especially surprising about Chris's finds is their antiquity. The earliest English examples I've found so far for "(not yet) dry behind the ears" are from the 1870s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sir,  a man may go blind for one gal when he is not yet dry behind the ears,  and then, when his eyes are skinned, go in for one better.&amp;quot; [said by an American character, Colonel Morley, who &amp;quot;had the habit … of adorning his style of conversation with quaint Americanisms&amp;quot;]&lt;br&gt;
— Edward Bulwer-Lytton, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.archive.org/details/parisiansandpilg00lyttiala"&gt;The Parisians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (1873), p. 375&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  Newcomerstown "Eye," a new paper, has already got into a squabble with  an editor named Persinger, at Bloomington, Illinois. The Bloomington  man should wait until the Eye gets dry behind the Ears.&lt;br&gt;
—  &lt;em&gt;(New Philadelphia) Ohio Democrat&lt;/em&gt;, May 2, 1878, p. 4, col. 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And "wet behind the ears" (along with other variations like "damp" or "moist") doesn't show up in the databases for a few decades after that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is not much in the matter so far as the organ is concerned&lt;br&gt;
except it is so new that it is wet behind the ears yet and doesn't&lt;br&gt;
know Prosecuting Attorney Small was put at the court house because&lt;br&gt;
he is fair and square and knows what a law is when he reads it.&lt;br&gt;
—&lt;em&gt; Portsmouth (Ohio) Daily Times&lt;/em&gt;, Oct. 9, 1911, p. 2, col. 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For "green behind the ears," I've got the questionable 1911 cite from &lt;em&gt;The Compleat Oxford Man&lt;/em&gt; above, and then this more clear-cut example from 1924:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of one thing all can be sure: that so long as the law stands as it does  today Republican presidents will continue to appoint Republican  postmasters and Democratic presidents will appoint Democratic  postmasters. He is quite green behind the ears who either expects  otherwise or that either party is going to change the law and deprive  themselves of the opportunity afforded by it.&lt;br&gt;
— &lt;em&gt;Charleston&lt;/em&gt; (W. Va.) &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;, Sept. 9, 1924, p. 6, col. 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since all three of these versions of the idiom are preceded by German attestations, it looks increasingly like a case of loan-translation, with the German expressions brought over by immigrants to the United States in the nineteenth century. (It's notable that many of the early American cites that I've found come from midwestern states like Ohio with historically large German immigrant populations.) The record also suggests that the &lt;em&gt;green&lt;/em&gt; variation has been kicking around in both German and English for quite some time, though it's unclear whether the German &lt;em&gt;grün &lt;/em&gt;expression was directly responsible for the English equivalent, or whether it developed as a kind of independent invention. That independent invention may be continuing today, with speakers like Obama hitting on the phrase anew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Final thought: if "green behind the ears" isn't properly considered an &lt;em&gt;idiom blend&lt;/em&gt;, maybe we should call it an &lt;em&gt;idiom bend&lt;/em&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;

–&lt;em&gt;Daily (Columbus) Ohio Statesman&lt;/em&gt;, May 9, 1850, p. 3, col. 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great finds, though they still occur a century later than the earliest cites for the German equivalents.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update #2: As Doug Wilson points out in the comments, &lt;span&gt;Maximilian Schele de Vere noted the German-to-English transfer as early as 1872 in his book &lt;em&gt;Americanisms&lt;/em&gt; (see &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GyTGX7mbBVkC&amp;amp;pg=PA146"&gt;Google Book Search&lt;/a&gt; for pp. 146-7). Schele de Vere says the expression was first brought by German settlers to Pennsylvania and spread from there.]&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Who Is Your Creator Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
1. Evolution predicts that genetic complexity is gained gradually, but specific genetic material for creating advanced features appeared “long before” in organisms that supposedly evolved millions of years earlier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long before animals with limbs (tetrapods) came onto the scene about 365 million years ago, fish already possessed the genes associated with helping to grow hands and feet (autopods) report University of Chicago researchers … The capability of building limbs with fingers and toes existed for a long period of time, but it took a set of environmental triggers to make use of that capability… ‘It had the tools,’ he said, ‘but it needed the opportunity as well.’” 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/news/new_genetic_data_overturns_long_held_theory_of_limb_development" rel="external "&gt;Hox gene research and new data on how fish grew feet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The paper in question is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Davis, M.C., Dahn, R.D., Shubin, N.H. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17522683?dopt=Abstract" rel="external "&gt;An autopodial-like pattern of Hox expression in the fins of a basal actinopterygian fish&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. 2007. Vol. 447. Pages 473 - 476.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt; Comparative analyses of Hox gene expression and regulation in teleost fish and tetrapods support the long-entrenched notion that the distal region of tetrapod limbs, containing the wrist, ankle and digits, is an evolutionary novelty. Data from fossils support the notion that the unique features of tetrapod limbs were assembled over evolutionary time in the paired fins of fish. The challenge in linking developmental and palaeontological approaches has been that developmental data for fins and limbs compare only highly derived teleosts and tetrapods; what is lacking are data from extant taxa that retain greater portions of the fin skeletal morphology considered primitive to all bony fish. Here, we report on the expression and function of genes implicated in the origin of the autopod in a basal actinopterygian, Polyodon spathula. Polyodon exhibits a late-phase, inverted collinear expression of 5’ HoxD genes, a pattern of expression long considered a developmental hallmark of the autopod and shown in tetrapods to be controlled by a ‘digit enhancer’ region. These data show that aspects of the development of the autopod are primitive to tetrapods and that the origin of digits entailed the redeployment of ancient patterns of gene activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href="http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/2007/20070524-hoxgene.html" rel="external "&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; observes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding overturns a long-held, but much-debated, theory that limb acquisition was a novel evolutionary event, requiring the descendents of lobed-fin fish to dramatically alter their genes to adapt their bodies to their new environments of streams and swamps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the original hypothesis was that a ‘dramatic change’ was required for limbs to develop. Such a position would be a much larger problem for evolutionary theory than finding that the re-use of a duplicated hox gene for limb evolution explains the origin and evolution of the tetrapod limb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem was that science was using the zebra fish as a representative species which does not show a second stage of hox expression. However, the paddlefish does show such a second stage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tetrapods have a second phase of Hox gene expression that happens later in development. During this second phase, hands and feet develop. Although this second phase is not known in zebrafish, the scientists found that it is present in paddlefish, which reveals that a pattern of gene activity long thought to be unique to vertebrates with hands and feet is in fact much more primitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the evidence ties together fins and limbs using genetic data. However, the genetic data is not the only evidence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first molecular support for the theory that the genes to help make fingers and toes have been around for a long time–well before the 375-million-year-old Tiktaalik roseae, the newly found species discovered in 2004 by Shubin and colleagues. Tiktaalik provided a missing evolutionary link between fish and tetrapods and was among the first creatures that walked out of water onto land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This form of co-option is a common evolutionary strategy, and in fact countless other instances of co-option show how prevalent this form of evolutionary variation is. While some may see this as disproving evolutionary theory because it is an ‘abrupt’ rather than a ‘gradual’ change, they are missing the point that evolution modified pre-existing variation to modify the secondary stage of fin formation to limb formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, this in what other authors, who found similar two stage expressions in sharks, have proposed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicate that a second, distal phase of Hoxd gene expression is not uniquely associated with tetrapod digit development, but is more likely a plesiomorphic condition present the common ancestor of chondrichthyans and osteichthyans. We propose that a temporal extension, rather than de novo activation, of Hoxd expression in the distal part of the fin may have led to the evolution of digits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he hold to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a graceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of the faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods on facts which they themselves have learned from experience and the light of reason? Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That tumor turned out to be hemangiosarcoma and was already widely metastatic. It's hard to believe it's been that long, but amazingly it has. My wife and I still miss her--a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss those greetings, particularly when Echo used to talk to me in that bizarre bark/howl that reminded me of a combination of Scooby-Doo and Chewbacca. It was almost as though she was scolding me for being away. Maybe she was, but she was always happy and excited to see me or my wife. She always forgave us for leaving her alone.

&lt;p&gt;It’s true that gossip can be hurtful, petty, and even demeaning.  But, according to &lt;a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-science-of-gossip"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article in Scientific American MIND, it is also a useful part of our evolutionary history, bonding us to confidants and aiding us in social success and survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article points out that our ancestors lived in small communities, without the travel and technology resources that we now have.  They had to learn to survive (economically, socially, etc.) with the same small group of people for their entire lives.  Social intelligence was likely key to success under such circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And evidence suggests that gossip is valuable in modern times as well.  A study by Roy F. Baumeister of FSU shows that gossip is helpful in regard to learning unwritten social rules and develping group norms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about society’s fascination with pop culture?  It’s cool to say you’re “above” following the latest gossip on Britney Spears, Brad Pitt, and Angelina Jolie.  But historically, people that we &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; often and &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; a lot about are socially important to us.  Is it possible that the desire to follow celebrity gossip is merely a collision of the advent of fame with our evolutionary instincts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; When gossip is discussed seriously, the goal usually is to suppress the frequency with which it occurs in an attempt to avoid the undeniably harmful effects it often has in work groups and other social networks.  This tendency, however, overlooks that gossip is part of who we are and an essential part of what makes groups function as well as they do.  … Successful gossiping is about being a good team player and sharing key information with others in a way that will not be perceived as self-serving, and about understanding when to keep your mouth shut.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;Government owning a stake in any private U.S. company is objectionable to most Americans — &lt;b&gt;me included&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The quote can be found several places, such as near the end of &lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/10/14/the-evolution-of-henry-paulson/"&gt;this WSJ blog post&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As indicated by the boldface print that I added above — and by the title of this post — what struck me was the &amp;quot;me included&amp;quot; bit; specifically, the form of the pronoun &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;myself&lt;/i&gt;. My personal sense is that "me included" is at best highly marked compared to "myself included", and for me this contrasts with "including me" (completely normal) vs. "including myself" (marked by comparison, but not as bad-sounding as "me included"). In other words, I have a hierarchy of acceptability for these forms that is more or less Y-shaped, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/include.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/include.png" width="148" height="137"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google appears to agree with me about the unexceptionalness of "including me" (just under 6M ghits) and the relative badness of "me included" (just over 800K ghits), but puts the two "myself" examples firmly in the middle (just over 2.6M ghits for "myself included", and just over 2.3M ghits for "including myself"). The resulting hierarchy looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/include-google.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/include-google.png" width="158" height="153"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the vertical spacing difference that I&amp;#39;ve given to the &amp;quot;myself&amp;quot; examples in the middle. I don&amp;#39;t think the ghit difference between them (roughly 300K) is significant enough to firmly rank them, but I think it&amp;#39;s worth representing that difference somehow — especially given that it tends in the direction of agreeing with my personal judgment. And come to think of it, I do think there&amp;#39;s a certain stylistic difference between &amp;quot;including me&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;myself included&amp;quot; that I might represent thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/include-revised.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/include-revised.png" width="148" height="154"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, now we're just playing around with figures. (Yay, &lt;a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/"&gt;OmniGraffle&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it&amp;#39;s worth noting that the #1 hit for &amp;quot;me included&amp;quot; and the #1 hit for &amp;quot;including myself&amp;quot; — that is, the two options with fewer total ghits — are both for discussions about just this grammatical point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;#1 hit for "me included"&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;a href="http://forum.wordreference.com/showthread.php?t=148506"&gt;including me/ me included — WordReference Forums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;#1 hit for "including myself"&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.englishforums.com/English/IncludingIncludingMyself/dlhgq/post.htm"&gt;Including me vs. Including myself — English Forums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparison, none of the top 10 hits for &amp;quot;including me&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;myself included&amp;quot; — that is, the two options with more total ghits — appear to involve any grammatical discussion. (The #1 hit for &amp;quot;me included&amp;quot; eventually shows up in the top 30 for &amp;quot;including me&amp;quot;; scrolling through several pages of the &amp;quot;myself included&amp;quot; results doesn&amp;#39;t seem to reveal much at all.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So back to Sec. Paulson: why did he use the clearly-least-preferred of the four available options? I honestly don't know. But I do wonder what would happen if we sorted the results of all four Google searches by the grammatical function of the noun phrase that this phrase is tacked on to (something I am woefully unequipped to do myself). Specifically, I'm willing to bet that "me included" is most often used when the previous noun phrase is an &lt;b&gt;object&lt;/b&gt; of some kind (like Paulson's &lt;i&gt;most Americans&lt;/i&gt;, which is the object of the preposition &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt;), as opposed to a subject. Compare Paulson's quote with this reworded example and I think you'll see what I'm getting at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;Most Americans — &lt;b&gt;me included&lt;/b&gt; — object to government owning a stake in any private U.S. company.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sentence, the &lt;i&gt;most Americans&lt;/i&gt; noun phrase is functioning as the subject, and I think "me included" sounds even worse here. (Note that this is not only because the form of the pronoun "me" is the prototypical object form; I still think "including me" sounds perfect in this reworded sentence.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is just a little something frivolous for our readers to chew on — perhaps along with your fingernails, as you watch the stock market go up and down this week.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Eric Baković</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224097370677"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=726">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/898503b4d28a1054</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Temporary permanence</title><published>2008-10-15T19:00:51Z</published><updated>2008-10-15T19:00:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=726" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another one from the news yesterday: at 6pm every weekday, &lt;a href="http://www.kpbs.org/"&gt;my local public radio station&lt;/a&gt; broadcasts one of the three daily editions of the BBC's &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/programmes/world_today.shtml"&gt;The World Today&lt;/a&gt;. In one of the interviews (at around 20 mins. after the hour, if anyone finds the audio), an American whose name I unfortunately didn't catch was comparing the U.S. bank bailout plan with the corresponding plan in the U.K., and he was attempting to argue that the U.S. plan was somehow "less socialist" than the U.K. plan because (for various reasons I'm ill-equipped to understand or critique) the U.S. plan is deliberately temporary in a way that the U.K. plan is supposedly not. Anyway, he summed up his argument like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;This is a temporary situation and we'd like to keep it that way.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Kate Alexander | Wednesday, October 15, 2008, 11:31 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the State Board of Education’s appointments to a new panel appointed to review the state’s science curriculum standards has drawn quick fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two authors of a textbook called Explore Evolution have been named to the six-member panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The textbook is distributed by the Discovery Institute, which promotes intelligent design. The book is described as presenting “the scientific evidence both for and against key aspects of Darwinian evolution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a snippet about textbook from its Web site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of Explore Evolution, is to examine the scientific controversy about Darwin’s theory, and in particular, the contemporary version of the theory known as neo-Darwinism. Whether you are a teacher, a student, or a parent, this book will help you understand what Darwin’s theory of evolution is, why many scientists find it persuasive, and why other scientists question the theory or some key aspects of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Texas Freedom Network criticized the appointment of the textbook authors, Stephen Meyer, vice president of the Discovery Institute, and Ralph Seelke, a biology and earth sciences professor from the University of Wisconsin-Superior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Texas universities boast some of the leading scientists in the world,” said Kathy Miller, executive director of the Texas Freedom Network. “It’s appalling that some state board members turned to out-of-state ideologues to decide whether Texas kids get a 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century science education.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Texas, you've got trouble. The people are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Hillis, professor of integrative biology and director of the Center of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at the University of Texas at Austin;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ronald K. Wetherington, professor of anthropology at Southern Methodist University and director of the Center for Teaching Excellence;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerald Skoog, professor and dean emeritus of the College of Education at Texas Tech and co-director of the Center for Integration of Science Education and Research;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.antievolution.org/people/meyer_sc/meyer2004_bio_info/"&gt;Stephen Meyer&lt;/a&gt;, vice-frakkin'-president of the odious Discovery Institute in Washington state;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://jgrr.blogspot.com/2005/04/pandas-thumb-weighs-in-especially-on.html"&gt;Ralph Seelke&lt;/a&gt;, a pro-ID creationist and biologist from Wisconsin;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Charles Garner, a chemist from Baylor who is also a pro-ID creationist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Meyer and Seelke are co-authors of that ghastly new ID textbook, &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/other/discovery-textbook-review.ars"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Explore Evolution&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and would no doubt love to tweak the curriculum to make their book marketable in Texas. Conflict of interest? Nah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, three good guys and three ignorant ideologues, with the overall head of the board of education being Don McLeroy, the creationist dentist. It's going to get ugly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/prepare_for_an_ugly_battle_in.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/421698220" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224084681143"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/congratulations_to_randy_moore.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/49421f9b79873811</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Congratulations to Randy Moore</title><published>2008-10-15T16:05:34Z</published><updated>2008-10-15T16:05:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/421674738/congratulations_to_randy_moore.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/congratulations_to_randy_moore.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My colleague at the Twin Cities branch campus of the University of Minnesota, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2008/10/prestigious_evolution_award_aw.php"&gt;Randy Moore, has won an award from the Discovery Institute&lt;/a&gt;:  The Award for Most Dogmatic Indoctrinator in an Evolutionary Biology Course. Congratulations to Randy! He won it for this paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence supporting evolution is overwhelming and comes from diverse disciplines, such as molecular biology, paleontology, comparative anatomy, ethology, and biochemistry. There is no controversy among biologists about whether evolution occurs, nor are there science-based alternative theories. Evolution is a unifying theme in biology; teaching it as such is the best way to show students what biology is about and how they can use evolution as a tool to understand our world. [Evolution] is as important an idea as there is in science - it is a great gift to give to students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Discovery Institute claims there are at least four mistakes in that paragraph. Their summary of the "errors" is &lt;i&gt;hilarious&lt;/i&gt;, and shows how delusional those guys are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The evidence isn't overwhelming, because their books, &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/wells/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Icons of Evolution&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/other/discovery-textbook-review.ars"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Explore Evolution&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, say so.&lt;/b&gt; Those two books are propaganda pieces put out by the Discovery Institute itself, and they are &lt;i&gt;awful&lt;/i&gt;: poor scholarship, sloppy reasoning, and and an abysmal ignorance of the science characterize both. If you want some good popular books on the subject, try &lt;i&gt;The Making of the Fittest&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9px"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393330516/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;amzn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;amp;bfpid=0393330516&amp;amp;bfmtype=book" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;amp;noble"&gt;b&amp;amp;n&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=0393330516&amp;amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" title="buy this book at abebooks"&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;amp;cgi=product&amp;amp;isbn=0393330516" title="buy this book at Powells"&gt;pwll&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Your Inner Fish&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9px"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375424474/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;amzn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;amp;bfpid=0375424474&amp;amp;bfmtype=book" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;amp;noble"&gt;b&amp;amp;n&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=0375424474&amp;amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" title="buy this book at abebooks"&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;amp;cgi=product&amp;amp;isbn=0375424474" title="buy this book at Powells"&gt;pwll&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Why Evolution is True&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9px"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670020532/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;amzn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;amp;bfpid=0670020532&amp;amp;bfmtype=book" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;amp;noble"&gt;b&amp;amp;n&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=0670020532&amp;amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" title="buy this book at abebooks"&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;amp;cgi=product&amp;amp;isbn=0670020532" title="buy this book at Powells"&gt;pwll&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Ancestor's Tale&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9px"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/061861916X/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;amzn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;amp;bfpid=061861916X&amp;amp;bfmtype=book" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;amp;noble"&gt;b&amp;amp;n&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=061861916X&amp;amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" title="buy this book at abebooks"&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;amp;cgi=product&amp;amp;isbn=061861916X" title="buy this book at Powells"&gt;pwll&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, all much better and more informative, and actually representing the evidence accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There is too controversy because they have a list of &lt;s&gt;crackpots&lt;/s&gt; dissenters from evolution.&lt;/b&gt; Any field will have kooks and crackpots on the fringe; compiling a short list of loons is a relatively trivial and entirely meaningless exercise. Even at that, the DI's list is &lt;a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/7306_pr87_11292001__doubting_dar_11_29_2001.asp"&gt;very short on people who are actually biologists&lt;/a&gt;…and the whole petition is misleadingly worded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evolution is a theory in trouble because some scientists discussed alternative modes of evolution at the Altenberg conference this summer.&lt;/b&gt; Science is not fixed, but adapts to the evidence, so it is perfectly normal to have conferences that discuss new ideas. &lt;a href="http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2008/07/is-there-fundamental-scientific.html"&gt;The Altenberg meeting did not challenge the fact of evolution or try to displace known evolutionary mechanisms&lt;/a&gt;; it discussed some &lt;a href="http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2008/07/altenberg-2008-what-happened.html"&gt;new findings that might &lt;i&gt;add&lt;/i&gt; to the theory&lt;/a&gt;. It's absurd that people are still going on and on about how a small meeting of scientists working on extending some parts evolutionary theory is a strike &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; evolution. To the contrary, it's what we expect of good science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are too science-based alternative theories: Intelligent Design, endosymbiosis, and self-organization.&lt;/b&gt; Margulis&amp;#39;s endosymbiotic theory was a natural explanation for eukaryote evolution — it is not an alternative, but a part of evolutionary theory. Similarly, self-organization (as, for example, described by Kauffman) does not oppose evolution at all, but suggests that physical and chemical properties of the universe could facilitate evolution. Like I said above, these are part of the normal process of science, that people propose new explanations and try to back them up with evidence, and they become incorporated into our body of knowledge. Intelligent Design creationism does not qualify. IDists don&amp;#39;t do science, don&amp;#39;t propose testable theories, and don&amp;#39;t have any evidence to back up their claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I hope Randy Moore doesn&amp;#39;t get too cocky here — the award was given by a gang of incompetent judges who don&amp;#39;t know what they are talking about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/congratulations_to_randy_moore.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/421674738" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224084518269"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-financial-crisis-a-guest-post-by-diamond-and-kashyap/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7afae16175f7ef58</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="anil kashyap"/><category term="bank"/><category term="bankruptcy"/><category term="credit"/><category term="debt"/><category term="doug diamond"/><category term="economy"/><category term="finance"/><category term="guest posts"/><title type="html">Everything You Need to Know About the Financial Crisis: A Guest Post by Diamond and Kashyap</title><published>2008-10-15T15:13:31Z</published><updated>2008-10-15T15:13:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/oAms9jGpSwY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-financial-crisis-a-guest-post-by-diamond-and-kashyap/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">When the financial crisis was just beginning to appear, I did one of the smartest things I've ever done: I asked my colleagues Doug Diamond and Anil Kashyap to explain to me what was happening.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/10/foreverwar1.jpg" alt="The Forever War cover"&gt;When I was in high school, I read a book called &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060510862/104-3562944-3784755"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Forever War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Joe Haldeman. It was already a classic then, and it’s more so now — the story of a soldier in a war with aliens; the weirdness of interstellar flight means the war takes thousands of years, but only a few years elapse to him. He is basically watching the future unfold, and he’s not thrilled with it. The book is fantastic, a beautiful satire that many people compare to &lt;em&gt;Catch-22&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is crying out to be made into a movie. I never understood why it hasn’t been, so when I was talking with My Close Personal Friend™ Joe Haldeman at World Con a couple of years ago, I asked him. He got a pained look on his face, and I knew right away I had stepped in it. Evidently, the rights to the book have been in some sort of battle for years. I quickly dropped the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was with much joy today that I saw that not only is &lt;em&gt;The Forever War&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/10/13/ridley-scott-to-adap.html"&gt;finally going to be made into a movie&lt;/a&gt;, it’s going to be done by &lt;strong&gt;Ridley Scott&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000631/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Ridley Scott. &amp;quot;Alien&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Blade Runner&amp;quot; Ridley Scott.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ska. Whee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I emailed Joe right away to get info and congratulate him. I love that guy; within minutes I got a reply confirming the report, saying he was &amp;quot;tickled&amp;quot; about it. Cripes, tickled? I’d be plotzing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m really excited about this, even though I know it’ll be a few years before we see the final movie. The story is incredible, and I think special effects have caught up with the ideas in the book, too. This’ll be a barn burner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to Joe, and congrats to us — science fiction fans everywhere. This is very cool news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, hmmm. I gave my copy away or sold it years and years ago (probably in the Great Paperback Purge when I got a job after grad school). Time to pick up a copy… and one of &lt;em&gt;Catch-22&lt;/em&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224082283724"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/the-mailman-index-of-economic-indicators/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cf209688fd182da0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="mail"/><title type="html">The Mailman Index of Economic Indicators</title><published>2008-10-15T13:45:01Z</published><updated>2008-10-15T13:45:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/NXvcYBeX6wM/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/the-mailman-index-of-economic-indicators/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">How much does your mailman know about your financial health?

They don’t need to be able to produce a media-friendly soundbite in order to do their job. However, some are better at it than others as a result of necessity. If you want media coverage for your project, you need to learn how to make it interesting or palatable for a layman audience. There is specialist training available for precisely this which really helps, but sometimes you can see where the “ground it in something the audience will relate to on an everyday level” or “compare it with something recogniseable” coaching begins…and unfortunately where sense sometimes ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I give you this gem from Dr Fausto Ferraccioli from the British Antarctic Survey, who is talking about the just-launched and jolly interesting expedition to map and explore the vast mountain range buried under 4km of Antartic ice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I subject myself to wave after wave of neuron-&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"&gt;apoptosing&lt;/a&gt; stupidity of a magnitude that even activation of &lt;a href="http://people.bu.edu/gilmore/nf-kb/"&gt;NF-kappaB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akt"&gt;Akt&lt;/a&gt;, and neuronal cell survival signaling pathways can barely keep the killing stupidity at bay? I guess it's because it provides such good blog fodder for a skeptical blog dedicated to science- and evidence-based medicine. On the other hand, it often gives me a headache to read its contents. Really, it does. I mean, looking at how Mike Adams, the Woo-meister Supreme and Chief Tin Foil Hat responsible for the lunacy there, regularly serves up fare that alternates between the simply over-the-top &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/07/how_can_so_much_stupidity_about_medicine.php"&gt;hilarious&lt;/a&gt; (unintentionally, of course) and the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/the_ghouls_descend_upon_the_corpse.php"&gt;truly vile&lt;/a&gt; (although leaning more towards &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/a_ghoul_descends_upon_christina_applegat.php"&gt;the vile&lt;/a&gt;) that the alternating current of fun woo and dumb woo seriously stresses the electrical impulses flowing through my brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I could use some acupuncture for that headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not just any acupuncture. Oh, no. That would be too mundane, too boring, too...pedestrian. Needles? Stuck into the skin? Physically? How primitive! There might even be a tiny drop of blood! We can't have that! No, I'm a 21st century kind of guy, and I need a 21st century form of woo. It needs to be high tech woo of the finest caliber. Just like Dr. Evil, I want my frikkin' sharks to have frikkin' laser beams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's right: Laser acupuncture!

But there&amp;#39;s a linguistic side as well, which is partly terminological and partly rhetorical, as we&amp;#39;ve tried to document over the years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224050777764"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/571845e4a8741fee</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Heckle Me Elmo</title><published>2008-10-15T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2008-10-15T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/mccain/heckler.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Old story, new target: John McCain one-upped by a heckler during a campaign stop.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224046624471"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/liberal_baloney.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/14468732aed0260e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Liberal baloney</title><published>2008-10-15T05:25:59Z</published><updated>2008-10-15T05:25:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/421213822/liberal_baloney.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/liberal_baloney.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;OK, this is the kind of thing that just pisses me off: the tendency for some liberals to go off all loopy and credulous.

Dembski and Michael Ruse in Dialogue&lt;/strong&gt; Minneapolis: Fortress, 2007, we read how Dembski’s  attempts to have design be a place holder for our ignorance, are doomed to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heard points out how Dembski misunderstands, or perhaps misrepresents, scientific inquiry by claiming that many evolutionary biologists believe that a hypothetical pathway is sufficient to trump Intelligent Design. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there are some interesting conclusions to be made here, after the quote:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Heard Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dembski Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many evolutionary biologists seem to think that if you can merely imagine a material force or process that could bring about some biological structure, then it’s immediately going to trump intelligent design. But is there actual evidence for the creative power of these material forces? Or is the more compelling evidence on the side of intelligent design? It seems to me that really is where the issue should be. (15)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds like a promising beginning, but Dembski does not deliver. He repeatedly claims, but does not demonstrate, that evolutionary biologists rest content with “imagining” evolutionary pathways; he addresses neither the fossil record nor DNA evidence, to name but two sources of data that outline such pathways and provide “actual evidence” for the “material forces” that evolutionary biologists study. Nor does Dembski provide “compelling evidence” in favor of ID. Instead, Dembski tries to set up ID as the preferred fallback position should mainstream biology fail to explain–to Dembski’s satisfaction?–the evolutionary pathways leading to selected biological structures. To be blunt, Dembski does not really play fair. He asks, “[I]s it reasonable to argue that because we don’t understand how the design of biological systems was implemented that it didn’t happen by design at all?” (19). Yet Dembski offers precisely this argument against evolutionary biology: “if we don’t understand how a given biological system (like the bacterial flagellum) emerged by evolution, it didn’t happen by evolution at all.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heard quickly points out that not only does Dembski fail in his strawman portrayal of ‘many evolutionary biologists’ but also shows how Intelligent Design remains with any competing explanation because it is at best a placeholder for our ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dembski, attempting to respond to a question about what ID has contributed to science, basically shows why it remains scientifically vacuous:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Heard Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In response to Ruse’s question, “What are you ID people actually getting in the biological world that we evolutionists are not?” (32), Dembski replies (in part),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dembski Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the burden on intelligent design is simply to come up with new experiments, new facts. The important thing is to find new ways to make sense of them. I believe that we are making better sense out of them than the evolutionary biologists. The point of my joke about imagining an evolutionary pathway was that we have not been given any detailed evolutionary pathways. (32) 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dembski’s final claim in this quotation is not only false but also somewhat brazen, given his absolute refusal to accept for ID the “burden” of showing detailed design pathways.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Dembski’s claim is well in line with his ‘pathetic’ statement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dembski Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for your example, I’m not going to take the bait. You’re asking me to play a game: “Provide as much detail in terms of possible causal mechanisms for your ID position as I do for my Darwinian position.” ID is not a mechanistic theory, and it’s not ID’s task to match your pathetic level of detail in telling mechanistic stories. If ID is correct and an intelligence is responsible and indispensable for certain structures, then it makes no sense to try to ape your method of connecting the dots. True, there may be dots to be connected. But there may also be fundamental discontinuities, and with IC systems that is what ID is discovering.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time ID attempts to replace our ignorance with ‘design’, feel free to remind its followers of the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

This critical piece of hardware controls almost all the scientific instruments on the observatory, so Hubble has been essentially down for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, NASA anticipates such things, and when Hubble was built, all critical systems had a redundant set installed. In other words, there is another of these controllers on Hubble, but it’s been switched off since just before launch back in April 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27181992/"&gt;NASA will start the procedure to turn it back on&lt;/a&gt;. This process is tricky, as it involves basically shutting everything down, then restarting it again. It means powering up a piece of hardware that’s had 18 years of napping. And it means several days of painstaking engineering and control, and making sure everything goes according to plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s entirely possible that Hubble will be up and running by Friday, which is good. The Shuttle mission that was going to service Hubble (installing two cameras and a bunch of other needed parts) has been postponed until next year. They are considering bringing up another controller to replace the dead one; that’s just in case the redundant one breaks down as well (and if they can’t turn on the redundant one, they’ll have to bring one up anyway). Ironically, the launch date was supposed to have been today, but now it won’t be until February at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA takes Hubble pretty seriously; in many ways it represents NASA itself. I’m glad. Hubble still has many years of peering into the universe ahead of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if anyone at NASA is reading this: I went to &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov"&gt;the main NASA site&lt;/a&gt;. I went to &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html"&gt;the Goddard site&lt;/a&gt;. And as of the time of this writing, I found no mention of this anywhere, even though the telecon about it was 7 hours ago. On &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/main/"&gt;the NASA Hubble page&lt;/a&gt;, the last update was from two weeks ago. Maybe I missed it, but news like this should really be on the front page.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224023521739"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3518">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d74467349d4d5d63</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Tick Tock!

&lt;p&gt;How can I respond to a story about zebrafish, development, and new imaging and visualization techniques? Total incoherent nerdgasm is how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keller et al. are using a technique called digital scanned laser light sheet fluorescence microscopy (DSLM) to do fast, high-resolution, 3-D scans through developing embryos over time; using a GFP-histone fusion protein marker, they localize the nucleus of every single cell in the embryo. Some of the geeky specs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1500x1500 pixel 2-D resolution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;12 bits per pixel dynamic range&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imaging speed of 10 million voxels per second&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete scan of a 1 cubic millimeter volume in 3µm steps in 90 seconds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efficient excitation (5600 times less energy than a confocal, one million times less than a two-photon scope) to minimize bleaching and photodamage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        

&lt;p&gt;Trust me, this is great stuff — as someone who was trying to do crude imaging of fluorescently labeled cells in the 1980s using a standard fluorescence scope and storing stills on VHS tape, this is all very Buck Rogers. Just load your embryo into the machine, start up the scanner, and it sits there collecting gigabytes of data for you for hours and hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait! That's not all! They've also got sophisticated analysis tools that go through the collected images and put together data projections for you. For instance, it will color code cells by how fast they are migrating, or will count cell divisions. Similar tools have been available for &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; for a while now, but they have an advantage: they're tiny animals where you might have to follow a thousand cells to get the full story. In zebrafish, you need to track tens of thousands of cells to capture all the details of a developmental event. This gadget can do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, for instance, are a couple of images to show what it looks like. The right half is the raw embryo, where each bright spot is a single cell nucleus; the left is one where the pattern of cell movement is color-coded, making it easier to spot exactly what domains of cells are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center;font-size:11px"&gt;&lt;img alt="dslm.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/14/dslm.jpg" width="300" height="281"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cell tracking and detection of cell divisions in the 
digital embryo. (A) Microscopy data (right half of embryo:
animal view maximum-projection) and digital embryo (left 
half of embryo) with color-encoded migration directions (see 
movie S9). Color-code: dorsal migration (green), ventral 
migration (cyan), towards/away from body axis (red/yellow), 
toward yolk (pink).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed one of their movies and threw it on YouTube for the bandwidth-challenged. It's not very pretty, but that's the fault of reducing it and compressing it with YouTube's standard tools. This is an example with color-coded migration (blue cells are relatively motionless, orange ones are moving fast), and you can at least get the gist of what you can detect. You can see the early scrambling of cells in the blastula, migration during epiboly and blastopore closure, and convergence in the formation of the body axis fairly easily. Well, you can if you're familiar with fish embryology, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I respond to a story about zebrafish, development, and new imaging and visualization techniques? Total incoherent nerdgasm is how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keller et al. are using a technique called digital scanned laser light sheet fluorescence microscopy (DSLM) to do fast, high-resolution, 3-D scans through developing embryos over time; using a GFP-histone fusion protein marker, they localize the nucleus of every single cell in the embryo. Some of the geeky specs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1500x1500 pixel 2-D resolution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;12 bits per pixel dynamic range&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imaging speed of 10 million voxels per second&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete scan of a 1 cubic millimeter volume in 3µm steps in 90 seconds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efficient excitation (5600 times less energy than a confocal, one million times less than a two-photon scope) to minimize bleaching and photodamage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust me, this is great stuff — as someone who was trying to do crude imaging of fluorescently labeled cells in the 1980s using a standard fluorescence scope and storing stills on VHS tape, this is all very Buck Rogers. Just load your embryo into the machine, start up the scanner, and it sits there collecting gigabytes of data for you for hours and hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait! That's not all! They've also got sophisticated analysis tools that go through the collected images and put together data projections for you. For instance, it will color code cells by how fast they are migrating, or will count cell divisions. Similar tools have been available for &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; for a while now, but they have an advantage: they're tiny animals where you might have to follow a thousand cells to get the full story. In zebrafish, you need to track tens of thousands of cells to capture all the details of a developmental event. This gadget can do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, for instance, are a couple of images to show what it looks like. The right half is the raw embryo, where each bright spot is a single cell nucleus; the left is one where the pattern of cell movement is color-coded, making it easier to spot exactly what domains of cells are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="dslm.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/14/dslm.jpg" width="300" height="281"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cell tracking and detection of cell divisions in the 
digital embryo. (A) Microscopy data (right half of embryo:
animal view maximum-projection) and digital embryo (left 
half of embryo) with color-encoded migration directions (see 
movie S9). Color-code: dorsal migration (green), ventral 
migration (cyan), towards/away from body axis (red/yellow), 
toward yolk (pink).&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed one of their movies and threw it on YouTube for the bandwidth-challenged. It's not very pretty, but that's the fault of reducing it and compressing it with YouTube's standard tools. This is an example with color-coded migration (blue cells are relatively motionless, orange ones are moving fast), and you can at least get the gist of what you can detect. You can see the early scrambling of cells in the blastula, migration during epiboly and blastopore closure, and convergence in the formation of the body axis fairly easily. Well, you can if you're familiar with fish embryology, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This is just a short gripe at the NYT, and a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/10/14/opinion/20081014_OPCHART.html"&gt;feature
that they included in today's Op-Ed section.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It purports to compare how the economy does under democratic versus
republican administrations. They claim that they're computing the returns
on a 10,000 dollar stock investment under 40 years of republican
administrations and 40 years of democratic administrations, in the 80 years
since 1929.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except she has magnified them even more &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3505"&gt;by very glowingly reviewing my book&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, given the number of cosmic events that can irradiate the Earth to the point of vaporization, &amp;quot;glowing&amp;quot; reviews should be common. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem with Rebecca’s review is she complains about my puns. The thing is, I know she secretly loves them, but cannot bring herself to admit it, at least in public. C’mon, Rebecca: fess up. Or… maybe it’s because she’s a vegetarian, and the book is meteor than she’s used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it’s a great review. Thanks, RW! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh– I’m hearing stories that the book is already appearing on bookshelves, and is being shipped by online stores. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Skies-These-Ways-World/dp/0670019976/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220913560&amp;amp;sr=8-8/badastronomy"&gt;So what are you waiting for&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224012224383"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-6905738919369938365">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/428ee47311379cf9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Canada" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Move to Canada</title><published>2008-10-14T19:21:00Z</published><updated>2008-10-14T19:24:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/10/move-to-canada.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/6905738919369938365/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=6905738919369938365" title="2 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Hat Tip: The Unexamined Life]</summary><author><name>Larry Moran</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1224008785253"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/i_wonder_who_marty_chalfie_is.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/62ffc453243c44b7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">I wonder who Marty Chalfie is voting for?</title><published>2008-10-14T19:20:33Z</published><updated>2008-10-14T19:20:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/420779360/i_wonder_who_marty_chalfie_is.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/i_wonder_who_marty_chalfie_is.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Seed and &lt;a href="http://sefora.org/2008/10/13/i&amp;#39;m-a-scientist-and-i&amp;#39;m-voting-for...-challenge/"&gt;Scientists and Engineers for America&lt;/a&gt; are teaming up to promote a youtube challenge — they are collecting videos of scientists stating who they are voting for in the coming election.

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that the scientific establishment will be showing a profound liberal bias this year, largely because the scientific establishment tends to be pro-reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have to be a Nobelist — if you&amp;#39;re a scientist, record a youtube video of yourself, tag it with &amp;quot;aVoteForScience&amp;quot;, and you too can contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

Sorting out their evolutionary history has been a major challenge for decades. Unlike the much bigger, multicellular, eukaryotes, there are few morphological markers to assist scientists in classifying bacteria. The fossil record is mostly silent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Molecular evolution came to the rescue thirty years ago when cloning and sequencing became common.
