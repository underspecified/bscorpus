From Science on line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientists have discovered a potential retroviral link to chronic fatigue syndrome, known as CFS, a debilitating disease that affects millions of people in the United States. Researchers from the Whittemore Peterson Institute (WPI), located at the University of Nevada, Reno, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and the Cleveland Clinic, report this finding online Oct. 8, 2009, issue of Science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We now have evidence that a retrovirus named XMRV is frequently present in the blood of patients with CFS. This discovery could be a major step in the discovery of vital treatment options for millions of patients,” said Judy Mikovits, Ph.D., director of research for WPI and leader of the team that discovered this association. Researchers cautioned however, that this finding shows there is an association between XMRV and CFS but does not prove that XMRV causes CFS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was as surprised as others on reading this release. A disorder followed for over a century, commonly believed to be an emotionally-based, mood disorder (somatization) is found to have a viral “association”? Although the release states “association,” many readers are likely to read “cause.”  The vigor of the news releases and the enthusiasm of investigator comments sure lead one in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprised? Rather, shocked – reading simultaneous news releases from the journal Science (on-line version) and the NIH plus about association with the Cleveland Clinic. These are big time sponsors and investigators. The announcements are intended to be taken seriously. Yet I have doubts.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcements and releases are a bit trumpety. But aren’t most such releases the same?  Yes, but then why the doubts here, which led to a skeptical blog like this.  Well, I saw a few problem clues – I thought I’d “share.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, here are the present principles we use in thinking about CFS.  These principles compose a paradigm of the nature of CFS for which the new findings, if proved causal, would require a thorough re-structuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CFS has been recognized and described for over a century. It is commonly known by an array of different names, applied to the phenomenon’s syndromes, most of which have shared characteristics: chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, da Costa syndrome/effort syndrome, neurasthenia (and even “pseudo-neurasthenia,”) myalgic encephalitis (M.E. – UK) chronic Lyme disease, multiple chemical sensitivities, Icelandic (Akureyrie) disease, subclinical hypothyroidism,  hypometabolism, hypoglycemia, candidiasis,  chronic mononucleosis/ Epstein-Barr disease.  Sharing symptoms and presumed differing only in prior associations have been shell-shock (WWI,) battle fatigue (WW II),) post-traumatic stress disorder (Viet Nam and subsequently,) and Gulf War Syndrome. The current paradigm includes all these as variants of somatization, somatiform illness, somatic conversion – all expressions of the same problem through a similar mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of those syndromes differs from others in the focus or dominance of the major symptom and the perceived cause. According to medical historians, these functional disorders were described as early as the mid-19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century (Charcot), and defined or elaborated and popularized by Freud in the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; as hysterical (blindness, paralysis, etc.) illness or conversion hysteria.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century manifestations were mostly vague physical symptoms, still expressive of somatization – a transfer of focus from emotional source to bodily functions and discomfort. The originating problem is thought to be too threatening to the person’s self image or identity to deal with consciously. Most physician observers detect signs of secondary gain in most patients.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A signal finding of CFS people is a solidified lack of insight, and resistance to introspection and to pursuing psychotherapy or psychological investigation. Psychotropic drugs are generally unable to produce relief or a sense of help. This characteristic has made a diagnosis of underlying depression uncertain, and psychological approaches unsuccessful. But the lack of insight and the surface hostility to medical approaches cause a standoff between the affected and the medical system. Affected people drift easily into aberrant sectarian systems and methods, often claiming dramatic, though temporary results from them. Although most psychological approaches meet with resistance, some success is reported with cognitive behavioral therapy, perceived as non-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CFS uniformly spontaneously resolves over time. According to CDC, almost all cases are resolved by three years, although there are many of longer record.  If anyone has ever died with CFS, I’ve not heard of it. Nor have there been complications or sequelae. Coming close was a young man whose self-recorded history is on &lt;a href="http://aboutmecfs.org/Story/MECFSRecovery.aspx"&gt;Phoenix Rising&lt;/a&gt;, one of the CFS web pages I came across. His is a lengthy story – not a typical CFS case – remarkable in its severity, duration, and  disability and even to cachexia.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major and signal symptoms have varied over the decades (centuries?) to conform to changes in medical heuristics and scientific explanations. Patient perceptions seem to accommodate to physician perceptions of what might be acceptable as physical illness. Despite this variation, in the early to mid 1980s, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) synthesized a collection of major and minor criteria for following a population of CFSers for epidemiologic study. At the time, some experts estimated the affected US population at some 2 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Incline Village epidemic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current CFS wave started in about 1985 with a small population of patients in a small medical practice of two physicians in Incline Village Nevada, a resort collection of homes and condos on Lake Tahoe. The two physicians claimed that the symptoms of fatigue and poor mental functioning had affected the town in unusual numbers. They suspected the condition acted like a viral disease traveling through their community. Thus began a search for a viral etiology – Epstein-Barr, followed by HHV-6, then  mycoplasma, and other organisms. The affair led eventually to a national search and a sudden appearance of other clusters as well as widespread isolated cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among multiple news stories in print and television, was a Newsweek cover story, identifying the phenomenon as an epidemic of mysterious origin, and ignoring the century-long identified history of mood disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another vogue concept in the mid-1990s was some ill defined adreno-pituitary-hypothalamic axis “imbalance” as seen by yet another array of mild abnormalities on various measurements including stress testing, hormonal assays, and blood pressure measurements, especially to tilt-table positioning.  These have led to other theories of vascular and pressure instability or electrolyte imbalance. Some of these studies bore the name of the future Director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Steven E. Straus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem has been that no laboratory or physical test abnormality had been found consistently in different groups or by different investigators.  There are over 4 600 references in Medline, and Google Scholar records over 400,000 references.  One would think there would be little left to discover. And, there is already a credible explanation for most cases of CFS – somatiform illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the CDC completed its initial investigation, it found no evidence of a viral etiology, or even of an identifiable physical disease. To many of us, the sudden epidemic-like spread acted as much like a mass psychogenic illness as it did an infectious disease. At least two self-help, patient-organized CFS societies formed for patient education and advocacy, lobbying the CDC for research, and Congress for funds.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CFS, lacking consistent definable characteristics, was somewhat arbitrarily defined by epidemiologists at the CDC in order to select a study population. Simply put, the symptoms are common to almost everyone at some time or other – fatigue, myalgia, specific tender “trigger points,” sleep disturbance, sore throat, mental fog, and inability to concentrate, all lasting a minimum of six months. The physical findings are also minimal – limited to perhaps a mild fever and/or mildly enlarged lymph nodes without pathology, tender muscle areas, but no specific objective finding, no radiographic finding, and no consistent blood or other lab test abnormality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus found by the current investigators was described as a xenotropic murine leukemia related retrovirus – like RNA virus previously found in men with aggressive prostate cancer. I know nothing about this virus or why they suspected it or how they happened upon it.  The article’s full text was still unavailable at the time of this writing. If I had read it, I still might need a virologist to interpret the lab methods and findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report’s abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating disease of&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;unknown etiology that is estimated to affect 17 million people&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;worldwide. Studying peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;from CFS patients, we identified DNA from a human gammaretrovirus,&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV), in 68&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;of 101 patients (67%) compared to 8 of 218 (3.7%) healthy controls.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Cell culture experiments revealed that patient-derived XMRV&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;is infectious and that both cell-associated and cell-free transmission&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;of the virus are possible. Secondary viral infections were established&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;in uninfected primary lymphocytes and indicator cell lines following&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;exposure to activated PBMCs, B cells, T cells, or plasma derived&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;from CFS patients. These findings raise the possibility that&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;XMRV may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of CFS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the description of a debilitating disease of unknown etiology… with no mention of current theory –  none of the reports so far has mentioned the current opinion on the nature of CFS and its other forms – somatization. All news reports contain only comments on theories of infection and the mysteries of CFS. Nevertheless, the researchers found the virus in blood and immune cells of 67 percent of CFS people as compared with 3.7 percent in normal people. That is impressive.  Determining what the XMRV is doing there is guesswork at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then two names on the news releases and the report caught my eye. The major research organization publicizing the discovery was the Whittemore-Peterson Institute for Molecular Biology. Reno is not far from Incline Village and the name D. Peterson – that turned out to be Daniel Peterson, the second physician in the original Incline report, along with Paul Cheney.  Over twenty years of searching for a cause of a phenomenon (an infectious epidemic) determined not to have occurred – and the search continues?  I could not help but take notice. And who is Whittemore?  He is a real estate developer in Reno who supplied the first $1.4 million for the new research institute to be at the University of Nevada Reno’s medical school, to be devoted to investigating neuro-humoral systems.  I suspected some family connection to CFS so looked through the releases and found a note that his daughter, 26, is…a sufferer from CFS.  None of this detracts directly from the weight of the experimental findings, but it’s just unsettling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know what will result from this work. Certainly, the work of 13 authors from four different research institutes must mean something. They could not all be deceived?  Eight authors from four countries were deceived in the original Benveniste homeopathy report. Then, tens to hundreds of investigators at NIH may have drunk of the NCCAM Kool-Aid by this time, believing at some point that there might be something worthwhile in CAM methods.  Funny things happen. I’m betting that either the work will not be replicated, or that some other innocent explanation such as an artifact of lab technique accounting for viral presence will be found. I estimate the odds at 80:20 (4 to 1.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the association is confirmed, the finding will have near-revolutionary implications for our understanding disease – particularly infectious disease.  If there is a confirmed model for such a vague set of symptoms signifying some occult infection limited to immune cells, which produces no repeatable cellular or antibody abnormality, no susceptibility to other infections (such as with HIV) and in which the sites of infection (immune cells) bear no relation to the sites of symptoms and produce no physical abnormality, I haven’t known of it.  Interesting times.&lt;/p&gt;

It concerns a recent &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.0359"&gt;paper by Holger Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya&lt;/a&gt; (and some earlier work) discussing a seemingly crazy-sounding proposal — that we should randomly choose a card from a million-card deck and, on the basis of which card we get, decide whether to go forward with the Large Hadron Collider.  Responses have ranged from eye-rolling and heavy sighs to cries of outrage, clutching at pearls, and grim warnings that the postmodernists have finally infiltrated the scientific/journalistic establishment, this could be the straw that breaks the back of the Enlightenment camel, and worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I am quoted (in a rather non-committal way) in the essay, it’s my responsibility to dig into the papers and report back.  And my message is:  relax!  Western civilization will survive.  The theory is undeniably crazy — but not crackpot, which is a distinction worth drawing.  And an occasional fun essay about speculative science in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; is not going to send us back to the Dark Ages, or even rank among the top ten thousand dangers along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard Newtonian way of thinking about the laws of physics is in terms of an initial-value problem.  You specify the state of the system (positions and velocities) at one moment, then the laws of physics tell you how it will evolve into the future.  But there is a completely equivalent alternative, which casts the laws of physics in terms of an &lt;em&gt;action principle&lt;/em&gt;.  In this formulation, we assign a number — the action — to every possible &lt;em&gt;history&lt;/em&gt; of the system throughout time.  (The choice of what action to assign is simply the choice of what laws of physics are operative.)  Then the allowed histories, the ones that “obey the laws of physics,” are those for which the action is the smallest.  That’s the “principle of least action,” and it’s a standard undergraduate exercise to show that it’s utterly equivalent to the initial-value formulation of dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In quantum mechanics, as you may have heard, things change a tiny bit.  Instead of only allowing histories that minimize the action, quantum mechanics (as reformulated by Feynman) tells us to add up the contributions from every possible history, but give larger weight to those with smaller actions.  In effect, we blur out the allowed trajectories around the one with absolutely smallest action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nielsen and Ninomiya (NN) pull an absolutely speculative idea out of their hats:  they ask us to consider what would happen if the action were a complex number, rather than just a real number.  Then there would be an &lt;em&gt;imaginary&lt;/em&gt; part of the action, in addition to the real part.  (This is the square-root-of-minus-one sense of “imaginary,” not the LSD-hallucination sense of “imaginary.”)  No real justification — or if there is, it’s sufficiently lost in the mists that I can’t discern it from the recent papers.  That’s okay; it’s just the traditional hypothesis-testing that has served science well for a few centuries now.  Propose an idea, see where it leads, toss it out if it conflicts with the data, build on it if it seems promising.  We don’t know all the laws of physics, so there’s no reason to stand pat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NN argue that the effect of the imaginary action is to highly suppress the probabilities associated with certain trajectories, even if those trajectories minimize the real action.  But it does so in a way that appears &lt;em&gt;nonlocal&lt;/em&gt; in spacetime — it’s really the entire trajectory through time that seems to matter, not just what is happening in our local neighborhood.  That’s a crucial difference between their version of quantum mechanics and the conventional formulation.  But it’s not completely bizarre or unprecedented.  Plenty of hints we have about quantum gravity indicate that it really is nonlocal.  More prosaically, in everyday statistical mechanics we don’t assign equal weight to every possible trajectory consistent with our current knowledge of the universe; by hypothesis, we only allow those trajectories that have a low entropy in the past.  (As readers of this blog should well know by now; and if you don’t, I have a book you should definitely read.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make progress with this idea, you have to make a choice for what the imaginary part of the action is supposed to be.  Here, in the eyes of this not-quite-expert, NN seem to cheat a little bit.  They basically want the imaginary action to look very similar to the real action, but it turns out that this choice is naively ruled out.  So they jump through some hoops until they get a more palatable choice of model, with the property that it is basically impotent except where the Higgs boson is concerned.  (The Higgs, as a fundamental scalar, interacts differently than other particles, so this isn’t completely &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; — just a little bit.)  Because they are not actually crackpots, they even admit what they’re doing — in their own words, “Our model with an imaginary part of the action begins with a series of not completely convincing, but still suggestive, assumptions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having invoked the tooth fairy twice — contemplating an imaginary part of the action, then choosing its form so as to only be relevant where the Higgs is concerned — they consider consequences.  Remember that the effect of the imaginary action is non-local in time — it depends on what happens throughout the history of the universe, not just here and now.  In particular, given their assumptions, it provides a large suppression to any history in which large numbers of Higgs bosons are produced, even if they won’t be produced until some time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;So this model makes a strong prediction:  we’re not going to be producing any Higgs bosons.  Not because the ordinary dynamical equations of physics prevent it (e.g., because the Higgs is just too massive), but because the specific trajectory on which the universe finds itself is one in which no Higgses are made.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, of course, runs into the problem that we have every intention of making Higgs bosons, for example at the LHC.  Aha, say NN, but notice that we haven’t yet!  The Superconducting Supercollider, which could have found the Higgs long ago, was canceled by Congress.  And in their &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.1919"&gt;December 2007 paper&lt;/a&gt; — before the LHC tried to turn on — they very explicitly say that a “natural” accident will come along and break the LHC if we try to turn it on.  Well, we know how &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/09/19/lhc-first-magnet-failure/"&gt;that turned out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But NN have an ingenious suggestion for saving us from future accidents at the LHC — which, as they warn, could endanger lives.  They propose a card game with more than a million cards, almost all of which say “go ahead, no problem.”  But one card says “don’t turn on the LHC!”  In their model, the nonlocal effect of the imaginary part of the action is to ensure that the realized history of the universe is one in which the LHC never turns on; but it doesn’t matter &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it doesn’t turn on.  If we randomly pick one out of a million cards, and honestly promise to follow through on the instructions on the card we pick, and we happen to pick the card that says not to turn it on, and we therefore don’t — that’s a history of the universe that is completely unsuppressed by their mechanism.  And if we choose a card that says “go ahead,” well then their theory is falsified.  (Unless we try to go ahead and are continually foiled by a series of unfortunate accidents.)  Best of all, playing the card game costs almost nothing.  But for it to work, we have to be very sincere that we won’t turn on the LHC if that’s what the card says.  It’s only a million-to-one chance, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that all of this “nonlocal in time,” “receiving signals sent from the future” stuff is a bit of a red herring, at least at the classical level.  We often think that the past is set in stone, while the future is still to be determined.  But that’s not how the laws of physics operate.  If we knew the precise state of the universe, and the exact laws of physics, the future would be as utterly determined as the present (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon"&gt;Laplace’s Demon&lt;/a&gt;).  We only think otherwise because our knowledge of the present state is highly imperfect, consisting as it does as a few pieces of information about the coarse-grained state.  (We don’t know the position and velocity of every particle in the universe, or for that matter in any macroscopic object.)  So there’s no need to think of NN’s imaginary action as making reference to what happens in the future — all the necessary data are in the present state.  What seems weird to us is that the NN mechanism makes crucial use of detailed, non-macroscopic information about the present state; information to which we don’t have access.  (Such as, “does this subset of the universe evolve into the Large Hadron Collider?”)  That’s not how the physics we know and love actually works, but the setup doesn’t actually rely on propagation of signals backwards in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day:  this theory is crazy.  There’s no real reason to believe in an imaginary component to the action with dramatic apparently-nonlocal effects, and even if there were, the specific choice of action contemplated by NN seems rather contrived.  But I’m happy to argue that it’s the good kind of crazy.  The authors start with a speculative but well-defined idea, and carry it through to its logical conclusions.  That’s what scientists are supposed to do.  I think that the Bayesian prior probability on their model being right is less than one in a million, so I’m not going to take its predictions very seriously.  But the process by which they work those predictions out has been perfectly scientific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another reasonable question, which is whether an essay (not a news story, note) like this in a major media outlet contributes to the erosion of trust in scientists on the part of the general public.  I would love to see actual data one way or the other, which went beyond “remarkably, the view of the common man aligns precisely with the view I myself hold.”  My own anecdotal observations are pretty unambiguous — the public loves far-out speculations like this, and happily eats them up.  (See previous mocking quote, now applied to myself.)  It’s always important to distinguish as clearly as possible between what is crazy-sounding but well-established as true — quantum mechanics, relativity, natural selection — and what is crazy-sounding and speculative, even if it’s respectable speculation — inflation, string theory, exobiology.  But if that distinction is made, I’ve always found it pretty paternalistic and condescending to claim that we should shield the public from speculative science until it’s been established one way or the other.  The public are grown-ups, and we should assume the best of them rather than the worst.  There’s nothing wrong with letting them in on the debates about crazy-sounding ideas that we professional scientists enjoy as our stock in trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disappointing thing about the responses to the article is how non-intellectual they have been.  I haven’t heard “the NN argument against contributions to the imaginary action that are homogeneous in field types is specious,” or even “I see no reason whatsoever to contemplate imaginary actions, so I’m going to ignore this” (which would be a perfectly defensible stance).  It’s been more like “this is completely counter to my everyday experience, therefore it must be crackpot!”  That’s not a very sciencey attitude.  It certainly would have been incompatible with all sorts of important breakthroughs in physics through the years.  The Nielsen/Ninomiya scenario isn’t going to be one of those breakthroughs, I feel pretty sure.  But it’s sensible enough that it merits disagreement on the basis of rational arguments, not just rolling of eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255568198665"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/hpv_vaccinination---the_is_rea.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7083f325cece0c9b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cancer basics"/><title type="html">HPV vaccinination---this is real, people</title><published>2009-10-14T22:52:02Z</published><updated>2009-10-14T22:52:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/yMGopb2GuPs/hpv_vaccinination---the_is_rea.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/hpv_vaccinination---the_is_rea.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;First let me remind you that I've written extensively about HPV infection, cervical cancer, and Gardasil, the vaccine to prevent these. The links are at the bottom of the post for your reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, here's the deal.  &lt;a href="http://quichemoraine.com/2009/10/and-then-you-wait/"&gt;A bloggy friend of mine&lt;/a&gt; is dealing with some serious health concerns due to HPV infection.  I've written lots of pieces about the more intimate side of medicine, but no one can tell it like a patient.  How someone deals with disease is a personal matter, and she has decided to "come out" and share her story in order to help others. (Digression: &lt;a href="http://everythingchangesbook.com/"&gt;a great book called &lt;i&gt;Everything Changes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about dealing with cancer as a young adult is out, and it is also a bit harsh on our current health care system.  It's a Studs Terkel type oral history, and a good read.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry to keep getting derailed here, but for some reason, a lot of my friends have cancer, and it's right in my face these days.  I have one friend who's had ovarian cancer since her baby was born four years ago, another who just had a bilateral mastectomy, another with metastatic melanoma---you get the idea.  If there had been some way to prevent these cancers, either by aggressive screening to identify early disease or by primary prevention through, say, vaccination, I'd be a much happier person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me back to my friend.  The internet is a funny place.  Stephanie and I certainly don't agree about everything, but we do read each other's stuff fairly regularly and have had the chance to meet in person, albeit far too briefly. I'm hoping she and her hirsute hubby will make it to ScienceOnline this winter.  Anyway, like many Americans, Stephanie hasn't always been able to get regular screening exams, and whether it's because of insurance, finances, laziness, or aliens, the point is that screening (that is, Pap smears) requires an action on the part of the patient to understand risk and to present themselves to a doctor for an invasive and expensive exam at least once a year.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many American women, Stephanie harbors the human papillomavirus, and apparently her guest is one of the cancer-causing strains.  This virus lives in her cervix and messes with the genes of cervical cells, causing them to reproduce uncontrollably.  In her case, the malignant cells haven't yet figured out how to invade very deeply, but they are spread out rather diffusely, making cure certain, but not easy.   &lt;a href="http://almostdiamonds.blogspot.com/2009/10/good-news-but-complicated.html"&gt;Stephanie has a good picture&lt;/a&gt; up at her place, but let me give you a little more detail.  I find that people who don't actually dig into other people regularly don't always have a good feel for &lt;a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Female_reproductive_system_lateral_nolabel.png"&gt;more hidden anatomy&lt;/a&gt;.  You can check out the linked picture, but more helpful (at least for women) would be to ask for a mirror at your next gynecology appointment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/hpv_vaccinination---the_is_rea.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/hpv_vaccinination---the_is_rea.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/yMGopb2GuPs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255567556487"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=17109">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/af96248699b7eb51</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Pop Culture"/><title type="html">Another Reason Not to Shop at Walmart</title><published>2009-10-15T00:00:06Z</published><updated>2009-10-15T00:00:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/14/another-reason-not-to-shop-at-walmart/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christian video games are bad enough as it is.  So often, they’re low-quality versions of real entertainment.  (Remember &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/08/27/i-want-these-games/"&gt;Guitar Praise and Dance Praise 2 — The ReMix&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you’re trying to sell the Jesus kitsch, you might as well go where your customers are:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walmart.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, Walmarts in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where Left Behind Games Inc. is now going to be &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS65055+12-Oct-2009+PRN20091012"&gt;selling their goods&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Christian products have gained popular acceptance in the music and book sections of retailers over recent years. The newest Left Behind and Charlie Church Mouse PC video games are among three titles being piloted in approximately 100 Texas Walmart stores for determining customer interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demographics in Texas make it an ideal testing ground for Left Behind PC Games where there are over 23,000 churches… Texas ranks first in the nation in the number of Evangelical Protestants (over 5 million), second in number of Mainline Protestants (over 1.7 million) and third in number of Catholics… Troy Lyndon, CEO of Inspired Media says, “The US market for Christian video games could reach $648 Million within the next five years based upon just 3% of video game sales being in the Christian segment.” This projection is based upon the prediction by PricewaterhouseCoopers that the sale of video game software will reach $21.6 Billion by 2013 in the US alone.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know whether to cry for all of Texas or for the children who will end up playing this garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, I just don’t think kids are going to line up for miles for games &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2006/11/30/left-behind-the-game/"&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/gamelife/2009/10/left_behind_-_eternal_forces_coverart.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/gamelife/2009/10/left_behind_-_eternal_forces_coverart.jpg" title="LeftBehind" width="256" height="364"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2006/11/30/left-behind-the-game/"&gt;purpose of that game&lt;/a&gt;, by the way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You are in control of the gospel singers and missionaries, and you must defeat the secularists, devils, and rock stars. By defeat, they mean you must convert them by “raising their spirit level.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’d prefer the Christian version of Mario Kart.  That would be awesome.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d totally take Judas out with a red turtle shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;a href="http://secularright.org/wordpress/?p=2917"&gt;Secular Right, Razib Khan&lt;/a&gt; asks if adherence to creationism has become a litmus test for Republican presidential candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[I]t looks like 3 of the front-runners for the G.O.P. nomination are rather frank Creationists (Palin, Huckabee and Pawlenty). I’m skeptical about any of these as likely candidates (i.e., if you had to make a bet you’re going to be surprised), but if you keep adding individuals to the list it seems likely that we’re looking at a serious probability that the G.O.P. nominee in 2012 will be a Creationist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pawlenty was once thought of as a &lt;a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2008/Pres/Maps/Jul12.html"&gt;possibly moderate&lt;/a&gt; sort of Republican: no more. It is gob-smacking to think that the President of the United States could be someone who thinks, as Richard Dawkins put it, that &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articleComments,647,Foreword-for-the-UK-edition-of-Letter-to-a-Christian-Nation,Richard-Dawkins,page2"&gt;the universe came into existence after the domestication of the dog&lt;/a&gt;. That’s the problem with a two party system: when inevitably the people, through the hubris, boredom, or familiarity of the ruling party become disenchanted with it, the other party takes power, no matter how narrow, bizarre, and dysfunctional it has become.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of saying, “So Help Me God,” she said, “On my honor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reader &lt;strong&gt;Sarah&lt;/strong&gt; just began a new job and faced a similar situation.  Jen’s story was in the back of her mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah writes this in an email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A few days ago, I was hired by a privately-funded homeless shelter.  My first day of work I was asked to fill out tax forms, sign my employment contract, and sign an oath to act in a respectful and professional manner.  At the end of the oath, above the line for my signature, I was perturbed to see the phrase “SO HELP ME GOD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe I require a non-existent being to help me behave properly, and I would have felt like a hypocrite if I had signed it with the (irrelevant) phrase intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered reading about a lawyer in the states (on Friendly Atheist) who substituted “On my honour” for “so help me God” when giving an oath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked my new boss if it would be acceptable to make the substitution.  He said it was fine by him but was unsure if it was all right for us to make the changes on a legal document.  He called the commissioner of oaths and asked her if it was all right to make the change and she said it wass perfectly fine.  “So help me God” was scratched out with a black pen and “on my honour” was written in.  I signed and feel good about it!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This organization is the respectable face of the chiropractic profession and yet it happily promotes bogus treatments."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simon applied for this permission so he can appeal the adverse ruling, which had held that in that passage: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- he had made factual statements rather than mere comment (and this is legally important as factual statements need to be justified, and this is difficult, whilst comment only needs to be shown to be fair); and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- the factual statements meant that the BCA were knowingly dishonest (and this would be, in my view, impossible to prove and was not Simon's intention nor, again in my view, what he actually said).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But to even make this appeal Simon required &lt;em&gt;permission&lt;/em&gt;. This was essential, for such an appeal is not an automatic entitlement and so one has to apply for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The test for permission to appeal here was whether Simon has an arguable case to appeal the adverse ruling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simon had lost his two previous two applications for permission to appeal - the first at the initial High Court hearing and the second in July "on the papers" by &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/08/length-of-simon-singhs-skeleton-reasons.html"&gt; another Lord Justice of Appeal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both refusals were to the effect that Simon did not have an arguable case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After two such refusals the main options for Simon were to either proceed to trial (or settle) on the basis of the adverse ruling on meaning, or to make his third and final application by way of an oral hearing before the Court of Appeal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;He chose to go for the third, oral application. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was partly because any eventual application to the European Court of Human Rights may formally require him to have exhausted his domestic appeals; and partly - and most commendably - because he simply believed it was right that he should have the chance to defend his article on the basis of what he believed he had said (and what almost everyone else seems to think he said).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nonetheless, no lawyer would have put his chances for this application at more than 50:50, even for limited permission to appeal only the meaning of dishonesty so that he could mount a less onerous justification defence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was because the Court of Appeal is extremely reluctant to overturn the preliminary rulings in cases currently before the lower courts, especially appeals concerning meaning in defamation cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So even without all the special features of this case, this was just not the sort of application in which one tends to succeed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/StYjZmd7BFI/AAAAAAAAANE/SRhLoj8CdxM/s1600-h/a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:298px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/StYjZmd7BFI/AAAAAAAAANE/SRhLoj8CdxM/s400/a.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Therefore our hopes were not high at 10.00 this morning in Court 75, deep in the Hogwartian maze of the Royal Courts of Justice, a courtroom accessible only through countless corridors and numerous cold stone stairwells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The British Chiropractic Association did not attend, and so the parties' and lawyers' benches in court were half empty. The BCA did not need to turn up, for it was Simon's application, and not their application. However, this imbalance did give the courtroom a strange feel, especially as the public gallery was packed with Simon's cheerful supporters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We waited for the appeal judge,&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Laws_(judge)"&gt; Lord Justice Laws&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most highly-regarded and senior members of the Court of Appeal, with a formidable intellectual reputation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the hearing commenced it quickly became apparent that no further submissions were to be required from Simon's barristers. This was a good sign. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lord Justice Laws then announced that the application would be granted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He proceeded to give a very carefully worded judgment, which is characteristic of Lord Justice Laws, and so it is important to wait for the formal publication of the judgment, which should be in a few days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, four aspects of the judgment immediately struck me as interesting - but please do note that my observations here are subject to the actual published judgment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, Lord Justice Laws was careful set out in full the paragraph which followed the alleged libel in the passage, where Simon explains his use of the word "bogus". It may be recalled that this paragraph was not expressly mentioned by Mr Justice Eady in the initial ruling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second, Lord Justice Laws explicitly mentioned Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights (which protects free expression) and the requirement under Article 10 for a balancing exercise. It appeared to me - and I will be interested to read the judgment carefully on this when it is published - that the implication was that the initial ruling had not sufficiently engaged Article 10 of the Convention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Third, Lord Justice Laws seemed to accept that it was arguable that it was disproportionate to really expect a defendant to show that a corporate entity could have a subjective dishonest intent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fourth, and most importantly, Lord Justice Laws gave permission for a &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; appeal on the meaning of the alleged libel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This means that Simon can now re-argue before the Court of Appeal that his article was &lt;em&gt;fair comment&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The appeal will not therefore be limited to deciding which factual meaning Simon will need to justify. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This Court of Appeal hearing will be in around six months time, perhaps in time for the next &lt;em&gt;Chiropractic Awareness Week&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, a warning. It is important to note what this decision does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- the High Court's adverse ruling has &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; been overturned: it is entirely possible for the Court of Appeal to still uphold the High Court's original adverse ruling; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- the Court of Appeal has not criticised or in any way ruled against the BCA's case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Court of Appeal has held that Simon has an arguable case for a full appeal on meaning; but this certainly does not mean that they will necessarily accept his case at the full appeal, and so his case may still be rejected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it does turn the litigation clock back to the very beginning of the preliminary hearing and gives Simon a well-deserved (and legally rather unexpected) opportunity to argue before the Court of Appeal what his article actually meant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, in summary, this is the best possible outcome for this application for permission to appeal. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it is also the best possible reward for Simon's awesome determination to be able to properly defend in court what he said about the British Chiropractic Association's promotion of chiropractic for various children's ailments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will set out the full judgment on this site as soon as it is published with a detailed commentary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please provide a name with your comment; purely anonymous posts will not be approved.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-6918574067459281871?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255549316345"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/donorschoose_-_update.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5df1191890a14c97</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">DonorsChoose - Update</title><published>2009-10-14T20:10:21Z</published><updated>2009-10-14T20:10:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/M_PfTXk_Bf8/donorschoose_-_update.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/donorschoose_-_update.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As an addendum, I received a couple of emails from you who are poor, starving graduate students who want to make an impact, but may only have $1-5 to spare.

To date we have helped to fully fund 13 projects and I could not be more proud of the folks who read my blog and generously opened their wallets for this cause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Twitter I have become acquainted with one of the teachers (@sumrthyme) from my project list. I asked her if she could tell me a little more about her school and she said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I teach kindergarten in rural South Carolina. Our district was featured in the Corridor of Shame documentary. ( &lt;a href="http://www.corridorofshame.com/"&gt;http://www.corridorofshame.com/&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is my 33rd year teaching. I still love teaching and truly consider it my calling, not just a job.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;All of my schools funds have been frozen. We have received no money for classroom supplies or materials this year. 93% of our students receive free or reduced lunches so parental contributions are rare. In a &amp;quot;good&amp;#39; year, I usually get $600.00 to purchase supplies and materials. Most of this is spent on consumable items. I may have some money left to purchase 1 or 2 items such as learning center activities or manipulatives.  We did not lose any teachers this year.We are very grateful for this. Some positions were not filled if teachers and/or assistants retired or left due to other reasons. Some faculty/staff had to change schools.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We are not hiring substitutes this year. If a teacher is out, the students are placed in other classrooms. This results in loss of instruction for several classes. This has really hurt teacher morale at my school. DonorsChoose has been a tremendous blessing to me and my students. Through the generosity of donors, I have gotten many items that have enriched my students' instruction and educational experiences. Some of these include:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;LeapFrog Tag Readers and books&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;materials for a wring center -crayons, pencils, journals, writing paper..&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;math games and manipulatives&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;a sand water table with molds&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;an art easel, paints, play dough&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It breaks my heart to think that a teacher should have to feel grateful that someone provided her students with paint and crayons and pencils. These items should be commonplace in a classroom and no teacher should have to beg for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thank you again for your efforts to provide these items to budding scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, on to business.  You see, I was very happy to participate simply to do something good for others.  &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey"&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground"&gt;rest of you&lt;/a&gt; seem to believe that this must be a competition to see who can raise the most.  Apparently beating Isis at something earns you some kind of notch in your blog belt.  Recently, fellow ScienceBlogger and nurse hater &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground"&gt;PalMD&lt;/a&gt; said this via his Twitter (@palmd):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why do @&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/drisis"&gt;drisis&lt;/a&gt; readers hate children? Why? My pitifully small readership is still ahead in &lt;a title="#donorschoose" href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23donorschoose"&gt;#donorschoose&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/4dYRqL" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://bit.ly/4dYRqL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yo, @&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/drisis"&gt;drisis&lt;/a&gt; im kicking your hot ass at &lt;a title="#donorschoose" href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23donorschoose"&gt;#donorschoose&lt;/a&gt; ! why do your readers hate children? Why?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;And &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey"&gt;DrugMonkey&lt;/a&gt; (@drugmonkeyblog) joined in with:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;I can't believe that the @&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/palmd"&gt;palmd&lt;/a&gt; readers have surpassed the minions and little chickens of @&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/drisis"&gt;drisis&lt;/a&gt; !! &lt;a title="#donorschoose" href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23donorschoose"&gt;#donorschoose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I say, don't you remember &lt;a href="http://physioprof.wordpress.com/2008/10/27/congratulations-dr-isis/"&gt;what happened to the last dude&lt;/a&gt; who thought he could beat me at something?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;But, alright, bitches.  If you ask for war, then war you shall have.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to thinking, what do I possibly have that could make some of you open your wallets just a little bit wider...or even open your wallets at all?  Well, there&amp;#39;s only one thing I have that some of you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#39;s the deal, little chickens.   Dr. Isis is currently third on the Scienceblogs leader board, very, very close behind &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/leadershipboard.html?category=111"&gt;PalMD and Chad Orzel&lt;/a&gt;.   You help me teach these boys (not Chad, but Pal and Brother Drug) the consequences of talking trash and I will post for my little chickens a full head to toe video of Dr. Isis in all her glory, dancing like a little chicken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How badly do you want to see Dr. Isis?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/donorschoose_-_who_is_dr_isis.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/b1fKvCzdg7c" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255548577929"><id gr:original-id="http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/2009/10/14/on-story-telling">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f576e82c57a9f432</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="talks"/><category term="powerpoint"/><category term="boots"/><title type="html">On story-telling</title><published>2009-10-14T19:17:11Z</published><updated>2009-10-14T19:17:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/2009/10/14/on-story-telling" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://blogs.nature.com/rpg/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve got to give a talk tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the best traditions of scientific conferencing the abstract submitted a month ago bears little relationship to what I’m actually going to say. (And in that tradition: What &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; I going to say? It’s only because I had to upload some slides to their server this afternoon that I even have my slides ready.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in recognition that I’m now &lt;del&gt;Mr&lt;/del&gt; Dr Corporate, and that I’ll be addressing internet librarians &lt;em&gt;internationale&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve decided against wearing my Levi’s with the RM Williams. I’ll still wear the boots, but smart trousers instead of jeans. By the way, don’t buy RM Williams boots if you can avoid it. They look good, but the build quality is surprisingly disappointing. I think they’re designed for riding dingoes around all day and shooting kangaroos, rather than walking to walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where was I? Oh yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks given from the corporate side of the fence are subtly difference from those you might give as an academic, when you describe your research. For starters, unless you’re giving a terribly boring presentation on sales or ROIs or whatever, you &lt;del&gt;can just make shit up&lt;/del&gt; have quite a bit of freedom in how you present, and indeed what you’re presenting. Your standard scientific talk takes a problem, gives you some background, describes what you did to answer the problem, shows some data and presents your conclusion (which is usually ‘it didn’t work’ or ‘we need to do more experiments’, or most frequently ‘give me a job. Please’).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have materials, methods, data or conclusions. I’ve got an interesting problem, sure, but it’s more ‘oh, here’s a fly-infested ointment; what’s being done about it and how might we tackle it?‘. It’s not ‘gizza job’, nor even ‘buy our product’, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to it. Even if I have to dress a little smarter than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are principles that apply equally to academic and corporate talks, such as the ‘10-20-30’ rule, the ’don’t talk to the screen’ rule and the ‘my God but Powerpoint is complete &lt;em&gt;crap&lt;/em&gt;, isn’t it?’ rule. But I was reminded of one rule in particular a couple of days ago, when I received a really lovely Facebook message from a student back in Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.usyd.edu.au/labrats/2008/11/like_wow_1.html"&gt;Nurse Donovan&lt;/a&gt; said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:7pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;RPG&lt;/span&gt; you have left a lasting mark on me:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:7pt"&gt;Once at mmb you came and looked over my shoulder at the slides i was making for my lab talk, and you said “the title of your slide should always be the conclusion of the slide”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:7pt"&gt;And I have never been able to forget it!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:7pt"&gt;That’s not to say that all my slides now have great punchy all-conclusive titles, but it means that now when i make a slide that has some sort of an airy-fairy title or (slide-god forbid) an ellipsis, i feel this nagging sense of guilt…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:7pt"&gt;Just thought i’d share that with you because i’m making some slides right now and there you were haunting me again!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:7pt"&gt;Hope you’re great!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t that totally brilliant? I may be gone, but my &lt;del&gt;smell&lt;/del&gt; influence lingers on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And tomorrow, I’m going to totally break my own rule. Rather than show each slide with a conclusion, episodic-like, I’m going to continue something I started experimenting with in Sydney, and managed to pull off in Nantwich. That is, I’m going to stand there and tell a story, and going to use the slides behind me to illustrate what I’m saying, rather than being the focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to tell a story. With pictures.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Richard Grant</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/posts.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/posts.rss</id><title type="html">Confessions of a (former) Lab Rat</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.nature.com/rpg/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255548445555"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/cognitivedaily/~3/Himlgg_E1VY/in_which_i_resist_writing_the.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/48783f9dd0b397a5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">In which I resist writing the obvious headline</title><published>2009-10-14T14:23:09Z</published><updated>2009-10-14T14:23:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/AWjYaoDdjlg/in_which_i_resist_writing_the.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/cognitivedaily/~3/Himlgg_E1VY/in_which_i_resist_writing_the.php"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">I've just read an engrossing report about some very promising research in a an exciting field. The researchers combined fMRI research with genetic analysis to see if they could identify a genetic basis for anger. And they actually found something quite interesting.

If I was writing for the New York Times, the headline might read something like this: "Researchers identify gene responsible for regulating anger." For the Washington Post, it could be "Is there an anger gene?" For the New York Post, perhaps simply "RAGE GENE FOUND."

But those headlines, while they are in some ways accurate, don't really tell the whole story. A team led by Martin Reuter was intrigued by findings linking the gene for a protein, DARPP-32, with antisocial and addictive behaviors. DARPP-32 is involved in regulating the dopamine signaling pathway in the brain. When the brain has elevated dopamine levels, it has a lower threshold for anger and aggression, so DARPP-32 may be the key to understanding why some people are quicker to anger than others.

The gene that encodes DARPP-32 has been fully sequenced, and a variation in just one tiny section of the gene, it turns out, may have a direct impact on human behavior. A gene sequence is simply a string of nucleotides. There are four possible nucleotides, represented by the letters C, T, A, and G. In DARPP-32, just two nucleotides are related to the antisocial and addictive behaviors. Out of a long string of nucleotides, it turns out, it matters a lot whether one set of two particular elements is CC, CT, or TT. But does it directly affect anger?

&lt;p&gt;We all like to laugh at the woo. Particularly when the woo causes epic fails. That said, there are some things its probably not okay to  laugh at. Like, say, homeopathic dead babies, which is to say babies who died due to the application of homeopathy, not a single dead baby  in a whole bunch of water whose molecules will gain the memory of post  mortem infantility. Possibly a bad example. Regardless, for most of us  there are things we wont joke about, either because real damage has been done, or because the joke undermines the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; different. As some of you may know, every week during the academic year, I send out an electronic newsletter to Zoology students at Manchester University, past and present, and to another hundred or so interested people. I just sent out the latest issue of the Z-letter, and one of my readers – Jerry Coyne – replied from Guatemala, or wherever: “Post this WHOLE THING on my website!  Including the stuck skunk!” So here you are… If any of you want to subscribe to the Z-letter, send a mail to: cobb at manchester dot ac dot uk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the latest Z-letter, with everything from a stuck skunk video to ideas about how morality evolved, including rapping about natural selection… Don’t forget to send in your links! 288 subscribers now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OPPOSING SLAVERY WITH DARWIN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Moore, co-author of the recent book “Darwin’s Sacred Cause: Race, Slavery and the Quest for Human Origins”, will be giving a talk about his fascinating discoveries underlying Darwin’s motivations. Everyone is welcome - the talk will be in Roscoe B lecture Theatre, on Brunswick Street, at 5:30pm on Tuesday 20 October. Anyone with any interest in Darwin should go to what will be an excellent talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=========================================&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAPPING WITH DARWIN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first heard about this Darwin-themed event at the Manchester Museum, I was very doubtful – “evolution presented in the style of Eminem”. But Henry McGhie of the Museum, who’s been heavily involved with it, assures me that it really is fantastic. Baba Brinkman explores the history of Darwin’s theory combining hilarious remixes of popular rap songs with clever lyrical storytelling that covers Natural Selection, Sexual Selection, Evolutionary Psychology, and much more. Friday 23 October at 6pm in the Museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.babasword.com/"&gt;http://www.babasword.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=========================================&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE END OF THE LINE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new documentary about the fishing industry which was mentioned in the last Z-letter will be shown on More4 at 10:00pm on Tuesday October 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHY SPONGES ARE ANIMALS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to address this issue in my second year lecture this morning. I was so amazed by some of the stuff I uncovered while researching the talk that I had to blog about it as Jerry Coyne’s guest blogger. See whether you’re equally convinced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REMOTE CONTROLLED BEETLES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to check the date on this one, but no, it’s not date-stamped 1 April. US researchers at Berkeley are apparently able to radio control giant beetles (up to 20cm long) using electrodes implanted when the beetle was a grub. They can be “flown” round a room using a laptop. Although undoubtedly macabre, it isn’t quite so amazing as it sounds, as the electrodes are implanted into the muscles, not the brain. Stimulating the wing muscles on one side rather than the other would make the animal turn. Controlling the neuronal activity leading to that movement would be a lot more difficult, indeed impossible given our current knowledge. &lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[EDIT - How wrong I was! Now I have been able to read the original article - see below, they did indeed plant electrodes into the beetle's brain, which controlled flight initiation (wing flapping) and elevation (presumably a function of wing vibration speed). Amazing!]&lt;/span&gt; However, there are alarming implications of this work, which is being funded by the US military… Sheffield’s Professor Neil Starkey is particularly concerned by this. The work is &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;allegedly&lt;/span&gt; reported in &lt;a href="http://frontiersin.org/integrativeneuroscience/paper/10.3389/neuro.07/024.2009/"&gt;Frontiers in INTEGRATIVE Neuroscience &lt;/a&gt;(open access, includes movies!) &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt; but I can’t find the original article…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the EZNews produced by John Altrincham (Leeds): Cameras fitted to albatrosses show that they follow killer whales, perhaps to take advantage of fish flushed to the surface. They also appear to dive in the company of other albatrosses and dive surprisingly infrequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE EVOLUTION OF MORALITY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an issue that Darwin (again) was fascinated by, and which is growing in importance. There’s an excellent site by Douglas Allchin of the University of Minnesota which effectively functions as a textbook on the question. Essential reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LIFE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Moment of many people’s week will have been the new BBC natural history series, Life, narrated (but not filmed) by David Attenborough. I found the music incredibly irritating, overblown and unnecessary, but the images are absolutely stunning. (The flying fish were my favourite.) If you’re in the UK, you can still watch it again on line at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE STRESS OF BEING A PREY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the footage in the first episode of Life was devoted to predation, with scenes of prey animals being chased by hungry predators. What are the physiological effects of such stress on prey animals? An article in a recent issue of Journal of Animal Ecology looks at snowshoe hares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE VEGETARIAN SPIDER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promised about a month ago by Geoff North, editor of Current Biology and assiduous Z-letter reader, this news of a salticid spider from Central America that is vegetarian. Or nearly. Its primary food are small tender shots of acacia leaves, which are guarded by ants as part of an ant-plant mutualism. The spider can jump over the ants and get the buds. Quite amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MASSIVE DINO PRINTS FOUND IN FRANCE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge set of dino prints, covering several hectares, has been found in Eastern France. Some of the sauropod traces are over *two metres* wide. That doesn’t mean that the dino’s feet were that wide, of course. The way that prints are preserved in gloopy mud often means that they are much broader than the animal’s feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments in &lt;em&gt;Salazar v.

&lt;p&gt;I loved “America may be a deeply Christian nation, but people of all faiths are welcome here to worship Jesus in their own way.”  (This is silly, but often used with ‘God’ replacing ‘Jesus’.  Suddenly it’s not quite as absurd, is it?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colbert, riffing on Justice Scalia, also made a point to say “Since [the cross] represents everybody, shouldn’t we use it to represent every religion?  Or symbolize no religion!  Atheists can have crosses too – they can use them to replace whatever traditionally represents their lack of belief!” as the side text read “A Smug Look?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autumn is starting to get nasty in Sweden, and immediately the Fake Advertising Mom pops up on billboards and in magazines. Sometimes she's even part of a Fake Advertising Family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what I mean. I don't claim 100% accuracy, but I believe I can usually tell on sight whether a woman has given birth and nursed a baby or not. It's part of the difference between girls and women. There is also the simple issue of at what age women usually have kids in the West. So when the travel agencies want to illustrate parenthood and show us a cute 7-y-o kid being held by a really pretty, pert, skinny woman in her late 20s, I just shake my head. It's obvious. They stick a kid model onto the lap of a grownup female model who has no kids, and sometimes they also equip the pair with a grinning hunk of a male model with good hair, playing dad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/10/fake_advertising_mom/Part2_solomedbarn.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Part2_solomedbarn.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere outside the picture frame is the kid's real mom. She's not in her 20s and she has given birth and has nursed and is probably not skinny, though most likely pretty too, and she has the build of a woman. During the photo shoot she's probably sitting around with the kid's dad whose hair is going and who isn't skinny either. I'd be more open to buying a ticket if the ads featured real families instead.&lt;/p&gt;

K. Ann's &lt;em&gt;Cracking the Chinese Puzzles&lt;/em&gt;.  It was written by Alison Matthews ("a statistician who has worked in the oil, aviation, tourism, medical and software industries") and Laurence Matthews (author of books that claim to help you find Chinese characters fast) and is called &lt;em&gt;Learning Chinese Characters:  A revolutionary new way to learn and remember the 800 most basic Chinese characters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the Matthews' miraculous tome on Google books &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YweFHwPd05EC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=tuttle+learning+chinese+characters#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you start leafing through the book, as I did, you will find on any given page hilarious explanations such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"tree 木 + several 几 = machine 机":  It took &lt;strong&gt;several trees&lt;/strong&gt; to provide enough wood to make the parts for the huge &lt;strong&gt;machine&lt;/strong&gt;.            &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is accompanied by a picture of a wooden contraption behind which are four trunks of trees that have been felled and beyond that three trees that are still standing.  Whereas the Matthewses gushingly enjoin us to "see how the 'several trees' have indeed been felled to make the large 'machine' that is taking shape," this is actually a pictophonetic (or semantosyllabic) character in which MU4 is the semantic indicator and JI1 (not JI3 ["several") is the phonophore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"wrap  勹 + a drop 丶 = ladle 勺":  When he had &lt;strong&gt;wrap&lt;/strong&gt;ped it up he put a &lt;strong&gt;drop&lt;/strong&gt; of perfume on the package even though there was only a &lt;strong&gt;ladle&lt;/strong&gt; inside.         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tortuous explanation is accompanied by a picture of two hands in front of a belly; the right one is holding a perfume dropper out of which has come a drop of perfume that is wiggling in mid-air, while the left hand is holding the handle of a ladle that is wrapped in cloth or paper and tied with a string.  The ladle appears to be resting on a flat surface, or possibly partially submerged underwater.  In fact, this character goes back to the period of the oracle bones (earliest stage of the writing system, circa 1200 BC), at which time it depicted a ladle with a drop of liquid in it.  At the time of its creation, the character had absolutely nothing to do with "wrapping"; the idea of "wrapping" is an artifact of a later stage of evolution when the ladle was transformed into what became Kangxi radical 20 勹.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just the first two characters that I happened to turn to as I perused the book.  Looking further, I find that there are even more outlandish explanations for many other characters.  If one tried to use this method to learn 8 characters, it might work, but if one attempted to learn all of the 800 characters in the book this way, it would be a horribly frustrating experience.  If one did not go insane in the process, at the very least one would have lost hundreds, if not thousands, of hours in vain hopes of mastering the strokes, sounds, and meanings of so many characters in this absurd fashion.  And, if one should ever be so foolhardy as to try to employ the method of the Matthewses to learn 8,000 characters, one would certainly go stark, raving mad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pity anyone into whose hands this book falls and who actually tries to learn the characters by using it.  The only thing it will do for you is turn your brain into mush.&lt;/p&gt;

Or rather, he's won the right to appeal a previous loss in court.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Last May, Sir David Eady &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1426"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that a passage in Singh's article "&lt;a href="http://svetlana14s.narod.ru/Simon_Singhs_silenced_paper.html"&gt;Beware the spinal trap&lt;/a&gt;" was a statement of fact rather than a comment, and also that when Singh wrote that  the BCA "happily promotes bogus treatments", he accused the BCA of conscious dishonesty, not just of, well, promoting bogus treatments, i.e. treatments that don't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Addressing Mr Justice Eady's previous judgement in the case, Lord Justice Laws said Eady had arguably risked swinging the balance of rights too far in favour of the right to reputation and against the right to free expression. Lord Justice Laws said Eady's judgement, centred on Singh's use of the word "bogus" in an article published by the Guardian newspaper, could be seen as "legally erroneous".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now Singh gets to appeal Eady's rulings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255545494929"><id gr:original-id="http://climatechange.thinkaboutit.eu/think2/post/irreversible_climate_changes/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/710505b6f935bfef</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Benno Hansen - Predictions of irreversible, unavoidable climate changes</title><published>2009-10-14T13:35:08Z</published><updated>2009-10-14T13:35:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/RrfvzxL7DAI/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://climatechange.thinkaboutit.eu/think2/post/irreversible_climate_changes/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Scientists have summed up those climate changes that are both adverse, unavoidable, irreversible and pretty much certainly going to happen....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pair of otherwise distinguished physicists have suggested that the hypothesized Higgs boson, which physicists hope to produce with the collider, might be so abhorrent to nature that its creation would ripple backward through time and stop the collider before it could make one, like a time traveler who goes back in time to kill his grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except for one thing: the proponents of this idea are operating in the world of pure speculation, and have no evidence to support it, yet. That tells me that I'm best off provisionally rejecting it. I'll start incorporating crazy counter-intuitive notions about the nature of the universe when the cold implacable hand of the universe starts shoving them down my throat, not before!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trinda Barocas is accused of trying to get a non-verbal student with severe peanut allergies to eat a peanut candy bar, so that he will be so unwell as to not go on a field trip.  Details below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sylvia Tangle was found guilty of giving a student with autism a hot-sauce-laced soda, &amp;quot;to teach him a lesson&amp;quot;.  Details below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
Trinda Barocas&lt;/strong&gt;, as reported by the &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091010/ap_on_re_us/us_candy_bar_lawsuit"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; ,  &lt;a href="http://www.theindychannel.com/news/18980284/detail.html"&gt;The Indy Channel &lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.wthr.com/Global/story.asp?s=11287249&amp;amp;clienttype=printable"&gt;WTHR. &lt;/a&gt; In the 2008-2009 academic year, Trinda Barocas had Anita Young&amp;#39;s son in her classroom (his name has not been released). The child, then 7, had autism and was largely non-verbal. In addition, the boy had a severe peanut allergy, suffering hives and swelling if he so much as touched a peanut.  In March, it is alleged that Barocas gave the child a &lt;a href="http://www.hersheys.com/products/details/mrgoodbar.asp"&gt;Mr. Goodbar &lt;/a&gt;(a chocolate and peanut confection), in the hopes that the  boy would then be too ill to go on a scheduled field trip.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;She gave him the Mr. Goodbar candy bar in an attempt to keep him from going on a field trip to the Indianapolis Zoo,&amp;quot; said Ron Frazier, the family&amp;#39;s attorney.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Frazier says that&amp;#39;s just the beginning of the abuse Young&amp;#39;s son endured at the hands of Barocas.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;She pinched him, that she put him in a room that she called his &amp;#39;office&amp;#39; and she left him there for extended periods of time,&amp;quot; he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

{snip}
&lt;p&gt;
According to a report from Child Protective Services, provided to Eyewitness News by Frazier, three separate teachers&amp;#39; aides came forward in March, claiming Barocas mistreated two students. One of them being Young&amp;#39;s son.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;He had no way of communicating to me that he was being hurt at school,&amp;quot; Young said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The school district said, in a statement, they learned of the alleged abuse last March 16 and called CPS. Three days later, Barocas was put on administrative leave. The district says Barocas told the school in February she would resign at the end of the year for unrelated reasons.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From the Associated Press:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A lawsuit filed by the boy&amp;#39;s mother, Anita Young, alleges that special education teacher Trinda Barocas told a classroom aide that the boy would likely misbehave and &amp;quot;maybe he could be sick enough not to attend and we won&amp;#39;t have to deal with it.&amp;quot; Young said her son, Jacob, who is mostly nonverbal, gets hives and experiences swelling if he merely touches peanuts.
&lt;/p&gt;

{snip}
&lt;p&gt;
The lawsuit said one classroom aide told school officials that Barocas treated the boy like a &amp;quot;caged animal&amp;quot; by keeping him for hours in a cubicle that should have been used for short times alone. Barocas also was accused of pinching the boy, standing on his foot so he could not move his leg and grabbing him by the arm to drag him around the classroom.
&lt;/p&gt;
 {snip}
&lt;p&gt;
The DCS report said aides also claimed Barocas hit a 9-year-old girl with Down syndrome on the lips in an attempt to make her pull her tongue back into her mouth. Barocas told DCS officials that she would tap the girl with two fingers on her mouth as a physical prompt. Barocas said it was a therapeutic technique, not abuse.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In 2007, Barocas was placed on administrative leave in Franklin Community Schools after a nurse told a child&amp;#39;s mother that she saw Barocas force-feed the girl, slap her and improperly restrain her, according to The Indianapolis Star. Authorities cleared Barocas in that case. &amp;quot;I did not, will not and would not hurt a child in my care,&amp;quot; Barocas told the newspaper at the time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Sylvia Tangle&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.justnews.com/news/21062762/detail.html"&gt;Just News&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.cfnews13.com/News/Local/2009/9/23/teacher_spikes_autistic_students_soda_with_hot_sauce.html"&gt;CFNews13.com&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/state/content/state/epaper/2009/10/08/1008hotteacher.html"&gt;Palm Beach Post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nbc33tv.com/news/teacher-sentenced-200-hours-community-service"&gt;NBCTV33.com&lt;/a&gt; -- this is more confusing. Some reports say that Ms. Tangle put hot sauce in a soda and gave the soda to one of her students, a child with autism, to teach him not to grab her soda off her desk. (What&amp;#39;s a can of soda doing in the classroom, anyway?) Other reports have Ms. Tangle saying that she &amp;quot;always&amp;quot; put hot sauce in her sodas, and the child helped himself to the drink. In any case, a student with autism inadvertently consumed hot sauce in soda, and Ms. Tangle put the hot sauce in the soda. She was convicted of abuse, but not sentenced to jail. She is on two years&amp;#39; probation and must serve 100 (200?) hours of community service. Some parents are upset that she didn&amp;#39;t get jail time.</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255540036561"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/wednesday_morning_jams.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ef9b0a35565473d0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Ass Shaking Jams"/><title type="html">Wednesday Morning Jams</title><published>2009-10-14T15:43:02Z</published><updated>2009-10-14T15:43:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/ibdi2FdENYk/wednesday_morning_jams.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/wednesday_morning_jams.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think this might be my new favorite song.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Ong"&gt;Olivia Ong&lt;/a&gt; is a Chinese Singaporean singer who first became popular in Japan.

First, years ago, they loudly proclaimed their religious beliefs. Then when they got smacked hard in the courtrooms when they wanted to teach religion in schools, they evolved: they changed their snake oil to Intelligent Design and tried again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/11/12/heroes-of-dover/"&gt;again they got whooped&lt;/a&gt;. ID was shown to be creationism in disguise — what some might call a bald-faced lie — so that again fundamentalists could attempt to teach religion in the classroom, despite the Constitution of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have wondered aloud what they would do next. After all, when facts are slippery things, able to be misused as openly and ridiculously as so many creationists do, then clearly they won’t just give up. They’ll move on to the next deceptive technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I have to wonder if we’re starting to see it. Could this new tactic be: &lt;em&gt;telling the truth?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Fish of the blog &lt;a href="http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/10/12/answers-in-genesis-takes-on-black-holes/"&gt;World of Weird Things&lt;/a&gt; clued me in to a post on the execrable Answers In Genesis website talking about black holes. &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/am/v3/n1/black-holes-evidence" rel="nofollow"&gt;In this essay&lt;/a&gt;, creationist astronomer Jason Lisle discusses the topic with clarity and actual accuracy. He uses decent analogies, doesn’t let them run away from him, and makes a good case for the existence of black holes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wha wha &lt;em&gt;whaaaa?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in the end, he says this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black holes provide an observable confirmation of Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Such physics is the basis for several young-universe cosmologies, which allow light from the most distant galaxies to reach earth in thousands of years or less. Scientific discoveries, such as black holes, are not only interesting, but they give us a small glimpse into the thoughts of an infinite God (Psalm 19:1). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, he certainly drops the ball there, letting it fall down (ha! haha!) a black hole. Cosmologies which abuse basic physics to change enough to allow a young Universe &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/c-decay.html"&gt;tend to be wrong in their basic assumptions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the point here is that the article itself is pretty much factually correct, making me wonder what’s going on here. Maybe the folks at AiG are hoping that by writing an article &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; filled with fallacious reasoning, they’ll reap the benefits of Google links (though not from me, since I put a &lt;a href="http://skeptools.wordpress.com/2008/09/03/not-just-for-spam-anymore-nofollow-for-skepticism/"&gt;rel=nofollow&lt;/a&gt; in the above link to the site). It’s hard to say. But given the sheer amount of nonsense on their site, it’s hard to ascribe noble motives to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let me add an irony: on that page is a description of dark matter. I find that humorous, because dark matter was originally proposed to solve the mystery of how individual galaxies in clusters can move so quickly but still stay bound to the cluster itself. The gravity from the visible matter in the cluster was too weak to hold on to such rapidly-moving galaxies, and therefore, if the clusters are to not fly apart &lt;em&gt;over the age of the Universe&lt;/em&gt;, there must be invisible matter holding them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So dark matter was originally proposed because we know the Universe is old. Of course, now we know that dark matter has influence all over the place, and would have been found even if we hadn’t studied clusters. But the irony still tickles me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what do we do here? Well, if creationists want to actually describe the Universe for what it really is, then I guess we let them… as long as they do so, pardon the pun, faithfully. But as soon as they step over that broad, broad line into territory clearly denied by the evidence, then they need to be called on it. &lt;/p&gt;

Less pointing out the obvious. More actual analysis (not that I’m qualified 2 judge just my opin)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, confession first. I got (and very much unwarranted, I feel, since people commenting on my site have been less than complimentary!) a very &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; Facebook message from one of the people from &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/hungrybeast/"&gt;Hungry Beast&lt;/a&gt;, who apparently reads these blog entries. That is flattering (they find the time?) and yet also makes me go aghrhhhhhhpeoplearereadingthisarggggggg…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’ll still be writing what I think about the program regardless of any nice messages. I will not be distracted even by liberal application of hair gel or even Liberal Party narcissists. Hungry Beasts must be fed with constructive feedback and that’s my goal! Or maybe I’ll just be a bitch, I haven’t made my mind up just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed that &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/desdev/statuses/4858850323"&gt;one other Twitter commentator online&lt;/a&gt; has recognised the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFxYIpGfwfU"&gt;Blah Blah Blah&lt;/a&gt; kinship that this show is developing. Perhaps I’m being unoriginal (and showing my 80s heritage and all that gaff), but I think this is a good thing, tending towards a quasi-overarching theme for a show. The ’strange, silly, serious - all lumped together’ comment - that’s a kind of mission statement about where this show is taking us, which I felt was lacking before. Nice new opening sequence too, gives a better sense of the ‘team’, without the distracting labels of ‘&lt;em&gt;She’s a website something-or-other! …Yuh huh, so I can blame you for X?&lt;/em&gt;‘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, Daniel K’s hair (and the pants and now a nice glossy blue suit) is clearly now a feature. You better work it, baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masters of Outrage segment, about the way the media works - much like the “&lt;em&gt;signed, Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells&lt;/em&gt;” stereotype that has existed since quill was put to parchment. The outrage becomes a living monster in itself that is fed by the furor - and thus, it’s much like the &lt;a href="http://img245.imageshack.us/img245/6112/villagepond.gif"&gt;infamous Leunig cartoon&lt;/a&gt; pictured here. Yet I’m wondering what is meant by ‘cleaning up’ with the punchline - are people really making a profit out of this, when many of us may not actually buy the newspaper that is selling the story and instead may just visit the websites / chat on a forum board / talk by the water-cooler? Is that ‘cleaning up’, profitable? Unsure.&lt;a href="http://img245.imageshack.us/img245/6112/villagepond.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" src="http://img245.imageshack.us/img245/6112/villagepond.gif" alt="" width="288" height="219"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d say that the Post-Race Rap and the Monique’s talking-heads actors (using quotes from www.blogs.news.com) were very much a highlight of the ‘&lt;em&gt;we might not be as tolerant a country as we think we are&lt;/em&gt;‘ theme. This really worked for me. I did say in my look at the first episode that I kept thinking back to the ‘topics’ in Denton’s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Money_or_the_Gun"&gt;Money or the Gun&lt;/a&gt;. Somehow, unlike the other two shows I reviewed (&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2009/09/hungry-beast-abc-tv-that-could-b-better/"&gt;episodes one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2009/10/hungry-beast-episode-two-beauty-and-the-argh-the-hair-the-hair/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, this episode really had more of a sense of cohesiveness, despite continuing to feature the different slices of social and comic commentary throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…Post-Race rap also kind of reminded me of this 90s D-Gen sketch, btw:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TevK9qFFKo"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TevK9qFFKo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Things We Think Might Be Bullshit’ - nice segment, hell of a lot of potential that is already being tapped into with the ‘Follow the Money’ breaks and the like (oh, don’t forget that 2009 is also the Year of Astronomy, thanks!) However, what I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think is tending towards being solid BS is the Victoria Dynamite segment, as when it gets so ha-ha self-referential with ‘that was a &lt;em&gt;visual gag&lt;/em&gt;‘, it stinks of the desperate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, the ‘battleground segment’ is still a bit twee. A topic more serious than panda-hate, with a faux-lesbian discussion - but I’m still wondering if they get much feedback on it? I think it could be used a little more effectively if that’s meant to be an attention-grabbing ‘viewer feedback’ initiative, perhaps with more challenging topics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Site is being pimped more - will feature new stories and more across the week, cool. And yes, work on the hair… but not too much, it’s already starting to influence planetary orbit with its fluffiness.&lt;/p&gt;

If there are any of my readers who happen to be surgeons attending the meeting, drop me a line and maybe we can get together. In the meantime, here's a blast from the past from the past. This post first reared its ugly head almost exactly three years ago; so if you haven't been reading at least three years, it's new to you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It seems like only yesterday that I was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/10/the_trouble_with_deepak_chopra_part_2.php"&gt;fisking&lt;/a&gt; yet another piece of seriously irritating woo from that expert purveyor of woo, &lt;a href="http://www.intentblog.com"&gt;Deepak Chopra&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, it was only yesterday that I was fisking part two of Chopra's woo-filled &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/search/?query=the+trouble+with+genes+chopra"&gt;The Trouble With Genes&lt;/a&gt; series. As I mentioned in my previous fisking, I had thought that Dr. Chopra might lay low for a while, and was surprised that he popped up again so soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So color me even more surprised that Chopra wasted no time in wading back in again with yet more of his tradmark brand of woo (which I like to call Choprawoo) in a post entitled &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/the-trouble-with-genes-p_b_31805.html"&gt;The Trouble With Genes, Part 3&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="http://www.intentblog.com/archives/2006/10/the_trouble_wit_2.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Given that, I thought it best simply to title this piece as part 3. Don't worry, I don't plan on wasting too much more time examining the pseudoscientific mystical blather of Chopra. After all, Chopra provides so much material that I could devote the entire blog to fisking his nonsense, but I suspect that such an endeavor would rapidly become tiresome, causing my visit count to plunge like a stone tossed off the Empire State Building. But, for whatever perverse reason, I feel like plunging once more into the breech and looking at this third part of Chopra's "speculations" because once again he makes me wonder if he actually learned anything in medical school. I promise to try to lay off for a while after this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_trouble_with_deepak_chopra_part_iii.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_trouble_with_deepak_chopra_part_iii.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/taTG3iawaW0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255538962413"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/q_a_the_shape_of_things.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/90c42c036a2ab2f6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Q &amp; A"/><title type="html">Q &amp;amp; A: The Shape of Things</title><published>2009-10-14T17:02:02Z</published><updated>2009-10-14T17:02:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/q_a_the_shape_of_things.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's only natural to wonder &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; things are the ways that they are.  Take a look at our Solar System, for example.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_the_shape_of_things/solar_system1.jpg" width="500" height="314" title="Doesn&amp;#39;t look so shapely to you?  Bulge + disc, and that&amp;#39;s all you need to know." alt="solar_system1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central bulge with planets, moons, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/all_the_junk_in_our_solar_syst.php"&gt;whatnot&lt;/a&gt; moving in a disc around it.  Is this the way things have to be?  My friend Rich, a chemist, asks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It seems that all the objects in our solar system orbit the sun in nearly the same plane. Why is that? Why doesn't the solar system have spherical symmetry?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;In particular, Rich wants to know why our Solar System doesn't look more like this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_the_shape_of_things/atom.jpg" width="500" title="Neils Bohr would be so proud..." alt="atom.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Solar System is definitely not shaped like a sphere; it definitely is a bulge at the center with a disc on the outskirts.  Well, I tried googling for bulge and disc and &lt;a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;resnum=0&amp;amp;q=bulge%20disc&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;tab=wi"&gt;this was all I got&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this shape, bulge + disc, is one of the most common in the Universe.  In fact, we can look at scales much smaller than the Solar System, such as the gas giants, and what do we find?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_the_shape_of_things/saturn_rings.jpg" width="500" title="Bulge + disc... what more could you ask for?" alt="saturn_rings.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bulge at the center (the planet), with a disc -- rings and many moons -- orbiting it.  Saturn's rings are the most spectacular, but Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune all have them, and they're all in the same plane as most of their massive moons.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why look smaller than the Solar System?  Why not look at galaxies too?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_the_shape_of_things/57%20-%20NGC4565%20LRGB%201d.preview.jpg" width="500" title="Even galaxies get in on the bulge + disc action." alt="57 - NGC4565 LRGB 1d.preview.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This famous "spiral" shape, when viewed edge-on, is clearly &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; just a bulge and a disc.  So this shape that Rich is asking about is actually very, very common.  How did we get stuck with this?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bulge part is easy: &lt;b&gt;gravity&lt;/b&gt;.  All of us -- planets, solar systems, and galaxies -- form from gravitational collapse.  You take a big blob of mass, you let gravity do its thing, and it collapses down as best it can.  But these initial blobs are never perfect spheres.  The stuff that forms galaxies looks like this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_the_shape_of_things/cosmological_structure_formation.jpg" width="500" title="How can this stuff ever collapse down to form a galaxy?  Oh right, billions of years and gravity..." alt="cosmological_structure_formation.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the stuff that forms stars looks like this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_the_shape_of_things/56518main_MM_image_feature_141_jw4.jpg" width="500" title="An actual star-forming region, instead of a simulation (like for the galaxies) above." alt="56518main_MM_image_feature_141_jw4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the initial shape is not a perfect sphere.  You have three dimensions to play with, and it's always shortest in one dimension and longest in another.  We have a fancy name for shapes like this -- a triaxial ellipsoid -- but it's just a sphere that's stretched and crunched like so.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_the_shape_of_things/Fig.T020-TriaxialEllipsoid.jpg" width="500" title="Triaxial ellipsoid, your friend and mine, and progenitor of us all." alt="Fig.T020-TriaxialEllipsoid.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the diagram above, the &lt;i&gt;blue&lt;/i&gt; direction is the shortest.  Newton's gravity is good enough to tell us that the shortest direction collapses the fastest, while the largest directions take longer to collapse down.  But the galaxy, the solar system, and even the region where planets form are full of normal matter.  What happens when you run two blobs of matter (or two halves of one blob of matter) into each other at high speeds?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_the_shape_of_things/splat1.gif" width="500" title="And it makes a &amp;#39;splat&amp;#39; sound!" alt="splat1.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes, they go "SPLAT!"  But more importantly, they form a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kK6F7t-x6E"&gt;pancake-like&lt;/a&gt; shape.  Now, if gravity were the only thing going on, all of this splatter along the other two axes (the ones that didn't collapse first) would eventually be pulled in towards the center, which means we'd just get a bulge.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's one more piece to the puzzle: &lt;b&gt;things rotate&lt;/b&gt;.  (In physics, we call this &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum#Conservation_of_angular_momentum"&gt;conservation of angular momentum&lt;/a&gt;.)  Galaxies, star systems, and individual planets all rotate, because they all start with some rotational energy, and that remains.  The stuff that doesn't have enough rotational energy collapses inwards, and becomes part of the bulge.  But the stuff that is rotating quickly enough stays on the outskirts, and forms the disc.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_the_shape_of_things/protoplanetary_disk.jpg" width="500" height="340" title="A star system in the early stages of formation." alt="protoplanetary_disk.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So everything -- planets, solar systems, and galaxies -- all form, initially, with this "bulge + disc" shape.  No giant atoms.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;"But wait a minute,"&lt;/b&gt; you might say.  &lt;b&gt;"What about elliptical galaxies?  Aren't they exactly what Rich is asking about?"&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahh, ellipticals.  Galaxies that look, well, like giant Bohr atoms.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_the_shape_of_things/m87_cfht.jpg" width="500" title="M87, my old friend, and the biggest elliptical galaxy in town." alt="m87_cfht.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They didn't form this way!  The way you make an elliptical galaxy is by taking two or more "normal" (i.e., spiral) galaxies and smacking them into each other.  The stuff that results from this collision is elliptically shaped, as you can see for yourself.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/RBFc1ldP_Ps%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x402061%26color2%3D0x9461ca%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;b&gt;no&lt;/b&gt;, Rich.  Apparently, there are no solar systems out there &lt;i&gt;that we know of&lt;/i&gt; that look like atoms.  They all form these bulge + disc structures, and the only way to change that (that we know of so far) is to run them into other bulge + disc structures, and hope for the best.

Indeed, one might go so far as to argue that what counts as a “fact” depends on one’s theoretical framework.  (Is “spacetime is curved” a fact?  What if spacetime isn’t fundamental in quantum gravity?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, people sometimes use the word.  A recent &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/nicholas_wade_flails_at_the_ph.php"&gt;post by PZ&lt;/a&gt; reminded me of how it comes up especially in arguments over evolution, which is occasionally accused of being “just a theory.”  I’ve tried to make &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2005/09/19/theories-laws-facts/"&gt;my own view&lt;/a&gt; clear — when we as scientists use these words, we shouldn’t pretend they have some once-and-for-all meanings that were handed down by Francis Bacon when he was putting the finishing touches on the scientific method.  Rather, we should be honest about how they are actually used.  “Theory,” in particular, isn’t cleanly separate from words like “law” or “hypothesis” or “model,” and doesn’t have any well-defined status on the spectrum from obviously false to certainly true.  And “fact” — well, that’s a word scientists hardly use at all.  We use words like “data” or “evidence,” but the concept of a “fact” simply isn’t that useful in scientific practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you know what would really be useful here?  Some facts!  Or at least some data.  There’s one repository of professional scientific communication that I know very well — &lt;a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/hep/"&gt;SPIRES&lt;/a&gt;, the high-energy physics literature database run by SLAC.  (My &lt;strike&gt;hypothesis&lt;/strike&gt; guess is that any other field would turn up similar results.)  I don’t know an easy way to search entire papers, but it’s child’s play to search the titles.  So let’s ask it — how often do scientists (as represented by high-energy physicists) use the word “fact”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?rawcmd=FIND+T+fact+or+t+facts&amp;amp;FORMAT=www&amp;amp;SEQUENCE="&gt;find t fact or t facts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
120 records&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, they clearly use the word sometimes.  What about some competitors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/spiface/find/hep/www?rawcmd=t%20data&amp;amp;FORMAT=WWW"&gt;find t data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
9909 records&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha!  Now that’s the kind of word scientists like to use.  And the others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?rawcmd=FIND+T+evidence&amp;amp;FORMAT=www&amp;amp;SEQUENCE="&gt;find t evidence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
4396 records &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?rawcmd=FIND+T+OBSERVATION+or+t+observations&amp;amp;FORMAT=www&amp;amp;SEQUENCE="&gt;find t observation or t observations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
10924 records&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get the picture.  Scientists prefer not to talk about “facts,” because it’s hard to tell what’s a fact and what isn’t.  Science looks at the data, and tries to understand it in terms of hypothetical models, which rise or fall in acceptance as new data are gathered and better theories are proposed.  Just for fun:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?rawcmd=FIND+T+theory&amp;amp;FORMAT=www&amp;amp;SEQUENCE="&gt;find t theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
42285 records &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?rawcmd=FIND+T+model&amp;amp;FORMAT=www&amp;amp;SEQUENCE="&gt;find t model &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
45977 records&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?rawcmd=FIND+T+hypothesis&amp;amp;FORMAT=www&amp;amp;SEQUENCE="&gt;find t hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
578 records&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?rawcmd=FIND+T+law&amp;amp;FORMAT=www&amp;amp;SEQUENCE="&gt;find t law&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1293 records&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It should speak to the commitment of the open source software community that FreeDOS continues under active (if slow) development 15 years after it was conceived.

Credit: Ken Catania  &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;So-called Gene-Culture Co-Evolution can be very obvious and direct or it can be very subtle and complex.  In almost all cases, the details defy the usual presumptions people make about the utility of culture, the nature of human-managed knowledge, race, and technology.  I would like to examine two cases of gene-culture interaction:  One of the earliest post-Darwinian Synthesis examples addressing malaria and sickle-cell disease, and the most recently published example, the worm-grunters of Florida, which it turns out is best explained by direct reference to the man (Darwin) himself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking the worm grunters of Florida is not an example of gene-culture interaction, as far as I know.  But this case study serves as a starting point for a discussion of how traits that "make sense" arise even though the rise of said traits does not necessarily "make sense."  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/cultural_evolution_from_mosqui_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/cultural_evolution_from_mosqui_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/Bgkdeg4lut0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255536689454"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1810">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/569d88e4d26d51ee</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and the media"/><title type="html">The gas of vehement assertion</title><published>2009-10-14T15:50:38Z</published><updated>2009-10-14T15:50:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1810" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the latest &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; (October 12), Tad Friend takes us into the chilling wonderworld of entertainment-business reporting, in a Letter from California, "Call Me: Why Hollywood fears Nikki Finke" (Finke runs the website Deadline Hollywood Daily). Apparently real life in the entertainment business in Hollywood goes beyond the parodies in movies and television shows.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A linguistic point about the business (p. 99):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hollywood's leaders work with the understanding that facts are not fixed pillars but trial balloons that you inflate with the gas of vehement assertion. The truth is always negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There then follows a convoluted story (one of many in Friend's piece), about who said "We are no longer doing movies with women in the lead" and in what circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judge overturned the original judgment by Justice Eady on Simon's use of the word 'bogus' in a Guardian article to describe claims by chiropractors to treat certain childhood illnesses. He said that there was no question of the good faith of the appellant (Simon) who wrote what he honestly believed with the purpose of serving the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laws also questioned whether Eady's ruling could have serious implications for the application of Article 10 of the Human Rights Act, which concerns freedom of expression, and said that there was a disproportionate burden of proof on the appellant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also commented that the 47 pages of written evidence presented in Simon's defence were on the 'voluminous' side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon's case will now go to full appeal, probably in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Josh&lt;/strong&gt; recently got a 33-page letter from his Christian grandma.  It was prompted by Josh’s parents telling her he was an atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read it &lt;a href="http://dipperstove.com/pages1-6.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://dipperstove.com/pages7-12.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://dipperstove.com/pages13-18.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (PDFs).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s just the &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/9tqhp/epic_letter_from_fundamentalist_xtian_grandmother/"&gt;first half&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… She wrote me an epic letter with a dismissal of evolution on theological grounds and tried to scare me back into the fold by talking about how powerful Satan is. Well, I decided to take the time to respond, so I sat down and typed and typed. I finished the letter this afternoon.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the &lt;a href="http://dipperstove.com/letter.pdf"&gt;draft of Josh’s letter here&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He doesn’t intend to be mean at all — he just wants to lay out the facts and explain why he believes what he does.  He even ends it in a respectful way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… I was only able to touch upon a few [of the subjects], and even then I’m sure I could have given more thought to my presentation of them. I expect you to agree with a few points and to firmly disagree with others (I do expect that you will respond), but above all I expect that nothing I have said changes our relationship or the interest we both take in approaching these usually sensitive subjects. I love you! Thanks for reaching out to me and thank you for spending time to understand where I am and how I got here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love,&lt;br&gt;
Josh
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any feedback for him?  He’d love some advice before sending it out to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d be impressed if she read the entire letter and I’m curious what her response would be.  Usually, in these situations (in my experience), the Christians just go back to their standard arguments without even acknowledging what the other person has said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope it works out for Josh’s sake, though.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have recently been listening to women who are practicing yoga asana and they have been told by their teacher (Trika Yoga) that to perform inverted postures so as to prevent menstruation is beneficial to women. They argue that reabsorbing the chemicals produced during menstruation helps to prevent disease and also gives you renewed energy. One lady has practiced this for a year approximately and she says by her own experience that she feels generally more enlivened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, I was intrigued. I have practiced yoga for many years because it keeps me in good shape and helps my back and posture. At the core, yoga is generally good exercise and a healthy practice, if you want to strengthen your muscles and improve your flexibility. However, yoga is also surrounded by mysticism and spirituality and it can be difficult to get the reality when learning about it. I’m very used to glazing over during the talk of ‘oneness with the universe’ and ‘interdependence between mind and spirit’ that you inevitably hear as benefits of yoga. Luckily, you practice yoga on a mat, which is very convenient for nodding off during the boring bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuart’s question, however, was one I hadn’t heard of before.  Most of my yoga instructors have advocated against doing any inverted postures while playing in the Ragtime band. The reasoning was never very clear to me but as far as I could tell, went something along the lines of ‘things will go upside down and be icky.’ Apparently, this yoga teacher was claiming that not only should you perform inverted postures, you should perform a LOT of inversions; so much so that you actually stopped the siege of the Red Army altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I tried to find anything on the interwebs about this practice. Nada. I found nothing that referenced yoga for stopping a girl from trolling for vampires, nothing that said anything about benefits of reabsorbed menstrual chemicals preventing disease. I’m sure this yoga teacher was saying these things; unfortunately, this is so nuts it hasn’t even made it to the internet. Which, I’ll admit, is pretty impressive. I also talked to the always awesome &lt;a href="http://www.skepdoc.info/"&gt;SkepDoc, Harriet Hall&lt;/a&gt;, who checked the PubMed and other sources for any research around this and found nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the research or lack thereof, the facts are that inverted postures are not going to stop your red badge of courage. Although gravity might temporarily slow menstrual flow, as soon as you go back to right side up, the accumulated flow will continue. As to reabsorbing chemicals during Shark Week, again, there doesn’t appear to be any research around this either; it appears to be a new variant on old detoxification myths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also did some research as to whether there is any real danger around doing inverted postures while surfing the crimson wave. This also appears to be a myth. Staying in an inverted posture could slow the menstrual flow due to gravity and could potentially cause additional cramping due to accumulated flow but there doesn’t appear to be any evidence of long term harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the concerns with inversions is that doing an inverted posture while donating to the red cross could cause menstrual tissue to end up in the fallopian tubes and this could cause endometriosis.  This seems to have come from an early theory of the cause of endometriosis which is no longer considered plausible. Most women (90% of women) have “retrograde” menstruation but most &lt;a href="http://www.endo-resolved.com/cause.html"&gt;do not develop endometriosis.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the conclusion? Like most exercise, yoga can help relieve some of the discomfort of composing a period piece. Doing inverted postures doesn’t appear to do any harm, but like with most yoga, listen to your body; if you feel pain, don’t do it. The same is true for most exercise, really.  And if you have excessive cramping or other reactions to any exercise.. yep, you guessed it – check with your doctor; there could be something else going on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Masala Skeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255534002513"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/bmi_tmi_update_11.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/53f83c672c56250d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">BMI TMI update</title><published>2009-10-14T15:40:31Z</published><updated>2009-10-14T15:40:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/Fkt0JJRUmks/bmi_tmi_update_11.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/bmi_tmi_update_11.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm very worried about the change in seasons, and about eating in response to stress.

Now for the first time, we have a common vision to govern the 4.4 million square miles of America’s marine waters: President Obama’s Ocean Policy Task Force has issued science-based recommendations for a national policy to govern, protect, maintain and restore ocean habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should you care? Oceans are important to all of us–not just fishermen and boaters, but snorkelers, sunbathers, divers… even those who may not see the coast on a regular basis. They drive life on our planet. Unless we take responsibility for keeping oceans sound, we’re all in trouble. As the &lt;a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/takeaction/730642026"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Marine Conservation Biology Institute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If adopted, implemented and funded, the recommendations would usher in a new era of ocean management — one based on environmental stewardship. Just imagine the impact we could have if, rather than the hodgepodge of agencies and laws that currently govern oceans, coasts and the Great Lakes, we work together to restore the health of these critical ecosystems!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go visit &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ceq/initiatives/oceans/"&gt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ceq/initiatives/oceans/&lt;/a&gt; and tell the White House Council on Environmental Quality that you support a comprehensive national policy to protect, maintain and restore our oceans and coasts.&lt;/strong&gt; The 30 day comment period ends on the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For inspiration, once again, here’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;My Top Ten List of reasons why oceans are vital:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ocean critters generate a good deal of the oxygen we breathe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re talking 99% of the habitat, 97% of the water, and 71% of surface on the planet!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oceans drive climate and weather through transfer of water and heat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most U.S. commerce travels through the nation’s ports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oceans account for a $20 billion recreational fishing industry… not to mention, a $60 billion annual &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/kcet/wiredscience/blogs/2007/11/are-there-fish-in-our-future-o.html#more"&gt;seafood industry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And we’re talking $8 trillion estimated in oil and gas reserves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They support nearly 50 percent of all species on Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over 50% of our nation’s population lives in coastal counties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oceans mitigate the effects of CO2 in the atmosphere at their own expense… (okay, and &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/kcet/wiredscience/blogs/2007/11/ocean-acidification.html#more"&gt;ultimately ours&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marine animals and plants produce a ton of compounds that prevent and treat human disease.  Like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2007/12/sea_cucumbers_echinoderm_messi.php"&gt;sea cucumbers&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;

href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/11/the_dying_grandma_gambit.php"&gt;Grandma Gambit&lt;/a&gt; — it&amp;#39;s a common tactic used to shut us up. We&amp;#39;re told to keep quiet because our dear sweet devout Grandma couldn&amp;#39;t possibly deal with the news; it would break her heart and you wouldn&amp;#39;t want to do that, would you? What kind of callous rat would hurt a gentle little old lady!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a rather patronizing suggestion that belittles Grandmas everywhere. Both of my grandmothers were feisty types who would have relished a good argument (and one of my grandmothers, who died when I was 12, would probably have just said, &amp;quot;good for you&amp;quot;). Go ahead, break the news to Grandma — it&amp;#39;s much more respectful than treating her like a delicate flower that would wilt at the thought of you not going to church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a more realistic reaction from a Christian grandmother who hears that you've left the faith: an argument, in the form of a &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/9tqhp/epic_letter_from_fundamentalist_xtian_grandmother/"&gt;33 page handwritten letter&lt;/a&gt; which is almost entirely a creationist screed. It's interesting, too, because I see this a lot, that nowadays the response to apostasy is often built around arguments against evolution. There is an expectation that faith is not enough, and that calling the faithful back to the fold is a matter of reasoned argument with 'science' on their side. Unfortunately for them, they don't have any science at all, and Grandma's letter is a series of creationist canards, from the "just a theory" error to the absence of transitional fossils, all wrapped up with bible verses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Grandma wants to talk; what does the grandson do? He &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/9tfg8/epic_letter_to_fundamentalist_xtian_grandmother/?sort=new"&gt;writes back with a 17 page letter, neatly typed, with charts and figures&lt;/a&gt;! Bravo! This is how loving families should deal with faith, by simply caring enough to wrestle with the ideas between them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/the_grandma_gambit_meets_its_m.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/0q9DBnNNXf0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255532790082"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=19717">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/250d7e4be303357e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="football" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><title type="html">Why Play When You Know You'll Win?</title><published>2009-10-14T14:34:18Z</published><updated>2009-10-14T14:34:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/why-play-when-you-know-youll-win/" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/why-play-when-you-know-youll-win/#comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/why-play-when-you-know-youll-win/feed/atom/" type="application/atom+xml"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/wp-atom.php" xml:lang="en" type="html">This season the University of Texas at Austin's football team is scheduled or has already played against such athletic powerhouses as the University of Louisiana-Monroe (59-20), the University of Texas-El Paso (64-7), and the University of Central Florida (on November 7).

It was a tough decision, because a Vietnamese restaurant was a lot more likely to have some grilled chicken-on-a-stick that Alex would eat. But homestyle Chinese favorites were calling, so we went to &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/buyjhgftywy6gtrtgrytyr%20tpo9iuyjgfrgthyuzy7u7y6t5r4e3w2qertyuiop%5B%5Dpoiuuytrewq"&gt;China Village&lt;/a&gt;, an ordinary but great place on Baxter Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we’ve been forcing Alex to taste things at home, it wasn’t that hard to get him to try some crispy dumpling skin — and he liked it! He ate quite a few pieces. We moved onto an order of fried rice (diced pork not a hit) and and chicken with broccoli (sliced chicken fairly successful),  chicken lo mein (sliced chicken a bigger hit). Since Alex once — &lt;em&gt;once &lt;/em&gt;— ate spaghetti at home, I decided to try the noodles. “Watch!” I said. “Twirl! Twirl!” He liked the twirling. I twirled a few strands onto a fork and handed it to him. He ate it — and willingly ate a few more bites. A very successful meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, Alex is eating chocolate ice cream &lt;em&gt;with stuff in it&lt;/em&gt;! This is exciting, because we keep buying something called &lt;a href="https://www.wegmans.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;amp;storeId=10052&amp;amp;productId=572931&amp;amp;catalogId=10002&amp;amp;krypto=QJrbAudPd0vzXUGByeatog%3D%3D&amp;amp;ddkey=http:ProductDisplay"&gt;Chocolate Moose Tracks&lt;/a&gt; that has swirls and bits and chocolate pieces in it, and it’s great that we are all eating the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.talk-early-talk-often.com/special-needs-adult.html"&gt;Talk Often&lt;/a&gt; offers a preparedness primer for a sometimes-overlooked segment  of the special needs population: the adult sibs of special needs adults.  Overlaying the already tricky task of preparations in this group is that parents themselves may not have that long left.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;“It is  essential that you understand and record the smallest details of (your adult  special needs sib’s) daily life,” the site maintains. “You’ll need it in case of  an emergency with your aging parents. Talk to your parents now so that you are  not left without critical information after a crisis.” The site gives  sample questions and conversations for the best preparation, and recommends recording these conversations.&lt;/div&gt;

According to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention, an estimated 33 million (44%) of US Dogs and 51 million (57%) US Cats are Overweight or Obese.

“Pudgy pooches and fat cats are now the norm.” states Dr. Ernie Ward, founder and President of the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention (APOP) in a recent press release. He goes on to suggest that “the majority of today’s overweight pets will endure painful and expensive medical conditions – all of which can be avoided.”...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But by far the majority of galaxies in our group — the majority &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;, really — are dwarfs; small collections of stars and gas with only a few million stars. Lurking just 1.6 million light years away, half the distance to Andromeda, is Barnard’s galaxy, an irregular dwarf with about 10 million stars. Behold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/gallery/d/200830-4/phot-38a-09-fullres.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3503/4008742873_1b3686e318_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[As usual, click to embiggen, or &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/gallery/d/200824-4/phot-38a-09-fullres.tif"&gt;get a ginormous 80 Mb TIF&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the finest near-true color image of Barnard’s galaxy I have ever seen, courtesy of &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2009/pr-38-09.html"&gt;the European Southern Observatory’s 2.2 meter telescope in Chile&lt;/a&gt;… a far cry from the small 12.5 cm (5 inch) refractor Barnard himself used to discover it. Given that this diminutive galaxy is in the direction of Sagittarius — toward the center of our galaxy, which is loaded with stars — it’s incredible Barnard found it at all. In fact, most of the stars in this image are inside the Milky Way, between us and the other galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnard’s Galaxy is not precisely irregular, since it appears to have a bar-like structure across it. The red bubbles are regions where stars are being born in large numbers; the UV and fierce winds of subatomic particles from the massive stars being formed carve out cavities in the gas, creating what look like smoke rings. The red glow is characteristic of hot hydrogen, and is a sure-fire way to know that gas is being excited by the stars nearby. The sharp edges to the bubbles are real, due to the gas piling up as it rams gas in interstellar space in a cosmic snowplow effect. There are over 150 separate bubbles like these in the galaxy, &lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/gallery/album/objects-from/pr2001039a"&gt;some of which have been observed using the Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another feature here that’s not obvious. On the left and right of the galaxy are faint, thick, blue arcs. This is actually gas that’s being blown out by the stars in the center of the galaxy, forming a weak ring surrounding the entire structure. I expect that gas will blow right out of the galaxy entirely; the gravity from the meager number of stars making up Barnard’s Galaxy can’t possibly be enough to restrain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dwarf galaxies are difficult to observe because they are so faint; they fade with distance rapidly, so only nearby ones can be studied in detail. But since they are the most numerous types of galaxy in the Universe, these tiny smudges are well worth studying, and images like this one of Barnard’s Galaxy will help us understand how these galaxies formed, and what they’re made of, and how they behave. We also think that through collisions, these galaxies can grow to become larger, more magnificent ones like our Milky Way, so, as usual, when we study the Universe, looking ever outward, we are actually turning our gaze inwards to learn more about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m hoping I’ll have a lot more to say about it soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I’ve just gotten an email notification that an even bigger scientific publishing event is happening: Timed for the IPCC-Copenhagen Summit, famed climatologist James Hansen will be out with a book entitled &lt;a href="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;p=8&amp;amp;l=as1&amp;amp;asins=1608192008&amp;amp;fc1=000000&amp;amp;IS2=1&amp;amp;lt1=_blank&amp;amp;m=amazon&amp;amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;amp;bc1=000000&amp;amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;amp;f=ifr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Storms of My Grandchildren: The Truth About the Coming Climate Catastrophe and Our Last Chance to Save Humanity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with an initial press run of 100,000 copies by Bloomsbury USA. I can’t yet seem to find a good image of the book, so I’ll do without one here–but it sounds like Hansen is going to upbraid the world, and the U.S., for moving way too slowly and lamely on climate change, and basically lay it all out there–if we don’t do something really radical, it’s going to be too late. No doubt this is going to be a very, very important statement.&lt;/p&gt;

We are now facing a regular seasonal flu spiked with the H1N1 pandemic. Our best weapon against morbidity and mortality caused by the flu is information, and yet the public is being barraged with misinformation designed to encourage poor choices and thereby result in maximal morbidity and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I confess I was never impressed with FDR’s famous quip, “All we have to fear is fear itself,” – I think there is plenty else to fear. But his sentiment is very appropriate to the current situation – fear mongering around the seasonal flu and H1N1 vaccines is what we have most to fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, as is almost always the case, accurate information is complex and requires a nuanced understanding. This creates uncertainty, which is easy to exploit to manufacture unreasonable fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-vaccine fear mongers are playing every card in the deck. They are arguing (falsely) that H1N1 is not severe enough to warrant getting the vaccine, that the vaccine does not work anyway, and that there are unacceptable or unknown risks to the vaccine. In the most extreme cases, bizarre conspiracy theories are brought to bear, but I will not discuss these here as anyone compelled by such fantasies is likely beyond the reach of any information I could provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Crislip has already provided &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2040"&gt;an excellent overview &lt;/a&gt;of the evidence for seasonal flu vaccine efficacy in adults. To summarize – the evidence is complex and mixed, but there is compelling evidence that the flu vaccine works as designed, in that it produces protective antibodies against influenza. There is also evidence that it decreases morbidity and complications from the flu, although it is less clear if it decreases the number of flu cases. Further, the efficacy of the vaccine depends highly on how well the strains vaccinated against match the circulating strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficacy also depends highly on compliance – the percentage of the population (especially those likely to spread the flu to vulnerable populations) who get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that the vaccine works enough to make it worthwhile, and it is extremely safe. At a time when health care costs are crushing our economy, it is also worth pointing out that it is cost effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet confidence in the H1N1 vaccine is decreasing under the onslaught of scare mongering and misinformation. &lt;a href="http://www.nursingtimes.net/whats-new-in-nursing/swine-flu/nurse-confidence-in-swine-flu-vaccine-falling/5006950.article"&gt;A recent survey &lt;/a&gt;of UK nurses found that 47 percent do not plan on getting the H1N1 vaccine, while only 23 percent said they would. This is concerning because health care workers are perceived as having more authority with the public, and because protecting the sick and elderly likely depends most on their health care providers getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that the H1N1 vaccine has a big advantage over the seasonal flu vaccine – the match between the vaccine and the circulating virus is high. This is perhaps the biggest predictor of efficacy for the flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Bad Is It?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence so far indicates that, as predicted, H1N1 is now making its second circuit through Western countries, including the UK, Canada, and US. &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/update.htm"&gt;The CDC reports&lt;/a&gt; that flu cases are increasing rapidly, and are exceeding the normal number of cases that would be seen at this time of year from the seasonal flu. By all reports, we are in for a heavy flu season. It does not look like the 1918-1919 pandemic, but a bad flu season is still a concern. The average flu season kills 30,000 Americans and 500,000 worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/updates/us/"&gt;Statistics from August 30 to October 3&lt;/a&gt; in the US indicate: Influenza and Pneumonia Syndrome – 12,384 hospitalizations and 1,544 deaths, of those influenza was confirmed in laboratory tests in 	3,874 and 	240 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the seasonal flu H1N1 is about as deadly overall, but kills a higher proportion of those who are otherwise young and healthy, and also is more deadly for pregnant women. About &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17753-dont-be-fooled-swine-flu-still-poses-a-deadly-threat.html"&gt;1% of people infected with H1N1&lt;/a&gt; get a severe form of the flu likely requiring hospitalization and at high risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the vaccine safe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a range of concerns that have been raised about the vaccine. These range from those that are reasonable and should be raised about any new intervention at one end, to outrageous conspiracy mongering at the other. Of course, those who raise appropriate concerns hate to be painted with the same brush as the conspiracy theorists, and so I will make that distinction at the outset. And, as stated above, the conspiracy theories are beyond the scope of this entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would file under appropriate concerns the fact that the previous H1N1 pandemic vaccine from 1976 resulted in an increased risk of Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) – about 1 per 100,000 people vaccinated. The seasonal flu vaccine in the last 32 years has resulted in excess cases of GBS of about 1 in 1 million. While we expect that the H1N1 vaccine will likely have the same risk of GBS as the seasonal flu vaccine, the US and UK have instituted monitoring systems (essentially encouraging doctors to report cases of GBS following vaccination) as an early warning if the H1N1 vaccine has a higher risk of GBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discuss the issue of &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=784"&gt;GBS in more detail here&lt;/a&gt;, but the bottom line is that the risk of GBS ranges from low to very low, and it will be monitored. Also, early experience with the H1N1 vaccine has not resulted in any cases of GBS, so at the very least the risk is not high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the concerns brought up about the H1N1 vaccine I consider to be unreasonable fear mongering. For example, anti-vaccinationists have tried to raise fears about adjuvants in the vaccine. They consistently fail to point out that the versions of the vaccine approved by the FDA for use in the US &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19816398?ordinalpos=6&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;do not contain adjuvants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjuvants are substances added to vaccine to increase the immune response. This allows for the use of less viral material in the vaccine. Vaccine adjuvants are all extensively tested and are generally safe. Any reactions are extremely rares, and certainly much less likely than morbidity from the disease the vaccine is targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harriet Hall has already addressed the fear mongering surrounding squalene and other adjuvants &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1296"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and David Gorski addresses similar concerns &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1504"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another concern that is brought up is that one can get sick from the vaccine itself. Bill Maher infamously stated recently on his show that the vaccine “injects disease” into the arm. The injectible version of the vaccine does not contain “disease” – it is a killed virus vaccine, and it is impossible to get the flu from the vaccine. The nasal spray vaccine does contain a live virus, but it is an attenuated virus – meaning that it is weakened so as not to cause illness but only to provoke an immune response. There is a small risk that attenuated viruses will spontaneously mutate and revert back to a more virulent form, but the risk is very small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, the now classic vaccine&lt;a href="http://thebirdflupandemic.com/archives/the-swine-flu-vaccine-contains-25000-times-the-amount-of-mercury-that-is-considered-safe"&gt; scare mongering regarding thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;, a mercury-based preservative, is being trotted out. These claims are wrong on multiple levels. We have already dealt extensively with the false claim that thimerosal is unsafe. A thorough review and reference list &lt;a href="http://sciencebasedmedicine.org/reference/vaccines-and-autism/"&gt;can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. Thimerosal is safe in the doses used in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the single-shot version of the seasonal and H1N1 flu vaccines, and the nasal vaccine, all &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/vaccination/vaccine_safety_qa.htm"&gt;do not contain any thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;. Thimerosal is only used in the multi-shot version of the vaccine, to prevent contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is uncertainty and reasonable concerns regarding the flu vaccine, and more research is welcome, current evidence is sufficient to recommend that the vaccine is safe and effective. The bottom line with any medical intervention is risk vs benefit. The benefit of the H1N1 vaccine far outweighs the minimal risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the more people who get the vaccine the more effective it will be. At this rate, we are unlikely to achieve herd immunity, but everyone who gets vaccinated will not only provide themselves with a level of protection, but will also protect those around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still too early to tell how severe the H1N1 pandemic will be, but at least it will result in a bad flu season. It is also clear at this point that the pandemic will be significantly worsened by fear-mongering against the most effective defense we have against the flu – the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a body count attached to this unreasonable fear, justifying FDR’s famous words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things did not go well for Singh initially, when in the preliminary hearing, the Judge determined Singh’s use of the word bogus to mean the BCA were knowingly deceiving the public by using certain techniques. So in effect, Simon would have to prove that the BCA were being knowingly deceitful and not just niaively. This seemed like an impossible task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Simon took the risky step of appealing this decision and today he was granted the right to a full appeal to argue his right to publish the article as fair comment. In a hearing that took place in the London Royal Courts of Justice, the judge referred to the intitial judgement as “disproportionate” and erroneous. He then wasted no time in ruling a full appeal to Singh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is bloody good news for Simon but also for journalists and other commentators (like myself) who feared their right to critical comment was to be removed. Those of you who have been following this story would know that some chiropractors have not behaved in a particularly upstanding manner.  The MCA instructed their members to remove any reference to treating colic from all their material including websites. Australian Skeptics also received a &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/announcements/chiropractor-lodges-complaint-against-australian-skeptics/"&gt;complaint &lt;/a&gt;about republishing Simon’s article on their website from a chiropractor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judge overturned the original judgment by Justice Eady on Simon's use of the word 'bogus' in a Guardian article to describe claims by chiropractors to treat certain childhood illnesses. He said that there was no question of the good faith of the appellant (Simon) who wrote what he honestly believed with the purpose of serving the public interest. [Edit: 'overturned' is not the strict legal term here, see Jack of Kent for the lawyer's version]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laws also questioned whether Eady's ruling could have serious implications for the application of &lt;a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_3"&gt;Article 10 of the Human Rights Act&lt;/a&gt;, which concerns freedom of expression, and said that there was a disproportionate burden of proof on the appellant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also commented that the 47 pages of written evidence presented in Simon's defence were on the 'voluminous' side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCA, who were informed of the decision in advance, did not show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon's case will now go to full appeal, probably in the spring - just in time for the next Chiropractic Awareness Week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was there representing the &lt;a href="http://secularism.org.uk/"&gt;National Secular Society&lt;/a&gt;, which defends freedom of expression and evidence-based rationalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the hearing we all re-convened at the pub for a celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full legal details can be found at &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/"&gt;Jack of Kent's blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: The BCA's response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: A fuller response from the chiromancers (sorry, chiropractors):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Simon Singh has been granted permission to appeal against the decision of Mr. Justice Eady. As the Claimant is not permitted to be represented in a hearing of this nature, the Judge of the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Laws, did not have the benefit of being able to consider all the issues, nor indeed, has he heard any argument from the BCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Singh has used this case as a platform to argue that science writers should be immune from the law of libel and be free to write what they please. [No he hasn't] Ever since the Eady decision of 7th May 2009, he has engaged in a high profile media campaign to assert that the BCA's action is a restriction of the freedom of speech. It is nothing of the sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCA supportes and would never seek to stifle legitimate open scientific debate [legitimate meaning 'not critical of the BCA'?] . However, this action is actually a simple libel claim based on the fact that the BCA was &lt;b&gt;maliciously attacked&lt;/b&gt; by Dr. Singh in the Guardian newspaper. When given the opportunity to retract his words and apologise, Dr. Singh refused. This claim has been brought to restore the good reputation of the BCA and that of its members.[Good luck with that]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Singh may now put his case before a full Court of Appeal. Here the BCA will, for the first time, have the opportunity to present its case. The BCA remains confident that once in possession of all the facts the presiding judges will refuse the Appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And comment on it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And an excellent article by Allen Green (Jack of Kent's alter ego) here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: The BCA has now changed its press release to remove the possibly libellous accusation. The words 'maliciously attacked' (in bold above) have been replaced by 'libelled'. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have now pretty much run out of feet to shoot themselves in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian Skeptics posted Simon’s original article so that it would get more attention. And it worked, kinda: like a fly to honey, one chiropractor took offense at what was written, and decided to send them a nearly logic-free letter. That’s fine, and pretty much what I expect from a vocal alt-med devotée. As justified, Eran Segev, president of the Australian Skeptics, &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/skeptics-chiropractic-ierano-segev-response-20090906.pdf"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All well and good, &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/announcements/chiropractor-lodges-complaint-against-australian-skeptics/"&gt;until…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… two weeks after responding we received a letter from the NSW Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) indicating Mr Ierano [the chiropractor] has lodged a complaint against Australian Skeptics. The letter attached to the complaint was the same one that Australian Skeptics had received and responded to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s a bit odd! I mean, why go to the trouble to pursue legal action against someone responding to your claims when it should be easy to present a simple rebuttal based on the evidence that chiropractic works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… oh, &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s funny is that originally, the BCA (the group suing Simon in the UK) tried to defend their position, and presented a poorly-researched, off-topic press release &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/18/careful-bca-you-might-slip-a-disk/"&gt;that somehow managed to make them look worse&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, that’s a theme amongst chiropractors trying to support some of their less reality-based claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while I’m using a light-hearted tone here, I’ll note that this is a very serious issue: there are people out there trying to stifle free speech. It’s that simple. The UK libel laws are draconian and designed to shut up any protest, making scientific objections and investigations into potential and real quackery very difficult. As Eran says on the AS page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australian Skeptics sees this complaint as lacking any merit even if it did not include some factual errors (e.g. the claim that a British court ruled Simon’s article is biased). We have prepared a detailed response to the HCCC and will be defending our right to publish articles relating to any scientific issue, as long as they are backed by scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harris was re-elected, but certain issues have not yet been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Harris criticized Barbour for being an atheist and contributing to a “Charles Darwin” scholarship, among other things.  He sent out the following mailing which specifically goes after Barbour’s non-theism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://newmexicoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/harris-barbour.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/harris-barbour1.jpg" alt="harris-barbour" title="harris-barbour" width="550" height="646"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several readers wrote to Harris complaining about his tactics.  He sent a form letter to many of them and a &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/09/albuquerque-city-councilperson-don-harris-responds-about-attack-on-atheism/"&gt;short apology&lt;/a&gt; to at least one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, he sent a statement to me.  I’m printing it here in full (including the intro):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dear Mr. Mehta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I respect [and] appreciate public service of and involvement of all kinds, including your web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have taken some time to review many things on your site.   You espouse friendliness, fairness, openness, and a desire to have a real dialog with members of the faith community.   With that in mind, I think you should make some concessions.  In particular, (1) What you did with regard to my city council race was also a political attack.  (2) It is neither objectively fair nor persuasive to non-Atheists to be hyper-critical of me while treating the other politician involved (Mr. Barbour who has run for office before) uncritically in terms of communications or motives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have a statement for you to publish if you like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Barbour first presented himself as an ultra progressive, espousing universal health care, “trams” (streetcars), global warming and publicly-financed internet.  The picture of the bearded, beret-wearing radical came from his own initial campaign literature.    That is who he is, a far-left, recent San Francisco transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After realizing that this image was a losing strategy in our part of the City, he presented himself as a clean cut, fiscal-conservative, church-going Democrat from Pueblo Colorado.   That is not who he is, and it should be expected for me, his opponent, to expose him and tell the voters who I honestly believe him to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I brought up Atheism and treated it merely as part of a bundle of ultra liberal attributes, and to contradict his own political messaging.   I certainly did not mean to criticize or offend any thoughtful Atheists.  And, I’m sorry that any took offense.  I do not intend to use similar messages again.  In fact, I will counsel others in political circles against similar messages if the opportunity arises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something as personal as religion should be left out of political campaigns.  Atheists are a diverse group and cannot be accurately characterized as all having the same political leaning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don Harris
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My responses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you did with regard to my city council race was also a political attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I publicized a mailing that Harris sent out, a mailing which was already made public in a &lt;a href="http://newmexicoindependent.com/38299/abq-city-councilor-don-harris-attacks-challenger-on-religion"&gt;local Albuquerque newspaper&lt;/a&gt;.  There was no attack, simply restating what was local knowledge.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My concern in this particular race had nothing with the candidates’ policies and everything to do with religion.  To use Barbour’s ties to atheist organizations as a weapon &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; him is an offense to anyone who believes in a similar way.  I’m offended that Barbour’s involvement and support of a local Unitarian Universalist church was used to instill some sort of fear in constituents who are taught that non-religious people are in some way not worthy of holding public office.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s a “political attack,” then it’s one that needs to happen more often.  Harris would not have gotten away with it if he substituted the word “black” or “Jew” in the place of “atheist.”  We need to defend ourselves from bigoted, unreasonable attacks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It is neither objectively fair nor persuasive to non-Atheists to be hyper-critical of me while treating the other politician involved (Mr. Barbour who has run for office before) uncritically in terms of communications or motives.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not criticizing Harris for his policies nor did I purposely avoid any criticism of Barbour.  I don’t know their policies nor was I concerned with them at this time.  As a person who lives well outside the voting district, my main concern was the way the word “Atheist” was used in a derogatory manner by Harris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Barbour used Harris’ faith as a rallying point against &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; candidacy, without good reason, he ought to be criticized, too.  Did he?  I haven’t heard or seen any evidence of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did Barbour do anything to warrant the anti-atheist sentiment used against him by Harris?  Again, not that I’ve been made aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… he presented himself as a clean cut, fiscal-conservative, church-going Democrat from Pueblo Colorado.   That is not who he is, and it should be expected for me, his opponent, to expose him and tell the voters who I honestly believe him to be.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Barbour switched his positions, then Harris has a right to point that out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Barbour &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a church-going guy: He attended a Unitarian church.  It may not be &lt;em&gt;Harris&lt;/em&gt;‘ kind of church, but it is a church.  And Barbour does not contradict his church-going status when he gives money for a local science scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I brought up Atheism and treated it merely as part of a bundle of ultra liberal attributes, and to contradict his own political messaging.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conservative/Liberal politics aside, not all atheists are liberal.  If you want to go after him for his stance on the issues, then do it.  There’s no need to go after a person’s faith unless it affects how he or she will vote on particular issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I certainly did not mean to criticize or offend any thoughtful Atheists.  And, I’m sorry that any took offense.  I do not intend to use similar messages again.  In fact, I will counsel others in political circles against similar messages if the opportunity arises.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disregarding the “thoughtful Atheists” comment for now, this is what we need to hear.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that Harris will not do this again and that he’ll advise others not to do it either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Something as personal as religion should be left out of political campaigns.  Atheists are a diverse group and cannot be accurately characterized as all having the same political leaning.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, like I said before, religion shouldn’t be attacked unless it affects how the person is going to vote.  If it doesn’t affect that, then an elected official’s religion isn’t a major concern for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could easily vote for a Christian if I knew that candidate supported my beliefs on issues like science education or stem cell research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I would vote against Christians if I knew their fundamentalist beliefs would guide them on issues like gay marriage or comprehensive sex education — voting against them because they think the Bible tells them to, instead of voting against them for any “real,” concrete reasons (none of which I’ve ever heard).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to vote against a person &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; because of the label?  And to use that label to scare people into voting for you?  That’s sinking pretty low.  That’s what Harris did — he capitalized “Atheist” and used that term twice in a pullout box in the mailing — and that’s what I was so upset by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to go after his “liberal” policies, so be it.  If you did that, none of this would’ve been an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

He did not; he was only signing his books. I'm disappointed; I was really hoping to have a Dawkins-autographed bible. That would be awesome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The actual interesting stuff that happened that night is under the fold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;When first we arrived (and by "we" I mean "Magus and I"), we got lost in Bloomington. After finally finding a parking garage, we arrived at the auditorium just in time to get two of the reserved seats we had manage to obtain. On our way up the stairs into the auditorium, a couple of smugly smiling older men greeted us and handed us each a wonderful little card-tract of the kind &lt;a href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/2008/08/they-found-our-lack-of-faith-disturbing.html"&gt;we received&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2008/08/us-vs-fundies.html"&gt;at Gen Con 2008&lt;/a&gt;. It has a (probably illegal) picture of a GEICO caveman and says "&lt;u&gt;Evolution&lt;/u&gt;: Even cavemen don't believe it!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tract really deserves its own post, so that's all I'll say about it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we got seated, I was immediately excited because, oddly enough, it was the IU auditorium that was featured in the DVD set &lt;i&gt;An Evening With Kevin Smith&lt;/i&gt;. I was there to see Richard Dawkins, and I was excited because Kevin Smith had been there like six years ago. Eh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dawkins came out after a brief introduction and proceeded to, for about half an hour or so, read selections from &lt;i&gt;The Greatest Show on Earth&lt;/i&gt;. That was kind of disappointing, to be honest. I was hoping for an interested speech or presentation; if I want to know what the book said, I can read it anytime. What was impressive, though, was his elocution; his writing has such a poetic touch and he reads it better than anyone else ever could. It sounds so fluid, so inspiring in his confident received pronunciation that it makes one want to go buy and read the book immediately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the reading was the Q&amp;amp;A session, which really was the true meat and potatoes of the event. It allowed Dawkins to flex his intellect and be a bit more off-the-cuff. I was really hoping for a crazy fundie, but no dice. What we got instead was a gaggle of fucking retards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of all the questions asked, I remember two that were good floating on a sea of mediocrity under which moved a seething undertow of Epic Fail. &lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com"&gt;Jen&lt;/a&gt; asked how educators might counteract the childhood indoctrination inherent in places like the Creation Museum, and, &lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/2009/10/richard-dawkins-at-indiana-university.html"&gt;as she related&lt;/a&gt;, he didn't actually answer her question. He went off on the "bee in [his] bonnet," as he put it: the labeling of children with their parents' religion. The other good question was a guy who asked Dawkins to speculate on how he figured the creationists would misuse and spin &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus ramidus&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, that guy doesn't totally get a pass because he greeted Dawkins with the salutation "How the hell are ya?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which brings me to the rant section of this post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why the hell is it that when people attend an event like this, when they get the opportunity to expand their knowledge by asking questions of a noted authority, they decide that the show has to be about them for a minute? I get that sometimes it's just nervousness caused by trying to elucidate something into a microphone in front of a large audience, but the rambly questions that usually result from that are not what I mean.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why is it that 75% of people have to be fucking assholes and make some sort of a lame joke, or talk themselves up, or ask a &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/01/attention-seeking-behavior.html"&gt;"Look at me!" question&lt;/a&gt;? Why can't they just ask their questions and get on with it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He doesn't fucking need to know how "honored" you are to be in the same room with him, or what your fucking background is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One asshole prefaced his question by speaking in a &lt;i&gt;ridiculously bad&lt;/i&gt; British accent and saying something like "I seem to have evolved into a Brit during your talk!" It was fucking painful, and I wanted to run down to the mic and elbow this irritating dickhead in the spleen. The audience groaned, Dawkins looked at him like he was an idiot (because he was), and he tried to save it with &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; lame jokes before he asked his goddamned question! What the hell?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One guy asked, in essence, "Why don't more scientists try to prove the bible in order to disprove creationism?" He apparently thought that the question made sense, because he stopped there. Dawkins, however, did not answer. So he tried to clarify and dug the hole even deeper. I'm still not sure if that's &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what he was asking because the question didn't make any sense. Dawkins' reply was to say "I'm sorry, but your question is confusing me. What are you asking?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One guy rambled on and on and on and on until Dawkins just cut him off and answered the basic gist of the question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worst question of all, in my mind, was the fellow who said "I'm so honored that you're here, Dr. Dawkins. I've been a follower since &lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt;. I just wanted to ask, and I don't believe this at all but I want your answer, why don't apes give birth to humans?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is so much wrong about that dude's question I about blew my top. The murmuring around us seemed to generally focus on the dumbass question itself, and that deserves focus, but what really jumped out at me and Magus was the word "follower." You're a follower of Dawkins? Really? He's your fucking leader?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Somebody missed the bus to Critical Thinking Land.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A follower of Dawkins! Like Dawkins is some sort of fucking atheist prophet! And he's been a "follower" since &lt;i&gt;Dawkins' last fucking book!&lt;/i&gt; That's like going to a concert on Green Day's &lt;i&gt;21st Century Breakdown&lt;/i&gt; tour and telling Billie Joe "I've been a huge fan since &lt;i&gt;American Idiot!&lt;/i&gt;" Good for you, buddy. Way to be an ignorant shit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lameness of his question is bad enough already, but it's really put into perspective by his claim to be a "follower" of Dawkins: here is a guy who knows not the most basic facts about how evolution actually functions, but he trusts his high-and-mighty authority figure that it does. He thinks that there is a great ladder of life with humans at the top; he thinks that apes are pre-human evolutionary forms; he thinks that one species giving birth to a totally different one is how evolution moves forward. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These gross misunderstandings live inside his head, but thanks to the word of the Dawkins, the disconnect between his entirely nonsensical "understanding" of evolution and the facts of the real world do not come together to shatter his faith in evolutionary science. He, ignorant though he is, has a blind and unshakable faith in evolution by natural selection because he is a follower of one who says it must be so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I don't know shit about evolution, Dr. Dawkins, but you said there's no god and evolution is true so I believe it unquestioningly!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What a worthless little fucker. Science, to paraphrase Morbo, does not work like that. Shove off, Slappy, and find another religion; you won't find your succor here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These were the questions that stood out to me. Most of the rest weren't great and weren't terrible, and Dawkins answered most with knowledge and patience. I wondered the whole time if he was thinking something like "Bloody Americans. Why do I even bother?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Afterward, he signed books in the lobby. I already told you how that ended, but it began like this: a total mess of a line (more of a disorganized horde, really) began to form. It was people-dense and confusing. A guy to my right held up a red book and said "Did anyone else get one of these when they came in?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I looked and saw what appeared to be a copy of &lt;i&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/i&gt;. I paused for a moment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Holy shit!" I then exclaimed. "It's Ray Comfort's edited version! I'm so jealous! I wanted to snag one of those! I had no idea they'd be giving them out here!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fellow with the book had no idea what I was talking about, so I briefly explained it to him. He seemed completely uninterested in Ray's antics, and as such he ave me his copy of the book; he didn't want it at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was so excited I about did a dance. I am now, thanks to the kindness of a stranger, a proud owner of one of the limited dition free copies of Darwin's &lt;i&gt;Origin&lt;/i&gt; with a special 50-page bullshit intro by Ray Comfort hisownself. I can't wait to dig into Ray's nonsense!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inside the book were a few things: yet another of the aforementioned caveman tracts, a "Darwin recanted on his deathbed" tract, and a "Hitler loved evolution" tract. It was like a gold mine of fundamentalist lunacy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It occurs to me that throughout all of this I haven't actually talked much about &lt;i&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/i&gt;, just about the people and events surrounding him. I suppose that's because, for the most part, what he said were things I already knew and had heard him say before. Not only that, but he was very prim and formal, almost cold. While I was, as I said, impressed with the eloquence with which he read his already eloquent prose, he wasn't suffused with the warmth and personability that so defined the many speakers at TAM7, or James Randi when &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2008/03/our-very-own-amazing-meeting.html"&gt;I saw him at UIUC&lt;/a&gt; a while back. The whole event had a very...sanitized feel to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don't get me wrong; I'm glad I went, and Dawkins was a great speaker, but he was a great speaker in a sort of rehearsed, professional, and very proper British way, if you catch my meaning. Lacking was the sheer energy of Adam Savage, or the self-deprecating humor of Michael Shermer, or the irascible vim and vigor of The Amazing Randi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He did, however, have one point of pure comic brilliance. Someone (I believe it was "Mr. I Evolved Into a Brit and Am an Idiot") asked "Do you find anything at all redeeming about creationism or ID?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dawkins, who listened to each question from the edge of the stage, paused for a moment before walking back to the podium. When he got there, he paused again, took a long drink from a glass of water, stood silently for a long moment, and then leaned over and said "No."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was fucking &lt;i&gt;genius&lt;/i&gt; timing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One random thing that occurred to me during the talk was that there seem to be at least two kinds of applause. Normal applause can be called "appreciation applause." This is when you applaud someone as a reward for something they did. This is the kind of applause a band gets between songs, or a comedian gets after a really good joke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's another kind of applause, though, and it was this second kind that overwhelmed the IU Auditorium Monday night. I call it "agreement applause." This is when the speaker says something with which you agree heartily so you start applauding to show that you're a back-patting yes-man and to remind yourself how smart you are and how stupid people are who disagree with you. I can't abide agreement applause; it cuts into the talk, it eats up time, and it serves no purpose other than to make the applauders feel like they're something special.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That, I suppose, is that. When I get more time, I'll cover the caveman tract in exhaustive detail; it's pretty damned ridiculous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-199769727855908095?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255509139762"><id gr:original-id="http://healthskills.wordpress.com/2009/10/14/act-some-evidence-for-acceptance-commitment-therapy-in-chronic-pain/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/546ae972e902ebd3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">ACT – some evidence for acceptance &amp;amp; commitment therapy in chronic pain</title><published>2009-10-14T02:01:02Z</published><updated>2009-10-14T02:01:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/ba9O1rk6gxo/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://healthskills.wordpress.com/2009/10/14/act-some-evidence-for-acceptance-commitment-therapy-in-chronic-pain/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">For a relatively young therapy, ACT has a lot of research to support its use in chronic pain.

&lt;p&gt;Aristotle thought they were plants; for centuries, we have used them to scrub ourselves clean, while millions of kids round the planet think they wear square pants and play with stupid starfish. Nevertheless, sponges are in fact the oldest living animals, one of the most amazing success stories on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argument rages over exactly how old the earliest sponge is. Some fossils that are claimed to be sponges have been dated back to around 710 MY ago, but not everyone accepts these. Everyone agrees, however, that they were around shortly before the Cambrian Explosion, around 560MY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They now cover every part of the ocean, and can account for up to 75% of the biomass on the floor of the Antarctic ocean. 15,000 species have been identified, most of them marine, but there are around 150 freshwater species. There are three main extant groups, and – confusingly – three main body forms, which don’t overlap (i.e. the body forms don’t form distinct evolutionary lineages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group of sponges – the Archaeocyaths – flowered briefly (metaphorically speaking) during the Cambrian, but disappeared after around 15 MY. Most sponges are filter feeders, but a few deep sea sponges are carnivorous, spiking tiny crustaceans on their spicules and then absorbing their body contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sponges have no neurons, no muscles, no cell-cell junctions, no gut, no front/back, no reproductive organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes them animals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of DNA show that all the animals – “metazoa” – form what is called a monophyletic group. In other words, all us animals share a common ancestor which is not shared by any other life form. Animals evolved only once, and the earliest branch is the sponges, says the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But strictly speaking, that doesn’t make them an animal. They could be some multicellular non-animal, which branched off before the rest of us started on our animally way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, recent studies have revealed some amazing things about sponges that clearly place them with the animals – they share fundamental characters with us that no other life-form shares. We can see in the sponge the beginnings of our own way of organizing our bodies and behaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a simple immune system – a sponge will accept a graft of its own flesh, but will reject that of another sponge. This rejection can be stopped by using an immunosuppressant widely used in medicine. In other words, we share a biochemical pathway that the body uses to distinguish self and non-self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They show coordinated movement – Ephydatia muelleri, a small sponge, “sneezes” (rather slowly!) when it is agitated or has inedible ink poured over it. This movement can be induced by pouring known animal neurotransmitters over the sponge, showing the sponge cells are sensitive to stuff that we use to activate our neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They may not have neurons, but they have the tiny ion channels that are required to make a neuron work. Express these genes in another organism, and they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a simple form of the genes required to make neurons. Express these genes in a toad or fly and they start to make neurons there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what we would expect would have happened at the earliest stages of animal multicellularity. Animals didn’t suddenly appear as running, flying, swimming things. Our earliest, multicellular ancestors would have been perfectly adapted to their environment, but would also have used simple forms of cell-cell communication to build their bodies, and to respond to that environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the vast depths of evolutionary time, those methods were honed and shaped by natural selection, eventually leading to the stupendous array of animal life that the planet has carried, including me, typing these words to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t make sponges “primitive”, or in any way lesser beings. They have been on our planet for longer than any other animal – around 10,000 times longer than our species. They have survived repeated mass extinction events, and that suggests they will probably be around for at least another 600 MY. Not bad for an animal that Aristotle took for a plant.&lt;/p&gt;

If there are any of my readers who happen to be surgeons attending the meeting, drop me a line and maybe we can get together. In the meantime, here's a blast from the past from the past. This post first reared its ugly head almost exactly three years ago; so if you haven't been reading at least three years, it's new to you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, I'll come right out and admit it up front. There was no part one to this piece. Well, there was, but it wasn't on this blog, and I didn't write it. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/10/deepak_chopra_does_it_again.php"&gt;PZ&lt;/a&gt; did in response to some really idiotic arguments from ignorance that &lt;a href="http://www.intentblog.com/"&gt;Deepak Chopra&lt;/a&gt; (or, less pleasing to Dr. C, &lt;a href="http://skepdic.com/chopra.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) displayed as part of an "&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/the-trouble-with-genes_b_31118.html"&gt;argument&lt;/a&gt;" (and I use the term loosely) that there is some mystical other quality that explains life other than genes. He paraded a litany of arguments that so conclusively demonstrated that he had no clue about even the basics of molecular biology that I as a physician cringed and hid my head in shame when I read it, given that Dr. Chopra is, at least nominally, a medical doctor. PZ did a fine job of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/10/deepak_chopra_does_it_again.php"&gt;fisking&lt;/a&gt; Chopra's nonsense (with one minor quibble that I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/10/deepak_chopra_does_it_again.php#comment-235498"&gt;mentioned in the comments&lt;/a&gt;). Even the people leaving comments on Chopra's article were in general pretty hostile to his drivel and pointed out the large number of misstatements of our understanding of genetics, logical fallacies, and credulous arguments from ignorance that flew hither and yon from Chopra's keyboard. I thought that, having thoroughly embarrassed himself once, Chopra would slink away for a while before dropping another woo-bomb onto an unsuspecting blogosphere. I even thought that Chopra had a shred of self-respect that would prevent him from embarrassing himself again that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks Bill for giving me another excuse to post the video you find so objectionable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/10/13/this-week-in-god-10-13-09/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/3bObItmxAGc/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/bill_donohue_just_keeps_on_giv.php"&gt;Here’s Donohue’s reaction&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catholic League president Bill Donohue responds as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silverman’s assault on Catholicism is just another example of HBO’s corporate irresponsibility. Time and again, if it’s not Bill Maher thrashing the Catholic Church, it’s one of his guests. There is obviously something pathological going on there: Silverman’s filthy diatribe would never be allowed if the chosen target were the Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem and the state of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a reality check for Silverman: the Catholic Church operates more hospitals and feeds more of the poor than any private institution in the world. It also saved more Jews during the Holocaust than any other institution in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it should be mentioned that Donohue is once again using his favorite tactic, the “you wouldn’t be allowed to get away with this if it was another religion” gambit. I’m actually surprised that for once he used the Christ-killing Jews in his example instead of Islam. Donohue has used this tactic so often that I really think this is his excuse for everything. When he gets a speeding ticket, he probably says that if he were Muslim, society would be outraged at him getting ticketed. When he defends child rapists, he probably says nobody would mind if he were Muslim. I’m starting to think the man has Muslim envy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there’s also the matter of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/bill_donohue_just_keeps_on_giv.php"&gt;his “reality check” having no actual basis in reality&lt;/a&gt;, as PZ Myers illustrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the final point that I think is interesting is that all that verbiage to attack Silverman’s character and he never once actually explains why what she said is so offensive. Does Catholicism not preach charity and living humbly? Is the Vatican not incredibly rich? Would the money not be better spent feeding the poor? Where exactly does Donohue feel Silverman crossed the line?&lt;/p&gt;

I ran a quiz last month for the &lt;a href="http://www.perthskeptics.org"&gt;Perth Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;, but because we have our get-togethers from 3-5 on Sundays, I had what may be a less formal arrangement than most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine most people will have theirs at night, so if you’re stuck with how they run, I suggest attending a local one or checking out a few websites online about coordinating a quiz in general - I found &lt;a href="http://brainboxquizzes.com/doc/BrainBoxQuizzesGuidetoRunningAQuiz.pdf"&gt;How to Run a Great Quiz Night&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.f5m.org.au/documents/RunyouownFundraisingTriviaNight_000.pdf"&gt;Run your own Fundraising Trivia Night&lt;/a&gt; good for the really basic essentials if you’ve never experienced one before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the (gorgeous!) venue we have is mostly chairs and low tables (it’s a bar-lounge area), I made sure that I had something for people to write with (Ikea pencils are great; otherwise just scrabble some pens together and suggest people bring one next time too) and something to write on (the bar area also has some old second-hand hardcover books; in the past I’ve suggested using a few beer mats as something to lean on too). Check your venue, see if you can get enough space to fit people in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider using sites like Meetup.com to coordinate numbers so everyone fits in and try a sign-up sheet the meeting before the quiz if you want to formally organise tables. Remember, there may be people coming who are new and may not know that it was going to be running - be flexible if they want to take part! I have an additional suggestion at the end about ‘independent quizes’ too, if they would prefer to sit out being a part of a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:left" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2665/3957995279_647e70be20.jpg" alt="" width="222" height="295"&gt;The Perth Skeptics had four rounds of five questions each, which lasted for about one and a half hours in total, which including the grading (done by helpers at the end of each round) - important not to have things go on too long if people also want to socialise! I suggest small prize for a table at the half-way mark too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggestion - don’t make your questions too long as people might strain to get what you’re saying by the time you’ve reached the end of the question! There’s also single word answers, along with multiple choice, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mix it up with funny elements and pop culture; you might like to add things like podcast names and some of the news items on pseudoscience that people are interested in, along with basic science questions. Your audience is bound to have a mixture of ages and interests and even qualifications, so it’s useful to keep in mind. My personal favourite was the snappy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;#39;Times New Roman&amp;#39;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small"&gt;The Viking Orbiter found it in 1976 - Richard Hoagland thinks it really exists and the Bad Astronomer &lt;em&gt;has had enough of it.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The categories I had (and of course, you can have many more) were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;Logic and Fallacies&lt;/strong&gt; (that way, you could mix up with not only those ‘tried and true’ fallacies that skeptics like, but some of the other elements like Occam’s razor)&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;strong&gt;Weird and Wacky &lt;/strong&gt;- those odder claims out there like &lt;em&gt;‘Examples include – the nun bun and Jesus on a dog’s bottom. What is it?’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;strong&gt;Pseudoscience and the Paranormal&lt;/strong&gt; - of course, these could be two categories or split into even more such as UFO/Aliens, Halloween and Superstitions, etc.&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;strong&gt;Name the Author / Name the Book&lt;/strong&gt; - helps promote discussion after about books that people should be getting into (or should be avoiding!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically at any quiz gathering, there’s mid-point games like ‘Heads and Tails’ (make a point that you’re teaching probability!) and table prizes. Suggestion: have not only a trivia quiz, but a separate two-sided, one page of questions that are for individual entry only. That way, you can have an additional fun element of people ‘winning for their own merit only’. For this, I had a first, second and third prizes for the most completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ‘individual quiz’ could hold more detailed questions, such as, ‘name the science-skeptic song title / fill in the lyrics’ with material from &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2008/12/little-kitten-lyrics-to-tim-minchins-storm/"&gt;Tim Minchin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.geologicpodcast.com"&gt;George Hrab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.royzimmerman.com/"&gt;Roy Zimmerman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/"&gt;Jonathan Coulton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tmbw.net/wiki/Here_Comes_Science"&gt;They Might Be Giants&lt;/a&gt; and the like on one side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side I had a ‘&lt;em&gt;Who Am I&lt;/em&gt;?’ where I took biographical details of skeptics (e.g. Richard Saunders, Carl Sagan - do make sure you recognise the range of people who have contributed over the years!) and gave some facts about them and let them figure out who it was. There’s plenty of variations you could do with this too - such as names of your committee members of your skeptic group (’do you know who…’ ‘which committee member has…’).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can also extend to a breaking-the-ice activity, where people can be given the sheet before any skeptic meeting and have to go around finding out about each other in order to complete it all (not unusual at school camps I’ve gone to, where you have to find ’someone who lives near / in suburb X’ to complete your ‘person bingo’ sheet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this is of help - let me know if you have any further questions or suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;

A problem arises in understanding why women forgo one-third (and sometimes as much as one-half) of their reproductive lives, a condition unique in the natural world.  Could this just be a neutral mutation, an artifact of longer human lives, or might it be a product of natural selection?  If the latter, what selection pressure(s) could result in this unique human adaptation?  The grandmother hypothesis posits that women who stopped ovulating in their golden years were freed from the costs of reproduction and were better able to invest in their existing children and grandchildren (thus helping to ensure that more individuals with their menopause inducing genes thrived and had children themselves).

Larry Moran at Sandwalk takes issue with my support for this hypothesis, as discussed by Razib at Gene Expressions.  Moran refers to the hypothesis as an "adaptationist just so story" and insists that the study cited offers no evidence that menopause has adaptive value:

Given that there were many families that received no help from grandmothers, whether they had the menopause allele or not, and given that there were many families who received help even if the grandmothers did not have the menopause allele, the question is "what is the adaptive value of menopause under those circumstances."

Well, the international journal editors have come together to think of a new way to combat the highly contested and controversial topic of Disclosure of Interests in journal articles. In this editorial, which is being published in the above said journals simultaneously, a new format is being proposed. This will be in the Beta mode (testing mode, so to say) till April 2010, at the end of which, the big bosses of the publication world will put their heads together and see how things are turning out.At present, the different journals use different formats, hence there is no uniformity in the declaration of competing interests by the authors. Keeping in view the fact that the issues like ghost writing and gift authorship are plaguing the world of medical publication, it seems like a timely intervention.Another good thing is that because this is a standard format which can be saved in the user&amp;#39;s computer, it can be partially filled in and modified according to the specific needs of the specific journal.Check out the new format:http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdfAnd a &amp;quot;filled out form for dummies&amp;quot;:http://www.icmje.org/sample_disclosure.pdfCheck it out.

If you're &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Olson"&gt;Randy Olson&lt;/a&gt;, you become an independent filmmaker. First, you make a splash  with a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd7obytz_LM"&gt;short music video about the sex life of barnacles&lt;/a&gt;. Then you take on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design"&gt;intelligent design&lt;/a&gt; and the failure of the scientific community to make their counter-arguments about &lt;a href="http://en.wiki%5Bedia.org/wiki/Evolution"&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt; convincingly to the public with a quirky documentary called &lt;a href="http://www.flockofdodos.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Flock of Dodos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And then you see &lt;i&gt;An Inconvenient Truth&lt;/i&gt;, and decide there really needs to be a documentary about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; that lets the scientists speak for themselves. &lt;div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, scientists have traditionally ranked right down there with, well, barnacles on the list of Least Telegenic Life Forms. So Olson finds there are very few people willing to invest in a documentary featuring scientists. "My neighbor's a scientist, and I certainly wouldn't pay to see &lt;u&gt;him&lt;/u&gt; on screen," one potential investor bluntly says. Olson finally gets some meager funding from a neighborly gay couple, Mitch and Brian, who care deeply about the problem of global warming. "We're really, really upset about it," says Mitch. "We just don't know why."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The quest to find out why Mitch and Brian are so upset about global warming -- and why the rest of us should be, too -- provides a handy narrative framework for &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sizzlethemovie.com/"&gt;SIZZLE!&lt;/a&gt; A Global Warming Comedy&lt;/i&gt;, Olson's 2008 feature film, which makes its NYC premiere on October 23, at 7 PM, to close out the second annual &lt;a href="http://www.imaginesciencefilms.com/"&gt;Imagine Science Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;. If you missed &lt;i&gt;SIZZLE!&lt;/i&gt; the first time around, and plan to be in NYC on October 21, reserve a seat now for the free screening at The New School's Tishman Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;SIZZLE!&lt;/i&gt; is a celluloid hybrid, more "mockumentary" than documentary, blending the real with selected fictional elements and a colorful cast of characters. You've got Mitch and Brian (actors with LA's legendary Groundlings playing exaggerated versions of themselves), so obsessed with finding a celebrity host for their documentary that they take to stalking random celebrities on the streets of Los Angeles. ("Okay, Christina Ricci ran away from us...) There's the sound guy, Antoine (Ifeanyi Njoku)  and a chronically late cameraman named Marion (Alex Thomas), who is skeptical that global warming is real and keeps interrupting Olson's interviews with the scientists: "I just think it's a scam, man...." There's even a cameo by Olson's 83-year-old mother, &lt;a href="http://www.muffymoose.com/"&gt;Muffy Moose&lt;/a&gt;, who sneaks off with Antoine and Marion to go dancing at a hip-hop club. (Just call her "Muff-Diddy.")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Will Muffy Moose forsake the Midwest to cut a hit single with TimbaLand? Will Mitch and Brian find their celebrity host and figure out why they're so upset about global warming? And will Olson be able to let go of his scientific obsession with data to find the human story of climate change? You'll just have to check out the film to find out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/o96VZb27qug%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-7412027318965876103?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The festival will screen some 50 films from nine different countries at such venues as Tribeca Cinemas, New York all of Science, CUNY Graduate Center and The New School. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The over-arching message is "science is for everyone," according to festival founder Alexis Gambis, who has a PhD in genetics and molecular biology from Rockefeller University, and has just enrolled as a film student at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. "There is a definite need to create a dialogue between scientists and the public," he says. "The [festival] provides a creative platform for scientists to share their inspiration with the public in relatable and engaging ways."&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That&amp;#39;s a mission the Science &amp;amp; Entertainment Exchange shares, which is why we&amp;#39;re sponsoring a special sneak preview of the CG-animated feature, &lt;i&gt;Quantum Quest: A Cassini Space Odyssey, &lt;/i&gt;directed by Harry Kloor and Dan St. Pierre. The screening will take place on Wednesday, October 21, 7 PM, at the CUNY Graduate Center's Proshansky Auditorium. It's free, although seating is limited, so &lt;a href="http://web.gc.cuny.edu/sciart"&gt;reservations are required&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Quantum Quest&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a plucky little photon named Dave who lives in the sun and is drawn into an epic galactic battle between good and evil as the forces of the Core (protons, photons and neutrinos) face off against the antimatter forces of the Void to determine the fate of the universe. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/StVSybLKMBI/AAAAAAAAAH4/zK9h9vmoEkg/s1600-h/qqcoachminer.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:320px;height:169px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/StVSybLKMBI/AAAAAAAAAH4/zK9h9vmoEkg/s320/qqcoachminer.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Several Hollywood luminaries lent their voices to the film, including Chris Pie, William Shatner, Mark Hamill, Amanda Peet, Samuel L. Jackson, James Earl Jones, Abigail Breslin, and Hayden Christensen. And Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, makes his first film appearance voicing one of the characters.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Quantum Quest&lt;/i&gt; is also unusual because it is the first time NASA has collaborated with an independent filmmaker to produce a fictional animated film based on the agency's numerous missions. Kloor dreamed up the film back in 1996, when NASA launched the Cassini-Huygens mission to orbit Saturn. Production couldn't begin until NASA released the final images and radar data in 2008. So &lt;i&gt;Quantum Quest&lt;/i&gt; combines state-of-the-art CGI with actual images taken not just by Cassini-Huygens, but also other NASA missions (SOHO, Stereo, Mars Odyssey, Venus Express and Mercury Messenger).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Kloor himself will be on hand after the screening to talk about the making of Quantum Quest, along with special guests, including Space Shuttle astronaut Dan Berry, who made four spacewalks during his NASA tenure.

&lt;p&gt;A video from a FOX News interview of Bill O’Reilly &amp;amp; Dr. Richard Dawkins discussing evolutionary science, God, and religious belief is now making the rounds on the Internet, and I wanted to share both it and my thoughts on it here.  First off, &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,564422,00.html#"&gt;here’s the video…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,564422,00.html#"&gt;&lt;img title="dawkins" src="http://www.foxnews.com/images/575737/0_61_320_Dawkins.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,564422,00.html"&gt;here’s the full transcript of the obviously edited video&lt;/a&gt; (just watch it closely and you can catch the numerous cuts which probably left out most of Dawkins’ best arguments), and a careful read will expose a number of flaws in O’Reilly’s muddled thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to point out just a few of the biggest loser arguments made by O’Reilly in this exchange:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1. Argument from Ignorance:&lt;/strong&gt; Essentially, O’Reilly is &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Argument_from_Ignorance"&gt;arguing from ignorance&lt;/a&gt; – in this case using the famous &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/God_of_the_Gaps_Fallacy"&gt;“god-of-the-gaps”&lt;/a&gt; logical fallacy – when he states that because science hasn’t yet produced an answer on the question of life’s origins then Christianity must be correct…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O’REILLY:&lt;/strong&gt; Tell me where I’m going wrong here. I believe in creative design. I believe in evolution, but I think it was overseen by a higher power, because as we just stated and you acknowledged, you guys still haven’t figured out how it all began.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Btw, I really like how O’Reilly tries to slip that phrasing in there… creative design.  It’s not &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Intelligent_Design"&gt;intelligent design&lt;/a&gt; – which has become synonymous with &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Creationism"&gt;creationism&lt;/a&gt; – it’s now &lt;em&gt;creative&lt;/em&gt; design.  Makes me think that O’Reilly’s hypothetical god is like some kind of basket-weaver or something similarly silly.  I might also point out that one could just as easily use this kind of argument to justify that &lt;a href="http://www.rael.org/"&gt;space aliens&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="http://venganza.org"&gt;Flying Spaghetti Monster&lt;/a&gt; made the universe via creative design &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/False_Dichotomy"&gt;False Dichotomy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; O’Reilly very clearly implies through his arguments that this is a question of science versus God, specifically Christianity.  Of course, the fact that he has Dawkins, who is a staunch &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/atheism.html"&gt;atheist&lt;/a&gt;, on the show plays into this false dichotomy.  O’Reilly completely neglects to mention that numerous religious scientists, including evangelical Christian Dr. Francis Collins, have come out publicly and stated quite clearly that intelligent – oops, I mean &lt;em&gt;creative&lt;/em&gt; – design, or creationism, is a bunch of &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Pseudoscience"&gt;pseudoscientific&lt;/a&gt; baloney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The folks at FOX were cutting out parts of the interview, but they missed a piece, because Dawkins (however briefly) did indeed catch O’Reilly on this particular point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAWKINS:&lt;/strong&gt; Why would you muddle up the question of giving you a moral compass for life, which is important, with the other question, which is explaining the nature of the world, the nature of life, the nature of the universe? That’s what science is about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: you can both accept modern evolutionary science &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; garner specific moral teachings from your religion (or non-religion, for that matter).  The two are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as O’Reilly would have the viewer believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Moving the Goalposts:&lt;/strong&gt; Notice how O’Reilly not-so-cleverly attempts to change the conditions of “success” on Dawkins in the interview…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O’REILLY:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m throwing in with Jesus rather than be thrown in with you guys, because you guys can’t tell me how it all got here. You guys don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RICHARD DAWKINS, AUTHOR, “THE GOD DELUSION”:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re working on it. Physicists…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O’REILLY:&lt;/strong&gt; When you get it, then maybe I’ll listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAWKINS:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, if you look at the history of science over the centuries, the amount that’s gained in knowledge each century is stupendous. In the beginning of the 21st century, we don’t know everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O’REILLY:&lt;/strong&gt; All right. When you guys figure it out, then you come back here and tell me, because until that time I’m sticking with Judeo-Christian philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that O’Reilly keeps on saying, “When you guys get it, I’ll listen” but he never – on purpose, I think – states exactly what “it” is.  Many creationists &amp;amp; pseudoscientists perform the same logically fallacious sleight-of-hand when attempting to cast doubt upon science – they state that they’ll accept the evidence that science presents, yet they never tell what the nature of that evidence may be.  This allows them to use a tactic called &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Moving_the_Goalposts"&gt;moving the goalposts&lt;/a&gt; of the argument, which means that when evidence challenging their beliefs actually is presented to them they can deny the evidence or simply state that “it’s not enough”.  And when more evidence is presented, they simply move the goalposts again, and so on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Present “All” Views:&lt;/strong&gt; Another trick that O’Reilly pulls out of the creationist hat is that old standby, &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Teach_Both_Theories"&gt;present “all” views…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O’REILLY:&lt;/strong&gt; No. You present in the science classroom all the alternatives that are legitimate. Now, Adam and Eve, you don’t have to do that, all right. That’s for the Biblical portion of a theology class. But, as I said, there are more believers than nonbelievers, and that should be presented. I’ll give you the last word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an argument designed to appeal to the notion of fairness inherent in most people in the Western democracies.  In our society, it seems just plain unfair to not allow all sides of a debate to present their point of view, but this particular argument is easily countered.  Note that when discussing science, one must abide by very specific rules – such as following the &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/science.html"&gt;scientific method&lt;/a&gt; and being able to &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Falsifiability"&gt;test &amp;amp; potentially falsify your ideas.&lt;/a&gt; However, the O’Reillys of the world would much rather circumvent the requirements of science yet still call their religious ideology science, which is &lt;em&gt;unfairly&lt;/em&gt; stacking the deck in their favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, another thing to note is that when this argument is presented, it is always presented in the context of a specific religious belief vs. evolution – in this case O’Reilly’s view of Christianity vs. evolution.  If they &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; do mean teach “all” alternative views, then why don’t they ever advocate for things like &lt;a href="http://www.rael.org/"&gt;Raelianism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.scientology.org/"&gt;$cientology&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://harunyahya.us/"&gt;Islamic creationism&lt;/a&gt;?  The point here is that they’re outright hypocrites, because they whine and moan about “fairness” and teaching “all” views when in reality all they wish to do is stack the deck and give disproportionate time to presenting &lt;em&gt;their &lt;/em&gt;personal religious point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Blatant Anti-Scientific Stance:&lt;/strong&gt; In one section of the interview, O’Reilly stoops pretty low claiming that when Dawkins argues against allowing blatantly religious views into science classrooms he is taking a fascist stance.  O’Reilly actually equates defending the teaching of science with &lt;em&gt;fascism!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O’REILLY:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, for you to say you cannot, in a public school classroom, a science classroom, talk about brilliant men, and I know brilliant, smarter than you, who do believe in a higher power, who do believe that there was an overseer of the universe, and you insist you can’t even mention it, that is fascism, sir.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a douchebag.  This is clearly an attempt to make an ad hominem attack on anyone who, like Dawkins, opposes the teaching of religious ideology or pseudoscientific tripe masquerading as science.  It is an extremely slimy and weaseling way of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law"&gt;Godwinning the discussion&lt;/a&gt; by, in a roundabout way, of implying that your opponent is a Nazi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen this kind of argumentation before when actor Ben Stein made similar arguments and stated that &lt;a href="http://boingboing.net/2008/05/01/ben-stein-science-le.html"&gt;“Science leads you to killing people” in the context of the Holocaust…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/10/14/bill-oreilly-vs-richard-dawkins-oreilly-shows-why-hes-a-wedge-the-simplest-of-tools/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/FvKvHM5m5qw/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stein:&lt;/strong&gt; When we just saw that man, I think it was Mr. Myers [biologist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.Z._Myers"&gt;P.Z. Myers&lt;/a&gt;], talking about how great scientists were, I was thinking to myself the last time any of my relatives saw scientists telling them what to do they were telling them to go to the showers to get gassed … that was horrifying beyond words, and that’s where science — in my opinion, this is just an opinion — that’s where science leads you.&lt;strong&gt;Crouch:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stein:&lt;/strong&gt; …Love of God and compassion and empathy leads you to a very glorious place, and science leads you to killing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crouch:&lt;/strong&gt; Good word, good word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the irony here is that O’Reilly’s career and lifestyle are wholly dependent upon the very science that he so disparages.  I don’t recall any Bible stories talking about television, radio waves, or the Internet, do you?  Last I saw in the history books, it took good old fashioned &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; to come up with those things &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Intermittent fasting isn't as well researched as calorie restriction - by which I mean to say the evidence for health benefits is "only" very good rather than overwhelming, as in the case of calorie restriction. It's worth noting that there exist intriguing hints that the underlying biological mechanisms by which these benefits are conferred are different for these two strategies, despite the basic similarity: eating less while still obtaining all the necessary nutrients. Over at the Longevity Meme I recently remarked upon a study showing improvement in heart function and overall health with age as a result of suppressing one gene involved in the calorie restriction response: researchers compared aged mice with a functional p110alpha to aged mice with suppressed p110alpha and found that mice with the suppressed gene had: improved cardiac function; less fibrosis (fibrosis causes the heart to lose flexibility); fewer biological markers of aging; and a pattern of cardiac gene expression like that of younger mice. By way of comparison, here is another study showing much the same result, but achieved through alternate day......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/7F_BODrAwSE%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x006699%26color2%3D0x54abd6&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that you'll watch the entire video, but I will tell you that Obama's words at 23:16 left me able to do nothing but sit and weep.  Specifically, he says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tonight, somewhere in America, a young person, let's say a young man, will struggle to fall to sleep, wrestling alone with a secret he's held as long as he can remember. Soon, perhaps, he will decide it's time to let that secret out. What happens next depends on him, his family, as well as his friends and his teachers and his community. But it also depends on us -- on the kind of society we engender, the kind of future we build.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so, so sorry that you went to sleep so many nights in the room next door with that secret. I'm sorry you felt alone.  I'm sorry you felt different.  I am sorry that you were afraid for so many years to tell anyone and I'm sorry that you know what it feels like to belong to a group that is afforded no protection in our society.  A group belittled &lt;a href="http://current.com/items/91120515_thats-gay-no-homo.htm"&gt;in our society so frequently&lt;/a&gt;, in ways that no other group is subjected to, that it has become accepted and common place.  Even &amp;quot;funny.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, thank you for telling me.  Thank you for letting me tell you, &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot; in reply.  Not, &amp;quot;I love you anyway.&amp;quot;  Not, &amp;quot;I love you no matter what.&amp;quot; Not, &amp;quot;It doesn&amp;#39;t matter to me.&amp;quot;  Just that I love you.  I loved you then.  I love you now.  I&amp;#39;ll love you tomorrow, because you&amp;#39;re the same person you&amp;#39;ve always been. Thank you for letting me know you better, for letting my son know you, be proud of you, and see you as the role model I know that you will be, and for giving me the opportunity to love the people who are important to you.&lt;br&gt;

While it is by no means a comprehensive documentation of all the  evidence for evolution, it does touch on many fallacies and arguments  often put forth against evolution. However, it does much more than  this. It describes, in classic Dawkins style, a rather broad sample of  the fossil, molecular, biogeographical, embryological, and  experimental evidence for evolution ranging from &lt;a href="http://myxo.css.msu.edu/index.html"&gt;Lenski’s  experiments&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/~jetterso/documents/Endler1980.pdf"&gt;Endler’s guppy experiments&lt;/a&gt; and many others. Even those that have taken college courses in  evolutionary biology, but have not kept up with the literature of the  past decade or so would greatly benefit from this book. While I  disagree with many of Dawkins’ metaphors, such as DNA “code” and other &lt;a href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/falsehoods-collection/"&gt;falsehoods&lt;/a&gt;, I nevertheless think these falsehoods are useful in the introductory style or writing in which they are used for only a basic introduction. In fact, I may  even go so far as to say these are necessary for this particular  target audience. For those of you at least moderately familiar with evolutionary biology, Dawkins may not tell you anything new (or he may), but his manner of explaining this demonstrates, if nothing else, a useful model in how to present this information to the uninformed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit I am genuinely unimpressed with this book in terms of information contained within it (I knew about pretty much everything he covered except for the lack of fossil flatworms and a few other points), but I am very impressed with what I have learned reading between the lines regarding how Dawkins presents this information.&lt;/p&gt;

Oaks of the Mormon Church has made some &lt;a href="http://www.fox13now.com/news/kstu-mormon-leader-religious-freedom-at-risk,0,648952.story"&gt;interesting remarks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview Monday before the speech, Oaks said he did not consider it provocative to compare the treatment of Mormons in the election's aftermath to that of blacks in the civil rights era, and said he stands by the analogy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;"It may be offensive to some -- maybe because it hadn't occurred to them that they were putting themselves in the same category as people we deplore from that bygone era,"&lt;/span&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you get that? He thinks the Mormons, who are trying to deny a civil right to another minority and reserve it to themselves, are exactly like a minority that were denied a civil right and had to fight to get their equality recognized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not offended. I've just determined that the elders of the Mormon Church are a collection of antiquated, dumb old bigots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So…when can we start taxing the Mormon temples? And when is California going to kick their regressive, but intrusive, little butts out of the state? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/the_mormon_leadership_demonstr.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/n7Vjh3wsn4o" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255487383944"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/583f5c8d39904eb3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Resveratrol - Wine Not Take a Miracle Pill to Live Longer?</title><published>2009-10-14T02:00:18Z</published><updated>2009-10-14T02:00:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/735-resveratrol-wine-not-take-a-miracle-pill-to-live-longer.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;People who drink red wine in moderation tend to live longer than those who abstain from alcohol entirely.

First it’s to the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo, which is hosting the &lt;a href="http://www.q2cfestival.com/"&gt;Quantum to Cosmos Festival&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s ten days of fun and big ideas, and best of all it will all be recorded and streamed live.  Check out the program &lt;a href="http://www.q2cfestival.com/program"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I’ll be participating in a &lt;a href="http://www.q2cfestival.com/program&amp;amp;lecture_id=7976"&gt;panel discussion on big ideas&lt;/a&gt; Thursday night, and giving a &lt;a href="http://www.q2cfestival.com/program&amp;amp;lecture_id=7731"&gt;popular talk on the arrow of time&lt;/a&gt; Saturday night.  But there’s also a promising &lt;a href="http://www.q2cfestival.com/program&amp;amp;lecture_id=7725"&gt;panel discussion on cosmology&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday (moderated by my favorite science writer), as well as interesting-looking talks by people like Peter Diamandis, Jim Gates, Neil Gershenfeld, Cory Doctorow, and even the other Sean Carroll.  Plenty of fun to go around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it’s off to the Francophone sector with me, where I’ll be visiting McGill University in Montreal to give another &lt;a href="http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/seminars/PSC_carroll.html"&gt;public talk&lt;/a&gt; on Monday night.  I don’t know of any recordings there, but the talk won’t be that different from Saturday’s.  But if there are any CV readers in Montreal, be sure to say hi!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255485202029"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/10/totally-trivial-and-selfabsorbed.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b212f552cdb5fe0b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="House"/><title type="html">Totally Trivial and Self-Absorbed</title><published>2009-10-14T01:24:07Z</published><updated>2009-10-14T01:24:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/10/totally-trivial-and-selfabsorbed.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;California had the first storm of the season, and it was a doozie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My backyard was flooded.

From the right and behind is not Jerry’s good side. Or at least not a side from which he is very recognizable.

&lt;p&gt;(Added note: in the original post, I spelled Russell with one ‘l’– now corrected.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007416" title=""&gt;Chimpanzees Help Each Other upon Request&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The evolution of altruism has been explained mainly from ultimate perspectives. However, it remains to be investigated from a proximate point of view how and in which situations such social propensity is achieved. We investigated chimpanzees' targeted helping in a tool transfer paradigm, and discuss the similarities and differences in altruism between humans and chimpanzees. Previously it has been suggested that chimpanzees help human experimenters by retrieving an object which the experimenter is trying to reach. In the present study, we investigated the importance of communicative interactions between chimpanzees themselves and the influence of conspecific partner's request on chimpanzees' targeted helping. We presented two tool-use situations (a stick-use situation and a straw-use situation) in two adjacent booths, and supplied non-corresponding tools to paired chimpanzees in the two booths. For example, a chimpanzee in the stick-use situation was supplied with a straw, and the partner in the straw-use situation possessed a stick. Spontaneous tool transfer was observed between paired chimpanzees. The tool transfer events occurred predominantly following recipients' request. Even without any hope of reciprocation from the partner, the chimpanzees continued to help the partner as long as the partner required help. These results provide further evidence for altruistic helping in chimpanzees in the absence of direct personal gain or even immediate reciprocation. Our findings additionally highlight the importance of request as a proximate mechanism motivating prosocial behavior in chimpanzees whether between kin or non-kin individuals and the possible confounding effect of dominance on the symmetry of such interactions. Finally, in contrast to humans, our study suggests that chimpanzees rarely perform acts of voluntary altruism. Voluntary altruism in chimpanzees is not necessarily prompted by simple observation of another's struggle to attain a goal and therefore an accurate understanding of others' desires in the absence of communicative signals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007404" title=""&gt;Understanding Ancient Hominin Dispersals Using Artefactual Data: A Phylogeographic Analysis of Acheulean Handaxes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Reconstructing the dispersal patterns of extinct hominins remains a challenging but essential goal. One means of supplementing fossil evidence is to utilize archaeological evidence in the form of stone tools. Based on broad dating patterns, it has long been thought that the appearance of Acheulean handaxe technologies outside of Africa was the result of hominin dispersals, yet independent tests of this hypothesis remain rare. Cultural transmission theory leads to a prediction of a strong African versus non-African phylogeographic pattern in handaxe datasets, if the African Acheulean hypothesis is to be supported. Here, this prediction is tested using an intercontinental dataset of Acheulean handaxes and a biological phylogenetic method (maximum parsimony). The analyses produce a tree consistent with the phylogeographic prediction. Moreover, a bootstrap analysis provides evidence that this pattern is robust, and the maximum parsimony tree is also shown to be statistically different from a tree constrained by stone raw materials. These results demonstrate that nested analyses of behavioural data, utilizing methods drawn from biology, have the potential to shed light on ancient hominin dispersals. This is an encouraging prospect for human palaeobiology since sample sizes for lithic artefacts are many orders of magnitude higher than those of fossil data. These analyses also suggest that the sustained occurrence of Acheulean handaxe technologies in regions such as Europe and the Indian subcontinent resulted from dispersals by African hominin populations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007402" title=""&gt;Understanding Others' Regret: A fMRI Study&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Previous studies showed that the understanding of others' basic emotional experiences is based on a "resonant" mechanism, i.e., on the reactivation, in the observer's brain, of the cerebral areas associated with those experiences. The present study aimed to investigate whether the same neural mechanism is activated both when experiencing and attending complex, cognitively-generated, emotions. A gambling task and functional-Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging (fMRI) were used to test this hypothesis using regret, the negative cognitively-based emotion resulting from an unfavorable counterfactual comparison between the outcomes of chosen and discarded options. Do the same brain structures that mediate the experience of regret become active in the observation of situations eliciting regret in another individual? Here we show that observing the regretful outcomes of someone else's choices activates the same regions that are activated during a first-person experience of regret, i.e. the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus. These results extend the possible role of a mirror-like mechanism beyond basic emotions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007400" title=""&gt;Mapping Oil and Gas Development Potential in the US Intermountain West and Estimating Impacts to Species&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many studies have quantified the indirect effect of hydrocarbon-based economies on climate change and biodiversity, concluding that a significant proportion of species will be threatened with extinction. However, few studies have measured the direct effect of new energy production infrastructure on species persistence. We propose a systematic way to forecast patterns of future energy development and calculate impacts to species using spatially-explicit predictive modeling techniques to estimate oil and gas potential and create development build-out scenarios by seeding the landscape with oil and gas wells based on underlying potential. We illustrate our approach for the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in the western US and translate the build-out scenarios into estimated impacts on sage-grouse. We project that future oil and gas development will cause a 7-19 percent decline from 2007 sage-grouse lek population counts and impact 3.7 million ha of sagebrush shrublands and 1.1 million ha of grasslands in the study area. Maps of where oil and gas development is anticipated in the US Intermountain West can be used by decision-makers intent on minimizing impacts to sage-grouse. This analysis also provides a general framework for using predictive models and build-out scenarios to anticipate impacts to species. These predictive models and build-out scenarios allow tradeoffs to be considered between species conservation and energy development prior to implementation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007423" title=""&gt;Species-Specific Traits Rather Than Resource Partitioning Mediate Diversity Effects on Resource Use&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The link between biodiversity and ecosystem processes has firmly been established, but the mechanisms underpinning this relationship are poorly documented. Most studies have focused on terrestrial plant systems where resource use can be difficult to quantify as species rely on a limited number of common resources. Investigating resource use at the bulk level may not always be of sufficient resolution to detect subtle differences in resource use, as species-specific nutritional niches at the biochemical level may also moderate diversity effects on resource use. Here we use three co-occurring marine benthic echinoderms (Brissopsis lyrifera, Mesothuria intestinalis, Parastichopus tremulus) that feed on the same phytodetrital food source, to determine whether resource partitioning is the principal mechanism underpinning diversity effects on resource use. Specifically we investigate the use of phytodetrital pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) because many of these are essential for biological functions, including reproduction. Pigments were identified and quantified using reverse-phase high performance liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and data were analysed using a combination of extended linear regression with generalised least squares (GLS) estimation and standard multivariate techniques. Our analyses reveal no species-specific selectivity for particular algal pigments, confirming that these three species do not partition food resources at the biochemical level. Nevertheless, we demonstrate increased total resource use in diverse treatments as a result of selection effects and the dominance of one species (B. lyrifera). Overall, we found no evidence for resource partitioning at the biochemical level, as pigment composition was similar between individuals, which is likely due to plentiful food availability. Reduced intra-specific competition in the species mixture combined with greater adsorption efficiency and differences in feeding behaviour likely explain the dominant use of resources by B. lyrifera.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007460" title=""&gt;Ecological Equivalence: A Realistic Assumption for Niche Theory as a Testable Alternative to Neutral Theory&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hubbell's 2001 neutral theory unifies biodiversity and biogeography by modelling steady-state distributions of species richness and abundances across spatio-temporal scales. Accurate predictions have issued from its core premise that all species have identical vital rates. Yet no ecologist believes that species are identical in reality. Here I explain this paradox in terms of the ecological equivalence that species must achieve at their coexistence equilibrium, defined by zero net fitness for all regardless of intrinsic differences between them. I show that the distinction of realised from intrinsic vital rates is crucial to evaluating community resilience. An analysis of competitive interactions reveals how zero-sum patterns of abundance emerge for species with contrasting life-history traits as for identical species. I develop a stochastic model to simulate community assembly from a random drift of invasions sustaining the dynamics of recruitment following deaths and extinctions. Species are allocated identical intrinsic vital rates for neutral dynamics, or random intrinsic vital rates and competitive abilities for niche dynamics either on a continuous scale or between dominant-fugitive extremes. Resulting communities have steady-state distributions of the same type for more or less extremely differentiated species as for identical species. All produce negatively skewed log-normal distributions of species abundance, zero-sum relationships of total abundance to area, and Arrhenius relationships of species to area. Intrinsically identical species nevertheless support fewer total individuals, because their densities impact as strongly on each other as on themselves. Truly neutral communities have measurably lower abundance/area and higher species/abundance ratios. Neutral scenarios can be parameterized as null hypotheses for testing competitive release, which is a sure signal of niche dynamics. Ignoring the true strength of interactions between and within species risks a substantial misrepresentation of community resilience to habitat loss.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_203.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/hV_hjUrUepY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255476642505"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/10/installed-the-pidgin-microblog/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/73833da0aa546a16</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">installed the Pidgin microblog…</title><published>2009-10-13T23:17:29Z</published><updated>2009-10-13T23:17:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/10/installed-the-pidgin-microblog/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;installed the Pidgin microblog plugin, a little more functional than plain ol’ xmpp&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255475623118"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=3420">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1d1e04aefc947439</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Politics and Science"/><category term="health care"/><category term="olympia snowe"/><title type="html">Maverick</title><published>2009-10-13T22:56:59Z</published><updated>2009-10-13T22:56:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/10/13/maverick/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/health/policy/14health.html?hp"&gt;&lt;img title="478px-Olympia_Snowe,_official_photo_2" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2009/10/478px-Olympia_Snowe_official_photo_2.JPG" alt="478px-Olympia_Snowe,_official_photo_2" width="360" height="450"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sheril Kirshenbaum</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255473031694"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/10/ubuntu-takes-45-seconds-to-de/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/26d75c6f44de70a7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">#ubuntu takes 45 seconds to de…</title><published>2009-10-13T22:23:01Z</published><updated>2009-10-13T22:23:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/10/ubuntu-takes-45-seconds-to-de/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;#ubuntu takes 45 seconds to decide that eth0 doesn’t have a wire attached every boot, how can I tell it to stop doing that?

&lt;p&gt;It would be Bill Donohue waxing apoplectic over that video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah! My prayers are answered!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comedian Sarah Silverman appeared on Bill Maher&amp;#39;s HBO show on October 9 attacking the Vatican. She began her monologue bemoaning the plight of world hunger, and then found a solution: &amp;quot;What is the Vatican worth, like 500 billion dollars? This is great, sell the Vatican, take a big chunk of the money, build a gorgeous condominium for you and all your friends to live in…and with the money left over, feed the whole f---ing world.&amp;quot;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Speaking of the pope, Silverman continued, &amp;quot;You preach to live humbly, and I totally agree. So, now maybe it&amp;#39;s time for you to move out of your house that is a city. On an ego level alone, you will be the biggest hero in the history of ever. And by the way, any involvement in the Holocaust, bygones….&amp;quot;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Silverman closed by saying, "If you sell the Vatican, and you take that money, and you use it to feed every single human being on the planet, you will get crazy p---y. All the p---y."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
Catholic League president Bill Donohue responds as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Silverman's assault on Catholicism is just another example of HBO's corporate irresponsibility. Time and again, if it's not Bill Maher thrashing the Catholic Church, it's one of his guests. There is obviously something pathological going on there: Silverman's filthy diatribe would never be allowed if the chosen target were the Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem and the state of Israel.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here's a reality check for Silverman: the Catholic Church operates more hospitals and feeds more of the poor than any private institution in the world. It also saved more Jews during the Holocaust than any other institution in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.atheists.org/The_Question_of_Atheists_Hospitals"&gt;Factcheck time&lt;/a&gt;, Bill!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In America, as of 1999, 13% of all hospitals were religious (totaling 18% of all hospital beds); that's 604 out of 4,573 hospitals. [6] Despite the presence of organized religion in America, the Church has managed to scrape together only a few hospitals. Of these 604 hospitals many are a product of mergers with public, non-sectarian hospitals. Not all of these 604 hospitals are Catholic; many are Baptist, Methodist, Shriner (Masonic), Jewish, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Despite the religious label, these so-called religious hospitals are more public than public hospitals. Religious hospitals get 36% of all their revenue from Medicare; public hospitals get only 27%. In addition to that 36% of public funding they get 12% of their funding from Medicaid. Of the remaining 44% of funding, 31% comes from county appropriations, 30% comes from investments, and only 5% comes from charitable contributions (not necessarily religious).

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had permission to post a submission that has been sent to the Pittilo consultation. The whole document can be &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Pittilo_consultation-AvP.pdf"&gt;downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;. I have removed the name of the author.  It is written by the person who has made some excellent contributions to this blog under the pseudonym &amp;quot;Allo V Psycho&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document is a model of clarity, and it ends with  constructive suggestions for forms of regulation that will, unlike the Pittilo proposals, really protect  patients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the summary. The full document explains each point in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive Summary &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Statutory regulation lends prestige, but needs to be  balanced by a requirement for practitioners to be competent, as is the case for  doctors and nurses. Regulation almost exclusively deals with conduct, but the  unique risks posed by alternative medicine are not addressed by this. The harms  which will arise from licensing practitioners who are not required to show  evidence of competence and efficacy are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harm 1.&lt;/strong&gt; Misdiagnosis of serious conditions.  Alternative practitioners offer to diagnose illnesses without proper training. This can lead to avoidable death, such as treating an ectopic pregnancy with ginger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harm 2.&lt;/strong&gt; Withdrawal from  treatment. Clients of alternative practitioners risk being encouraged to withdraw from life saving treatments in favours of treatments without evidence, as in the death of baby Gloria Thomas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harm 3.&lt;/strong&gt; Harms arising from the nature of the alternative practice, but not covered by the regulatory framework, such as adulterated herbal remedies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harm 4.&lt;/strong&gt;  Lack of informed consent. If alternative practitioners are not required to study or show evidence of efficacy, how can they inform patients of their options?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harm 5.&lt;/strong&gt; Equity. Doctors and nurses have to use evidence based methods, but it is proposed that alternative practitioners are not held to this standard. Is this fair? Health Minsters should ask themselves if they advocate withdrawing the requirement for evidence based treatment from doctors and nurses. If not, why not? And if not, why should alternative practitioners be treated differently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harm 6.&lt;/strong&gt; Promotion of irrationality. If no evidence of efficacy is required, where do you draw       the line? Witch doctoring is a ‘traditional practice’ in communities in the UK, and astrology is used by some herbal healers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harm 7&lt;/strong&gt;. Opportunity Costs. If no evidence of efficacy is required of alternative medicine, significant sums will be wasted by individuals and by the NHS. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harm 8&lt;/strong&gt;. Reputational harms for UK Higher Education. UK Honours Degrees are based on the ability to think critically and to assess evidence. Alternative medicine Degree programmes do not require this. These positions are not compatible. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harm 9&lt;/strong&gt;.  Health care futures. We are making slow but steady progress on health indicators through the use of evidence based  methods. Why should the requirement for evidence be abandoned now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead, safe regulation of alternative practitioners  should be through:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Medicines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthcare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agency &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Office of Trading Standards&lt;/strong&gt; via the Unfair Trading Consumer Protection Regulations,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;new Health Advertising Standards Authority&lt;/strong&gt;, modelled on the successful Cancer Act 1939.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two recommendations for effcective regulation are much the same as mine, but the the third one is interesting.  The problem with the Cancer Act (1939), and with the Unfair Trading regulations, is that they are applied very erratically.  They are the responsibility of local Trading Standards offices, who have, as a rule, neither the expertise nor the time to enforce them effectively.  A &lt;strong&gt;Health Advertising Standards Authority&lt;/strong&gt; could perhaps take over the role of enforcing existing laws.  But it should be an authority with teeth.  It should have the ability to prosecute.  The existinbg Advertising Standards Authority produces, on the whole, excellent judgements but it is quite ineffective because it can do very little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A letter from an acupuncturist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a remarkable letter recently from someone who actually practises acupuncture. Here are some extracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I very much enjoy reading your Improbable Science blog. It’s great to see good old-fashioned logic being applied incisively to the murk and spin that passes for government “thinking” these days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s interesting that the British Acupuncture Council are in favour of statutory regulation. The reason is, as you have pointed out, that this will confer a respectability on them, and will be used as a lever to try to get NHS funding for acupuncture. Indeed, the BAcC’s mission statement includes a line “To contribute to the development of healthcare policy both now and in the future”, which is a huge joke when they clearly haven’t got the remotest idea about the issues involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Before anything is decided on statutory regulation, the British Acupuncture Council is trying to get a Royal Charter. If this is achieved, it will be seen as a significant boost to their respectability and, by implication, the validity of state-funded acupuncture. The argument will be that if Physios and O.T.s are Chartered and safe to work in the NHS, then why should Chartered Acupuncturists be treated differently? A postal vote of 2,700 BAcC members is under-way now and they are being urged to vote “yes”. The fact that the Privy Council are even considering it, is surprising when the BAcC does not even meet the requirement that the institution should have a minimum of 5000 members (&lt;a href="http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page45.asp"&gt;http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page45.asp&lt;/a&gt;). Chartered status is seen as a significant stepping-stone in strengthening their negotiating hand in the run-up to statutory regulation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “Whatever the efficacy of acupuncture, I would hate to see scarce NHS resources spent on well-meaning, but frequently gormless acupuncturists when there’s no money for the increasing costs of medical technology or proven life-saving pharmaceuticals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
“The fact that universities are handing out a science degree in acupuncture is a testament to how devalued tertiary education has become since my day. An acupuncture degree cannot be called “scientific” in any normal sense of the term. The truth is that most acupuncturists have a poor understanding of the form of TCM taught in P.R.China, and hang on to a confused grasp of oriental concepts mixed in with a bit of New Age philosophy and trendy nutritional/life-coach advice that you see trotted out by journalists in the women’s weeklies. This casual eclectic approach is accompanied by a complete lack of intellectual rigour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My view is that acupuncturists might help people who have not been helped by NHS interventions, but, in my experience, it has very little to do with the application of a proven set of clinical principles (alternative or otherwise). Some patients experience remission of symptoms and I’m sure that is, in part, bound up with the psychosomatic effects of good listening, and non-judgemental kindness. In that respect, the woolly-minded thinking of most traditional acupuncturists doesn’t really matter, they’re relatively harmless and well-meaning, a bit like hair-dressers. But just because you trust your hairdresser, it doesn’t mean hairdressers deserve the Privy Council’s Royal Charter or that they need to be regulated by the government because their clients are somehow supposedly “vulnerable”.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I don&amp;#39;t know why I didn&amp;#39;t think of this earlier -- it&amp;#39;s great footage, and deserves to be seen more widely.

A female yucca moth mates, then collects pollen from a yucca flower in specialized mouthparts. She carries it to another flower where, as shown in the video, she drills into the floral pistil with her ovipositor and lays eggs inside, then climbs to the tip of the pistil and applies pollen to fertilize the flower. When the flower develops into a fruit, the eggs hatch and the caterpillars eat some of the seeds inside.

Yuccas and yucca moths are completely dependent on each other [PDF] -- nothing else pollinates yuccas, and the moths have no other source of food (they don&amp;#39;t eat as adults). Recently, the Pellmyr lab has shown that this interaction may be leading to speciation in one yucca species, the Joshua tree -- Joshua trees pollinated by two different species of yucca moths have differently-shaped flowers [PDF], but these two tree types may not be totally genetically isolated [PDF]. I&amp;#39;ve written about this work before -- for more information about the interaction, check out Olle&amp;#39;s publication page.

Usually AiG simply refers to me as &amp;quot;the Professor&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the atheist&amp;quot;, but in their latest screed they actually mention me by name…and they even spell it correctly! Of course, &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2009/10/13/prof-reveals-truth-scripture"&gt;they get everything else wrong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A well-known University of Minnesota-Morris professor who has a history of hate speech against creationists—especially Answers in Genesis and the Creation Museum1—inadvertently admitted recently that we were not wrong. This was kind of a blessing in disguise and also reveals much about his character. Professor Paul (P.Z.) Myers said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="font-family:Georgia"&gt;First, there is no moral law: the universe is a nasty, heartless place where most things wouldn't mind killing you if you let them. No one is compelled to be nice; you or anyone could go on a murder spree, and all that is stopping you is your self-interest (it is very destructive to your personal bliss to knock down your social support system) and the self-interest of others, who would try to stop you. There is nothing 'out there' that imposes morality on you, other than local, temporary conditions, a lot of social enculturation, and probably a bit of genetic hardwiring that you've inherited from ancestors who lived under similar conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myers admits there is no morality or anying that imposes it either (i.e., God) in his worldview. This means that from his own worldview, there is no such thing as right and wrong. Accordingly, this means that there must be nothing wrong with teaching the truth of creation as revealed in the Bible. Ironically, perhaps, it also means that there is nothing wrong in showing the problems with false religions like humanism and evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They still couldn't bear to actually link to the article in question; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/morality_doesnt_equal_god.php"&gt;here it is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their article still goes awry at the very first sentence. I am definitely not saying that they were not wrong, and there was nothing inadvertent about my post. Seriously, I don't sneeze and a grammatically correct blog entry pops out accidentally, or something. I actually have to invest a microsecond or three in thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets worse in the sentence right after they quote me. There is morality in my &amp;#39;worldview&amp;#39;; don&amp;#39;t confuse the fact that I state baldly that there is no external non-human intelligent agent that imposes morality on me with an absence of moral thought. I derive my sense of what is right and wrong from intrinsic properties such as empathy and other social impulses, and from acculturation in a stable, successful society that has expectations of parents to introduce their children to what constitutes reasonable behavior. I also derive it rationally from what I can see as a robust strategy for long term security and happiness within my culture — that is, robbing banks has a very poor long term return on the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I do believe in right and wrong. It's just not handed down from a magical sky-lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, but wait…I just noticed. This isn&amp;#39;t a serious article from AiG, it&amp;#39;s a comedy routine. That phrase, &lt;span&gt;"the truth of creation as revealed in the Bible"&lt;/span&gt;, should have tipped me off. There is no truth in the Bible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never mind, just laugh. Well, laugh weakly. It's still not a very good routine, but at least the clowns at AiG are trying out some new material.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/answers_in_genesis_mentions_th.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/5uDLCyiQcYo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255468308117"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/stay_tuned_to_npr_on_thursday.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b805e0ba589409be</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">Stay tuned to NPR on Thursday</title><published>2009-10-13T19:59:42Z</published><updated>2009-10-13T19:59:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/sFVclY2ALIU/stay_tuned_to_npr_on_thursday.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/stay_tuned_to_npr_on_thursday.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Barbara Bradley Hagerty felt obligated to go find some rambunctious New Atheist for her series on religion on NPR, and guess who she scavenged up?

&lt;p&gt;This is obviously true, and i’ve been saying this for a long time.  And I’m not talking about the butt-slaps and sharing chewing tobacco and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a certain extent, digit ratios seem to be a reasonable indicator of the kinds of hormonal environment in which a person develops in utero.  It turns out that the indicator of homosexuality is the same as the indicator of athleticism, only turned up even more.  In other words, a certain kind of hormonal environment in which a male fetuses develops can result in a higher likelihood of that person growing up to be an athlete.  But if that hormonal “conditioning” is turned up a bit more, you get a higher likelihood of that person being gay.  How strong is this effect?  Well, it’s statistically significant but not large.  Is it genetic? That is not at all clear.  How does this work with women?  That’s not clear either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, from this we can speculate that there should be a higher percentage of gay-osity among athletes than among other men.  And now there is some new information that supports this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A study of former high-school American Football players has found that more than a third said they had had sexual relations with other men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his study of homosexuality among sportsmen in the US, sociologist Dr Eric Anderson found that 19 in a sample of 47 had taken part in acts intended to sexually arouse other men, ranging from kissing to mutual masturbation and oral sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, as always a twist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 47 men, aged 18-23, were all American Football players who previously played at the high school (secondary school) level but had failed to be picked for their university's team and were now cheerleaders instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like George Bush, right?  &lt;/p&gt;

Only 15% are employed full-time, and the NAS says a key problem is a lack of understanding of autism among agency staff who determine eligibility for benefits and provide employment support. NAS wants the British government to introduce autism coordinators who would work with frontline staff, local employers and employment support services, including services to obtain Britain’s new Employment and Support Allowance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the government has pledged support and says it will an autism strategy “in due course,” one’s first reaction might be that these people have gone without enough in life – including living with an overall view in society that they can contribute. Imagine too the uproar if the overall unemployment rate in this or any other country hit 85% in a given sector of the population?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mother of a 7-year-old boy with autism and a severe peanut allergy has filed a lawsuit claiming a teacher tossed her son a peanut-filled Mr. Goodbar candy bar in hopes of sickening him and keeping him from going on a zoo field trip, according to &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jz40lAv8lDbug_Z92lZNcr35ajLAD9B7UAJ80"&gt;news reports&lt;/a&gt;. The boy didn’t eat the candy bar, but the mom says her son suffered physical and emotional abuse at the hands of his teacher, and filed a lawsuit in Marion County against her son’s Indianapolis school. She also wants criminal charges filed against the teacher, who has denied doing anything to prevent the child from attending the trip or harming any children. The teacher has since resigned from the Perry Township district school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 11-year-old autistic boy died over the weekend after being hit by a truck while trying to cross Highway 99 near Seattle. Cops said the boy was reported missing from his nearby home around 4:30 p.m. Saturday, and a search began. Fifteen minutes later, officials received reports of a boy walking on the shoulder of the northbound lanes of Highway 99. The boy then apparently attempted to cross the freeway and was struck by a one-ton flatbed truck. The driver, who reportedly was going around a curve and could not avoid the boy, wasn’t injured and wasn’t at fault, police said. Our prayers and very deep sadness to all involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great conversation is one of the most satisfying pleasures in life. Some of the best in my recent memory include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can we ever completely grasp how big our universe is--with Wayne&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the history of marriage and how love was only recently considered a necessary prerequisite to the endeavor--with Jamie (a reporter heard this conversation and wrote a piece for NPR about the subject)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;both compromise and tolerance are necessary in living with someone, you gotta know when to use each--mom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hooked into these riveting chats, our brain actually works ahead of the banter, anticipating words that are said by the other person before they even come out of their mouth. I must have previewed the words star or milky way or black hole before my fiance Wayne had even said them. The experience is the same as having actually heard them, according to a recent study by Jos van Berkum at the Max Plank Institute. Van Berkum shows anticipatory brain waves look identical to brain waves of actually experiencing a spoken word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain also consolidates personality traits into stereotypes to speed up understanding in conversation flow. Knowing my friend Jamie very well, if she had said, "I can't wait to get married," instead of, "Im just looking for a good traveling partner right now," i would literally have had a tougher time getting what she was saying. It would have been shocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our brain is always jumping ahead, making judgments and assumptions....is that why great points in conversation are truly revolutionary--they give us new information, perspective, and actually surprise the hell out of us?&lt;/p&gt;

It’s well-written, compelling, and betrays an exceptional intelligence.  It’s also completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The piece is called, “Bias, Racism, and Alternative Medicine”, an intriguing title.  The first part tries to establish that “Western medicine” in one of many ways of understanding health and disease.  She starts with some personal anecdotes—always interesting, rarely generalizable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While receiving Western biomedical treatment for ADD, the side effects of my therapy convinced me that western medication alone would not provide a solution to my problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the author’s fundamental misunderstandings is that the failure of a particular treatment to make her feel better does not invalidate all of medical science, and more important, it does not validate “other ways of thinking”.  Still, I can understand how this happens.  Personal experience is powerful; unfortunately, it is also misleading. I like this writer.  She seems very kind.  She goes on to describe her enlightenment further, but this is where a pleasant anecdote goes terribly wrong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was because eating the wrong kinds of foods, along with other stressors like studying all night, raises the inflammation of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worry for her medical soul.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her statement about inflammation &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/magic.php"&gt;is just flat out wrong&lt;/a&gt;.  If this is what she’s learned from medical school, she deserves a refund.  “Raises inflammation in the body” is simply a meaningless statement.  The author is trying to leverage her anecdotes about medical conditions that naturally wax an wane into a general statement about alternative medicine.  This is a mistake.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first part establishes her belief that so-called Western medicine is missing something, and that “other ways” of understanding disease have value.  Having established that “Western” medicine doesn’t know everything, she tries to explain why this may be, not on the basis of scientific knowledge, but on the basis of cultural hegemony.  Bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But neither am I in the group of Western medicine trained students or doctors who refuse to see other medical systems in their own rights, and therefore cannot make sense of why patients seek alternative treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement rests on a faulty assumption, namely that we “Western” docs have failed to properly examine other medical systems, and have failed to understand why people believe in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand other systems—they are based on false, vitalistic, pre-scientific beliefs about nature.  Understand, that’s not a moral judgment but a factual one.  I also understand why people believe in things.  We all have our own cultural context, our own baggage.  We all wear blinders of one kind or another.  I can’t tell you how many minority patients I’ve had who don’t trust doctors because of larger cultural experiences; it’s a lot though.  But none of this changes what is biologically so.  The fact that the Tuskegee Experiment allowed African American men to suffer and die from untreated syphilis does not change the biology of the spirochete; it changes the relationship of individuals and groups to the system as a whole.  Failing to understand this can lead from one kind of neglect (e.g., Tuskegee) to another (e.g., Ayurveda).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important thing to understand as a scientist (or as an “applied scientist” like a doctor) is that while what we do and how we do it is suffused with cultural biases and stereotypes, the physical reality is not.  We may choose to ignore the genetic and cultural reasons that a minority group is more affected by a particular disease, but the genetics do not change.  This is something the author has yet to learn: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we lump all of these very different systems and practices of medicine into one category called CAM? What are these alternatives to? Missing from the picture is that CAM is only alternative to a Western biomedical system of medicine, and one form of CAM might be considered an alternative by a practitioner of a different CAM. This Eurocentric attitude, that the traditional Western biomedical system is the epitome of medicine itself, exists in even international organizations like WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to the question, “what are these alternatives to?” is “science-based medicine”, not “hegemonic, Eurocentric medical beliefs”.   We consider science-based medicine to be the “default” because it is the one that reflects scientific reality.  This doesn’t diminish the important role played by religio-medical beliefs in many people, but it does place them in the proper context: the are quasi-religious beliefs, not scientific ones, and people hold to them for various cultural and economic reasons—&lt;i&gt;important&lt;/i&gt; reasons, but not science-based reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are Africans and Asians said to use “traditional medicine” but not Europeans or Americans? In America, the Western biomedical system is our tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, our “tradition” has its roots in the vitalistic and humoral beliefs that we held to for most of our history.  Our current understanding explicitly rejects these as pre-scientific and rather than forming a new “tradition” sets tradition aside for a reality-based system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand where writing like this comes from.  Many voices in this world are not heard, especially voices of women, non-whites, and the poor.  These voices are particularly important in medicine, since we do not normally choose to serve only one population (although some do).  The historic dearth of women and minorities in the sciences is an important fact, one that needs fixing for many reasons.  One of these reasons is that we must serve everyone, and to serve everyone it helps to &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; everyone.  Serving may mean understanding where someone’s beliefs come from, and even respecting these beliefs, but it does not mean &lt;i&gt;endorsing&lt;/i&gt; these beliefs.  They may be morally equal beliefs, but they are not scientifically equal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is right when she says we are biased, but not in what way we are biased:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have we really recognized our own bias when evaluating a CAM therapy? We haven’t even removed the biggest bias of all, which is to see the Western biomedical system as the one and only valid form of science and medicine, instead of admitting that it is one system among many. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Our bias is not failing to recognize other ways of knowing, but in failing to treat other human beings with respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brave author closes with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot comment on the efficacy of each non-Western medical system, because I’m not being trained in any of them, and I don’t have the understanding to praise or criticize those systems. Our version of medical reality has receptors, hormones and nerves, etc. Someone else’s medical reality includes energies, meridians, or doshas. We may be so ingrained in the traditional Western biomedical model that we’re unable to make sense of anything that doesn’t use the same concepts or language. However, many patients accurately see that there seems to be different ways of understanding a health condition, and they will choose the one that makes them feel the best at any given point in time. Even if we can’t accept their logic, we’ll have to accept that traditional medicine from other cultures will gain a stronghold in our population, just as we have imposed our traditional medicine on theirs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, as a trained physician and scientist, you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; comment on “non-Western” systems quite effectively.  You are in a special position to do so.  This isn’t about “concepts and language” but truth and non-truth.  To be better physicians and scientist we must understand why people believe what they do, and we must find ways to help our patients take advantage of real medicine in a way that does not violate their basic values.  That is moral.  What is not moral is placing other’s health at risk by declaring all knowledge equal but different, or in someone else’s words, “separate but equal”.  &lt;/p&gt;

There on the side of the road is a check point with uniformed federal agents, a place to pull off, some garbage cans.  I look at the oranges sitting on the floor over on the passenger side and figure ... "better pull off and dump this contraband."

I'm all for anything that helps kids, but c'mon---we can stay ahead.  Even small donations help tons.  For example, if 23 people give $10 each, &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=303878&amp;amp;challengeid=24230"&gt;we can buy a netbook&lt;/a&gt; for a classroom in need.  There are plenty of other proposals from needy Michigan classrooms, too.  Even a couple of bucks will help bring these projects closer to completion.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can give a buck, or twenty of them, that's great, but if you can't, you can still help by tweeting, facebooking, etc. so that more people can hear about &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=24230&amp;amp;category=111"&gt;our projects&lt;/a&gt;.

As you have no doubt noted, I posted a nice, cranky rant this morning.  Shall we examine it dispassionately in the light of day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any doctor who takes care of inpatients walks a fine line.  As most nurses know, docs can be real assholes.  While asshole-ism is never justified, it is sometimes explainable.  Many hospitals are unable or unwilling to implement standing orders for basic comfort measures.  It is theoretically possible to write a ton of "prn" orders to cover any contingency, but it's unlikely.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the non-medical folks, I'd like to explain what nurses and doctors actually do.  Registered nurses, who provide most of the patient care in my hospital, have at least four years of university education and are not simple technicians (we have some of those too).  They are the professionals who spend the most time with the patients, and who have to make most of the calls "on the ground".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inpatient physicians usually round once a day, sometimes twice.  They often have an office practice as well.  Most of us are on call all day, every day.  We take every ER call, every office call, every hospital call.  We must not lash out (at least not often) because, aside from the moral aspect, if we discourage a call for something important, we may hurt someone.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For nurses, there is often a fine line to tread between hospital policy, common sense, and needing to wake a doctor.  Any decent nurse knows when and if they can give out a throat lozenge, but most hospitals will require a written doctor's order.  Where the judgment comes in is in deciding whether something is important enough to warrant calling the doc ASAP.  One commenter pointed out that since we physicians must take call as part of our lives, we should suck it up.  This is half true.  I don't have a lot of choice but to be on call every day.  I know the nurses, and most exercise exquisite judgment.  We all have had the experiences, though, of being awakened for "low BUN", "I woke up the patient to ask them if they want a sleeping pill", etc. These are thankfully rare, but not rare enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hospital has been pretty good about pulling physicians aside and having a conversation when their behavior is not so wonderful.  But there is, at many hospitals, no mechanism for addressing minor problems at night, other than having a nurse decide whether to wake a physician.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of us who take care of our own patients in the hospital rarely do it for the money---the payments are negligible compared to the time.  We do it because our patients like it.  If the system, including nurses with questionable judgment, makes it even more difficult, there will be no one left to care for you but hospitalists whom you've never met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that many  see doctors as arrogant, unfeeling, rude, or whatever, but doctors are actually human beings, as you so often remind us.  It is not unreasonable to expect to be treated with the same respect as any other professional.  Few of my patients would ever think to wake me for a sore throat---it would never occur to them.  Most people wouldn't call their accountant at home at midnight when they open their mail to find an IRS audit. But then judgment can only rarely be taught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know I'm just pissing you all off even more, but hey, if I only wrote stuff you agreed with, why would you even bother?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/mea_culpa---a_cranky_doctor_sp.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/fFJne3RZ1p0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255463094267"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/i_was_in_a_movie.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a2b632a40b20cb09</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Video"/><title type="html">I was in a movie!</title><published>2009-10-13T19:59:12Z</published><updated>2009-10-13T19:59:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/i_was_in_a_movie.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Barney: Next they're gonna show my movie. 
&lt;br&gt;Bart: You made a movie ? 
&lt;br&gt;Barney: I made a movie? I wonder why there was a picture of me on the cover of Entertainment Weekly. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Earlier this year, a documentary film challenge was issued internationally.  The goal was to make a movie about one of this year's two themes: hope or fear.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of Oregon filmmakers, &lt;a href="http://www.vimeo.com/cingulatesystem"&gt;The Cingulate System&lt;/a&gt;, called me up at work and asked if they could interview me for their film about Dark Matter.    The challenge was to make a documentary, from scratch, in under a week.  The film premiered April 8th right &lt;a href="http://www.hollywoodtheatre.org/engaging/index.html"&gt;here in Portland&lt;/a&gt;.  (You may noticed the very-infrequently-updated "events" portion of this page still reflects that.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it isn't &lt;a href="http://www.videosift.com/video/Barney-Gumbles-Movie"&gt;quite the same as Barney's movie&lt;/a&gt;, it is &lt;b&gt;short&lt;/b&gt; (under 8 minutes).  It's also informative and pretty entertaining, and somehow I find myself with a ton of screen time!  Who knew?!  It's also one of the last recordings of me with hair.  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9IYqmMhEu0&amp;amp;feature=player_profilepage"&gt;Have a look&lt;/a&gt;:

Hi Richard,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently organized for my body to be donated to science when I die. It will go to the nearest University for use by trainee doctors. I feel that my body would be better off used for the benefit of other people rather than just buried and wasted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem I have is that my parents, particularly my mother isn’t happy with this and is having trouble accepting my wishes. My father is an atheist but my mother likes to conform to the Anglican way of doing things. How can I make her understand my humanist point of view? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Dan,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I commend you for a level of generosity that will reach beyond your lifespan.  To give so freely to strangers a gift so intimate, to give literally &lt;em&gt;of yourself&lt;/em&gt; is deeply inspiring and praiseworthy.  I hope that everyone reading your letter makes the same arrangements, as I did long ago.  My spare parts are pretty shopworn, but if what’s left can help medical students learn to help the living, hey that’s fine with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s dispel any notion that the Anglican Church has any objections to donating one’s body to science. If that is all the problem is for your mother, this will be fairly easy to resolve, but I think that this may not be what is really troubling her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I searched several sources about the funerary customs of the Anglican and Episcopal churches, and I found this from a &lt;a href="http://www.goodshepherdbuf.org/Burial_guide_Revision.pdf"&gt;handbook about funerals&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) at the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd in Buffalo, NY:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
DISPOSITION OF THE BODY&lt;br&gt;
There are three basic options for the disposition of the body, all fully acceptable in the tradition of the Episcopal Church:&lt;br&gt;
1. Donation of the body to science and/or parts of the body for transplant.&lt;br&gt;
2. Burial or entombment of the body.&lt;br&gt;
3. Cremation, with several options for the disposition of ashes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found these passages in a &lt;a href="http://fredericton.anglican.org/pgrbay/burials/burials.html"&gt;pamphlet about funerary customs&lt;/a&gt; published by the Anglican Diocese of Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The chief emphasis of Christian Burial should be not upon death but on Life Eternal…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…In the making of Funeral arrangements, we are reminded as Christians of the simplicity of our Lord’s own burial… &lt;strong&gt;Any undue concern about the body is a worldly and pagan emphasis, not a Christian one.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as far as I can tell, the Anglican Church has no official opposition to you giving your body as a gift to help the rest of us.  You might want to speak with someone in the Church who has specific knowledge and authority, just to be sure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps your mother’s unhappiness over this is not about religion, but a very basic human characteristic, her attachment to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She bore you, your body came from her body. She carried, held, protected and suckled you.  More than anyone else in the world, she has an intense connection and identification with your physical body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking with your mother about the disposition of your body can bring  up for her or any parent a deep, instinctive aversion to even the thought of the death of their child. The fact that she is more likely to die before you does not reduce this visceral reaction against the idea that you will be no more. She wants there to be something left of you.  Your body that she so lovingly grew and protected must somehow continue.  The idea of your body being completely gone in any form, not even as a few bones in a grave, is too real, too stark, too final, too bereft for her.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She may have troubling thoughts about “strangers” handling your body, and unpleasant visions of what will be done with it.  These thoughts will also trigger that same protective instinct.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our intellects may tell us that our lost loved one’s body is not what we should cling to and cherish.  But our own bodies, being the living, uninterrupted continuation of cells for billions of years, are far older than our puny little intellects, and so they have their own very powerful priorities.  Primal grief and longing for the physical presence of our loved ones can utterly trump our minds’ attempts to reconcile the loss.  Rational thought takes a very long time to have any soothing effect at all on such heartache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing only upon your brief letter, I may be making more of her instinctive anguish than is really there, but regardless of how strongly this distress is affecting her, if it is at all, my suggestions of what to do will be the same:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, find enough printed material, or get some pastoral support to be able to set aside any concern she has about “conforming to the Anglican way of doing things.”  If that is all there is to it, then she’ll be satisfied that it’s not against the teachings.  Be prepared to describe a memorial service that would be acceptable to both of you, one that would not require the presence of your body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then begin to talk to her about your humanist values, about compassion, respect, commitment to truth, equality, and promoting freedom.   She is probably proud of you, as most parents are prone to be proud of their children, and she is probably especially proud of the good things that you do in your life. Your life is not made meaningful by your body doing all that breathing, eating and digesting, it’s made meaningful by what you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; with it, and in your case, as a humanist, by practicing those humanist values for the benefit of others. Describe for her examples of how you put those values into action. Then show her how in this last act of yours, your death will share the same purpose as did your life, to be of service to your fellow human beings in any way you can.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By donating your body to science, you will be adding one more piece to the positive effect, the positive influence, the &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; that your life has already had, and that benefit will last beyond your physical life.  Regardless of who outlives whom, that will be something unique to you and beautiful about you for your mother to cling to, to be proud of, to focus her love upon. Her son is a man who makes the world around him a little better because of the way he lives, from beginning to end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to her concerns carefully, ask open-ended questions about her feelings, accept her feelings without arguing against them, and respond with love and respect. Simply the ability to make her thoughts and feelings more clearly understood may help to reduce whatever is the root of her objection to your unselfish bequest to your larger family, humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;How’s this for any irony? David Michaels, President Obama’s nominee to head the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), has written a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Doubt-Their-Product-Industrys-Threatens/dp/019530067X"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, published by Oxford University press, documenting how industry manufactures doubts that chemicals harm people by accusing regulators and plaintiff lawyers of relying of “junk science” instead of “sound science.” Now, after Michaels has exposed this effort as a public relations campaign that mischaracterizes how science actually works, he is being attacked on the grounds, you guessed it, of favoring &lt;a href="http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/07/occupational-hazard/"&gt;junk science&lt;/a&gt;. And, because he favors “junk science,” he must be, you guessed it, a “&lt;a href="http://townhall.com/blog/g/6a888034-d1a2-4010-abdf-8786ebc0c522?comments=true"&gt;radical&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very simple. If you buy the idea that what some conservatives call “sound science” is good, and what those same pundits call “junk science” is bad, then David Michaels is your worst nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you have any capacity to see past these slogans and evaluate the scientific validity of various stances on the use of science in government decision-making…well, then the people who use the slogans are the problem, and David Michaels would be a much needed reprieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your pick–but I would advise first reading Michaels’ book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/019530067X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=019530067X"&gt;Doubt is Their Product&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;/em&gt;my review is &lt;a href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_manufacture_of_uncertainty"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), or my own &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465046762/chriscmooneyc-20/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Republican War on Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, both of which expose the “sound science”/”junk science” charade.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255461104400"><id gr:original-id="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/?p=1826">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ea32d8333fe4c217</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="1"/><title type="html">Partnering with industry positive for researchers, to a point</title><published>2009-10-13T18:50:54Z</published><updated>2009-10-13T18:50:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/2009/10/13/partnering-with-industry-positive-for-researchers-to-a-point/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/" type="html">According to an article published last year, partnering with industry is beneficial for researchers, so long as the partnership doesn’t account for more than 15% of the researcher’s total budget.

&lt;p&gt;The Australian Skeptics posted Simon’s original article so that it would get more attention. And it worked, kinda: like a fly to honey, one chiropractor took offense at what was written, and decided to send them a nearly logic-free letter. That’s fine, and pretty much what I expect from a vocal alt-med devotée. As justified, Eran Segev, president of the Australian Skeptics, &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/skeptics-chiropractic-ierano-segev-response-20090906.pdf"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All well and good, &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/announcements/chiropractor-lodges-complaint-against-australian-skeptics/"&gt;until…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… two weeks after responding we received a letter from the NSW Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) indicating Mr Ierano [the chiropractor] has lodged a complaint against Australian Skeptics. The letter attached to the complaint was the same one that Australian Skeptics had received and responded to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s a bit odd! I mean, why go to the trouble to pursue legal action against someone responding to your claims when it should be easy to present a simple rebuttal based on the evidence that chiropractic works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… oh, &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s funny is that originally, the BCA (the group suing Simon in the UK) tried to defend their position, and presented a poorly-researched, off-topic press release &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/18/careful-bca-you-might-slip-a-disk/"&gt;that somehow managed to make them look worse&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, that’s a theme amongst chiropractors trying to support some of their less reality-based claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while I’m using a light-hearted tone here, I’ll note that this is a very serious issue: there are people out there trying to stifle free speech. It’s that simple. The UK libel laws are draconian and designed to shut up any protest, making scientific objections and investigations into potential and real quackery very difficult. As Eran says on the AS page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australian Skeptics sees this complaint as lacking any merit even if it did not include some factual errors (e.g. the claim that a British court ruled Simon’s article is biased). We have prepared a detailed response to the HCCC and will be defending our right to publish articles relating to any scientific issue, as long as they are backed by scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As you may know, in 2003 the city imposed a congestion toll of £5 (later raised to £8) on all vehicles entering the central district. In 2007, Transport for London, a government agency, did a cost-benefit analysis of the impacts (find the full report here).

It found the following about costs per year to travelers in the central district:

    * Individuals and business travelers pay about £236 million in tolls.
    * Some trips to the area are canceled, costing would-have-been drivers the equivalent of about £31 million.
    * It costs motorists and firms £19 million to comply with the system.
    * Total burden on travelers: £286 million.</summary><author><name>By Eric A.

If there are any of my readers who happen to be surgeons attending the meeting, drop me a line and maybe we can get together. In the meantime, here's a blast from the past from the past. This post first reared its ugly head almost exactly three years ago; so if you haven't been reading at least three years, it's new to you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried not to write about the altie obsession with "detoxification" again. Really, I did. It gets repetitive, and I don't want &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/skepticismcritical_thinking/friday_woo/"&gt;Your Friday Dose of Woo (YFDoW)&lt;/a&gt; to become to repetitive. Of course, a certain amount of repetitiveness is unavoidable, given that there are only a few major themes running through medical woo. First, there's the belief that "toxins" (rarely specified and almost never with any hard evidence linking them to any specific diseases) are causing disease and that you--yes, you!--need to be "detoxified," whether this "detoxification" is supposedly accomplished through &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/07/your_friday_dose_of_woo_mere_regularity_1.php"&gt;enemas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/08/your_friday_dose_of_woo_gonna_wash_those.php"&gt;chelation therapy&lt;/a&gt;, "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/07/your_friday_dose_of_woo_would_you_like_a.php"&gt;liver flushes&lt;/a&gt;," or whatever. Another major theme is that "natural" is always "better." Never mind that strychnine and curare are both very "natural"--and very deadly. Last week, I managed to cover yet one more major theme of alternative medicine woo, mainly the idea that water can somehow be affected by "thoughts" or, as in the case of the granddaddy of all water quackery, homeopathy, can be remember the properties of a substance after that substance has been diluted to an unmeasurably small concentration. I was looking forward to moving on to one of the other major themes of alternative medicine, namely the concept that "energy" or "bioenergy" can be manipulated to heal (as in Reiki therapy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a reader sent me an example of detoxification woo unlike any that I had ever seen before. I knew I had this week's target. After all, all that energy woo will be around for my perusal anytime. There are more than enough targets to keep YFDoW going for many, many weeks. So what form of detoxification was so strange, so intriguing, that I just had to take a look at it this week, rather than next week or later?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In spite of the (lack of) punctuation in the first line, the links led me to several excellent, convincing, and professional-looking videos with titles like “Evolution is REAL Science #1.” A few more clicks, and I found the &lt;a href="http://www.anevolvingcreation.net/standup/index.htm" rel="external "&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; of the producer, Jeremy Mohn, as well as his &lt;a href="http://www.anevolvingcreation.net/standup/blog.htm" rel="external "&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Mohn describes himself as a “lone” Kansas biology teacher standing up to powerful anti-science interests.  As far as I can see, he is doing a good job.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Mohn is “also a religious believer who accepts evolution as one of God’s creations,” and he refers you to his personal Web page, &lt;a href="http://www.anevolvingcreation.net/home.htm" rel="external "&gt;An Evolving Creation&lt;/a&gt;.  I was, shall we say, less impressed with that effort and especially unimpressed with the hackneyed argument that God limits himself, herself, or itself so that we can gain experience on our own.  I mostly skimmed his essay, but I was somewhat taken aback by the bizarre translation of Psalm 135:13 (not to mention Genesis 1:1), and I cannot fathom how that verse tells us that God is “outside of time,” whatever that means. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My unsolicited advice:  Mr. Mohn should not quit his biology job, and you should watch his videos and send the links to anyone who will pay attention to them.&lt;/p&gt;

Since I spent the time writing this already, I'll keep it as is, but you should go read what he wrote too!]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Maher is hailed by many as a skeptic, but I disagree with that. He &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an atheist, and he has some salient points to make about religion and beliefs. However, he is by no means a &lt;em&gt;skeptic&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to matters medical. He rails against &amp;quot;western medicine&amp;quot; (what I prefer to call, simply, medicine), thinks vaccines are dangerous, and buys into a lot of nonsense about vaccinations that is known to be wrong. Note that &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/09/im-skeptical-of-denialism/"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;denier&lt;/em&gt; is not the same thing as a &lt;em&gt;skeptic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; go read&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?q=maher+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt; what Orac has to say about Maher&lt;/a&gt; to see how the &lt;em&gt;Real Time&lt;/em&gt; host misses the mark by miles in his medical beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also guess that I have little love for ex-Senate Majority Leader (and doctor) Bill Frist, who claimed he would never diagnose someone without seeing them first, but &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBYk4F164Hk"&gt;then proceeded to do just that&lt;/a&gt; on the Senate floor about Terry Schiavo (and &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/16/AR2005061600501.html"&gt;get it completely wrong&lt;/a&gt;). In my opinion, he let politics trump medicine at that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes medicine wins out: Frist schools Maher on the swine flu on &lt;em&gt;Real Time&lt;/em&gt;, with Frist telling Maher point blank that he’s wrong. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB5DLf1Qt78"&gt;This is worth watching&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/tB5DLf1Qt78%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frist is correct, the things Maher says about vaccines &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; dead wrong. I wonder if Maher will now do the research instead of just continuing to buy into his flawed belief system?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;*****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:left" src="http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/7052/18209381240x1801zl5.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"&gt;Today a news item popped up, which didn’t really surprise me. I’d heard of accounts of similar sorts of behaviour as ‘warnings’ to me, when I tried talking about how interesting and educational it would be to talk about the paranormal and pseudoscientific topics in the high school classroom. What should a teacher do in these circumstances, skeptic or otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Ten News.com:&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.10news.com/education/18209396/detail.html"&gt;Was High School Girl Possessed In Class?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.10news.com/education/18209396/detail.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Girl Spoke In Tongues, Made Predictions For Future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PELAHATCHIE, Miss. — &lt;/strong&gt;Students at a Mississippi high school said a fellow student spoke in tongues and made grave predictions for her classmates for three days. Some of those predictions included when students would die.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;…Sparks said Clanton told students about little-known facts in their past and made predictions on how some of them would die.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It made some students cry and leave school,” Sparks said. “Some have not returned yet.” Sparks and his classmates said they think an evil spirit possessed the girl. They were so convinced that Sparks and his friends brought Bibles to school and had a devotional. “Some believe, some don’t.” Clanton said. “They say it was the devil, but the devil only tells lies. Everything I said was the truth.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, this was the sort of thing that was being used as good reasons &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to talk to young people about psychics, questioning psychics or even basic psychology techniques. ‘The kids will use it to manipulate people’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This doesn’t seem to be something that seems to be discussed amongst skeptics often. I understand that a local skeptics group can eagerly suggest that testing an ouija board is a great experiment to do -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ouija board test: Have  a group seek answers from a Ouija board in the normal way, then hang  a cloth or place a piece of cardboard between the board and the participants’  eyes, so they can freely move their hands but can’t see the board.  See how clear the messages are then. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem simple to suggest an Ouija board test – quite  another to get it publicly accepted due to popular beliefs and inherent controversy! I had to be aware that people’s preconceptions (not just the students, but parents and fellow teachers and members of the school community) and related strong emotions may make it completely  out of the question to bring up such experiments. They do, after all, deal with challenging  predominant quasi-religious beliefs - or just plain make people uncomfortable with the implications. So, how do you strike a balance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example - when I took such  experiments into schools, not only did I make sure that I had the full  support of the science department (the fact-checkers and necessary experts  for the methodology) – but I informed all necessary stakeholders in  case anyone was challenged for what critics could easily label as ‘promoting  witchcraft’. Talking to counselors, deputy principals and certainly my Head of Department - and being prepared to compromise if need  be for what is still more about a method - rather than a particular &lt;em&gt;topic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could hardly, for example, encourage older students to ‘investigate the rumored ghost in the boarding house’ without thinking about the effect on the school community. For a start, like the film ‘Gossip’, there might be absolutely no history of any such ghost - but discussing it might well ‘create one’. I’ve even had a friend ‘create’ a superstition about Ginko leaves, demonstrating the power of folklore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider it irresponsible to not put in some groundwork and consider what may very well be instilled cultural beliefs (in my case, Chinese and Indigenious Aboriginal students), and how it might be turned into ‘calling up evil spirits’ by excited younger kids who weren’t in the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story also brings up the point about informing parents about what is happening too. I had one person tell me about how the mother of a student in fact made her living as a psychic and what happened when her son decided to do some amateur readings in the playground. Whilst apparently in that case, she disciplined her son for ‘messing with things he didn’t understand’, it also brings up the question how might it end up with a young person being very upset about their parents’ profession, if they happen to be involved in paranormal or pseudoscientific businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;…Sparks’ father said he’s unsure what to believe about Clanton’s experience. But he said that school officials should have told parents about what happened. Instead, they heard it from their children.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It disrupted class, and I think they could have done a little bit better,” Clint Sparks said. Clanton continues to go to class. She said God hasn’t spoken through her since Wednesday. Her mother said the school didn’t punish her daughter, though officials warned her that if she disrupts class, they will send her home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it appears that this is being treated as a straight-forward case of bullying. Yet the lack of discussion about what was happening with parents is certainly a concern. This could have been a good chance for a skeptic’s group to help out the school and certainly respond to the news - I hope that will happen in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

He’s talking on this very topic at the forthcoming Australian Skeptics conference -&lt;em&gt; “Why Skeptics are Dinner Party Nightmares”&lt;/em&gt;. Here’s &lt;a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,,24187185-23289,00.html"&gt;his article in the Australian newspaper:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW many readers have gone to dinner parties and listened to otherwise intelligent people assert that alternative medicine can be just as effective as mainstream, scientific medicine? Generally, the argument is that alternative medicine, in all its many forms, is just another complementary and legitimate form of healing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;So homeopathy, acupuncture, echinacea - even aromatherapy, magnetic resonance zones or anything with the word holistic in front of it - gets elevated to the same plane as chemotherapy, antibiotics or vaccines for mumps or measles. And this goes hand in hand with rather disdainful comments about sceptics of such alternative treatments not being open-minded and not being tolerant of competing world views. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;…No one likes to be rude at a fun dinner party or to risk social isolation by calling someone an idiot. But next time you find yourself seated beside a smart, well-paid enthusiast for the benefits of alternative medicine, you may just gently point out to him that if he gets cancer, he’d be better off opting for chemotherapy than for some equally valid, equally legitimate, non-traditional, world-view treatment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, James Allan of the University of Queensland will be presenting at the &lt;a href="http://www.qldskeptics.com/"&gt;Australian Skeptics Conference, held in Brisbane from 28-29th November.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;James Allan is a law professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane.  He is a native born Canadian who worked first as a lawyer then as a legal academic in the UK, Hong Kong, Canada and New Zealand before moving to Australia nearly five years ago.  During his 11 years in New Zealand he was on the operating committee of the New Zealand Skeptics.  He has presented talks at two previous Australian Skeptics’ conferences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(&lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-ca-sendak11-2009oct11,0,7605835,full.story"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently this half-sentence has a dislocating effect. But what &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; this dislocating half-sentence? This, (1):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;and it was still hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; refers to Max's supper, still waiting for him on his return from his adventures among the wild things).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose this last page had been this, (2):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it was still hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(with a period at the end of the immediately preceding text). Then we'd have a sentence with an initial coordinator. Such sentences are fiercely reviled in some circles, on the grounds that they are not complete sentences but only sentence fragments. But no reputable writer on usage shares this prejudice. &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002224.html"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;'s Mark Liberman on No Initial Coordinators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is nothing in the grammar of the English language to support a prescription against starting a sentence with &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; — nothing in the norms of speaking and nothing in the usage of the best writers over the entire history of the literary language. Like all languages, English is full of mechanisms to promote coherence by linking a sentence with its discourse context, and on any sensible evaluation, this is a Good Thing. Whoever invented the rule against sentence-intitial &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt;, with its a preposterous justification in terms of an alleged defect in sentential "completeness", must have had a tin ear and a dull mind. Nevertheless, this stupid made-up rule has infected the culture so thoroughly that 60% of the AHD's (sensible and well-educated) usage panel accepts it to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003723.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; I am, following up on Mark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark notes that the AHD note for &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; rejects NIC out of hand, and he provides a smorgasbord of cites (and statistics) from reputable authors.  Similarly MWDEU.  Paul Brians, collector of common errors in English, labels sentence-initial coordinators a "non-error".  Bryan Garner denies, all over the place, that NIC has any validity.  Even the curmudgeonly Robert Hartwell Fiske tells his readers that there's absolutely nothing wrong with sentence-initial coordinators.  A point of usage and style on which Liberman and I and the AHD and the MWDEU stand together with Brians and Garner and Fiske (and dozens of other advice writers) is, truly, not a disputed point.  NIC is crap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still NIC lives on in the popular mind. Presumably Timberg was treating (1) as (2) and criticizing it as a NIC violation (while, perhaps slyly, committing a NIC violation with &amp;quot;And this book with numerous wordless pages ends with a half-sentence …&amp;quot;). (Thanks to Phil Resnik for pointing me to the &lt;em&gt;L.A. Times&lt;/em&gt; piece and noting Timberg's NIC violation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Sendak didn't write (2). He wrote (1), which isn't punctuated as a separate sentence. Here's what Sendak wrote as the final sentence of &lt;em&gt;Wild Things&lt;/em&gt;, with line divisions as in the original; the sentence is spread across four pages, with some wordless pages intervening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth&lt;br&gt;
and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws&lt;br&gt;
but Max stepped into his private boat and waved good-bye&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sailed back over a year&lt;br&gt;
and in and out of weeks&lt;br&gt;
and through a day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and into the night of his very own room&lt;br&gt;
where he found his supper waiting for him&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it was still hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You'll see that Sendak isn't fond of commas.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sentence is a coordination of three clauses: the first in lines 1 and 2, the second (introduced by the coordinator &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt;) in lines 3 through 8, the third (introduced by the coordinator &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;) in line 9, which is our old friend (1). So, yes, (1) isn't a full sentence, just one clause of a sentence, but there's nothing grammatically wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe Timberg expects every page in a children's book to stand on its own as a text, and it looks like most (but not all) children's books are arranged that way, but it's not the way Sendak (with his few words and many images) works. In fact, not one of the four pages above stands on its own as a text (granted, the first is missing only a period).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Zwicky Arnold</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255452379336"><id gr:original-id="http://conservationbytes.com/2009/10/13/life-and-death-on-earth-the-cronus-hypothesis/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e9c22f89339a150c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Life and death on Earth: the Cronus hypothesis</title><published>2009-10-13T10:05:08Z</published><updated>2009-10-13T10:05:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/ZGUoYmq-xtI/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://conservationbytes.com/2009/10/13/life-and-death-on-earth-the-cronus-hypothesis/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Bit of a strange one for you today, but here’s a post I hope you’ll enjoy.

That's according to Nicholas Gueguen whose new study shows that women who mimic are rated by men as more sexually attractive.Gueguen recruited three female participants who were taking part in real-life, heterosexual speed-dating sessions and coached them to mimic some of their 66 male dates but not others. In the mimicking  condition, the female assistants were instructed to mimic their partner's utterances approximately five times during a five-minute date and to mimic his body language five times. For example, if a date said "You really do this?", the woman would respond "Yes I really do this" in the mimicry condition, but say only "Yes" in the non-mimicry condition. Similarly, if a man scratched his face, a mimicking assistant was instructed to wait two to three seconds and then scratch her face.The standard procedure at the end of these speed-dating sessions was for everyone to provide a list of those dates they would most like to give their contact details to. Guegen found that, on average, when a woman mimicked a dating partner, he was more likely, compared with non-mimicked dates, to want to give her his contact information, to say that the speed-date had gone well, and to rate her as more sexually attractive.Further analysis showed that in the mimicry condition only, a woman's perceived sexual attractiveness was linked to how much a partner subsequently wanted to share his contact information with her, even after factoring out the general influence of how well the man felt the date had gone. In other words, mimicry seemed to increase the influence of a woman's sexual attractiveness."By using an experimental approach in a real context it was found that mimicry is associated with greater preference and liking for a female in a courtship situation," Gueguen said. "This aspect [of mimicry] has never been examined previously".For extra appeal, the Digest blog archive suggests speed-daters could try combining mimicry with a light touch of their partner's arm. Guegen's previous research has shown that this can improve the success of romantic requests for a dance or phone number. Oh and for good measure, this earlier research suggests you should ask your opposite-sex friends to smile at you!_________________________________Gueguen, N. (2009).

From which she concludes, "Conversely, if you are not an independent," then you do not have a mind of your own.

Alex, I think, is making both a mistake in English usage and a mistake in logic.

Her mistake in usage is that she should have said "inversely" instead of "conversely." The converse of "If p, then q" is "If q, then p." But the last frame concerns an inverse: "If not p, then not q." An interesting empirical study would look to see how often newspapers or academics misuse these adverbs (I'm sure I have).&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/j7QE4fzIMWk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By Ian Ayres</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255450979109"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/10/bob-dylan-at-the-greek-theater-berkeley.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/73998704abd23025</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Stories About Me"/><title type="html">Bob Dylan at the Greek Theater, Berkeley</title><published>2009-10-13T15:34:06Z</published><updated>2009-10-13T15:34:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/10/bob-dylan-at-the-greek-theater-berkeley.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sunday night  Scholar Man &amp;amp; Scholar Woman had tickets to Bob Dylan at the Greek Theater.  Only Scholar Man was unwell, so I was the stand-in date.  Here&amp;#39;s the &lt;a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/#/tour/2009-10-11-greek-theatre"&gt;playlist&lt;/a&gt;, and here&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sonomapicman/sets/72157622442984347/"&gt;flikr set of the show.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He opened with &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsTDNm6VD-k"&gt;Leopardskin Pillbox Hat&lt;/a&gt;.  Judging by this version (recorded on October 8 2009) Dylan was particularly hoarse and, well, unmelodic.   The band was tight, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it&amp;#39;s the only time I&amp;#39;ve seen Dylan live.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we got home,  Jumper Girl was dozing to House.  Here&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8chs2ncYIw"&gt;Hugh Laurie&amp;#39;s Bob Dylan impersonation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255450626341"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/10/win_a_science_mega-book_part_2.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/43e08f3fdc7abf2a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Win a SCIENCE mega-book, part 2</title><published>2009-10-13T10:11:07Z</published><updated>2009-10-13T10:11:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/10/win_a_science_mega-book_part_2.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another day, another chance to win &lt;strong&gt;SCIENCE: THE DEFINITIVE VISUAL HISTORY&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, it's going to be hard to beat the massive response to the first round of this competition - thank you to everyone who commented.

And perhaps you have wondered how badly the popular press could possibly mangle your research. Wonder no more: we have discovered a new maximum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2009/09/the-dna-mystery-scientists-baffled-by-telepathic-abilities.html"&gt;Behold this research summary in The Daily Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;, and be amazed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's about &lt;a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp7112297"&gt;a paper in the ACS Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/a&gt;. It's straightforward physical chemistry using some cool tools to image the formation of double helices of DNA: it's simply addressing the question of how complementary strands align themselves in solution. It's &lt;i&gt;physical chemistry&lt;/i&gt;, OK? It&amp;#39;s about tiny molecular interactions…until the Daily Galaxy gets ahold of it. Now it&amp;#39;s about how DNA uses telepathy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNA has been found to have a bizarre ability to put itself together, even at a distance, when according to known science it shouldn't be able to. Explanation: None, at least not yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are reporting evidence that contrary to our current beliefs about what is possible, intact double-stranded DNA has the "amazing" ability to recognize similarities in other DNA strands from a distance. Somehow they are able to identify one another, and the tiny bits of genetic material tend to congregate with similar DNA. The recognition of similar sequences in DNA's chemical subunits, occurs in a way unrecognized by science. There is no known reason why the DNA is able to combine the way it does, and from a current theoretical standpoint this feat should be chemically impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, scientists observed the behavior of fluorescently tagged DNA strands placed in water that contained no proteins or other material that could interfere with the experiment. Strands with identical nucleotide sequences were about twice as likely to gather together as DNA strands with different sequences. No one knows how individual DNA strands could possibly be communicating in this way, yet somehow they do. The "telepathic" effect is a source of wonder and amazement for scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cue the theremins, everyone, and bring on the reanimated corpse of Rod Serling to narrate this sucker. Audience, say "OOOOOoooooOOOOOOOOooOOH!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait. Read the &lt;a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp7112297"&gt;actual paper&lt;/a&gt;, first. It turns out that not only are the scientists not mystified, but they provide a reasonable explanation for the phenomenon, and go on to give some alternatives, even. None of them involve molecular telepathy. They actually are amazed at the ability of these molecules to align…at distances of &lt;i&gt;one whole nanometer&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay especially careful to the first sentence of the following paragraph. If you are a journalist writing a summary of a paper, claiming that it says no one knows how the two molecules recognize each other, you should probably read more closely a paragraph that begins, "We hypothesize that the origin of this recognition may be as follows." It's a clue that an explanation will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hypothesize that the origin of this recognition may be as follows. In-register alignment of phosphate strands with grooves on opposing DNA minimizes unfavorable electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged phosphates and maximizes favorable interactions of phosphates with bound counterions. DNAs with identical sequences will have the same structure and will stay in register over any juxtaposition length. Nonhomologous DNAs will have uncorrelated sequence-dependent variations in the local pitch that will disrupt the register over large juxtaposition length. The register may be restored at the expense of torsional deformation, but the deformation cost will still make juxtaposition of nonhomologous DNAs unfavorable. The sequence recognition energy, calculated from the corresponding theory is consistent with the observed segregation within the existing uncertainties in the theoretical and experimental parameters. This energy is ˜1 kT under the conditions utilized for the present study, but it is predicted to be significantly amplified, for example, at closer separations, at lower ionic strength, and in the presence of DNA condensing counterions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, their preferred explanation is that there are electrostatic interactions between the molecules that favor pairs that fit together well. Not telepathy. As cautious investigators, they also suggest some alternative explanations; perhaps telepathy will appear here? Or maybe elves?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presently, we cannot exclude other mechanisms for the observed segregation. For instance, sequence-dependent bending of double helices may also lead to homology recognition by affecting the strand-groove register of two DNA molecules in juxtaposition. The juxtaposition of bent, nonhomologous DNAs may also be less energetically favorable under osmotic stress, since it may reduce the packing density of spherulites. In addition, formation of local single-stranded bubbles and base flipping may cause transient cross-hybridization between the molecules, as proposed to explain Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; induced self-assembly of DNA fragments with the same sequence and length. We consider it to be rather unlikely in this instance, since the probability of bubble formation in unstressed linear DNA of the studied length is very small in contrast to the case where topological strain is relieved by bubble formation in small circular DNA molecules. Furthermore, bubble formation would distort the cholesteric order of spherulites and we see no evidence of this in spherulites composed of a single type of DNA molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm so disappointed. Telepathy isn't mentioned once in the whole danged paper, and there aren't even tiny diaphanous fairies tugging at the molecules. And no, the Intelligent Designer doesn't appear, either.&lt;/p&gt;

I covered the prospect over a year ago at Seed’s &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/energy/2008/08/here_comes_the_sun.php"&gt;Next Generation Energy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storage and back-up systems are going to be very important given the sun doesn’t deliver that much energy to any one place at a time. The solution would be photovoltaic panels and solar heating troughs over huge tracts of land along with a direct-current transmission backbone to send that energy efficiently across the nation..Imagine a future where solar panels pave the desert between Phoenix and Los Angeles and consider whether that be worth the ecological footprint?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know lot that can be done with the existing solar technology today that would reduce our dependency on fossil fuels. Solar thermal plants are assuredly one part of the solution, but there is the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/business/energy-environment/30water.html?_r=1&amp;amp;scp=1&amp;amp;sq=michael%20webber&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;water conflict&lt;/a&gt; which cannot be overlooked. In short, this alternative has the potential to create a great deal of electricity–&lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;–and I hope the policy catches up and we integrate it into landscapes in a way that doesn’t add pressure on other limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="switchgrass" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2009/10/switchgrass.png" alt="switchgrass" width="282" height="127"&gt;Also remember that our energy needs exceed what solar power generates. So while I think we should be powering our cars and appliances on electricity, we must depend on many sources for a more sustainable future. We will still need combustible liquid fuels for shipping and air transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I continue to be interested in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/energy/2008/07/biofuels_the_next_generation_1.php"&gt;plant based biofuels&lt;/a&gt;. There is no better solar panel than the leaf of a plant. Alone it will not be the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; answer, but may eventually contribute to a significant percent of our energy budget.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sheril Kirshenbaum</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255449114802"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/duwayne_brayton_eschew_the_rej.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0519ae49e6a23de2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Gun Ownership"/><title type="html">DuWayne Brayton: We should all eschew the rejection of the other as your subaltern, even if only by accident.</title><published>2009-10-13T16:07:52Z</published><updated>2009-10-13T16:07:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/skVs3EyNKIw/duwayne_brayton_eschew_the_rej.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/duwayne_brayton_eschew_the_rej.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/carry_a_gun_you_get_shot_more.php"&gt;I said some things&lt;/a&gt; that got my friend DuWayne Brayton mad, and this caused him to write two blog posts (&lt;a href="http://debrayton.blogspot.com/2009/10/gun-study-critique-that-begat-race-card.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://debrayton.blogspot.com/2009/10/privilege-and-race-card.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and now with a little time to spare I'm giving this the attention it deserves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/duwayne_brayton_eschew_the_rej.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/duwayne_brayton_eschew_the_rej.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/skVs3EyNKIw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255449000241"><id gr:original-id="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/?p=1165">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/602035e8f7f37f45</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Anyone?</title><published>2009-10-13T15:44:10Z</published><updated>2009-10-13T15:44:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/10/13/anyone/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone have access to this article?&lt;/p&gt;

Stories of faith that piss me off. So allow me to purge my demons by slapping around a few religious goofballs — it&amp;#39;ll take the edge of my headache and lighten my step for the rest of the day. Don&amp;#39;t worry, I&amp;#39;ll start off easy and work up to the really bad ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/479/story/993680.html"&gt;John Shelby Spong is giving some lectures&lt;/a&gt;. You know, I think I&amp;#39;d like Spong as a person, and I think he espouses some worthy humanist values, but jeez, he always comes off as a cheerful airhead. He&amp;#39;s essentially an atheist who skims off a bit of the moldy skin of the rotten fruit of religion, and tells us how pretty the colors are…thereby making an implicit argument to keep the decaying garbage around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, God exists, but God is not a separate deity who intervenes in our lives.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Jesus' resurrection is not an historically accurate event, but a symbolic story of what it means to live a fully human life.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Eternal life is not a journey to heaven or hell, but a state which can only be glimpsed when we experience love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's like Karen Armstrong, so taken with the language of religion that they're willing to ignore the substance. When you've reduced god to the uncaring smear of cosmic background radiation and a collection of psychological quirks in the human brain, you might as well admit it: he's dead. Get over it and move on. And deceased figments don't need a weepy wake or much sympathy for the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Bible scholars can be such nuisances. Actually, Bible scholarship is a fine thing; I appreciate historical analysis, and think the secular study of old documents is an eminently respectable academic discipline. Unfortunately, the freaking &lt;i&gt;Bible&lt;/i&gt; is fraught with cultural connections that lead too many people to draw unwarrantedly deep conclusions from it. I'm sure this &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/6274502/God-is-not-the-Creator-claims-academic.html"&gt;Professor van Wolde is a reasonable scholar, but her conclusions about Genesis are fine nits that need picking&lt;/a&gt;, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Ellen van Wolde, a respected Old Testament scholar and author, claims the first sentence of Genesis "in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth" is not a true translation of the Hebrew.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She claims she has carried out fresh textual analysis that suggests the writers of the great book never intended to suggest that God created the world -- and in fact the Earth was already there when he created humans and animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, yeah. It's a small piece of the puzzle, nice to know, tells us squat-all about the origin of the world (which van Wolde is not claiming), and a little bit about the culture that scribbled down the Genesis myth. It generates breathless excitement among the credulous, though, who believe the book actually provides some insight into the creation of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how you should look at the book of Genesis. Long, long ago, a tribe of desert nomads bumped up against the more cosmopolitan culture of Mesopotamia. They learned useful skills from the city people, like writing, but at the same time, the allure of those older, more sophisticated ideas was leading to the dissolution of tribal identity, and especially to a loss of respect for the austere and demanding desert god. Who wants to worship dry old El when slinky, sexy Innini is calling?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in a move as old as religion, almost, the desert priests slyly adopted the popular culture of their neighbors, stealing all their myths, but rewrote them to put their one great god in charge of the whole story. Genesis is an exercise in syncretism, a wholesale theft of one tradition to be repackaged with a new set of symbols. It is not about the creation of the universe. It is about resolving a conflict between two human cultures. That's interesting, sure enough, as long as you don't forget where you are and start building big pseudo-museums in Kentucky dedicated to your misconceptions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also a problem when you have professional rabbinical nit-pickers who use their silly fine-grained interpretations of ancient texts to demand ridiculous and irrelevant impositions on people's lives. As a further example of scholars losing sight of the context of their great big dusty books, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/nyregion/10elevator.html?_r=2"&gt;consider the case of Shabbos elevators&lt;/a&gt;. There is a strict Jewish tradition of not doing any work on the sabbath, even to the point of not flicking any switches, so many buildings in Jewish communities have ridiculous and wasteful elevators that stop at every floor, so the devout don't need to push a button. Except that as they learn more about the technology, they are becoming afraid that it might offend their god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the recent ruling, whose signers included Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv -- at 99, widely considered the most influential Torah sage of his generation -- introduced a caveat based on new technology in elevators. The rabbis wrote that this new technology, which was explained to them by elevator technicians and engineers in "a written and oral technical opinion," made them aware for the first time that using Shabbos elevators may be a "desecration of the Sabbath."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They did not name the offending technology. But for several years there has been debate among Orthodox rabbis in Israel over whether devices that measure the weight in an elevator car, and adjust power accordingly, effectively make entering a car the equivalent of pressing a button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come on. Seriously? Listening to the most hidebound, most literal, most conservative, and most ancient geezer in your community is a useful way to maintain tribal tradition, but sometimes traditions need to break and respond to the times. Whoever scribbled down the old Sabbath laws couldn't even imagine elevators, let alone electronic sensors, so it would make more sense to abide by the spirit of the old laws rather than trying to impose a precise meaning on them that simply isn't there. Adapt! Your pointless dilemmas simply make you look like a gang of unimaginative old fools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adhering to ancient dogma kills people, too. &lt;a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGNAU2009100913472"&gt;Khristian Oliver has been convicted of murder and sentenced to die&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;d be willing to concede that he&amp;#39;s a bad guy who committed an evil act — nobody seems to be arguing over whether he actually committed the crime — except that his trial took place in Texas, and we&amp;#39;ve had a few &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/texas_has_state-sanctioned_mur.php"&gt;examples of Texas "justice"&lt;/a&gt;. But let us, for the moment, concede that he has legitimately been found guilty. Now look at how the decision to execute him was reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the trial, evidence emerged that jurors had consulted the Bible during their sentencing deliberations. At a hearing in June 1999, four of the jurors recalled that several Bibles had been present and highlighted passages had been passed around.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One juror had read aloud from the Bible to a group of fellow jurors, including the passage, "And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Holy crap. Condemned to death because of a &lt;i&gt;Bible verse&lt;/i&gt;? By the way, if you read the rest of &lt;a href="http://kingjbible.com/numbers/35.htm"&gt;Numbers 35&lt;/a&gt;, from which that verse was taken, it's fairly exhaustive: if somebody kills someone else with iron, wood, or stone, they're murderers, and need to be put to death. It's simply yet another piece of Old Testament blanket savagery: simple-minded, unthinking, absolutist, and prejudicial demands for execution of anyone who violates their rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jurors also seem to have ignored the subsequent verses, where it says that you can offer an alternative verdict in the absence of malice of confining the killer to his 'city of refuge,' until the high priest dies, at which time he's free to go. Is that a valid sentence in 21st century America, too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Texas is a state that can't be trusted in determining guilt, and given that the dim-witted jurors threw away reason and justice to blindly obey an archaic book (and only a select, small piece of that book), that sentence ought to be reduced, and the death penalty in general stricken from the state law books. Until, that is, enough of the state's population is well-enough educated to make rational determinations of guilt, at which time they'll also be smart enough to reject the death penalty as a primitive barbarism anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel a little better now. Still need a nap, though, and maybe some aspirin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/throw_out_your_bibles_and_free.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/UJuf7bZdrmk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255446377805"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AbhishekTiwarisBlog/~3/RyTFnLztzNM/monkeys-exhibit-uncanny-valley-effect.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ebd26d0d21c64930</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Monkeys exhibit the uncanny valley effect</title><published>2009-10-13T08:28:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-13T08:28:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/RuzWz6OelvA/monkeys-exhibit-uncanny-valley-effect.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AbhishekTiwarisBlog/~3/RyTFnLztzNM/monkeys-exhibit-uncanny-valley-effect.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Image via WikipediaA recent peer reviewed research published in journal PNAS suggests that monkey visual behavior falls into the uncanny valley. The idea of uncanny valley was introduced by Japanese roboticist  Masahiro Mori in 1970. In simple words, as virtual humans approach photorealism or human  likeness,  they risk making real humans uncomfortable or  may evoke negative feelings in human observers. Although  uncanny valley is a valid and widely accepted psychological phenomenon in human supported by several controlled perceptual experiments, it was never tested for a nonhuman species. A phenomenon which was also subscribed as reason for poor  box office performance of highly realistic computer-animated films such as the Polar Express. Study suggest that humans are not  the only ones to exploit this fascinating psychological peculiarity, monkey too have photorealism issues  and there may be evolutionary origins behind the uncanny valley. Basically computer/synthetic  generated/animated facial rendering can be categorized in three classes: unrealistic, realistic and real, and this is the interaction of realistic features which fall in the valley. In this case monkeys looked longer at real faces and unrealistic synthetic faces than at realistic synthetic faces. Although there is no clear explanation for the  uncanny valley effect, but according to current understanding it is not the increased realism that evokes the uncanny valley effect, but rather that the increased realism lowers the tolerance for abnormalities. Last year Image Metrics who also developed the game Grand  Theft Auto created a animation character Emily which is supposed to be one of the finest animations to have crossed a long-standing roadblock of uncanny valley (see the video below Emily&amp;#39;s introduction about the technology).Render-types and hypothetical outcomes.

Any guesses who the respondent might be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comment was posted to a health discussion group in response to a telemarketer calling to ask for donations for &lt;a href="http://www.nbcf.org.au/"&gt;breast cancer awareness month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I think they end up being sorry that they ever called me because I don’t just say no, I tell them why &lt;img src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)"&gt;  I say that I work for a children’s charity that is involved in preventing cancer and that in 50 years, the cancer council and other bodies have done nothing. Cancer is more prevalent today then it was when they started to supposedly research and if I am going to be making a donation, I want it to go to a good cause, not just to &lt;strong&gt;line the pockets of some researcher who has no interest in actually seeing their research come to fruition&lt;/strong&gt; rather than just keeping themselves in a job. They don’t know what to say… But hopefully, it makes them think that maybe there is more to this cancer stuff then they were told?”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(emphasis mine, I’m off to line my pockets with public donations).&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The regulation of hypnotherapists in the UK is so lax that even a cat can become accredited, the BBC has found.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris Jackson, presenter of Inside Out in the North East and Cumbria, registered pet George with three industry bodies. Each one accepted a certificate from the non-existent Society of Certified Advanced Mind Therapists as proof of George’s credentials.&lt;/em&gt;.. &lt;em&gt;In the UK, George was registered with the British Board of Neuro Linguistic Programming (BBNLP), the United Fellowship of Hypnotherapists (UFH) and the Professional Hypnotherapy Practitioner Association (PHPA).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Thanks to Ian Rowland for the find!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just found it. Go back and read the blogpost called &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2009/10/retrospectacle-this-is-all-you-got-in-this-size/"&gt;‘Is This All You Got In This Size?’&lt;/a&gt; and the following will make sense. I think it’s relevant reading to the odd (female) person I heard on a podcast saying &lt;em&gt;‘why can’t we be out here and be ourselves - ALL of ourselves, like every aspect of ourselves, because that’s who we are, that’s what everybody is ultimately, no one is just one aspect of that, so we try to be honest about that and just present ourselves as whole people…’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh huh. So, thanks to Kitty Flannagan and Penny Flannagan, with ‘Show the World’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/large/heic0912a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/10/hst_ngc2623.jpg" alt="hst_ngc2623" title="hst_ngc2623" width="610" height="422"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click to embiggen; or &lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/original/heic0912a.tif"&gt;go here&lt;/a&gt; to get the massive 15Mb TIF image.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the unusual galaxy NGC 2623, seen in &lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/html/heic0912.html"&gt;this newly-released and breathtaking Hubble Space Telescope image&lt;/a&gt; taken in 2007. We’re seeing this vast smash-up caught in the act, a galactic collision already in progress. It appears frozen in time, but that is an illusion of distance: at a distance of a staggering 250 million light years the tremendous velocities of the collision are reduced to a motionless tableau on the human timescale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we see a large number of galactic collisions when we catalog the sky, and together with our knowledge of math and physics we have a good understanding of how these encounters play out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When two massive galaxies approach each other, the gravity of each starts to affect the other. Call them Galaxy A and B. The side of Galaxy B closer to Galaxy A feels more gravity from it, so stars and gas are drawn toward it more strongly than the stars and gas on the far side of Galaxy B. The same is true in the other galaxy. As they get closer, this force strengthens, teasing out long ribbons of material — called tidal tails — that stretch in the direction of the other galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the encounter is off-center, then the tails get curved when the galaxies pass, arcing either gently or severely depending on the speed, encounter distance, and mass of each participant. The Hubble image clearly shows the arcing tails from each galaxy in NGC 2623. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incredibly, even though hundreds of billions of stars are involved, each individual star is far too small to suffer a physical collision. But gas and dust clouds are much bigger than stars (they can be hundreds of trillions of kilometers across, as opposed to stars which are a trifling million or so kilometers in diameter), so collisions between them are common. When clouds collide they collapse and undergo violent bouts of star formation. This too is clear in the image: the blue clumps in the tidal tails are vast regions of clusters of stars being born; over 100 such clusters have been identified in this image in the tail on the right alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collisions like this blast out energy, not just in visible light, but at other wavelengths as well. In infrared alone, NGC 2623 radiates with the power of 400 &lt;strong&gt;billion&lt;/strong&gt; times the Sun’s energy. This makes NGC 2623 a ULIRG: an ultraluminous infrared galaxy. Although relatively rare locally, they are so common at great distance (and therefore earlier on in the age of the Universe) that they comprise as much as half of all the infrared background glow we see in the Universe. The huge amount of infrared comes from the collision itself; star formation produces prodigious amounts of dust which absorb ultraviolet light from newly-born stars and re-radiate it in the infrared. The collision also dumps gas and dust into the central supermassive black holes in the cores of the two colliding galaxies, which piles up in a flat disk outside the black hole, heats up hugely, and again glows brightly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.4498"&gt;Astronomers are making a comprehensive study of such ULIRGs&lt;/a&gt; using a fleet of telescopes including Hubble, Spitzer, Chandra, GALEX, 2MASS, VLA, and even the venerable IRAS satellite which surveyed the sky in infrared in the 1980s, and in fact first discovered the ULIRGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why study them? Because galaxies as large as our Milky Way almost certainly started off small and grew to their present size by colliding and merging with other galaxies. Studying ULIRGs is a way of examining how our galaxy came to be… and it’s a glimpse of our future as well. In a billion years or more, we will suffer a massive collision with the Andromeda Galaxy. Our own clouds of gas and dust may smash into those in Andromeda, creating huge waves of star formation and blasting out light at all wavelengths. What will our fate be then? The Earth may survive — the Sun will still be around for this event — and the gravitational repercussions may toss us out of the new galaxy, or drop us down to the core. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem academic, but astronomers thirst for understanding of these events. We want to know how we came to be, and where we are headed. That knowledge may have little or no practical use for our own survival (or at least not for a few million millennia), but for now, for today, we learn more about galaxies in general, more about the physics of cosmic collisions, and more about the interaction of gas and dust on a truly mind-numbing scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, we get to gaze on lovely images, illusions of placidity and gentleness to be sure, but lovely nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

Is nothing sacred?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russell Grant has consulted his astrological charts and listened to the voice of the cosmos to come up with a list of which chocolate is best suited to each star sign. According to him, my star sign - Libra - &lt;i&gt;likes the finer things in life and is likely to choose soft and smooth chocolate fillings preferably wrapped in a heart-shaped box to share with their partner. Hand-made chocolate moulded in novelty shapes will amuse this chocolate lover.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. I like large bars of dark chocolate, preferably Green &amp;amp; Black&amp;#39;s Maya Gold or Cherry. Or anything by Paul Young of Islington (I would never normally advertise in my blog but this is chocolate and all normal rules are suspended).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novelty chocolate shapes? Yes - chocolate shaped like a very large bar of chocolate. Oh and Russ, I don't share my chocolate with ANYONE. My ideal partner is a diabetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To capture the diet market, or possibly to guilt-trip anyone overweight, there is a chocolate face mask being advertised for Chocolate Week. According to the advert, &lt;i&gt;Cocoa is packed with antioxidants to smooth skin, macadamia nut oil moisturizes, and almond oil reduces imflammation.&lt;/i&gt; Let's ignore all the research that has found anti-oxidants do sod all, then. And why would your face be inflamed in the first place? Perhaps from weeping because some bugger bought you this stuff instead of the real thing. Eminence Organic Skincare Mousse Hydration Masque costs £36 for 60ml. That's a teeny tiny pot with a very big name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my local supermarket today, £36 would buy:&lt;br&gt;
78 packs of Minstrels or Maltesers&lt;br&gt;
90 Mars Bars&lt;br&gt;
36 packs of Fox's double chocolate cookies&lt;br&gt;
240 Fingers of Fudge&lt;br&gt;
and I don't even want to think about how many Gü chocolate puddings or I'll have to go out and buy some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Mintel, people in the UK ate £3.5bn worth of chocolate last year - that's £57 each person. Is that all? If that's an average, there must be an awful lot of babies who aren't onto solids yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mintel have also found that sales of dark chocolate almost doubled in the UK between 2005 and 2007. A (female) senior market analyst at Mintel said: &lt;i&gt;Although dark chocolate is still high in sugar, it is rich in antioxidants and is lower in fat than milk chocolate. Dark chocolate now has the reputation of being a healthier alternative to other chocolate.&lt;/i&gt; Again with the anti-oxidants. Let's make it absolutely clear - THEY DON'T WORK. Anyone would think chocolate was one of your five a day. If dark chocolate is 'healthier', that means you can eat more of it, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chocolate is not now nor has it ever been good for you (although it is cheaper than Prozac). But it is one of life's essentials. And in case anyone's interested, it's my birthday this week. Good timing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old journalists say that if you speak the word 'Trafigura' three times, a lawyer appears in a cloud of sulphurous smoke; telling you not to write about it. This prophecy has come true for the Guardian, on whom everyone's favourite media lawyers Carter-Ruck have placed an unprecedented gagging order which, outrageously, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/oct/12/guardian-gagged-from-reporting-parliament"&gt;bans them from reporting parliament&lt;/a&gt; - a spectacularly undemocratic tactic which as the paper point out calls &lt;i&gt;"into question privileges guaranteeing free speech established under the 1688 Bill of Rights."&lt;/i&gt;  The threats don't work of course; they never have. Not even in ancient times.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
The glittering Temple of Artemis in what is now western Turkey was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. I say &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; because on around July 20th, 356BCE a fame-obsessed man name Herostratus decided to burn it down, claiming credit in an attempt to have his name immortalised in history. The Ephesean authorities not only executed him, but, hoping to deny him his desired fame, banned all mention of his name. He became famous in spite of - or perhaps even &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; of - their actions, in the earliest recorded example of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect"&gt;The Streisand Effect&lt;/a&gt;; the phenomenon by which any attempt to censor something results it it being even more talked about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially true in the Internet Age. As EFF founder &lt;a href="http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/outerspace/internet-article.html"&gt;John Gilmore so eloquently put it back in 1993&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;i&gt;"The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it." &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it was inevitable that, even as The Guardian &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/10/most-significant-constitutional-case-of.html"&gt;go to court today to have the order overturned&lt;/a&gt;, Carter-Ruck's strategy would fail spectacularly. So spectacularly in fact that Trafigura became, briefly, the number one trending topic on Twitter; one of the most talked about stories on the planet. Rarely will you see a legal firm &lt;a href="http://www.inthenews.co.uk/news/politics/twitter-outcry-over-guardian-gagging-order-$1333695.htm"&gt;so deftly beating its own goal-keeper.&lt;/a&gt; Terribly misconceived, as lawyer and legal writer Jack of Kent &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/10/guardian-injunction.html"&gt;would put it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is this Trafigura business all about? And what have the Guardian been banned from reporting? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trafigura.com/"&gt;Trafigura&lt;/a&gt; are a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafigura"&gt;Swiss-based multinational oil trader&lt;/a&gt;, and with a turnover in the region of seventy &lt;i&gt;billion&lt;/i&gt; dollars probably one of the biggest companies you've never heard of, in spite of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipeia.org/wiki/Trafigura#Oil-for-food_scandal"&gt;being accused in the Iraq Oil-for-Food scandal&lt;/a&gt;. They are physical traders, carrying oil around the world, processing and refining it for resale at a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, they spotted &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8259765.stm"&gt;an opportunity for refining sulphur-contaminated gasoline&lt;/a&gt; from the Mexican state refinery, and processing it at sea using a process called "&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/sep/16/trafigura-case-toxic-slop"&gt;caustic washing&lt;/a&gt;", a cheap and decidedly uncheerful process that generates waste so dangerous it is effectively banned in most parts of the world. The refined oil was sold on for several million dollars at a time, but their ships were left with a cargo of toxic waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/16/trafigura-email-files-read"&gt;E-mails obtained by the Guardian showed that in 2006&lt;/a&gt;, having failed to offload this waste in Europe, they took it to Ivory Coast, and disposed of it with an enthusiastic but unqualified local "man-with-a-van." It ended up in dumps around Abidjan, Ivory Coast's maritime capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands fell ill, with many burns inflicted by caustic soda, and many deaths caused by breathing in hydrogen sulphide fumes produced by the waste. The company were &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/16/trafigura-oil-ivory-coast"&gt;forced to settle a 9-figure lawsuit on top of compensation previously given to the country's government&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the present. In parliament today, the a question is due to be asked by Newcastle MP Paul Farrelly, and it is this which &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/oct/12/guardian-gagged-from-reporting-parliament"&gt;the Guardian have been banned from reporting&lt;/a&gt;. As the Guardian have stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's published Commons order papers contain a question to be answered by a minister later this week. The Guardian is prevented from identifying the MP who has asked the question, what the question is, which minister might answer it, or where the question is to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardian is also forbidden from telling its readers why the paper is prevented – for the first time in memory – from reporting parliament. Legal obstacles, which cannot be identified, involve proceedings, which cannot be mentioned, on behalf of a client who must remain secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only fact the Guardian can report is that the case involves the London solicitors Carter-Ruck, who specialise in suing the media for clients, who include individuals or global corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question referenced, which is published online at the Parliament website, is believed to be the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From Parliament.uk, “Questions for Oral or Written Answer beginning on Tuesday 13 October 2009?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    (292409)&lt;br&gt;
    61&lt;br&gt;
    N Paul Farrelly (Newcastle-under-Lyme): To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of legislation to protect (a) whistleblowers and (b) press freedom following the injunctions obtained in the High Court by (i) Barclays and Freshfields solicitors on 19 March 2009 on the publication of internal Barclays reports documenting alleged tax avoidance schemes and &lt;b&gt;(ii) Trafigura and Carter-Ruck solicitors on 11 September 2009 on the publication of the Minton report on the alleged dumping of toxic waste in Ivory Coast, commissioned by Trafigura.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question makes reference to the Minton Report, The &lt;a href="http://go2.wordpress.com/?id=725X1342&amp;amp;site=richardwilsonauthor.wordpress.com&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwikileaks.org%2Fleak%2Fwaterson-toxicwaste-ivorycoast-%25C3%25A92009.pdf"&gt;report is available online&lt;/a&gt;, and suggests that Trafigura knew early on that the waste they dumped in Ivory Coast was toxic, a claim which the company have denied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever Carter-Ruck's reasons for this injunction, their approach has backfired spectacularly. A reference to a question that would have been buried in the middle of the Guardian has now been spread around the world, the question has been posted on numerous websites, and the Minton report is now published online and linked to by thousands of people. And good, because the appalling behaviour of companies like Trafigura needs to be exposed, and people need to stand up to attempts to stifle democracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update, 12:15pm:&lt;/b&gt; John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, has called for &lt;a href="http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;amp;storycode=44464&amp;amp;c=1"&gt;an urgent Commons debate on the matter&lt;/a&gt;. This has been echoed by the Lib Dem chief whip, Paul Burstow, and Nick Clegg has shown an interest in the case on Twitter. No word from anyone from Labour yet. Further &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/oct/13/guardian-court-parliament-reporting-gag"&gt;reporting on this in The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently more 18-25-year-olds who are &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2007/01/10/a-portrait-of-generation-next/"&gt;not affiliated with any religion&lt;/a&gt; than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.secularstudents.org/"&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has grown faster this year than at any time in our ten-year history.  You can see where the following curve is heading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.secularstudents.org/node/8"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009.group.graph.jpg" alt="2009.group.graph" title="2009.group.graph" width="500" height="257"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our campus groups have &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/us/27atheist.html"&gt;made the front page&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and been featured in &lt;a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/njmagazine/cs_20090307_9763.php"&gt;major magazine articles&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/03/24/atheists-and-christians-cooperate-and-help-others-in-new-orleans/"&gt;visited New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; to do community service work; spearheaded &lt;a href="http://inatheistbus.org/"&gt;consciousness-raising bus campaigns&lt;/a&gt;; and brought &lt;strong&gt;Dan Barker&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt;, and several other speakers to their universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our staff has fostered this climate for growth, created a &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/educators"&gt;resources for educators&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/files/SSA.educators.brochure.color.pdf"&gt;fantastic brochure&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) for high school teachers who may have non-religious students in their classroom.  They organized a conference for over 100 secular students and a trip to the Creation Museum (with special guest &lt;strong&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/strong&gt;) for 300 skeptics who left the museum armed with knowledge of its misinformation campaign, &lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/2009/09/video-of-my-creation-museum.html"&gt;able to spread the message&lt;/a&gt;.  They are currently developing &lt;em&gt;three separate student conferences&lt;/em&gt; for 2010, all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just read through our &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/files/2009.activity.snapshot.pdf"&gt;annual activity summary&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) and was amazed by how much our staff has done with relatively few resources and how much our affiliate groups have accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t stress this enough: when I say “our staff,” I’m only referring to two full-time staff members (who are seriously underpaid) and a handful of interns and volunteers.  We’re reaching the breaking point where our level of growth is surpassing our ability to support the groups adequately.  We need at least one other staffer and the board would love to be able to pay all staffers closer to what they’re really worth.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, we have a chance to remedy this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An SSA member/donor named &lt;strong&gt;Todd Stiefel&lt;/strong&gt; has presented us with a challenge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any amount we raise — up to $50,000 — by December 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, he will match dollar-for-dollar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, your $20 contribution will bring the SSA $40.  Todd’s not kidding about that dollar-for-dollar thing, either.  (It’s not like we can raise $3,000 and he’ll give us the whole $50,000 amount anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means we have a little over two months to raise an &lt;em&gt;incredible&lt;/em&gt; amount of money — a larger amount than we’ve ever had to raise before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SSA staff and board are going to be doing everything we can to make this happen — meeting donors, writing letters, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could use your help, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’ve never given before, we could use your contribution now more than ever.  If you have given before, your continuing support would help us even more!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t told your friends about the Secular Student Alliance, please tell them who we are and what we do.  We’re the largest organization in the world starting, supporting, and maintaining campus atheist groups.  We have the &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/node/2612"&gt;ear of the White House&lt;/a&gt;.  We helped found the &lt;a href="http://secular.org"&gt;Secular Coalition for America&lt;/a&gt; and continue to be a proud member of that group.  We are also a 501(c)(3) non-profit and donations are tax-deductible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a blog or Twitter feed or Facebook, please spread the word about this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the SSA, I would love to answer them in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I’ll be giving updates on how we’re doing over the next several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be incredible if we could meet this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m putting a ChipIn widget below (feel free to put it on your site), but you can give to us in a &lt;a href="https://www.secularstudents.org/node/8"&gt;variety of ways&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you help us?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You can read my previous blogs about this &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/04/26/meryl-dorey-endorses-homeopathy-for-treatment-of-whooping-cough/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/04/29/anti-vaxers-the-story-so-far/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, a 14 year old girl Tamar, was recently diagnosed with liver cancer which required immediate and aggressive chemotherapy. But  her parents have shunned conventional treatment in favour of “mud” therapy. A team of oncologists at Princes Margaret Childrens’ Hospital advised that a seven week course of chemotherapy would give Tamar a 50-60% chance of survival. Despite the treating hospital pleading with the parents to consent to chemotherapy, eventually seeking the involvement of the WA legal system, the parents fled Australia to El Salvador.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their preferred treatment is tea made from herbs, and red clay gathered from around the hills near their house in El Salvador. Tamar’s mother says that “&lt;em&gt;Clay is basically the right medicine for any kind of illness, (it can cure) anything&lt;/em&gt;“. She went on to say, “&lt;em&gt;..it dries up anything that is causing the illness in your system&lt;/em&gt;“. Twice a day, every day for a minimum of three hours, the clay is wrapped around the girl’s torso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her father says, “&lt;em&gt;I don’t want to do this to my daughter but if it’s God decision then so be it.&lt;/em&gt;” He claims his daughter doesn’t want to lose her hair or get sick from the chemotherapy and has seen the research for herself, so she is therefore capable of making a decision to use natural therapies. He also claims she is eating normally and has gained weight. The parents claim the proof for the efficacy of mud therapy therapy is a book “written by a doctor” about the curative effects of herbs.&lt;/p&gt;

So this semester I am sitting in on a very cool MIT course, the &lt;a href="http://physicsofenergy.mit.edu/"&gt;Physics of Energy&lt;/a&gt;, to try to strengthen my background in this area. I can’t transform all the equations they show on the board, but in terms of policy outlook, the class certainly seems to reinforce what I’ve already heard from a lot of other places. And so in honor of the Energy forum &lt;em&gt;Discover&lt;/em&gt; is now sponsoring (eyes right, see sidebar), I thought I’d weigh in on the big picture version of what I’m learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, fossil fuels have got to be phased out, as quickly as possible. In terms of filling the gap, you then contemplate wind, solar, tidal, geothermal, nuclear, and so on–and the source with by far the greatest potential, and the fewest downsides, seems to be solar. There is a place for all of the others, of course. But nothing can ultimately compare to harnessing the central energy source into the planet for our own purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I learned in the &lt;a href="http://physicsofenergy.mit.edu/"&gt;Physics of Energy&lt;/a&gt;, every 47 minutes, the sun delivers enough energy to power all of our societies for a year–if it could be harnessed, anyways. To power the entire United States, meanwhile, one would theoretically need a solar array whose surface area is just a small fraction of the total size of Nevada–assuming the solar panels were 100 percent efficient, anyway. They aren’t even close to that; but the point is, the potential here is massive. The problem to get higher efficiency and lower cost for solar energy is technological in nature; but the potential upside is incredible–which seems to suggest that California did the right thing with a &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/10/12/BUS41A4K4M.DTL&amp;amp;type=business"&gt;recent bill&lt;/a&gt; to promote solar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old journalists say that if you speak the word 'Trafigura' three times, a lawyer appears in a cloud of sulphurous smoke; telling you not to write about it. This prophecy has come true for the Guardian, on whom everyone's favourite media lawyers Carter-Ruck have placed an unprecedented gagging order which, outrageously, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/oct/12/guardian-gagged-from-reporting-parliament"&gt;bans them from reporting parliament&lt;/a&gt; - a spectacularly undemocratic tactic which as the paper point out calls &lt;i&gt;"into question privileges guaranteeing free speech established under the 1688 Bill of Rights."&lt;/i&gt;  The threats don't work of course; they never have. Not even in ancient times.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
The glittering Temple of Artemis in what is now western Turkey was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. I say &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; because on around July 20th, 356BCE a fame-obsessed man name Herostratus decided to burn it down, claiming credit in an attempt to have his name immortalised in history. The Ephesean authorities not only executed him, but, hoping to deny him his desired fame, banned all mention of his name. He became famous in spite of - or perhaps even &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; of - their actions, in the earliest recorded example of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect"&gt;The Streisand Effect&lt;/a&gt;; the phenomenon by which any attempt to censor something results it it being even more talked about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially true in the Internet Age. As EFF founder &lt;a href="http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/outerspace/internet-article.html"&gt;John Gilmore so eloquently put it back in 1993&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;i&gt;"The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it." &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it was inevitable that, even as The Guardian &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/10/most-significant-constitutional-case-of.html"&gt;go to court today to have the order overturned&lt;/a&gt;, Carter-Ruck's strategy would fail spectacularly. So spectacularly in fact that Trafigura became, briefly, the number one trending topic on Twitter; one of the most talked about stories on the planet. Rarely will you see a legal firm &lt;a href="http://www.inthenews.co.uk/news/politics/twitter-outcry-over-guardian-gagging-order-$1333695.htm"&gt;so deftly beating its own goal-keeper.&lt;/a&gt; Terribly misconceived, as lawyer and legal writer Jack of Kent &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/10/guardian-injunction.html"&gt;would put it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is this Trafigura business all about? And what have the Guardian been banned from reporting? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trafigura.com/"&gt;Trafigura&lt;/a&gt; are a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafigura"&gt;Swiss-based multinational oil trader&lt;/a&gt;, and with a turnover in the region of seventy &lt;i&gt;billion&lt;/i&gt; dollars probably one of the biggest companies you've never heard of, in spite of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipeia.org/wiki/Trafigura#Oil-for-food_scandal"&gt;being accused in the Iraq Oil-for-Food scandal&lt;/a&gt;. They are physical traders, carrying oil around the world, processing and refining it for resale at a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, they spotted &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8259765.stm"&gt;an opportunity for refining sulphur-contaminated gasoline&lt;/a&gt; from the Mexican state refinery, and processing it at sea using a process called "&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/sep/16/trafigura-case-toxic-slop"&gt;caustic washing&lt;/a&gt;", a cheap and decidedly uncheerful process that generates waste so dangerous it is effectively banned in most parts of the world. The refined oil was sold on for several million dollars at a time, but their ships were left with a cargo of toxic waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/16/trafigura-email-files-read"&gt;E-mails obtained by the Guardian showed that in 2006&lt;/a&gt;, having failed to offload this waste in Europe, they took it to Ivory Coast, and disposed of it with an enthusiastic but unqualified local "man-with-a-van." It ended up in dumps around Abidjan, Ivory Coast's maritime capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands fell ill, with many burns inflicted by caustic soda, and many deaths caused by breathing in hydrogen sulphide fumes produced by the waste. The company were &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/16/trafigura-oil-ivory-coast"&gt;forced to settle a 9-figure lawsuit on top of compensation previously given to the country's government&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the present. In parliament today, the a question is due to be asked by Newcastle MP Paul Farrelly, and it is this which &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/oct/12/guardian-gagged-from-reporting-parliament"&gt;the Guardian have been banned from reporting&lt;/a&gt;. As the Guardian have stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's published Commons order papers contain a question to be answered by a minister later this week. The Guardian is prevented from identifying the MP who has asked the question, what the question is, which minister might answer it, or where the question is to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardian is also forbidden from telling its readers why the paper is prevented – for the first time in memory – from reporting parliament. Legal obstacles, which cannot be identified, involve proceedings, which cannot be mentioned, on behalf of a client who must remain secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only fact the Guardian can report is that the case involves the London solicitors Carter-Ruck, who specialise in suing the media for clients, who include individuals or global corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question referenced, which is published online at the Parliament website, is believed to be the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From Parliament.uk, “Questions for Oral or Written Answer beginning on Tuesday 13 October 2009?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    (292409)&lt;br&gt;
    61&lt;br&gt;
    N Paul Farrelly (Newcastle-under-Lyme): To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of legislation to protect (a) whistleblowers and (b) press freedom following the injunctions obtained in the High Court by (i) Barclays and Freshfields solicitors on 19 March 2009 on the publication of internal Barclays reports documenting alleged tax avoidance schemes and &lt;b&gt;(ii) Trafigura and Carter-Ruck solicitors on 11 September 2009 on the publication of the Minton report on the alleged dumping of toxic waste in Ivory Coast, commissioned by Trafigura.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question makes reference to the Minton Report, The &lt;a href="http://go2.wordpress.com/?id=725X1342&amp;amp;site=richardwilsonauthor.wordpress.com&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwikileaks.org%2Fleak%2Fwaterson-toxicwaste-ivorycoast-%25C3%25A92009.pdf"&gt;report is available online&lt;/a&gt;, and suggests that Trafigura knew early on that the waste they dumped in Ivory Coast was toxic, a claim which the company have denied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever Carter-Ruck's reasons for this injunction, their approach has backfired spectacularly. A reference to a question that would have been buried in the middle of the Guardian has now been spread around the world, the question has been posted on numerous websites, and the Minton report is now published online and linked to by thousands of people. And good, because the appalling behaviour of companies like Trafigura needs to be exposed, and people need to stand up to attempts to stifle democracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update, 12:15pm:&lt;/b&gt; John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, has called for &lt;a href="http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;amp;storycode=44464&amp;amp;c=1"&gt;an urgent Commons debate on the matter&lt;/a&gt;. This has been echoed by the Lib Dem chief whip, Paul Burstow, and Nick Clegg has shown an interest in the case on Twitter. No word from anyone from Labour yet. Further &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/oct/13/guardian-court-parliament-reporting-gag"&gt;reporting on this in The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update: 13:00pm&lt;/b&gt; The Guardian are &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/oct/13/guardian-gagged-parliamentary-question"&gt;claiming victory&lt;/a&gt; in their battle to have the order overturned, with Carter-Ruck conceding defeat. Excellent news - common sense prevails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian was due to appear at the High Court at 2pm to challenge Carter-Ruck's behaviour, but the firm has dropped its claim that to report parliament would be in contempt of court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night somebody googled the phrase "martin rundqvist republikan" and ended up here on my blog. Note the K: this person probably didn't wonder if I'd vote for Sarah Palin. They wondered what I think about the Swedish constitution, which provides the country with a decorative king. Outside the US, "republican" means "anti-monarchist". And yes, I am an anti-monarchist. I think it's a disgrace that the Scandy countries, which are among the world's strongest democracies, are still symbolic monarchies. And I think it's deeply wrong that the hapless royals are born into their golden cage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there's a paradoxical twist to this issue. When polled, most Swedes voice strong &lt;i&gt;support&lt;/i&gt; for the current constitution and the royal house. So although monarchy is by its very nature undemocratic, it would be undemocratic to take monarchy away from the Swedish voters. &lt;i&gt;Republikanism&lt;/i&gt; (with a K) is in fact a minority position of the intellectual elite in Scandinavia. And if we'd decide that anybody who supports monarchy is too stupid to be allowed to vote, then bang goes our strong democracy. So I tend not to think too much about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

She&amp;#39;s also been a workhorse for the milk industry serving as a member of the Medical Advisory Board of the Milk Processors&amp;#39; Education Program, the Medical Advisory Board for the International Dairy Foods Association and speaking and writing  regularly for the Dairy Farmers of Canada.So what&amp;#39;s got my knickers in a knot about Dr. Barr? It&amp;#39;s her quotes from the recent &amp;quot;article&amp;quot; published in CanWest papers across the country last week where she tries to make the case that increased dietary dairy consumption reduces blood pressure. I put the word article in quotations because CanWest reports that the articles are &amp;quot;a joint venture with Dairy Farmers of Canada&amp;quot;and refer to them as a &amp;quot;special advertising feature&amp;quot;.Dr. Barr&amp;#39;s case for dairy&amp;#39;s role in reduction of blood pressure rests on a famous study from 1997, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Study which resulted in what&amp;#39;s now known as the DASH diet. Dr. Barr reports, &amp;quot;The findings showed that those on the fruit and vegetable rich diet experienced a significant reduction in blood pressure. Those on the diet with milk products as well showed an even more significant reduction.&amp;quot;A true statement, except of course it omits the fact that the study was not designed to examine the specific effects of dairy on blood pressure and more importantly omits the fact that the diet with dairy had other differences from the fruit and vegetable rich diet including lower overall saturated fat, lower total fat and lower cholesterol.Looking at the last 15 years of clinical trials research I was able to find only a handful of studies that were specifically designed to investigate the effects of dairy on blood pressure, and of those none were large or robust enough to draw firm conclusions.Thankfully I was able to find a recent review article  published in the Journal of the American College of Clinical Nutrition which summarized the most pertinent studies detailing dairy&amp;#39;s effects on blood pressure.  The review reported that a few studies indeed showed decreases in blood pressure with increased dairy, another showed increases in blood pressure with yogurt but not cheese, and many showed no dairy/blood pressure relationship at all. Regarding the DASH study the review specifically concluded, &amp;quot;The greater reductions in BP seen with the DASH diet compared to the high fruits and vegetable diet cannot be ascribed to dairy products per se&amp;quot;and the review goes on to conclude that there are certainly some plausible mechanisms by which dairy might improve blood pressure and that further research is warranted.Fair enough, and really that&amp;#39;s it? That&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s got me hot and bothered?  The fact that Dr. Barr perhaps misconstrued the DASH study and overblew the preliminary suggestion that maybe blood pressure and dairy have a connection?Nope.It was this. The review article summarized the only studies that have ever been conducted that were designed specifically to address whether or not an intervention involving increasing dairy would have a positive impact on blood pressure, all 5 of them.  According to the review none of those studies showed significant improvements to diastolic blood pressure while 3 showed minor improvements to systolic pressure, the greatest of which was 5mm Hg.Again, so? So why are you so pissy you&amp;#39;re actually devoting an entire post to Dr. Barr and suggesting she&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;bared her bias&amp;quot;, yeah it doesn&amp;#39;t look like there&amp;#39;s much data to conclusively recommend increasing dairy for blood pressure benefit, but so what, at least there&amp;#39;s some?It was this.  Included in those 5 studies was this one, &amp;quot;Effects of increased consumption of fluid milk on energy and nutrient intake, body weight, and cardiovascular risk factors in healthy older adults&amp;quot;This study, conducted in the year 2000, followed 204 healthy, middle aged men and women and tracked what happened to their blood pressure and their weight following randomization to either stick with their current diets (low in dairy) or to add 3 glasses per day of milk to their diets for 12 weeks. At the end of 12 weeks researchers found that the increased dairy group did not see any statistically significant reduction in their blood pressures (nor did the subgroup of pre-existing hypertensives in the sample), but they did see statistically significant increases in weight, triglycerides and blood sugar - not exactly healthful results.Want to know who the lead author of this study, one of only 5 studies  ever published which was actually designed to determine the effect of increasing dietary dairy consumption on blood pressure, the results of which showed increasing milk not only failed to have a positive effect on blood pressure but rather, significantly worsened weight, triglycerides and blood sugar?  You guessed it, Dr. Susan Barr.Ain&amp;#39;t it funny (and by funny I mean awful) that she didn&amp;#39;t mention the paucity of conclusive research linking increased dairy with decreased blood pressure along with her own study&amp;#39;s negative and potentially harmful results while misrepresenting the findings of the DASH study in the  &amp;quot;article&amp;quot;, I mean &amp;quot;joint venture&amp;quot;, I mean &amp;quot;special advertising feature&amp;quot; meant to sell more milk?Kris-Etherton PM, Grieger JA, Hilpert KF, &amp;amp; West SG (2009).

&lt;p&gt;Michael Moore is the Leni Riefenstahl of our time. Or, perhaps he would be better characterized as a Bizzaro World Leni Riefenstahl, because while she propped up with propaganda the political powers of her time, Moore uses the same techniques to bring down the powers of our time, be it GM (&lt;em&gt;Roger and Me&lt;/em&gt;), the gun lobby (&lt;em&gt;Bowling for Columbine&lt;/em&gt;), the government (&lt;em&gt;Fahrenheit 911&lt;/em&gt;), the health care industry (&lt;em&gt;Sicko&lt;/em&gt;), or free enterprise (&lt;em&gt;Capitalism: A Love Story&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this latest installment in his continuing series of what’s wrong with America, Michael Moore takes aim at his biggest target to date, and the result is a disaster. The documentary is not nearly as funny as his previous films, the music selections seem contrived and flat, and the edits and transitions are clumsy, wooden, and not nearly as effective as what we’ve come to expect from the premiere documentarian (Ken Burns notwithstanding) of our time. And, most importantly, the film’s central thesis is so bad that it’s not even wrong.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let me confess that even though I have disagreed with most of Michael Moore’s politics and economics throughout his career, I have thoroughly enjoyed his films as skilled and effective works of art and propaganda, never failing to laugh — or be emotionally distraught — at all the places audiences are cued to do so. My willing suspension of disbelief that enables me to take so much pleasure from works of fiction, does not always serve me well when pulled into the narrative arc of a documentary. Thus it is that with his past films I have exited the theater infuriated at the same things Moore is … until I rolled up my sleeves and did some fact checking of my own, at which point Moore’s theses unravel (with the possible exception of &lt;em&gt;Bowling for Columbine&lt;/em&gt;, his finest work in my opinion). But with &lt;em&gt;Capitalism: A Love Story&lt;/em&gt;, Moore’s propagandistic props are so transparent and contrived that I never was able to suspend disbelief.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was especially infuriating about &lt;em&gt;Capitalism: A Love Story&lt;/em&gt; was the treatment of the people at the bottom end of the economic spectrum. The film is anchored on two eviction stories contrived to pull at the heart strings. One family filmed the eviction process themselves and sent the footage to Moore in hopes he’d use it (many are called, few are chosen), and the other was filmed by Moore’s crew. The message of both is delivered with a sledge hammer: Greedy Evil Soul-Sucking Bankers (think Lionel Barrymore’s villainous Mr. Potter in &lt;em&gt;It’s a Wonderful Life&lt;/em&gt;) are tossing out onto the streets of America poor innocent families who are victims of circumstances not of their making. Why? First, because this is what Greedy Evil Soul-Sucking Bankers do for fun on weekends. Two, because the economic crisis caused solely by said bankers has made it impossible for families to make the payments on those subprime loans they were tricked into taking by those same bankers, who themselves were suckered into a Ponzi-like scheme cooked up by Alan Greenspan and his Wall Street/Federal Reserve buddies to take back the homes fully owned by (first) the elderly and (then) the poor. In the fine print that the bankers carefully slipped past the elderly and the poor for these second mortgages and subprime loans, the contracts said that the rates on variable rate loans could go up, and that the house was collateral for the loan such that if the loan payments are not made the home is subject to foreclosure and repossession by the bank (which is what the bankers are hoping happens).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Michael Moore’s worldview, a goodly portion of the American people are ignorant, uneducated, clueless pinheads too stupid to realize the fundamental principle of a loan: you have to have collateral to secure the loan! No collateral, no loan. You say to the banker “I would like to take out a loan.” The banker says to you “what do you have for collateral?” What happened in the housing boom was that bankers relaxed their standards for what they would require for collateral (and income, assets, etc.) because (1) the government told them to do so and promised to cover their losses if it didn’t work out, and (2) they wanted to make more money; and borrowers wanted in on the cash cow that everyone was milking, from individual house flippers looking for a quick buck, to ordinary families wanting extra cash for remodeling, tuition, or whatever, to mortgage giants wanting corporate expansion. And all were driven by the same motive: greed! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, greed. Those evicted families knew perfectly well what they were doing when they freely chose to climb onto the housing bubble and take it for a ride. I have a much higher view of the American public than does Michael Moore. I don’t think the American people are so stupid or uneducated that they didn’t know what they were doing. This wasn’t rocket science. It was even on television, the &lt;em&gt;ne plus ultra&lt;/em&gt; of pop culture! I well remember watching A &amp;amp; E’s television series &lt;em&gt;Flip This House&lt;/em&gt;, and reading all those magazine articles and get-rich-quick books on how to make a fortune in the real estate market, and thinking “wow, everyone’s getting rich except me; how can I get in on the action?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I felt is, I’m sure, what lots of people felt. I looked into securing a second mortgage on my home in order to build a second home on an undeveloped portion of my hillside property, and then selling it to turn a tidy profit. Everyone was doing it. What could go wrong? Well, for starters I thought, what if it takes longer to build the home than I projected? We all know how slow construction projects can be. Could I make the payments on the second mortgage for an additional six months to a year? And what if I couldn’t sell that second home? Could I make the payments on the new loan indefinitely? What if my income decreased instead of increased, like it was at the time (and, subsequently, did … dramatically!). And what would happen if I couldn’t make the payments? The answer was obvious, and it wasn’t in the fine print: I could lose my primary home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget that! Making a profit on a second home would be nice, but losing my first home would hurt well more than twice as much as making a profit on the second home would feel good. That’s a basic principle of risk aversion: losses hurt twice as much as gains feel good. Now, I’m not really a risk-averse guy (I gave up a secure career as a college professor for an insecure career as a writer and publisher), but even I could see the inherent risks involved when the home you live in could be taken away. My hillside remains sagebrush and wild grass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the people on the other end of the economic spectrum — the bankers and Wall Street moguls? Why aren’t they being evicted. Now, given that I’m a libertarian, you might expect me to come to the defense of Corporate America. Not so. Here I am in complete agreement with Michael Moore that, as I’ve been saying since the day it was first pronounced, “too big to fail” is the great myth of our time. None of these giant corporations — GM, AIG, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, et al. — should have been bailed out. In fact, they should have been allowed to fail, their stocks go into the toilet, their employees tossed out on to the gilded streets of lower Manhattan, and their CEOs dispersed to work as greeting clerks at Walmart. They gambled and lost on all those securities, bundled securities, derivatives, credit default swaps, and other “financial tools” that I’ll bet not one in a hundred Wall Street experts actually understands. If you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; believe in free enterprise, you must accept the freedom to lose everything on such gambles. These CEOs and their corporate lackeys are nothing more than welfare queens who adhere to the motto “in profits we’re capitalists, in losses we’re socialists.” Sorry guys, you can’t have it both ways without corrupting your morals, which you have, along with the politicians you’ve bribed, cajoled and otherwise coerced to your bidding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution? I have some suggestions of my own, but Michael Moore’s solution is beyond bizarre: replace capitalism with democracy. Uh? Replace an economic system with a political system? Even the über liberal Bill Maher was baffled by that one when he hosted Moore on his HBO show. How does a democracy produce automobiles and computers and search engines? It doesn’t. It can’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capitalism: A Love Story&lt;/em&gt;, ends with a remarkable film clip that Moore discovered of President Franklin Roosevelt reading from his never proposed second Bill of Rights (he died shortly after and the document died with him). Included in the list are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The right of every family to a decent home;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The right to a good education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s nice. To this list I would add a computer in every home with wireless Internet access. I’m sure we could all think of many more things “under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be established for all — regardless of station, race, or creed,” in Roosevelt’s words. But there is one question left unstated: &lt;em&gt;Who is going to pay for it?&lt;/em&gt; If there is no capitalism, from where will the wealth be generated to pay for all these wonderful things? How much does a “decent” home costs these days, anyway? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see the inherent contradiction? Of course you do. So does Michael Moore, who elsewhere in the film longs for the good old days when the “rich” were taxed 90% of their earnings. So did Willie Sutton, who answered a similar question after being nabbed by the FBI during the Great Depression and asked by a reporter why he robs banks: “Because that’s where the money is.”&lt;/p&gt;

Certainly in my lifetime it seems there has been one or another apocalypse right around the corner. In 1982 the planetary alignments were going to cause massive earthquakes. There were a &lt;a href="http://www.abhota.info/end3.htm"&gt;number of doomsday predictions&lt;/a&gt; over the 80s and 90s, but they were overshadowed by Y2K – perhaps the biggest doomsday fizzle of them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller doomsdays have come and gone since the turn of the millennium, but the next big date is 2012, December 21st to be precise (although some prefer the numerical symmetry of 12/12/12). To solidify this date in the mind of the public Hollywood is coming out with a doomsday thriller called 2012 (I don’t blame them, and it looks like good eye candy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The date of this apocalypse is based upon the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_calendar"&gt;Mayan Calendar&lt;/a&gt;, which allegedly ends on 12/21/2012. The Mayans were fairly advanced in their study of naked-eye astronomy and had a sophisticated calendar. Their “long count” calendar had, as its largest cycle, a period of 394.3 years known as a B’ak’tun. Thirteen was a sacred number to the Mayan, and counting 13 B’ak’tun from their presumed date of creation lands us in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile Pixtun says that the Mayans never claimed or intended for the ending of this calendar to imply the end of the world. That is a figment of Western apocalyptic obsession only. They have or had mystical beliefs about a transition at the end of that cycle, much like the psychological turning of the page we all make on New Year’s day, but not the end of the world. In fact there are Mayan writings the refer to future dates as late as 4772, so clearly they thought we would still be around then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While interesting, none of this really matters. Even if the Mayans firmly believed they had uncovered some astronomical secret of the universe and truly believed the earth would be destroyed on 2012 – so what? That would still just be a bit of pre-scientific superstition, and while they may have had advanced astronomy for an ancient culture, modern astronomy has far surpassed all ancient knowledge and has powerful tools at its disposal not dreamed of by ancient astronomers. There would be no reason for concern about ancient Mayan mythology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the 2012 doomsayers are doubly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, not content with wrongness squared, some doomsayers have added some modern pseudoscience to the mix. Some doomsayers are claiming that sunspot activity will peak in 2012, resulting in solar flares that wipe out our civilization. This is not an implausible scenario, but there is no reason to think it will happen in 2012. As usual, Phil Plait is all over this bit of astronomical pseudoscience. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/23/spotty-conclusions-about-2012/"&gt;Here he debunks &lt;/a&gt;the sunspot claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also those who claim that in 2012 the solar system will pass through the galactic plane, exposing the earth to radiation or something and wiping us out. But, this is simply not true. The solar system will be nowhere near the galactic plane in 2012, and if it were – again, so what, there is no reason to think this will cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2008/05/25/2012-no-planet-x/"&gt;planet X aficionados &lt;/a&gt;-so, there isn’t a killer planet headed our way. And no, we are not going to experience a &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2008/05/19/no-doomsday-in-2012/"&gt;geomagnetic reversal&lt;/a&gt; either (such things take thousands of years anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such claims are good examples of retrofitting. Doomsayers start with the incorrect mythological interpretation that the world will end in 2012, and then search for something pseudoplausible and sciencey they can squeeze into this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But – at least it is fun and light blog fodder. It is also an opportunity to teach some real science and history – a fun way to learn about sunspots and galactic structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also looking forward to the movie. It will probably be dumb, but I’m a sucker for good large-scale CG.&lt;/p&gt;

Is nothing sacred?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.responsesource.com/releases/rel_display.php?relid=50939"&gt;Russell Grant&lt;/a&gt; has consulted his astrological charts and listened to the voice of the cosmos to come up with a list of which chocolate is best suited to each star sign. According to him, my star sign - Libra - &lt;i&gt;likes the finer things in life and is likely to choose soft and smooth chocolate fillings preferably wrapped in a heart-shaped box to share with their partner. Hand-made chocolate moulded in novelty shapes will amuse this chocolate lover.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0fQbSv7TgZM/StNnsHYAQ7I/AAAAAAAAAMs/D5Rxqo1KgnM/s320/chocolate_rose.86193223.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. I like large bars of dark chocolate, preferably Green &amp;amp; Black&amp;#39;s Maya Gold or Cherry. Or anything by &lt;a href="http://www.paulayoung.co.uk/"&gt;Paul Young&lt;/a&gt; of Islington (I would never normally advertise in my blog but this is chocolate and all normal rules are suspended).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novelty chocolate shapes? Yes - chocolate shaped like a very large bar of chocolate. Oh and Russ, I don't share my chocolate with ANYONE. My ideal partner is a diabetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To capture the diet market, or possibly to guilt-trip anyone overweight, there is a chocolate face mask being advertised for Chocolate Week. According to &lt;a href="http://www.myfashionlife.com/archives/2009/10/12/celebrate-national-chocolate-week-without-the-calories/"&gt;the advert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cocoa is packed with antioxidants to smooth skin, macadamia nut oil moisturizes, and almond oil reduces imflammation.&lt;/i&gt; Let's ignore &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-02-27-2006662017_x.htm"&gt;all the research that has found anti-oxidants do sod all&lt;/a&gt;, then. And why would your face be inflamed in the first place? Perhaps from weeping because some bugger bought you this stuff instead of the real thing. Eminence Organic Skincare Mousse Hydration Masque costs £36 for 60ml. That's a teeny tiny pot with a very big name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my local supermarket today, £36 would buy:&lt;br&gt;
78 packs of Minstrels or Maltesers&lt;br&gt;
90 Mars Bars&lt;br&gt;
36 packs of Fox's double chocolate cookies&lt;br&gt;
240 Fingers of Fudge&lt;br&gt;
and I don't even want to think about how many Gü chocolate puddings or I'll have to go out and buy some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/6272067/Britons-spend-more-on-chocolate-than-any-country-in-Europe.html"&gt;Mintel&lt;/a&gt;, people in the UK ate £3.5bn worth of chocolate last year - that's £57 each person. Is that all? If that's an average, there must be an awful lot of babies who aren't onto solids yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mintel have &lt;a href="http://www.mintel.com/press-release/Brits-cross-over-to-the-dark-side-of-chocolate?id=254"&gt;also found&lt;/a&gt; that sales of dark chocolate almost doubled in the UK between 2005 and 2007. A (female) senior market analyst at Mintel said: &lt;i&gt;Although dark chocolate is still high in sugar, it is rich in antioxidants and is lower in fat than milk chocolate. Dark chocolate now has the reputation of being a healthier alternative to other chocolate.&lt;/i&gt; Again with the anti-oxidants. Let's make it absolutely clear - THEY DON'T WORK. Anyone would think chocolate was one of your five a day. If dark chocolate is 'healthier', that means you can eat more of it, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chocolate is not now nor has it ever been good for you (although it is cheaper than Prozac). But it is one of life's essentials. And in case anyone's interested, it's my birthday this week. Good timing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for choosing a difficult, sometimes thankless, but often rewarding profession.  We need more people like you.  And please know that I am available by pager 7 days a week, 24 hours a day for my patients. If anything goes wrong, I'd like to hear about it.   My training has prepared me to answer pages at any time, switching instantly from sleep to work mode, and to give that order for a chest X-ray and intravenous furosemide to help our mutual patient who is having difficulty breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also appreciate that you are thinking not just of the life-or-death needs of my patients, but also of their comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My schedule is rather full, and normally at 6 a.m. I am sleeping, preparing for a day of stamping out disease.  While I'm happy to interrupt my slumber for emergencies, an order for a throat lozenge is not such an emergency.  I do not live in a small box like a veal calf, sitting next to a phone, being force fed Lucky Charms and amphetamines.  I have a quasi-normal life and can serve my patients best by interrupting my rest only for non-trivial matters, the smaller ones being saved for after sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thank you for serving, RN, but if you get home this morning and climb into a nice, cozy bed, try not to wonder whether I'm going to call you about my bowel movements, because right now, I'm feeling just that crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medically yours,&lt;/p&gt;

I watched &lt;a href="http://www.oprah.com/article/oprahshow/20090924-tows-mike-tyson"&gt;his interview on the Oprah show Monday&lt;/a&gt;, and while I think he'll continue to struggle with his past, I thought he was a complete jerk before watching it. He describes his life and I honestly felt for him deeply. He said that he's tired of failing and I believe him. &lt;a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/tyson/"&gt;There's a movie about his life that looks interesting&lt;/a&gt;. But here's my point. Once we understand someone and what made that person who he is, we can love him. If I only understood everything about a person and every experience he has ever had that made him who he is, then I could love him completely. An omniscient God supposedly has that understanding of all of us. Hence an omniscient God can never be angry with us.

I’m with my friend Meredith (who some of you Boston Skeptics have met), and we’ll soon meet up with another good friend (Eve, who some of you met at NECSS). We’ll then begin traveling around Southeast Asia, taking trains and buses up through Malaysia to Thailand and then possibly into Cambodia and Myanmar. (I know, that last one is tricky. I hope to post more about that later, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"&gt;particularly concerning one amazingly heroic and strong woman&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t run into anything requiring serious skeptical inquiry just yet, but I’ve been poring over a guidebook that suggests some Skepchick-worthy stuff. Though my Netbook is refusing to play nicely with wifi connections and might not come with me, I’m sure I’ll be stopping in the occasional Internet cafe to give updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and on the way to Singapore I stopped in Qatar to pee, which I announced on Twitter, and which therefore inspired the headline above.

&lt;p&gt;Old journalists say that if you speak the word 'Trafigura' three times, a lawyer appears in a cloud of sulphurous smoke; telling you not to write about it. This prophecy has come true for the Guardian, on whom everyone's favourite media lawyers Carter-Ruck have placed an unprecedented gagging order which, outrageously, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/oct/12/guardian-gagged-from-reporting-parliament"&gt;bans them from reporting parliament&lt;/a&gt; - a spectacularly undemocratic tactic which as the paper point out calls &lt;i&gt;"into question privileges guaranteeing free speech established under the 1688 Bill of Rights."&lt;/i&gt;  The threats don't work of course; they never have. Not even in ancient times.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
The glittering Temple of Artemis in what is now western Turkey was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. I say &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; because on around July 20th, 356BCE a fame-obsessed man name Herostratus decided to burn it down, claiming credit in an attempt to have his name immortalised in history. The Ephesean authorities not only executed him, but, hoping to deny him his desired fame, banned all mention of his name. He became famous in spite of - or perhaps even &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; of - their actions, in the earliest recorded example of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect"&gt;The Streisand Effect&lt;/a&gt;; the phenomenon by which any attempt to censor something results it it being even more talked about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially true in the Internet Age. As EFF founder &lt;a href="http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/outerspace/internet-article.html"&gt;John Gilmore so eloquently put it back in 1993&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;i&gt;"The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it." &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it was inevitable that, even as The Guardian &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/10/most-significant-constitutional-case-of.html"&gt;go to court today to have the order overturned&lt;/a&gt;, Carter-Ruck's strategy would fail spectacularly. So spectacularly in fact that Trafigura became, briefly, the number one trending topic on Twitter; one of the most talked about stories on the planet. Rarely will you see a legal firm &lt;a href="http://www.inthenews.co.uk/news/politics/twitter-outcry-over-guardian-gagging-order-$1333695.htm"&gt;so deftly beating its own goal-keeper.&lt;/a&gt; Terribly misconceived, as lawyer and legal writer Jack of Kent &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/10/guardian-injunction.html"&gt;would put it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is this Trafigura business all about? And what have the Guardian been banned from reporting? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trafigura.com/"&gt;Trafigura&lt;/a&gt; are a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafigura"&gt;Swiss-based multinational oil trader&lt;/a&gt;, and with a turnover in the region of seventy &lt;i&gt;billion&lt;/i&gt; dollars probably one of the biggest companies you've never heard of, in spite of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipeia.org/wiki/Trafigura#Oil-for-food_scandal"&gt;being accused in the Iraq Oil-for-Food scandal&lt;/a&gt;. They are physical traders, carrying oil around the world, processing and refining it for resale at a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, they spotted &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8259765.stm"&gt;an opportunity for refining sulphur-contaminated gasoline&lt;/a&gt; from the Mexican state refinery, and processing it at sea using a process called "&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/sep/16/trafigura-case-toxic-slop"&gt;caustic washing&lt;/a&gt;", a cheap and decidedly uncheerful process that generates waste so dangerous it is effectively banned in most parts of the world. The refined oil was sold on for several million dollars at a time, but their ships were left with a cargo of toxic waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/16/trafigura-email-files-read"&gt;E-mails obtained by the Guardian showed that in 2006&lt;/a&gt;, having failed to offload this waste in Europe, they took it to Ivory Coast, and disposed of it with an enthusiastic but unqualified local "man-with-a-van." It ended up in dumps around Abidjan, Ivory Coast's maritime capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands fell ill, with many burns inflicted by caustic soda, and many deaths caused by breathing in hydrogen sulphide fumes produced by the waste. The company were &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/16/trafigura-oil-ivory-coast"&gt;forced to settle a 9-figure lawsuit on top of compensation previously given to the country's government&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the present. In parliament today, the a question is due to be asked by Newcastle MP Paul Farrelly, and it is this which &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/oct/12/guardian-gagged-from-reporting-parliament"&gt;the Guardian have been banned from reporting&lt;/a&gt;. As the Guardian have stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's published Commons order papers contain a question to be answered by a minister later this week. The Guardian is prevented from identifying the MP who has asked the question, what the question is, which minister might answer it, or where the question is to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardian is also forbidden from telling its readers why the paper is prevented – for the first time in memory – from reporting parliament. Legal obstacles, which cannot be identified, involve proceedings, which cannot be mentioned, on behalf of a client who must remain secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only fact the Guardian can report is that the case involves the London solicitors Carter-Ruck, who specialise in suing the media for clients, who include individuals or global corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question referenced, which is published online at the Parliament website, is believed to be the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From Parliament.uk, “Questions for Oral or Written Answer beginning on Tuesday 13 October 2009?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    (292409)&lt;br&gt;
    61&lt;br&gt;
    N Paul Farrelly (Newcastle-under-Lyme): To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of legislation to protect (a) whistleblowers and (b) press freedom following the injunctions obtained in the High Court by (i) Barclays and Freshfields solicitors on 19 March 2009 on the publication of internal Barclays reports documenting alleged tax avoidance schemes and &lt;b&gt;(ii) Trafigura and Carter-Ruck solicitors on 11 September 2009 on the publication of the Minton report on the alleged dumping of toxic waste in Ivory Coast, commissioned by Trafigura.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question makes reference to the Minton Report, The &lt;a href="http://go2.wordpress.com/?id=725X1342&amp;amp;site=richardwilsonauthor.wordpress.com&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwikileaks.org%2Fleak%2Fwaterson-toxicwaste-ivorycoast-%25C3%25A92009.pdf"&gt;report is available online&lt;/a&gt;, and suggests that Trafigura knew early on that the waste they dumped in Ivory Coast was toxic, a claim which the company have denied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever Carter-Ruck's reasons for this injunction, their approach has backfired spectacularly. A reference to a question that would have been buried in the middle of the Guardian has now been spread around the world, the question has been posted on numerous websites, and the Minton report is now published online and linked to by thousands of people. And good, because the appalling behaviour of companies like Trafigura needs to be exposed, and people need to stand up to attempts to stifle democracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update, 12:15pm:&lt;/b&gt; John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, has called for &lt;a href="http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;amp;storycode=44464&amp;amp;c=1"&gt;an urgent Commons debate on the matter&lt;/a&gt;. This has been echoed by the Lib Dem chief whip, Paul Burstow, and Nick Clegg has shown an interest in the case on Twitter. No word from anyone from Labour yet. Further &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/oct/13/guardian-court-parliament-reporting-gag"&gt;reporting on this in The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update: 13:00pm&lt;/b&gt; The Guardian are &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/oct/13/guardian-gagged-parliamentary-question"&gt;claiming victory&lt;/a&gt; in their battle to have the order overturned, with Carter-Ruck conceding defeat. Excellent news - common sense prevails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian was due to appear at the High Court at 2pm to challenge Carter-Ruck's behaviour, but the firm has dropped its claim that to report parliament would be in contempt of court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;'The South Carolina primary between Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain in 2000," wrote Eleanor Randolph, the New York Times editorialist, referring to Representative Lindsey Graham's current campaign for the Senate, "left Republicans in his state bitter and divided. That said, both President Bush and Senator McCain have already campaigned for his election to the Senate."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In olden times, those two sentences would have been written as one, with the first clause subordinated: "Although the South Carolina primary . . . left Republicans . . . divided, both Bush and McCain . . . campaigned for his election. . . . " Or they could have remained as two sentences, with the second beginning &lt;em&gt;however&lt;/em&gt; instead of with the voguism &lt;em&gt;that said&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;Immediately after introducing "[t]his absolutive participial construction now spreading like wildfire through our discourse", Safire quotes a linguist:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;We turn now to Prof. John Lawler in the linguistics department of the University of Michigan: "That said is an abbreviated form of the absolutive participial phrase '(With) that (having been) said."' (You were wondering where I got that "absolutive participial" from? You think I make up this stuff? If I had taken Latin, I'd be able to explain the closely related ablative absolute.) Lawler goes on to the essential meaning of that said: "It announces a change of subject, often despite whatever was just said."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By calling that said a "voguism", and noting that things would have different in "olden times", Safire flirts with linguistic peevishness, as he often did. Many of his readers no doubt preferred to interpret him that way, just as LL commenters often write as if the question under discussion were whether a particular usage annoys them. And in this case, Safire was put onto the scent of &lt;em&gt;that said&lt;/em&gt; by emails like &amp;quot;The latest abomination is the substitute for however in its many forms — having said that, that having been said, et cetera. That said, I guess I&amp;#39;ll just have to get with it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after some alliterative harrumphing ("the vocabulary of vacillation"), he describes &lt;em&gt;that said&lt;/em&gt; as an inverted-order rhetorical equivalent of "to be sure" ("X. To be sure, Y" == "Y. That said, X"), and closes with the opinion that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;To be sure, &lt;em&gt;that said&lt;/em&gt; has its good side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I bringing up this seven-year-old column? Because one of the many interesting talks that I heard at AACL 2009 was &lt;a href="http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/lbrinton/"&gt;Laurel Brinton&lt;/a&gt;'s 'The development of 'that said'".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brinton cites the results of a &lt;a href="http://www.americancorpus.org/"&gt;COCA&lt;/a&gt; search showing that &lt;em&gt;that said&lt;/em&gt; has indeed increased in popularity over the past couple of decades, apparently by moving from (some registers of) the spoken language into writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Brinton1.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Brinton1.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also gives the results of a search of the Time Magazine archive (also available on Mark Davies excellent web site at BYU), which suggests that a fairly rapid increase in popularity beginning in the 1990s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Brinton3.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Brinton3.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she presents evidence to contradict a temporal implication of Safire's quotation of John Lawler: 'That said is an abbreviated form of the absolutive participial phrase '(With) that (having been) said."'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that John probably meant this as a description of a cognitive process, or perhaps simply as a way to clarify the grammatical structure involved; but as an account of the historical development of this phrase, Brinton argues that it is  false.  Before giving her own new evidence, she cites earlier authorities who give a different account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Curme 1931 (&lt;em&gt;A  Grammar of the English Language. Vol.  II: Syntax,&lt;/em&gt; 153): absolute constructions without copula are original, more modern trend is to take tense (&lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt;) and voice (&lt;em&gt;having been&lt;/em&gt;), especially when active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Jespersen 1946 (&lt;em&gt;Modern  Grammar on Historical Principles.  Part V: Syntax, Fourth  Volume&lt;/em&gt;, 46, 55): &lt;em&gt;that said&lt;/em&gt; is the original construction; the "more clumsy construction" &lt;em&gt;that being said&lt;/em&gt; "begins to appear in the 16th century; &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;having been said&lt;/em&gt; dates from the 18th century.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Visser 1972 (&lt;em&gt;An  Historical Syntax of the English Language. Part  Two: Syntactical  Units with one Verb,&lt;/em&gt; 1259ff.): generally, absolute constructions with the simple past participle are original, forms with &lt;em&gt;having/being/having been &lt;/em&gt;are introduced in the modern period and are now often preferred.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before pursuing the history, Brinton gives a table suggesting that American and British usage may now follow somewhat different patterns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COCA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BNC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[punc] {that, this} said,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;773&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;134&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[conj] {that, this} said,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;67&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[prep] {that, this} said,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;52&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;all (of) {that, this} said,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;59&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{that, this} being said,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;172&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{that, this} having been said,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total passive form&lt;/strong&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1159&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;166&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequency per million&lt;br&gt;(passive forms)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.89&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.90&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;having said {that, this}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;698&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;247&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequency per million&lt;br&gt;(active forms)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.73&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.82&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(But note that the BNC material was collected in the early 1990s, whereas COCA contains material spread equally over the period 1990-2009 — since the pattern is presumably changing on both sides of the Atlantic, an accurate account of differences will require looking across comparable sources across comparable time periods..)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also observes that  CGEL (p. 1350) analyzes &lt;em&gt;that said &lt;/em&gt;as an "absolute construction within the class of supplements, or "elements which occupy a position in linear sequence without being integrated into the syntactic structure of the sentence", where "absolutes" express adverbial notions such as cause, condition, time, concession, manner, and attendant circumstances. She also cites the description of &lt;em&gt;that said&lt;/em&gt; by Quirk et al. (1985) as a "contrastive-concessive disjunct".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She notes Garner's observation (in &lt;em&gt;Modern American Usage&lt;/em&gt;, 2003) that &lt;em&gt;having said that&lt;/em&gt; “is a frequent source of DANGLERS” when not anchored to a speaker in the main clause; he advises deleting the “casualism” as it “doesn’t say much anyway”. However, Quirk, Greenbaum &amp;amp; Leech&amp;#39;s 1985 grammar (p. 623n) claims that &lt;em&gt;having said that&lt;/em&gt; “has become so stereotyped that it can violate” the “subject-attachment rule”; and Curme (1931:158-159) also argued that in this case, the construction is no longer connected with a subject at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She cites the OED's gloss, added as a 2007 online supplement to the 3rd edition's entry for &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; ("In phrases introducing a concessive clause. &lt;em&gt;having said that&lt;/em&gt; (also &lt;em&gt;that said&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;that being said&lt;/em&gt;): even so; nevertheless") with citations only back to 1908 for &lt;em&gt;that being said&lt;/em&gt; and 1923 for &lt;em&gt;that said&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1908&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Manitoba Morning Free Press&lt;/em&gt; (Electronic text) 1 Aug., The story of Sir James Douglas might have been told in smaller compass… That being said, James Douglas certainly deserved a place among the makers of Canada. &lt;strong&gt;1923 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; 14 Aug. 5/2 The change does not appear to be popular… That said, there is little to criticize in the performance last night. &lt;strong&gt;1975&lt;/strong&gt; A. V. GRIMSTONE in K. Sekida &lt;em&gt;Zen Training&lt;/em&gt; 21, I believe it would be possible..to mount a convincing refutation of the argument… However, having said that, I would add that I do not believe it is really necessary to defend the practice of Zen in that way. &lt;strong&gt;1986&lt;/strong&gt; C. SNYDER &lt;em&gt;Strategic Def. Deb.&lt;/em&gt; 222 We have little choice; today's technology provides no alternative. That being said, we will press for radical reductions in the number and power of strategic and intermediate-range nuclear arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she observes that Safire missed the chance to give the traditional name of "procatalepsis" to the rhetorical figure that he describes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Writers of opinion articles know how to use what we call a to-be-sure graph. After making an argument, some of us feel the urge to show that we are not simpletons — that we know the counterarguments, have taken them into due consideration, but still maintain our positions. In goes the to-be-sure graph, disarming our opponents with its &amp;quot;Yes, we know all that folderol on the other side&amp;quot; […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;To be sure is a rhetorical device to set up and counter the opposition after your initial point has been made. You often present the other side&amp;#39;s position as a straw man easy to knock down and then repeat your opening argument with great force at the end. This to-be-sure trick is described by grammarians as &amp;quot;concessive&amp;quot; — that is, I&amp;#39;ll give you this; it costs me nothing and makes me appear reasonable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;However (to use an old construction), that said is a device that works in the other direction. The point to be negated is made first: "My opponent is a great guy, a real patriot and a quick study." (End of concessive construction.) "That said, he doesn't know what he is talking about."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare the &lt;a href="http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.03.0096&amp;amp;query=head=#418"&gt;relevant section&lt;/a&gt; of Henry Peachum's 1593 &lt;a href="http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.03.0096&amp;amp;query="&gt;Garden of Eloquence&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procatalepsis&lt;/strong&gt; is a forme of speech by which the Orator perceiving aforehand what might be objected against him, and hurt him, doth confute it before it be spoken, or thus: when the Orator putteth forth the same objection against himselfe, which he doth thinke his adversarie would, and then refelleth it by a reason, whereby he doth providently prevent him. Cicero: as if some Judge or commiissioner might say unto me, thou mightest have contended with a lighter action, thou mightest have come to thy right by a more easie and profitable way: wherefore either change thine action, or resist me not as Judge: or if he do prescribe after what sort I ought to sue for my right, to which objection he maketh this answere. Notwithstanding he seemeth either more fearfull then is reason a Judge should be: or else he dareth not judge that which is committed to him. Likewise against Verres, Cicero saith, that he knoweth some men will marvell, seeing so many yeares he defended many, and hurt none, he doth now come to accuse Verres, then he doth shew them that this accusation against Verres is a defence of their fellowes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the history of &lt;em&gt;that said&lt;/em&gt;, Brinton notes that despite the antiquity of procatalepsis, this particular way of expressing it seems to be of fairly recent origin. The earliest examples in the OED are from 1923 (&lt;em&gt;that said&lt;/em&gt;) and 1908 (&lt;em&gt;that being said&lt;/em&gt;), with a 1975 citation for &lt;em&gt;having said that&lt;/em&gt;, and no examples of the other forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She found no examples in the following corpora of Early and Late Modern English:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helsinki Corpus of English Texts, Modern English Section (1500–1710) 551,000 words&lt;br&gt;

Corpus of Late 18C Prose (1761–90) 300,000 words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She checked these additional corpora:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLEMT Corpus of Late Modern English Texts (1710–1920) 10 million words&lt;br&gt;
CEN Corpus of English Novels (1881–1922) 25 million words&lt;br&gt;

ED English Drama (1280-1915) 3,900 plays&lt;br&gt;
TIME Corpus (1923 – 2000)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was able to find a number of earlier uses, e.g. "And these wordes sayd, she streyght her on length and rested a whyle", from 1387-88. But these are the literal usage that she calls "temporal/sequential", not the "contrastive/concessive" use.  The earliest clearly concessive examples she was able to find are from the late 19th to early 20th century:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;This being said, Mr. Hamilton and his colleagues of the executive council of the Territories will pardon me if I do not receive … the assurance given by them … (1894 Sessional Papers of the Dominion of Canada, Vol. 17, p. 57; ECO)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;That being said we come to the question as to whether the work is worth the money (1900 Official Report of the House of Commons of the Dominion of Canada: Fifth Session, Eighth Parliament, p. 9663; ECO)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus contra Lawler, Brinton argues that "there is no evidence of the construction being a reduced form of &lt;em&gt;(with) this/that having been said&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; — she found no non-recent examples of this pattern at all. The time-sequence uses of &lt;em&gt;this said&lt;/em&gt; date from the late 16th c., with the earliest examples of temporal/sequential &lt;em&gt;that said&lt;/em&gt; from a bit later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue (1592-93 Shakespeare, Venus and Adonis; UofV)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;She is a hansome picture, And that said, all is spoken (1636 Massinger, The Great Duke of Florence; ED)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She found a few possible (but ambiguous) early examples of concessive &lt;em&gt;that/this said&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;They all are made my Lord, and some giue out, That ‘tis a blow giuen to religion, To weaken it, in ruining of him, That said, he neuer wisht more glorious title, Then to be call’d the scrouge of Hugenots (1608 Chapman, Charles Duke of Byron; ED)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Then, daughter, graunt me one request, To shew thou louest me as thy sisters doe, Accept a husband, whom my selfe will woo. This sayd, she cannot well deny my sute (1605 Anon., King Leir; ED)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there's a gap of three centuries or so, before clear examples of &lt;em&gt;that said&lt;/em&gt; begin to appear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The change does not appear to be popular … That said, there is little to criticize in the performance last night (1923 Times 14 Aug 5/2; OED)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So summarizing her findings in a table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;this said&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;that said&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;this being said&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;that being said&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;having said this&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;having said that&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sequential&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;late 16th c&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;mid 17th c&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;early 16th c&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;—&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;early 17th c&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;mid 18th c&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Concessive&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;?17th c&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17th c?/
&lt;p&gt;20th c&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;late 19th c&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;early 20th c&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;mid 18th c&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20th c&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I observed in the question period after Brinton's talk that the Latin phrase &lt;em&gt;his dictis&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;quot;these [things having been] said&amp;quot;) was reasonably common — for example, it occurs &lt;a href="http://www.newadvent.org/utility/search.htm?safe=active&amp;amp;cx=000299817191393086628%3Aifmbhlr-8x0&amp;amp;q="&gt;six times in the Vulgate&lt;/a&gt;. Thus Luke 19:25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Et dixerunt ei: Domine, habet decem mnas. 26 Dico autem vobis, quia omni habenti dabitur, et abundabit: ab eo autem qui non habet, et quod habet auferetur ab eo. 27 Verumtamen inimicos meos illos, qui noluerunt me regnare super se, adducite huc: et interficite ante me. 28 Et &lt;strong&gt;his dictis&lt;/strong&gt;, præcedebat ascendens Jerosolymam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Douay-Rheims translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;25 And they said to him: Lord, he hath ten pounds. 26 But I say to you that to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: and from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken from him. 27 But as for those my enemies, who would not have me reign over them, bring them hither and kill them before me. 28 And having said these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His dictis&lt;/em&gt; also occurs several times in Virgil, e.g.  Aeneid IV 54&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;His dictis impenso animum flammauit amore&lt;br&gt;
spemque dedit dubiae menti soluitque pudorem.&lt;br&gt;
principio delubra adeunt pacemque per aras&lt;br&gt;
exquirunt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;So saying, she stirred a passion-burning breast&lt;br&gt;
to love more madly still; her words infused&lt;br&gt;
a doubting mind with hope, and bade the blush&lt;br&gt;
of shame begone. &lt;/span&gt;(Theodore C. Williams translation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus educated 16th- or 17th-century authors would probably be familiar with &lt;em&gt;his dictis&lt;/em&gt; — but all the classical examples that I&amp;#39;ve been able to find are strictly temporal/sequential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brinton's conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;The concessive meaning develops from, and has replaced, the temporal/sequential meaning.&lt;br&gt;
The longer forms develop from the shorter forms.&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That/this said&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;having said that/this&lt;/em&gt; have separate histories.&lt;br&gt;
For the most part, the &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;forms have replaced the&lt;em&gt; this&lt;/em&gt; forms.&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That said&lt;/em&gt; shows a marked increase in frequency beginning in about 1990.&lt;br&gt;
Semantic change in this construction conforms to well known paths of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to the last point, she cites Traugott and Dasher’s “correlated paths of directionality” (&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bKL3YIUdPgQC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regularity in Semantic Change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2002):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;truth-conditional&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;non-truth-conditional&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;content&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;content/procedural&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;procedural&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;scope within proposition&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;scope over proposition&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;scope over discourse&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;non-subjective&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;subjective&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;intersubjective&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, it surprises me that this process didn't take place much earlier.  For example, there are plenty of Latin phrases that followed the path to "non-truth-conditional", "procedural", "scope over discourse", "intersubjective" uses.  So why didn't &lt;em&gt;his dictis&lt;/em&gt; make this journey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And was the 1990s &lt;em&gt;that said&lt;/em&gt; vogue a random event? Or has there been something especially procataleptic about the past couple of decades?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255430452116"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4762827614191702843.post-8564521554651812851">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/355e161e245c846c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Guardian" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The Most Significant Constitutional Case Of Our Generation?</title><published>2009-10-13T09:39:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-13T09:39:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/10/most-significant-constitutional-case-of.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; has announced today that it hopes to be in court to discharge the &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/10/guardian-injunction.html"&gt; injunction against reporting a parliamentary question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One must wish &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; - and especially its lawyers - well in this endeavour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is unlikely that such a powerful injunction was granted on the basis of libel alone - or at all.  It may have been based on the grounds of privacy, confidentiality, legal privilege, or even contempt of court.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whatever the basis of the injunction, it seems to raise the crucial issue of the extent to which the courts can grant injunctions in respect of reporting parliamentary business, when such reports are protected by no less than the 1688 Bill of Rights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If so, this case directly pits the very extremity of the power of the courts against the most fundamental privilege of parliament.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This may well be the most significant constitutional case of our generation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-8564521554651812851?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255428241508"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/clock_quotes_442.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a9ed64b9fa4fd78e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-10-13T08:55:20Z</published><updated>2009-10-13T08:55:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/V19hRfuDkh8/clock_quotes_442.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/clock_quotes_442.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proverbs are jewels five words long, that on the stretched forefinger of all time sparkle forever. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “laws” of biology aren’t like the laws of physics, because they deal with stuff that’s alive, which doesn’t always obey the mathematical rigour of a “law”. And when we think we’ve found something that’s hard and fast, there’s generally an exception. So, for example, over 40,000 species of spider have been described, and they are all carnivorous (even if some occasionally sip nectar or eat pollen). “Spiders are carnivorous” would seem to be an appropriate generalization. But it isn’t a law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6VRT-4XF85VF-B&amp;amp;_user=6991156&amp;amp;_coverDate=10%2F13%2F2009&amp;amp;_rdoc=10&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_orig=browse&amp;amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%236243%232009%23999809980%231529114%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&amp;amp;_cdi=6243&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;_ct=35&amp;amp;_acct=C000024058&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=6991156&amp;amp;md5=03177ff2d226425df965c1528d637911"&gt;Today’s issue of Current Biology&lt;/a&gt; [subscription needed] shows why. It features an amazing discovery – a largely herbivorous jumping spider (Salticid) going by the charming name of &lt;em&gt;Bagheera kiplingi&lt;/em&gt; (if you don’t know why that’s charming, then you need to either watch or better still read The Jungle Book). This tiny spider has been found in Mexico and Costa Rica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spider eats the juicy orange tips (”Beltian bodies”) of the leaves of the acacia tree, which are protected by ants in a classic mutualist relationship (see picture below). First discovered in 2001 by Eric Olsen (Brandeis), and then – independently – in 2007 by a student, Christopher Meehan (Villanova, the spider uses its acute vision and jumping ability to avoid the ant protectors. Both behavioral observations and chemical analysis show that the spider eats the Beltian bodies. However, it is not strictly herbivorous – it will also nibble the odd ant larva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/0-3.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img title="DSC_0087" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/0-3.jpeg?w=500&amp;amp;h=332" alt="DSC_0087" width="500" height="332"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bagheera kiplingi spider gathering a Beltian body (Photo: Robert Curry, Current Biology)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;The article – with Robert Curry (Villanova) as senior author – describes the biology of &lt;em&gt;B. kiplingi&lt;/em&gt; and concludes that, paradoxically, the spider was able to make the shift to herbivory only because there was the previously-existing mutualism between the acacia tree and its &lt;em&gt;Pseudomyrmex&lt;/em&gt; ant protectors. The ants protect the Beltian bodies very effectively, and only an agile herbivore – like the spider – could get past their protection (download a video &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/MiamiMultiMediaURL/B6VRT-4XF85VF-B/B6VRT-4XF85VF-B-8/6243/html/11bc4fa2e0b484b6961f3d6fd7143dfa/mmc2.mov"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or watch it at the BBC &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8302535.stm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Without the ants, more bovine herbivores would easily out-compete the spider.&lt;/p&gt;

And that BBC report, part of a new "Hunger to Learn" series includes some videos featuring interviews with some of the kids in that school. &lt;i&gt;(Sorry the BBC doesn't enable embedding of their videos, so you'll have to go watch them there)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So cheer up! Things can't be all bad if our species can still produce such kids, even in the worst of circumstances, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

Looking for something to light that fire anew, to inspire you again to keep at it, to show that the world can change for the better, even if only in small steps incrementally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here are a couple of teenagers from the global south who just might do that: inspire you, perhaps revive your activist mojo, and leave you with more hope for the future. Last week, &lt;a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-october-7-2009/william-kamkwamba"&gt;the Daily Show interviewed an African youth, William Kamkwamba&lt;/a&gt;, who built a windmill from a picture in a library book - when he was all of 14 years old:&lt;/p&gt;

The most promising longevity research indicates that severe calorie restriction might extend life span, but such a diet is difficult to follow. Resveratrol, a phytochemical found in red wine, has been evaluated as a possible way out of the dilemma. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17086191?ordinalpos=5&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;When given to obese mice on a high calorie diet&lt;/a&gt;, it produced a number of changes associated with improved health, such as increased insulin sensitivity, and it increased survival. Perhaps by taking resveratrol you could eat as much as you want and get fat without suffering the usual consequences. Perhaps you could get the longevity benefits of severe calorie restriction without restricting calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to fat mice, resveratrol also extends the life of &lt;em&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/em&gt; (yeast, nematodes, and fruit flies). But &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18599363?ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;a study in non-obese mice &lt;/a&gt;found no increase in survival (although it did find several signs of improved health). Besides the anti-aging claims, there is also some evidence from in vitro and animal studies that it might have cardiovascular effects and anti-cancer effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ads for one product &lt;a href="http://vinotroldirect.com/"&gt;(Vinotrol)&lt;/a&gt; say:&lt;br&gt;
• “Life is short… or maybe not.&lt;br&gt;
• Top Harvard researcher says it’s “the Holy Grail of aging research.”&lt;br&gt;
• As seen on CBS “60 Minutes.”&lt;br&gt;
• Harvard Medical School, Johns Hopkins, Salk Institute and UC Davis Medical Research Proves that Powerful Red Wine Extract Holds the Secret to Living a Longer, Healthier and More Vibrant Life&lt;br&gt;
• Has the “French Paradox” finally been explained?&lt;br&gt;
• Trick your body into “aging in slow motion.”&lt;br&gt;
• Can you live years longer and feel years younger?&lt;br&gt;
• “extends the life of every species it’s been given to.”&lt;br&gt;
• Vinotrol, with 50 mg of resveratrol derived from grapes and roots, provides the equivalent of the resveratrol in 278 five ounce glasses of Pinot Noir.&lt;br&gt;
• Promoting circulation, blood flow, [what’s the difference between these two?] immune system [ &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1828"&gt;Mark Crislip has recently explained to us what that means&lt;/a&gt;], energy and healthy arteries.&lt;br&gt;

Vinotrol is not endorsed, associated or affiliated in any way with Harvard University, Johns Hopkins, Salk Institute or UC Davis Medical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stephen Barrett of Quackwatch has summarized the evidence for resveratrol at &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/DSH/resveratrol.html"&gt;“Resveratrol: Don’t Buy the Hype.” &lt;/a&gt;It was recently evaluated by the “gold standard” publication &lt;em&gt;The Medical Letter&lt;/em&gt; (Vol. 51 Issue 1321, p. 74-5, September 21, 2009). They pointed out “studies in humans are limited” and concluded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resveratrol appears to produce some of the same effects as calorie-restricted diets that have reduced the incidence of age-related diseases in animals. Whether it has any benefit in humans remains to be established. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.naturaldatabase.com/(S(wkmaxn55awt3h1454bzmad45))/home.aspx?cs=&amp;amp;s=ND"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is insufficient reliable information available about the effectiveness of resveratrol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its safety has not been established, and there is speculation that it might potentiate certain cancers. The &lt;em&gt;Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database&lt;/em&gt; concluded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of resveratrol when used in supplemental doses in amounts greater than those found in foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are concerns about interactions with other drugs. It has antiplatelet effects and preliminary evidence shows that resveratrol might inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP3A, CYP1A, and CYP2E1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resveratrol products have been associated with &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_32/b4142000175800.htm"&gt;scams and false advertising&lt;/a&gt;. Researcher Dr. David Sinclair is quoted in ads without his permission. He commented&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lab showed that mice fed the chemicals live at least 15% longer than normal mice. But to get such benefits, human beings might have to consume up to 5 grams of resveratrol a day, he says. That’s about 80 pills, at doses found in a typical bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The properties of resveratrol are intriguing, and it may turn out to be a useful drug. But so far the studies on resveratrol are pre-clinical studies. We have no data on its effects in humans. Few people would want to take a proposed prescription drug that had not yet undergone clinical trials: why should resveratrol be any different? In the absence of clinical trials, resveratrol might be recommended for obese mice, but not for men.&lt;/p&gt;

For some reason my long comments there weren't getting through (perhaps he hates me?), but I thought perhaps they were good enough as an actual blog post anyway. I think the very largest problem with this so-called debate about healthcare is that a huge amount of conflation keeps happening...on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health care technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is not the same thing as a health care &lt;em&gt;system&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its that simple. Seems obvious, so how come these morons can't keep the debate focused on the right thing? The debate should only be about the latter and should not include the former.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Care Technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is little doubt and little debate (at least amongst Americans) that America has the best health care technology in the world. Better than that, we export, and make tons of money on this very technology. This technology with respect not not only life saving procedures, but also effective drugs and treatments for non-life threatening issues like chronic stomach pain, restless leg syndrome, impotence, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;I don't want to ignore the contribution in many areas that come from other countries, I do recognize some amazing work that comes out of France and Japan that I am familiar with. I'm sure significant contributions come from other countries, I am just only familiar with these two (sorry if I left your country out). Even my vasectomy that I had, was done with a Thai procedure (but I got it here). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;But in the end, I think we can safely say that America does in fact, provide the world with more of what we call "western medicine" than any other country. We also can say that we have studied the efficacy of this work (from USA and other countries), and found that we have made &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19679548"&gt;great strides in cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4037.pdf"&gt;prevention of transmissible diseases&lt;/a&gt;, and other health areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Even if the science was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/was_nazi_science_good_science.php"&gt;attained through completely unethical means&lt;/a&gt;, and the efficacy of the treatment is proven, it is still healthcare technology and not part of the system under debate. That is not an endorsement of unethical behavior, its simply a fact that if a treatment is verified to work, its simply a fact that it does, which is a different issue than the means by which this fact was attained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;One more fact about our medical technology that is almost universally considered unsurpassed. The great majority of it was developed through a so-called 'socialist' mechanism. Yes folks, I'm sorry to say you have this wonderful healthcare technology due to a giant wealth redistribution system that takes money from citizen and aims billions of dollars of it towards medical research to the tunes of tens of billions of dollars annually.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/about/budget.htm"&gt;30 billion&lt;/a&gt; from the National Institute of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 80% of the NIH's funding is awarded through almost 50,000 &lt;a href="http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/"&gt;competitive grants&lt;/a&gt; to more than 325,000 researchers at over 3,000 universities, medical schools, and other research institutions in every state and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/about/business/funding.htm"&gt;6 billion&lt;/a&gt; redistributed dollars from the CDC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC awards nearly 85 percent of its budget through grants and contracts to help accomplish its mission to promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;The Health and Human Services has a budget of &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/fy2010_new_era/Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services1.pdf"&gt;76 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;p&gt; The HHS grant portfolio is the largest in the federal government with more than 300 grant programs operating under its annual grant budget that amounts to approximately 60% of the Federal government's grant dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;These tax dollars get doled on in a competitive peer reviewed process (as do grants for the DoD and DoE etc) in the form of phased grants. Sometimes the a &lt;a href="http://www.sbir.gov/"&gt;Small Business Innovation Research&lt;/a&gt; (SBIR) grants. Sometimes they are grand challenges, and sometimes they come in other forms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Compare these values to the paltry &lt;a href="http://www.nvca.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;amp;task=doc_download&amp;amp;gid=471&amp;amp;ItemId=93"&gt;10 billion or so dollars that venture capitalists invest&lt;/a&gt; every year. Conservatives seem to think that venture capitalists can do this, but I have sad news for them. Basic research rarely pays off directly, but it forms a foundation for the items that do pay off. VC tend to invest after the preliminary work has already been done, when the product has been fleshed out, even when some early units have shipped. They have almost no tolerance for the very early work. There are exceptions: Drug companies do invest lots of money in a new drug for example, but they get their returns in getting a formula retweaked as long as possible rather than doing the basic research for something truly novel (&lt;a href="http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/print/1463/how-i-discovered-viagra"&gt;Viagra was found by accident&lt;/a&gt; and will get tweaked as the patent's time limit arrives, much like you see Claritin coming in a new form).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;To sum up this part... The healthcare technology in the USA is possibly the best in the world. It also got this way through largely socialist means (but not totally) while the money is being made through capitalist means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health care system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A health care system is the mechanism by which the technology gets distributed to the people. Most, if not all, countries with longer lifespans (we rank &lt;a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html"&gt;50th&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy"&gt;35th&lt;/a&gt; depending on where you look) and &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,136990,00.html"&gt;greater healthcare satisfaction&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/117205/americans-not-feeling-health-benefits-high-spending.aspx"&gt;17th&lt;/a&gt;) have a socialized healthcare system. The citizens are taxed, the money is pooled and healthcare is delivered to everyone in the nation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Our healthcare system works by letting companies compete to provide better healthcare to their customers. At least that is the theory. In reality healthcare costs for customers of any of these companies average out to be far higher than in any other country, without the benefit of longer lifespans or better satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Liberal like me can't see how we can expect a company, with an inherently smaller pool of customers than a socialized system would provide, can possibly deliver competitive costs with respect to other countries. Never mind the fact that the profit motive necessarily raises costs even if it &lt;a href="http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2009/08/health-insurance-industry-ranks-86-by.html"&gt;as little as 3.3%&lt;/a&gt;. Never mind the &lt;a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200909/091709a.html"&gt;anti-trust issues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/17/business/fi-rescind17"&gt;unethical recision&lt;/a&gt; and all the other bad practices that they do, each company necessarily has a miniscule insurance pool by which to couch the payouts. Insurance works best when you have lots of healthy people paying into it. The whole country as an insurance pool is better than breaking it up into 50 smaller pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Anyway, regardless of my opinions of our system. The debate would go a lot easier if we stuck to discussion about a health care system rather than the state of our health care technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Here is a video going around. Both of these men perform the very conflation I am talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 10px"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/tB5DLf1Qt78%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/26613182-1308884995494896927?l=techskeptic.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Techskeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Effort Sisyphus</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255408348107"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/cafe_scientifique_minneapolis.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/acba1ea14d6f1021</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Events"/><title type="html">Cafe Scientifique Minneapolis</title><published>2009-10-13T04:28:12Z</published><updated>2009-10-13T04:28:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/rMw7dcG5dZ0/cafe_scientifique_minneapolis.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/cafe_scientifique_minneapolis.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;October 20th&lt;br&gt;

Bryant Lake Bowl&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Foley&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment, will talk about another inconvenient truth: our complex global food and agricultural system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With your help Foley will take-up the question, "&lt;em&gt;How will we feed and fuel more than nine billion people without destroying our environment in the process?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doors for this event open at 6pm. Tickets can be purchased in advance on the Bryant-Lake Bowl's website (see link below).&lt;br&gt;

If there are any of my readers who happen to be surgeons attending the meeting, drop me a line and maybe we can get together. In the meantime, here's a blast from the past from the past. This post first reared its ugly head almost exactly three years ago; so if you haven't been reading at least three years, it's new to you. Unfortunately, I see nothing that has changed since I originally wrote this. If anything, I underestimated the problem. Ain't it great to have three years' perspective on something you wrote?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the favorite gambits that alternative medicine mavens like to use to defend their favorite remedies when a skeptic starts asking uncomfortably pointed and specific questions their scientific and evidentiary basis is to accuse said skeptic of being "in the pocket of big pharma." Indeed, I've written before of the "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/09/the_pharma_shill_gambit_1.php"&gt;pharma shill gambit&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; where alties accuse skeptics of being nothing more than shills for the pharmaceutical industry (to which I always respond that it would be a dream come true to be paid for doing nothing more than posting skepticism about non-evidence-based medicine to a blog and Usenet but that unfortunately I&amp;#39;m just doing this as a hobby). There&amp;#39;s no doubt that big pharma makes a nice, juicy target, and no one claims the industry is without its problems. It&amp;#39;s also true that there&amp;#39;s a lot of money in pharma. But there&amp;#39;s also a lot of regulation and huge expenses. For example, between R &amp;amp; D costs, the costs of doing the clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy, it costs around &lt;a href="http://www.eyeonfda.com/eye_on_fda/2006/10/synopsis_of_the.html"&gt;$800 million&lt;/a&gt; to bring just a single truly new drug (known as a "new molecular entity" or NME) to market, but can be about 60-70% less for a new drug in an established class of drugs (a.k.a. a "me-too" drug. Still, that's righteous bucks (at least $250-300 million). By comparison, you'd think that the alternative medicine and supplement industry is a scrappy and poor underdog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'd only be half right. The alternative medicine industry may be smaller than big pharma right now, but it's hardly poor.

Some other quick thoughts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was not hype.  If anything, it was pretty modest, given the amount and significance of the work involved.  I didn't see the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Darwinius &lt;/span&gt;special, but even the previews had me wincing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mike Rowe is an excellent narrator.  I have enjoyed his work when I have watched Deadliest Catch and Dirty Jobs, but I would also like to see (er, hear) him on more specials like this in the future.  Mike, if you happen to read this, nicely done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The special did a fine job of emphasizing over and over what needs to be emphasized over and over: we are not descended from chimps, we share a &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;common ancestor&lt;/span&gt; with chimps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This isn't so significant as evidence for the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;fact &lt;/span&gt;of human evolution -- we had plenty of that before.  This is an important find that illustrates more about the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;path &lt;/span&gt;of human evolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; I am not sure I entirely see why Ardi necessarily shows that the common ancestor was not chimp-like (knuckle-walking and large canine teeth could have been lost after the split), but I will see if this is made more clear in the actual papers.  Nonetheless, no one should have &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;assumed &lt;/span&gt;the common ancestor must have been very similar to a chimp -- that assumption is based on a poor grasp of phylogenetics, basically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The show could probably have been about 1/2 hour shorter.  I enjoy seeing reconstructions, and I appreciate that they showed how this is done (I go through this briefly in one of my lectures as well, and I also liken it to forensic reconstruction).  However, this did seem to imply a little more than I would have liked that coming up with a digital animation was the culmination of the work rather than an interesting aside.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They could have done without the just-so story about pair bonding and carrying food.  I guess viewers would prefer some idea, and they did mention that there were many previous hypotheses, but if I had one significant complaint about the special it's that this part was really speculative and not up to the standard of the rest of the meticulous research depicted otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-5557185543787348261?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/T2nlwySgxQ4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255406598740"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/tweetlinks_10-12-09.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8fa7dfba1bb49512</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Tweetlinks"/><title type="html">Tweetlinks, 10-12-09</title><published>2009-10-13T03:09:53Z</published><updated>2009-10-13T03:09:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/GQvIrJ3nqqM/tweetlinks_10-12-09.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/tweetlinks_10-12-09.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Yes! Yes, I am!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, 16 November, I'm going to be doing a debate. I hate debates, but I've been dragged into this one. It's being promoted by the &lt;a href="http://tccsa.tc/"&gt;local creationist loons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://cashumn.org/"&gt;CASH&lt;/a&gt;, and I'd like to see a good turnout from the sensible, scientific, godless community. I'll be arguing with a &lt;a href="http://www.bay-of-fundie.com/archives/410/how-the-fallen-have-fallen-jerry-bergman-stoops-to-kevin-wirth"&gt;loud clown, Jerry Bergman&lt;/a&gt;, on "Should Intelligent Design Be Taught in the Schools?" I think you can guess which side I'm going to be on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, 3 December, I'll be back on the Twin Cities campus to give a public lecture, again sponsored by &lt;a href="http://cashumn.org/"&gt;CASH&lt;/a&gt;, on development, neuroscience, and evolution. It will be all science, so the creationist kooks have no part in this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and there will be a few non-local events in November, too. I'm giving the keynote at the &lt;a href="http://www.bio.indiana.edu/~igert/symposium/index.htm"&gt;IGERT symposium&lt;/a&gt; in Bloomington, Indiana. This isn&amp;#39;t a public lecture, I&amp;#39;m afraid — it&amp;#39;s part of an evo-devo meeting. If you want to register, don&amp;#39;t do it for me — I&amp;#39;m most looking forward to hearing my grad school advisor, &lt;a href="http://www.neuro.uoregon.edu/kimmel/klab.html"&gt;Chuck Kimmel&lt;/a&gt;, tell us what he's been up to, and there are a whole &lt;a href="http://www.bio.indiana.edu/~igert/symposium/schedule.htm"&gt;series of enticing talks&lt;/a&gt; planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don't forget &lt;a href="http://skepticon.broadcast44.com/"&gt;Skepticon II&lt;/a&gt;! I'll be at Missouri State University, 20-22 November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it for my Fall travel plans — I&amp;#39;m mainly going to be home, working.

&lt;p&gt;But today, I actually want to thank Oz for some recent good he’s done trying to promote vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;   &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/M_rKKawZx0I%26rel%3D1%26fs%3D1%26showsearch%3D0%26hd%3D0&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=350" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;   &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Hk5ANhHAJq4%26rel%3D1%26fs%3D1%26showsearch%3D0%26hd%3D0&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=350" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the really, really odd part is that the YouTube account that posted these 2 videos either belongs to medical quack “Dr.” Mercola or some fan of his. So I guess this is meant to discredit Oz in the minds of Mercola’s audience even though whoever uploaded it didn’t add any commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I guess when you’ve got people this nuts who just KNOW “The Truth” with absolute certainty, no commentary is needed. The comments section in both videos is full of pure rage against Oz with constant shouts of the “Big Pharma Shill” Gambit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what I found most amusing because it shows just how delusional these people are was that in that second video, numerous commenters insist that despite being shown very clearly as Dr. Oz gets vaccinated themselves, that he didn’t really get vaccinated. One person claimed it the vaccine was palmed even though we actually see the injection in close-up. I don’t think they actually know what palming is. If you don’t know, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zl3I5y4cZc"&gt;I suggest you watch a REAL demonstration of a magician palming something before an audience &amp;amp; camera&lt;/a&gt; (see 4 minutes into the video).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This just shows similar these kooks are to other denialist groups like the Obama Birthers. The Birthers kept asking to see Obama’s birth certificate. And then after it was shown to them and they saw it with their own eyes, they still denied it. And to this day, they continually insist on seeing the birth certificate, which they claim has never been shown, yet anyone who bothers to Google “Obama birth certificate” can now see it any time they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the anti-vaccinationists, I kept hearing them say they wanted to see the doctors themselves get them. In fact, there’s a common gambit they use all the time where they bring up a statistic that 1/3 of doctors don’t get themselves vaccinated. Of course this would mean that 2/3 do, but never let small details like that get in the way of a good nonsensical denialist argument. Now here we clearly see a doctor vaccinated on camera. . .AND IT’S STILL NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM! They just come up with a new excuse like, there was nothing in the vaccine or it didn’t really penetrate his skin, blah, blah, blah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why it doesn’t pay to try and rationally answer the arguments of crazy people. It won’t convince them. In fact, being proven wrong just manages to convince them of their delusion even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was a good try, Dr. Oz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;--Children everywhere, up until very recently&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Taking a look at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/saturn_when_one_ring_doesnt_ru.php"&gt;the new ring discovered around Saturn&lt;/a&gt; made me realize something.  Most of us don't realize how &lt;i&gt;full of crap&lt;/i&gt; our Solar System is.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't mean planets, or moons, or comets or asteroids, although there are certainly plenty to go around.  A brief recap of what happened around Saturn first.  Saturn has seven glorious, inner rings that we're familiar with, that make it a magnificent sight for skywatchers everywhere.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/all_the_junk_in_our_solar_syst/saturn_generic_600.jpg" width="500" title="Nice shot of Saturn, and those are some spectacular shadows on the rings." alt="saturn_generic_600.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look closely at this image, you will see a few white dots in the picture.  Know what those are?  Some of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Saturn"&gt;Saturn's Moons&lt;/a&gt;.  Titan is the biggest, followed by Rhea, and then Iapetus.  All told, Saturn has at least 61 Moons, but Iapetus is the most distant &lt;i&gt;large&lt;/i&gt; Moon, coming it at 40% the size of our own Moon.  All of Saturn's moons are made of highly reflective material, giving them what we call a high &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo"&gt;albedo&lt;/a&gt;.  But Iapetus has this weird coloration to it, as captured by Cassini:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/all_the_junk_in_our_solar_syst/iapetus-bright.jpg" width="500" title="You never hear about the *brown* side of the Moon!" alt="iapetus-bright.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, part of it has a similar albedo to the rest of Saturn's moons.  But the darker, brownish side of it has a much lower albedo.  Why?  Material knocked off of a darker moon even &lt;i&gt;farther&lt;/i&gt; out, Phoebe, gets into Iapetus' orbital path, and lands on one side of Iapetus only, turning it a dark, dirt-like color.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does Phoebe look like?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/all_the_junk_in_our_solar_syst/phoebe_cassini.jpg" width="500" title="Not as pretty as the name would lead you to believe, is it?" alt="phoebe_cassini.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it not only doesn't look like Iapetus, it doesn't look like &lt;b&gt;most&lt;/b&gt; moons.  In particular, it looks like an asteroid.  Compare with this asteroid below.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/all_the_junk_in_our_solar_syst/asteroid_ida.jpg" width="500" title="This one&amp;#39;s named Ida.  Hi, Ida!" alt="asteroid_ida.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, someone pointed out to me that Phoebe is probably a captured asteroid.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It isn't.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phoebe has the wrong density, albedo, and composition to be an asteroid.  It's a captured piece of junk.  You know about asteroids, which live between Mars and Jupiter.  You also know about Kuiper Belt objects, which live out past Neptune's orbit.  But have you ever heard of Centaurs?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/all_the_junk_in_our_solar_syst/centaur2.jpg" width="500" title="While horses wish they had hands, I wish I had four legs and could run 40 miles an hour!" alt="centaur2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that kind!  Centaurs were half-man/half-horse creatures.  In the Solar System, we have some half-asteroid/half-comet objects that we call &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(minor_planet)"&gt;Centaurs&lt;/a&gt;.  These probably originated out past Neptune, but now orbit in between Jupiter and Neptune.  (In orange, below.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/all_the_junk_in_our_solar_syst/611px-Outersolarsystem_objectpositions_labels_comp.png" width="500" title="Not asteroids or comets, but in-between!" alt="611px-Outersolarsystem_objectpositions_labels_comp.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have orbits more like asteroids, but material compositions similar to comets.  In fact, if we let Phoebe get close to the Sun, it would develop a cometary tail!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this interesting?  Remember the IAU's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_planet"&gt;definition of a planet&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A "planet" is a celestial body that:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;is in orbit around the Sun,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Apparently, "clearing your orbit" doesn't mean the same thing as "clearing the table".  You don't have to reach a state of "all-clear" to count yourself successful.  In fact, there are &lt;b&gt;plenty&lt;/b&gt; of them still left.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/all_the_junk_in_our_solar_syst/500px-TheKuiperBelt_42AU_Centaurs.svg.png" width="500" height="375" title="A map of known centaurs, not counting captured ones!" alt="500px-TheKuiperBelt_42AU_Centaurs.svg.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These "centaurs" are not stable, as within a few million years they'll all be either kicked out of orbit, thrown to the inner or outer solar system, or captured by one of the gas giants.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they'll be replaced by new centaurs coming in from beyond Neptune.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know what?  This isn't the only junk out there.  If we look around Jupiter, we find &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; classes of "asteroid" that are &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; Jupiter's orbit: Greeks and Trojans.  (Never mind the brown "Hildas"!)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/all_the_junk_in_our_solar_syst/InnerSolarSystem-en.png" width="500" title="Boy, someone really did a number spelling Helen&amp;#39;s name wrong!" alt="InnerSolarSystem-en.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "Greeks" orbit 60 degrees ahead of a planet in its orbit, while the "Trojans" orbit 60 degrees behind it.  These are also only temporary, but they sure to add up!  Jupiter -- right now -- has thousands!  The other gas giants have many, as well.  But even the inner solar system gets in on the action; our own dear &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/meet_our_second_moon.php"&gt;Earth has one!&lt;/a&gt;  (It's named Cruithne; have a look below!)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/all_the_junk_in_our_solar_syst/Cruithne.jpg" width="500" height="360" title="Is this little guy our second moon?  It&amp;#39;s the closest thing we&amp;#39;ve got to one..." alt="Cruithne.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there are asteroids and comets, but also a bunch of them that have migrated into other planets' orbits.  Some of them become moons (right, Mars?), others accrue Greek and Trojan asteroids (indeed, Jupiter?), and others either get kicked out or melt away.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007345" title=""&gt;The Perfect Family: Decision Making in Biparental Care&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Previous theoretical work on parental decisions in biparental care has emphasized the role of the conflict between evolutionary interests of parents in these decisions. A prominent prediction from this work is that parents should compensate for decreases in each other's effort, but only partially so. However, experimental tests that manipulate parents and measure their responses fail to confirm this prediction. At the same time, the process of parental decision making has remained unexplored theoretically. We develop a model to address the discrepancy between experiments and the theoretical prediction, and explore how assuming different decision making processes changes the prediction from the theory. We assume that parents make decisions in behavioral time. They have a fixed time budget, and allocate it between two parental tasks: provisioning the offspring and defending the nest. The proximate determinant of the allocation decisions are parents' behavioral objectives. We assume both parents aim to maximize the offspring production from the nest. Experimental manipulations change the shape of the nest production function. We consider two different scenarios for how parents make decisions: one where parents communicate with each other and act together (the perfect family), and one where they do not communicate, and act independently (the almost perfect family). The perfect family model is able to generate all the types of responses seen in experimental studies. The kind of response predicted depends on the nest production function, i.e. how parents' allocations affect offspring production, and the type of experimental manipulation. In particular, we find that complementarity of parents' allocations promotes matching responses. In contrast, the relative responses do not depend on the type of manipulation in the almost perfect family model. These results highlight the importance of the interaction between nest production function and how parents make decisions, factors that have largely been overlooked in previous models.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007324" title=""&gt;Bayesian Estimation of Animal Movement from Archival and Satellite Tags&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reliable estimation of animal location, and its associated error is fundamental to animal ecology. There are many existing techniques for handling location error, but these are often ad hoc or are used in isolation from each other. In this study we present a Bayesian framework for determining location that uses all the data available, is flexible to all tagging techniques, and provides location estimates with built-in measures of uncertainty. Bayesian methods allow the contributions of multiple data sources to be decomposed into manageable components. We illustrate with two examples for two different location methods: satellite tracking and light level geo-location. We show that many of the problems with uncertainty involved are reduced and quantified by our approach. This approach can use any available information, such as existing knowledge of the animal's potential range, light levels or direct location estimates, auxiliary data, and movement models. The approach provides a substantial contribution to the handling uncertainty in archival tag and satellite tracking data using readily available tools.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000214" title=""&gt;Dynamic Coupling of Pattern Formation and Morphogenesis in the Developing Vertebrate Retina&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The vertebrate brain contains a point-to-point representation of sensory input from the eye. This visual map forms during embryonic development, by neuronal cells of the retina sending targeted axon projections to the brain. Since the projection needs to wire up neighboring cell positions in the retina to neighboring target areas in the brain, all retinal cells must harbor a defined spatial coordinate as prerequisite for map formation. How such a retinal coordinate system is established and maintained in the dynamically evolving embryo is a fundamental, but unresolved, question. By combining genetic analysis and in vivo imaging in zebrafish embryos, we have tracked the developmental origin of cell coordinates in the retina. We find that three related Fgf signals emanating from outside the eye define relative cell positions in the retina very early, already at the onset of its formation. But the absolute position of retinal cells relative to the body axes is greatly rearranged during subsequent development. In this phase, surprisingly, the same Fgf signals that at first defined retinal cell positions now balance asymmetric cell movements and cell shape changes, which are required for harmonic retinal growth and the final alignment of cell coordinates in the eye.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000161" title=""&gt;The Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium: Using Spontaneously Occurring Cancers in Dogs to Inform the Cancer Drug Development Pathway&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite evidence of drug efficacy in mouse models of cancer, many novel anti-cancer agents fail in human cancer patients because of unacceptable toxicity or poor efficacy [1]. Naturally occurring tumors in dogs and other animals have clinical and biological similarities to human cancers that are difficult to replicate in other model systems. A recently launched cooperative effort, the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium (COTC; http://ccr.cancer.gov/resources/cop/COTC​.asp ), now provides infrastructure and resources needed to integrate these naturally occurring cancer models into the development of new human cancer drugs, devices, and imaging techniques.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_61.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/feLhvmCAvmY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255394458699"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/donors_choose_im_in_awe.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9af3bd12b004dcf2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Donors Choose"/><title type="html">Donors Choose: I'm in awe</title><published>2009-10-13T00:22:57Z</published><updated>2009-10-13T00:22:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/1IGBO8dyrVs/donors_choose_im_in_awe.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/donors_choose_im_in_awe.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You guys (and my next blogging check) have managed to fully fund several programs  already (six by my count), and we're not even at the half-way mark in the drive (well, we're almost there).

&lt;p&gt;What do they have in common?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They &lt;a href="http://secularright.org/wordpress/?p=2917"&gt;don’t accept evolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Razib Khan&lt;/strong&gt; writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… it looks like 3 of the front-runners for the G.O.P. nomination are rather frank Creationists… I’m skeptical about any of these as likely candidates (i.e., if you had to make a bet you’re going to be surprised), but if you keep adding individuals to the list it seems likely that we’re looking at a serious probability that the G.O.P. nominee in 2012 will be a Creationist.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Khan didn’t mention him, but &lt;strong&gt;Bobby Jindal&lt;/strong&gt; is an &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/12/11/intelligent-design-supporter-bobby-jindal-is-not-running-for-president-in-2012/"&gt;evolution-denier as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this such a big deal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any candidate who doesn’t accept evolution is a candidate who doesn’t understand or support &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; science.  In the world we live in, it’s vital that we have proper funding and incentives for scientific research and none of these Republicans have enough respect for the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, good reporters will get them to admit as much in interviews.  We have to be vigilant, too, calling them out on their ridiculous beliefs and spreading the word about their removal from reality.&lt;/p&gt;

Space debris of the man-made variety has been around ever since the first rocket launches in the late 1950s, but it was not until the end of the Cold War that the major space-faring nations began to see the growing number of leftover objects still in orbit from previous space missions as a concern.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And published order papers are in turn not difficult to search.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About the very same time I hit on the likely PQ, another blogger and skeptic hit on it independently, and he twittered it. Then it started going viral.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon it was clear that a very famous political blogger had also hit on the PQ and was publishing it in full.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is not for this Blog to publish direct links to these possible disclosures. The court has ordered an injunction, and so there will be nothing on this Blog which will circumvent that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, one does wonder whether &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; knew that this is what would happen...&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-4371225825236150990?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255389976044"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/dogs_can_be_good_without_god.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e33932e3a33a81dc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Ethics"/><title type="html">Dogs can be good without god</title><published>2009-10-12T22:47:06Z</published><updated>2009-10-12T22:47:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/UNMP9eeYc0s/dogs_can_be_good_without_god.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/dogs_can_be_good_without_god.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This clip is from a traffic camera in Chile — it shows a dog hit by a car, and then another dog risking the heavy traffic to pull the injured animal to the side, out of danger.&lt;/p&gt;

I am so very pleased to bring you another edition of &lt;em&gt;Get To Know Your &lt;img src="http://img379.imageshack.us/img379/8905/carrie4small.jpg" alt="Carrie" width="213" height="320"&gt;Skepchick&lt;/em&gt;. This installment features the oh-so-lovely and super-intelligent, carr2d2 (aka Carrie). Hooray! I took some glamour photos of Carrie on the swanky streets of Atlanta and asked her some questions to hopefully help you get to know her just a little bit better. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What experience first got you interested in skepticism?&lt;/strong&gt; I’m naturally curious, and I &lt;img src="http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/5695/carrie6small.jpg" alt="Carrie" width="213" height="320"&gt;have issues when it comes to understanding what people are saying to me (I think I have some sort of auditory processing thing), so I’ve always needed to figure things out for myself.  I became aware of this whole “movement” thing listening to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_Radio"&gt;Penn Jillette’s radio show&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest, as they say, is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. If you could wipe out one pseudoscience all together, which one would it be?&lt;/strong&gt; Faith healing.  Like, Benny Hinn style. It pisses me off for so many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. What one skeptical topic do you wish there was legitimate evidence for?&lt;/strong&gt; I always &lt;img src="http://img203.imageshack.us/img203/151/carrie3small.jpg" alt="Carrie" width="320" height="213"&gt;thought astral projection sounded really cool.  I kinda wish that was real.  I’d totally leave my body and go fly around the world.  It would be much cheaper than the way I do it now, what with all the airplanes and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What is the best pipe to lay?&lt;/strong&gt; Nice try at a dirty question, but I don’t actually lay pipe :p  I insulate it.  Which I suppose could be turned dirty in some of your minds.  Best pipe to insulate?  Tough to say; it all depends on where it is and how much shit is in the way.  Personally, I like nuclear plant work &lt;img src="http://img339.imageshack.us/img339/4562/carrie7small.jpg" alt="Carrie" width="213" height="320"&gt;the best.  It’s mostly clean (well, as clean as this trade gets), the work requires brain power, and you get to do and see some really cool stuff in the process (example: nuclear fuel is awesome looking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. On Skepchick island who would you recommend for the live entertainment?&lt;/strong&gt; Hmmm…let’s see…I’d say we need &lt;a href="http://www.geologicpodcast.com/"&gt;Hrab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Minchin"&gt;Minchin&lt;/a&gt; to play music, and &lt;a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/"&gt;Neil Gaiman&lt;/a&gt; to read us bedtime stories, and he could bring Amanda along as well to amuse and amaze us with her random acts of performance art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. What book would you recommend for someone just beginning to become interested in science and or skepticism? &lt;/strong&gt; Tough one.  Probably &lt;a href="http://www.quirkology.com/UK/index.shtml"&gt;Quirkology by Richard Wiseman&lt;/a&gt;.  It is fun and engaging, and shows how science can be applied to almost anything you can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Everyone is looking at these beautiful photos of you, staring at your boobs and totally not paying attention to this interview at all. Quick! Say something to grab their attention!&lt;/strong&gt; Holy shit it’s &lt;img src="http://img62.imageshack.us/img62/7442/carrie2small.jpg" alt="Carrie" width="213" height="320"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tennant"&gt;David Tennant&lt;/a&gt;!  Sorry, what were you asking me again?  Ok, resume boob-staring :p&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. The phone rings. It’s your friend who says she has cancer and she just heard Bill Maher say she should go to Mexico for an alternative treatment. What do you tell her?&lt;/strong&gt; I’d ask her to tell me more about this treatment and why she feels she cannot trust conventional medicine.  I’d try to be tactful and understanding while making a case for medical cancer treatment (as scary as it might sound) by talking about the huge increases in survival rates over the years as our technology has advanced, as well as some anecdotes from my friends and family who have beaten cancer.  Then I’d tell her I love her and want her alive and healthy for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. It’s the night before Dragon*Con. You can dress up any one skeptic as any character you like. Who is it and what are they dressed as?&lt;/strong&gt; Wow.  How did you know I think about things like this?  I have to pick just one?  Well, in that case, &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/about-james-randi.html"&gt;Randi&lt;/a&gt; as Yoda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Your iPod malfunctions and you can only subscribe to one podcast, forever. What podcast do &lt;img src="http://img185.imageshack.us/img185/492/carrie1small.jpg" alt="Carrie" width="213" height="320"&gt;you choose?&lt;/strong&gt; At the moment, I have a backlog of 129 podcasts because I haven’t been able to listen at work.  The only one I’m actually caught up on is &lt;a href="http://sundayssupplement.blogspot.com/"&gt;Sundays Supplement&lt;/a&gt;, because I always listen to that one as soon as it comes out.  What can I say?  Iszi and Simon crack me up.  So I guess I’d go with that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, this wasn’t a test, was it?  Oh, well…the boss lady is out of town and off internet island for awhile, so she won’t know I didn’t pick &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/"&gt;SGU&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. What advice would you give to a person who wants to meet more like-minded skeptics? &lt;img src="http://img185.imageshack.us/img185/9761/carrie5small.jpg" alt="Carrie" width="320" height="213"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The first thing I’d suggest is to talk about science and skepticism in your daily life, if you don’t already.  You might already know people who share your views.  Get involved online, and you will likely meet people from your area that you might want to hang out with.  Go to local skeptical events, like Drinking Skeptickally (or Skepchickally), attend museum events and book readings.  Put yourself out there, and most importantly, have fun.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Thank you so much Carrie! I had a great time spending time with you and chasing you around with a camera!

It's well-written, compelling, and betrays an exceptional intelligence.  It's also completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The piece is called, "Bias, Racism, and Alternative Medicine", an intriguing title.  The first part tries to establish that "Western medicine" in one of many ways of understanding health and disease.  She starts with some personal anecdotes---always interesting, rarely generalizable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;While receiving Western biomedical treatment for ADD, the side effects of my therapy convinced me that western medication alone would not provide a solution to my problems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the author's fundamental misunderstandings is that the failure of a particular treatment to make her feel better does not invalidate all of medical science, and more important, it does not validate "other ways of thinking".  Still, I can understand how this happens.  Personal experience is powerful; unfortunately, it is also misleading. I like this writer.  She seems very kind.  She goes on to describe her enlightenment further, but this is where a pleasant anecdote goes terribly wrong:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/i_am_culturally_insensitive.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/i_am_culturally_insensitive.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/yrP7mTe1G4k" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255385717069"><id gr:original-id="http://neuronarrative.wordpress.com/2009/10/12/when-the-powerful-feel-incompetent-the-rest-of-us-feel-their-wrath/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c5c53826e68fdbb6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">When the Powerful Feel Incompetent, the Rest of Us Feel Their Wrath</title><published>2009-10-12T17:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-12T17:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/SpIm9hFvyFU/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://neuronarrative.wordpress.com/2009/10/12/when-the-powerful-feel-incompetent-the-rest-of-us-feel-their-wrath/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">You’re sitting at your desk when the phone rings. It’s your boss and he wants to see you in his office.  You’re not sure why – nothing in particular comes to mind that would put you in his crosshairs. In fact, you’ve actually been doing a great job lately. Even your boss’s boss mentioned that you were doing outstanding work in a staff meeting the other day, right in front of everyone, including your boss. What could possibly be the problem?

You walk into his office, sit down, and are immediately awash in the most inappropriate display of yelling you’ve ever seen in the workplace. It’s hard to follow all of the criticisms he’s throwing at you, but you make out “incompetent,” “unresponsive” and “careless” amidst a caravan of expletives. The source of the criticism, you finally realize, is a small error you made in a report—something likely no one else even noticed. How could that bring on all of this?

Or…is that really the source of this reaction? Then you remember the look on your boss’s face when his boss sung your praises in the staff meeting. Suddenly this makes sense—he was threatened, and now he’s found one thing to aggressively nail you on.

As such, I was rather surprised when I stopped by the bookstore and realized &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unseen-Academicals-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0061161705/"&gt;Unseen Academicals&lt;/a&gt; had been released and I'd missed it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general, I wasn't terribly enthusiastic about this one. If you're familiar with Pratchett's works, you'll know that many of his stories recycle characters and tend to fit into sub series within Discworld; There's several books that feature the Watch, the Witches, Death's "family" and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UA fit in the Wizards series. I rather like the Wizards. They're the main focus in the &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2007/03/book-review-science-of-discworld-iii.html"&gt;Science of Discworld&lt;/a&gt; series. And Rincewind is in their lot. I like him too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the premise for this one seemed... off. The Unseen University faculty was supposed to reform football (soccer to us Americans). Ankh-Morpork's resident Tyrant, Ventari, has had several characters reform various bits of the city in past books (deWorde fixed the newspapers in The Truth mocking Hurst, and Moist von Lipwig fixed the postal and banking system in Going Postal and Making Money respectively). Sadly, this "Ventari says go fix this" plot is getting rather worn I think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, requiring the Wizards to refrain from using magic to recreate football took away, well.... their magic. Perhaps I just don't care enough about sports to get it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, the other plot that got tied in was that of Mr. Nutt, a goblin hiding a supposedly terrible secret. I won't say what it is, but the secret fell rather flat and seemed to be poorly delivered. Regardless, Nutt was a very likable character and I hope he shows up in future books.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was another subplot of "Jools" becoming a Dwarven fashion model, but it seemed so scarcely touched, I think it would have been better to leave out all together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wouldn't say it was his worst book, but certainly not one of the better ones. If you're not a serious Pratchett fan and don't get soccer/football, you may just want to skip this one.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-5266031737039574445?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255385117367"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/congratulations_pascale.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6a5c7926d20f9ad0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="DonorsChoose"/><title type="html">Congratulations Pascale!!!</title><published>2009-10-12T22:30:24Z</published><updated>2009-10-12T22:30:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/tp1XHSHmCcs/congratulations_pascale.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/congratulations_pascale.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Frequent commenter &lt;a href="http://pascalesthoughts.blogspot.com/"&gt;Pascale&lt;/a&gt; was the winner of ScienceBlog's first prize drawing for DonorsChoose donors.

And now our house is full of groggy young queen wasps. It seems that the last thing a wasp nest does before shutting down for good is discharge a bunch of queens who will hibernate and then start new nests come spring. But these queens are racing into a trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nest has two main exits. One out into the chilly open air. The other into the comfy warmth of the Rundkvist household. And we haven't been able to locate and stop up the latter opening. So when one of these young ladies is set to leave the nest -- which exit do you think she prefers? The parallel that comes to me unbidden is that of a condom: the wasp nest is ejaculating its little emissaries, and my house is one big latex contraceptive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though unusually large, they're quite pitiful creatures, unaggressive, already sleepy, looking for a decent hiding place to crash out in. I grab them from the south-facing windows with a piece of kitchen roll and end their suffering with little crispy noises.&lt;/p&gt;

Mind you, it’s only a &lt;em&gt;biological&lt;/em&gt; science advisor; Mr. D never talked to an astronomer before constructing the Universe. But the advisor looks like someone I know.

But could it be the result of human evolution?

One of the most fascinating areas of research in evolutionary studies is the question of reproductive senescence. Why do women go through menopause? Chimpanzees and bonobos, our closest evolutionary relatives who we share 99% of our DNA with, are reproductive throughout their lifespans but human women can spend the last third of their lives infertile. Why?

Biologist Virpi Lummaa, whose recent work on evolutionary theory and birth control I wrote about earlier, has conducted numerous highly regarded studies verifying the role of natural selection in human populations.  According to her research, menopause may in fact have helped our ancestors survive.  However, the reasons for this may be a surprise.

After a run of birdies, for examples, golfers sometimes say that the cup appeared to be the size of a bucket, and baseball players who have a hit a few home runs say that the ball is the size of a grapefruit. Conversely, targets are often reported to be smaller than they actually are by athletes who are performing badly.

Research carried out in the past 5 years suggests that these are more than just anecdotes, and that performance in sports can actually affect perception. A new study by psychologists at Purdue University now lends more weight to this, by providing evidence that success rate in American football field goals affects how the size of the goal posts is perceived.

Well, autism tax breaks should exist, that’s all I can say. But here’s something he could use, would probably like, and I’m sure does exist. A dance video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex has been jumping up and down, somewhat jerkily, when Elmo has dance numbers. I noticed this a few weeks ago on “Elmo’s Wild Wild West” when Mr. Noodle and his brother and sister are line-dancing. Alex has attempted his version — took me awhile to figure out he was dancing along. I noticed today that Alex has been rewinding to the dance parts of all his Elmo videos, and this evening he did something he’s never done before. He asked me to dance. So we danced together. We did the Chicken Dance, and Alex definitely got the shaking and the clapping parts, which is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not “American Idol” fans, but I’m thinking we should start watching “So You Think You Can Dance.” If Alex liked it, we could watch TV as a family, which I admit is not a lifelong dream of mine but would nevertheless be one of those nice things that seems to elude us. I wanted us to be able to eat in coffee shops and Chinese restaurants together and we can. I wanted us to be able to attend live performances, and we can do that too (as long as it’s the circus). So I think that my mini goal of watching a half-hour TV show together is not outside Alex’s scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;color:#000000;font-size:x-small"&gt;&lt;span style="font:normal normal normal medium/normal &amp;#39;Times New Roman&amp;#39;;font-size:13px;font-family:Georgia,&amp;#39;Times New Roman&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Bitstream Charter&amp;#39;,Times,serif"&gt;•       •      • &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest abomination is&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathy-freston/a-solution-for-diabetes-a_b_312219.html"&gt; an article on diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, by Kathy Freston.  Bad information on diabetes is particularly dangerous.  The longer diabetes goes untreated, the higher the likelihood of complications.  When reading medical writing it’s important to evaluate the source.  The author of this article wrote a book called, &lt;em&gt;The Quantum Wellness Cleanse&lt;/em&gt; which pretty much says it all.  But is it really fair to judge someone on a crappy book title?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes, but more important is the crappy interview she conducts with Dr. Neal Barnard.  I have no way of knowing with absolute certainty whether Barnard is as dangerous a fool as he sounds, but I suspect so.  He and Freston promulgate a dangerously over-simplified view of diabetes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To review briefly, type II diabetes is common and deadly.  It &lt;a href="http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/DM/PUBS/statistics/#allages"&gt;affects around 20 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; and if poorly treated leads to stroke, kidney failure, heart attacks, amputations, and death.  There is some evidence that in societies where people are poorly nourished or subsisting on minimal calories, diabetes is less common.   The disease is highly heritable, and is not evenly distributed among ethnicities, with African Americans, Hispanics,  many Native Americans, and probably South Asians being more affected than whites.  The disease usually starts as resistance to insulin.  Pancreatic beta cells bravely try to keep up, but eventually crap out.  With early dietary intervention, diabetes can often (but not always) be controlled. Whether someone with diet-controlled diabetes is still a diabetic is not settled.  There is more to diabetes than high blood sugar.  We know that controlling blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure in diabetics prevents devastating complications.  If a diabetic loses 20 lbs and has normal sugars, we know we’ve reduced their risk, but evidence seems to support the idea that they are still “diabetic”, at least from the perspective of risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/mvnfwche17mchgdc/"&gt;Some diets may be more or less “diabetogenic”&lt;/a&gt;, but  in general, a combination of genes, increase caloric intake, and abdominal adiposity are the big baddies.  Early in the course of developing diabetes, before the beta cells give up, it is usually possible to reduce insulin resistance by losing weight.  There is no good evidence that one particular approach to eating can “cure” diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting back to HuffPo, Dr. Barnard makes the reasonable statement that our society’s increased caloric intake contributes to soaring diabetes rates, and talks about the complications of diabetes. He then goes on to fall for one of the most common types of pseudo-scientific thought—oversimplification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me emphasize that this grim scenario does not have to occur. If an unhealthy diet is the cause, a better diet can provide the answer to this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes, in many if not most type II diabetics, dietary changes and exercise can dramatically change the course of the disease—at least early on when the beta cells still work.  But diet alone is not always sufficient to control diabetes, and it’s dangerous to imply that it is.  From the rest of the interview, it’s apparent to me that Dr. Barnard either went to a different kind of medical school than I, or didn’t pay attention:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So long as your body’s insulin can escort glucose into the cells normally, diabetes will not occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a lovely fantasy, but not consistent with reality.  He goes on to claim that fat intake is the cause of insulin resistance and that a vegan diet can prevent and reverse diabetes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we can go beyond prevention. When people who already have diabetes adopt a low-fat vegan diet, their condition often improves dramatically. In our research, funded by the U.S. Government, we found that a vegan diet is more effective than a traditional current diabetes diet, and is much safer than a low-carb diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/29/8/1777.long"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; to which he is presumably referring is interesting, but hardly groundbreaking.  It compared a standard American Diabetes Association balanced diet with a vegan diet.  Both groups did quite well, with the vegan group doing better by some measures.  The study was randomized, but obviously not blinded, and patients developed their own diets with the help of dietitians.  The diets were apparently not equally caloric and there was a large range of intake in both groups.  Diabetic control measured by glycolated hemoglobin levels was not terribly impressive (p=0.091).  By their own analysis, weight loss was more important than type of diet in determining improvement of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While interesting, this is not a study on which to hang an entire medical philosophy.  What troubles me about this article is that it creates/perpetuates a myth that diabetes (meaning type II diabetes) is always preventable and reversible with a particular diet.  While I’m very happy to have my patients change their diets for the better, to tell them that a particular diet is some sort of panacea is just untrue.  It is wrong.  It is a lie.   Diabetes is a serious disease, and anything that delays its proper treatment causes disability and death.  Dietary changes are an important component in a comprehensive diabetic treatment plan, but the evidence is insufficient to recommend one diet over another.&lt;/p&gt;

The link was over 99% (not kidding) content that was illegally obtained multimedia sources. I opted not to take a look at his “evidence” supporting his “theories” because it was pretty obvious that it was not scientific, a theory, or anything insightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone tells me “I have a scientific theory about that!” and “I stole my research off the internet and looking at it is completely illegal.” What they are saying to me is: Hi. I’m kind of crazy… and not crazy in the colloquial sense, I’m totally diagnosable and I don’t like how my meds make me feel so I don’t take them and I hope that cat I just beheaded wasn’t yours and if it was, sorry but he was transmitting my thoughts to the Russians via satellite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s kind of the same way that websites which include yellow and red highlighted text are 100% scams, woo, and conspiracy guys… just like anything with an outer-space-themed hurts-your-eyes background and/or blinking text and/or animated clip art. No one legit uses anything like that… in fact, it’s become so cliche that I’m actually starting to believe that all web-designers are skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your favorite “this is woo” red flag? What makes you say, “I don’t have to listen/read any further ____ tells me all I need to know”?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the &lt;a href="http://gregladen.com/wordpress/?p=1365"&gt;Bell Museum Slapdown panel&lt;/a&gt; last week, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/09/victory.php"&gt;Myers&lt;/a&gt; brought up differences between countries in public attitudes towards education.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2007/09/a_consensus_on_framing.php"&gt;Mooney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/framing-science/"&gt;Nisbet&lt;/a&gt; brought up the difficulty of making fundamental changes via “Popular Science” approaches, which I take to include public, popular culture as well as standard education (which is, after all, the main mechanism for cultural transmission of scientific viewpoints).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did not develop the potential for the comparative argument as much as we could have  during that discussion.  As Nisbet suggested:  We should be scientific about our understanding of how we present science.  I agree.  The comparative approach is a very useful one in science.  We can ask questions like, how can other predominantly christian countries (like Italy, France, Britain and Spain) have such a better attitude (publicly and culturally) towards science (especially evolution) compared to the US?  What’s the difference?  Let’s get us some of that difference!&lt;/p&gt;

I talk to Dennis Bray of the University of Cambridge about cells as microscopic computers. I first came across Bray’s work while working on my book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMicrocosm-coli-New-Science-Life%2Fdp%2F037542430X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1190687076%26sr%3D8-1&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microcosm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I was looking for new work on how &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; manages to figure out where to go when it doesn’t have a brain or even a single neuron. Before long, I came across Bray’s remarkable work on the sophisticated information-processing that goes on inside the bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this week’s podcast I sound like I’m broadcasting out of a tin can (I’m getting that hammered out), but don’t let my distractions get in the way of listening to Bray.

Since then, a lot of spacecraft have wended their way through the solar system and beyond. Trying to visualize all those trips can be mind-bending, so what better way to do so then to make a mind-bending graphic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good folks at National Geographic have done just that. Check this out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="http://books.nationalgeographic.com/map/map-day/index"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/10/50years_web.jpg" alt="50years_web" title="50years_web" width="610" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clever image displays all the space missions to various bodies. If an object (like the Moon) has a thicker spiral wound around it, then that means it’s been visited more times. Here’s some detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2448/4004406823_3e3e55eb92_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows a stylized view of the 73 missions that went to the Moon in the past 5 decades, and has some info on each. The original map is zoomable and pannable, so you can spend some time fooling around there. Take a look at the bottom, too, and you’ll find a scaled view of the solar system with spacecraft positions. Look how far away Voyager 1 is! &lt;a href="http://www.stevey.com/2009/01/21/50-years-of-space-exploration/"&gt;There’s also a static version of the image online&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m not sure how legal that copy is. The original artwork is by Sean McNaughton on the National Geographic staff and Samuel Velasco of 5W Infographics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And may I add, holy cow! 73 missions to the Moon! And more to come. We’re a cool species.&lt;/p&gt;

But if the mere expectation of improvement can produce improvement, then the expectation of unpleasant consequences, such as side effects, should make people feel worse. This is sometimes called the &amp;quot;nocebo&amp;quot; effect.Two recently published papers tried to measure it. They looked at people who took part in randomized controlled trials of various drugs, and who were given placebos. Because different drugs have different known side effects, if the nocebo effect is real, the side effects reported by the placebo group should depend on the drug they think they might be taking. As the authors of one of the papers put it:In a typical clinical trial, the subjects know they can receive either the active medication or the placebo and, accordingly, they are informed about the possible adverse events they may experience during the trial. ... Therefore, informing subjects about the possible adverse events they may experience, may have a significant impact on their expectations and experiences of negative effects.Accordingly, Rief et al compared the side effects reported in the placebo groups of a large number of antidepressant drug trials. At the same time a separate group of researchers, Amanzio et al, did the same thing for trials of migraine drugs, which is a nice coincidence.Both papers found that reported side effects do indeed depend on the drug being studied. In the antidepressant paper, people who believed they might be on tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) reported many more &amp;quot;side effects&amp;quot; than those in trials of SSRIs. These included dry mouth, drowsiness, constipation, and sexual problems. This makes sense, because TCAs do have worse side effects than SSRIs.Likewise, for the migraine trials, the placebo groups in trials of anticonvulsants reported more symptoms associated with those drugs, such as dizziness and sleepiness. Placebo groups in trials of NSAIDs (like aspirin) were more likely to report upset stomachs and so forth. Finally, in trials of triptans, which have very mild side effects, the placebo group reported few problems.It&amp;#39;s also interesting to compare the two papers. None of the migraine trial placebo patients reported experiencing sexual problems, while many of the antidepressant placebo patients did. Some antidepressants can cause sexual problems, while migraine drugs generally don&amp;#39;t.So, was the &amp;quot;nocebo effect&amp;quot; really making people feel worse? It could well have been, although there are other interpretations. People might just be more willing to report symptoms that they believe are drug side effects. Researchers might be more likely to write them down. And different kinds of people end up in trials of different drugs: some people might be more likely to report certain symptoms. Just as with placebos, we shouldn&amp;#39;t rush to ascribe incredible mind-over-matter powers to the &amp;quot;force of suggestion&amp;quot; when there are more prosaic explanations.Nevertheless, there&amp;#39;s an important lesson here. Anecdotal evidence about drug&amp;#39;s side effects shouldn&amp;#39;t be accepted at face value, any more than anecdotes about their benefits. Drugs do, of course, cause adverse effects. But some drugs have worse reputations than they deserve in this regard. In such cases, nocebo effects might account for some of the reported problems...Rief W, Nestoriuc Y, von Lilienfeld-Toal A, Dogan I, Schreiber F, Hofmann SG, Barsky AJ, &amp;amp; Avorn J (2009).

I &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;like&lt;/span&gt; teaching the iGeneration*.  I enjoy using YouTube clips in my lectures, putting together online discussions, and making use of blogs and online resources.  I like the fact that they all have laptops (but not if they're rude enough to play games during class). I appreciate that I can upload my lecture notes as PDF files and they will all be able to bring them to lectures.  I have a BlackBerry, an iPod, a netbook, a blog (obviously), a document scanner, and miscellaneous other gadgets.  I hate being offline as much as my students do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think it really depends on whether you feel that technology is a friend or a foe.  If you consider it all just a huge distraction and a competitor for their attention, you're likely to dislike current technological trends.  If, on the other hand, you embrace it, try to keep up with it (or better yet, stay ahead of your students), and use it to connect with the class, then it can be really very exciting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;_____________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* The only thing I don't like is the excessive use of the word "like" that is common among students... though it did inspire me to create a t-shirt:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.ca/signusup/6408361"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:327px;height:320px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/StNIAYDUxnI/AAAAAAAAAxM/sI6-kUMmlyg/s400/IkeLike.png" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-8988625233192083228?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/s4DDzTOd6Sc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255368778867"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=19465">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/10c39f275ca0a5f0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="swine flu"/><category term="unintended consequences"/><title type="html">Some Good Can Come From Swine Flu</title><published>2009-10-12T17:00:52Z</published><updated>2009-10-12T17:00:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/some-good-can-come-from-swine-flu/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">A very common ailment in Korean summers and falls is pinkeye (conjunctivitis), and the problem had been getting much worse in the past two years.

&lt;p&gt;Matthew has brought to my attention &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/4x5pm50v03628453/fulltext.pdf"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.springer.com/life+sci/journal/12052//"&gt;Evolution: Education and Outreach&lt;/a&gt; by Adam Goldstein that mentions the WEIT blog. It’s apparently addressed to a curiously naive audience, taking great care to explain what a “blog” is, and how the word “post” is both a noun and a verb, and that bloggers often provide “links”, and much more in that vein. It’s curious in another way, too, calling WEIT an anonymous blog, deducing that Jerry is the author only from subtle cues, and the fact that PZ Myers has referred to the blog’s author as Jerry (actually, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/why_evolution_is_true.php"&gt;Myers post&lt;/a&gt; he cites is about the book, and predates the start of the blog). Goldstein must have missed the &lt;a href="http://jerrycoyne.uchicago.edu/about.html"&gt;“About the Author”&lt;/a&gt; link up over there to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides characterizing what blogs are (and mis-characterizing them a bit, too: as the&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/05/21/darwinius-whats-at-issue/"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Darwinius&lt;/em&gt; case&lt;/a&gt; made clear, posting to the web does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; constitute scientific publication), he also classifies blogs as being “professional,” “amateur,” “apostolic,” or “imaginative.” WEIT is “amateur”, but that’s a good thing in his classification. Goldstein says about amateur blogs that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…blogs of this variety are superior to those of other varieties for the purpose of explaining evolutionary science… Those who create the blogs in this category are not amateur scientists; indeed, most are experienced research professionals. Nonetheless, they are not professional bloggers, and their blogs present them with an opportunity to take a lighter, less formal approach to the topics they know and love. For this reason, many posts to blogs in this category are highly informative expository essays on a range of topics in evolutionary science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned from the article about a bunch of evolution-oriented blogs I didn’t know about (including one by people I know!). PZ is classified as “apostolic”; I’m sure he’ll appreciate the religious terminology!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of more general interest is that the whole journal, which began publishing in 2008, is available free online, at least through the end of this year. &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/120878/"&gt;Go take a look&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Huge in scope, in detail, and in raw physical presence. That is I am going to insist on calling it SCIENCE, all in caps. Words couldn't do justice in describing just how massive this hardcover is, so here's a picture of me shortly before I was crushed under the weight of it and had to be rescued by my &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sciencepunk.com/2008/02/my-sweet-ant-farm/"&gt;pet ants&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="science_me.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/science_me.jpg" width="500" height="477"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Science follows in the tradition of publisher &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dorlingkindersley-uk.co.uk/"&gt;DK&lt;/a&gt;'s lavishly produced pictorial encyclopaedias, which include &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/History-Definitive-Visual-Civilization-Present/dp/1405318090/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1255358761&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;History&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dorlingkindersley-uk.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781405304719,00.html?strSrchSql=ocean/Ocean"&gt;Ocean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Illustrated-Encyclopedia-Universe-Dorling-Kindersley/dp/140533309X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1255358687&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Universe&lt;/a&gt;. It's 512 pages of delightful diagrams, wonderful art, and above all, cool science. This is the kind of book that, as a child, made me want to be a scientist. And still does. Even physics looks interesting:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/assets_c/2009/10/science_inner-20597.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/assets_c/2009/10/science_inner-thumb-500x354-20597.png" width="500" height="354" alt="science_inner.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SCIENCE is the kind of book that you can pick up and fall into, and I can easily see my young self becoming absorbed for hours inside its beautifully illustrated world. Adam Hart-Davis carries the reader from prehistory and the dawn of science, through the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, hurtling past the Industrial Revolution in a blur of steam and iron and then soaring into the space age, before plunging into the microscopic world of the Information Revolution. It's gratifying to see that (compared to the books of my youth), plenty of attention is paid to non-Western contributions to science, notably Arabic and Indian advances in mathematics, optics, and chemistry. It also includes a gorgeous reference section jam-packed with charts and tables of essential data, from an extensive list of Messier objects to the Beaufort wind scale, and a who's who of science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is, in short, deserving of the term 'definitive'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, on to the contest. Every day this week I'll give you the chance to win a copy of SCIENCE (RRP £30). The winner will be selected by an arbitrary and quite possibly entirely random process. But to be in with a chance, you have to answer the following question:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which book inspired your passion for science? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is it an encyclopaedia or a novel? Sci-fi or sci-fact? Tell me which one it was, and why, and you could win!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winner announced tomorrow.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="width:606px"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_tree_frog" rel="external "&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/09/26/Garrison.Hyla_versicolor_on_hickory_tree.jpg" alt="Garrison.Hyla_versicolor_on_hickory_tree.jpg" width="600" height="800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyla versicolor&lt;/em&gt;–gray tree frog.&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you can’t see the frog, just go below the fold. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="width:606px"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/10/10/frog_outline.jpg" alt="frog_outline.jpg" width="600" height="800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Your irascible judges generally do not discuss their decisions, but we frankly ruled out this remarkable example of camouflage because, well, there is no picture there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own pattern-recognition system is not so hot, and I simply could not find the frog until Mr. Garrison directed me to the photograph with the red outline. Once I identified the frog, however, I now see it immediately in the upper photograph. I have noticed the same phenomenon before, for example, in connection with photographs of the peppered moth – once I finally identify the moth, I see it immediately the next time I see the same photograph. People in the audience when I gave a talk on the peppered moth told me they experienced the same phenomenon. Still, I am fortunate that I do not have to rely on frogs’ legs for my sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Catholic priest in Poland was doing the Holy Communion ritual recently.  He accidentally dropped the cracker.  So he put it in holy water (to “cleanse” it).  The object turned red… and it turned out it’s not a cracker at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a piece of human heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of sudden, some Italians are proclaiming it’s a miracle!  Not just a miracle, either.  &lt;em&gt;They think it’s the heart of Jesus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umm… that’s not a miracle.  That’s murder!  Or something equally as freaky.  The &lt;a href="http://www.newpolandexpress.pl/npe_news_story-1271-miracle_claimed_after_wafer_%E2%80%98turns_into%E2%80%99_human_heart.php"&gt;church doesn’t seem to be exploring that option&lt;/a&gt;, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… The matter should be approached very carefully,” says priest Andrzej Debski. “So, for now let us talk of it as a paranormal phenomenon,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a matter requiring restraint. And most of all an explanation. But I ask everyone to pray that this phenomenon was truly a miracle,” says Father Stanislaw Gniedziejko, pastor of the parish of St. Anthony in Sokolka in northeast Poland where the incident occurred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church authorities are now investigating whether the phenomenon will indeed turn out to be a Eucharistic miracle like the one that happened in Lanciano in Italy in the 8th century when a holy wafer turned to flesh and wine turned into blood.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did anyone think to call the police…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the &lt;a href="http://www.racjonalista.pl"&gt;Polish Rationalist Association&lt;/a&gt; is on the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to reader &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://sekty.blog.pl"&gt;Wojtek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, they sent a letter to the “Prosecution Office” and, according to Polish law, “the prosecutor must now start an investigation or give a very good reason not to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What questions are they demanding the prosecution office answer?  What would they like to know?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;sl=pl&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;u=http://www.racjonalista.pl/kk.php/s,6832/q,Doniesienie.do.prokuratury.w.zwiazku.z.tzw.cudem.w.Sokolce&amp;amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;amp;usg=ALkJrhjE4ZugjYo49nzLz_rO5IptlK3nPg"&gt;the list in English&lt;/a&gt;.  The translation is very rough and I’m paraphrasing so please correct me if &lt;a href="http://www.racjonalista.pl/kk.php/s,6832/q,Doniesienie.do.prokuratury.w.zwiazku.z.tzw.cudem.w.Sokolce"&gt;anything is wrong&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)  Did the Prosecutor’s Office initiate an investigation to determine the origin of the debris?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)  Did the Public Prosecutor’s Office question all those in contact with these remains?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3)  Do we know the identity of the man whose remains were found?  (”It seems unlikely that these fragments belong to the myocardium of the Jewish prophet, crucified two thousand years ago, [so] it is possible that they belong[ed] to a living person until recently.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4)  If these are human remains, stolen from a medical facility, disease could be spread.  Ditto if these are animal remains, consumed by parishioners.  Has the wafer been analyzed for disease?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5)  We have found no information that anyone has investigated this activity.  We demand to know whether any of these institutions have committed a crime for not doing so.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They conclude their letter by writing (paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We live in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century and we understand the mechanisms governing the world.  We have not yet observed any mechanism whose origins could be attributed to supernatural beings. At the same time, we have long known that the Earth revolves around the sun, women do not become pregnant without the participation of male sperm, and the wafer is baked with rice flour.  Regardless of the myths of the religious authorities, we must build on the achievements of empirical science and prosecute the crimes listed in the criminal laws, regardless of religious affiliation for those involved.  We demand an immediate answer to the question, which we will also publish.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wojtek adds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The [skeptics&amp;#39;] letter got a lot of attention in our media.  The media’s spin was mostly, “A miracle has happened, so the rationalists don’t like it and they try to fight against it.” Nevertheless virtually all of Poland has heard our point of view. The Polish Rationalist Association has been really doing a great job lately (actually, they always have been, but they became very active and vocal recently).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good for them for being the voice of reason.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, everyone else needs to get the hell out of that creepy church.  And not just for the usual reasons.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh — two guys who would rather soul kiss Michael Moore than be identified as lefties — &lt;a href="http://mediamatters.org/print/research/200910070043"&gt;have both jumped on the antivax bandwagon&lt;/a&gt;. Beck is spouting long-debunked paranoid antivax rhetoric, and Limbaugh is, well, he’s just being Limbaugh. He’s long planted his flag in knee-jerk anti-government silliness, never admitting that maybe, just maybe, sometimes the government is &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know who this speaks worse for; the antivaxxers or the talk show bloviators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, though, we all lose. Because either way, this shows that nonsense doesn’t have political boundaries. Once you step off that narrow path that is reality, you’re surrounded by antireality in every direction. So it doesn’t matter if you face left &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; right; you’re still wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want arguments rebutting the offal flying from the above group, go to &lt;a href="http://antiantivax.flurf.net/"&gt;Antiantivax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=851"&gt;Joe Albietz’s swine flu FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=444"&gt;Steve Novella’s antivax FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hooray! I've been looking forward to visiting Ireland for some time, so it's going to be great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I discover that &lt;a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/1012/1224256437842.html"&gt;not all the Irish are sane&lt;/a&gt;. There are crowds listening to 'psychic' prophets and standing in churchyards to stare at the sun until their eyeballs are all wobbly and semi-toasted, and then declaring that the fact that they can't see straight is a miracle! From God! Hallelujah to a creator who would make a delicate energy sensor friable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was planning on giving a couple of serious talks, but now I&amp;#39;m cleverly thinking…if I just hand out ball-peen hammers to the audiences and tell them to bang themselves on the head until they see stars and angels and Jesus himself looking like Bono and singing lullabies, I&amp;#39;ll have a little more time to sneak out and get all touristy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except that the people who'd come to listen to me would probably be more critical than the ones who'd listen to a self-proclaimed 'clairvoyant' like Joe Coleman. Darn. Preaching reason and autonomy and rebellion from the dictates of mystical authority does have its downsides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/i_see_there_are_a_few_wacky_pe.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/kj3WD7IohLI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255362972287"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/i_get_spam.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/24f9c54bb0db66c6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">I get spam</title><published>2009-10-12T16:20:14Z</published><updated>2009-10-12T16:20:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/cBseXt5Vr1g/i_get_spam.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/i_get_spam.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Surely this was misaddressed! I am not the right person to contact about pseudo-scientific 'spiritual' evolutionary seminars.&lt;/p&gt;
	
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Evolutionary,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I am happy to invite you to two free teleseminars--one with spiritual teacher and founder of EnlightenNext Andrew Cohen, and another with EnlightenNext magazine executive editor, Carter Phipps. These calls offer not only valuable content but also a fully interactive experience on MaestroConference, a new technology platform that allows you to engage the speaker and other participants as if it's an in-person workshop, with breakout groups and more. Here are the details:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Awakening to the Evolutionary Impulse &lt;br&gt;
FREE Conference Call with Andrew Cohen &lt;br&gt;
Thursday, October 8, 2009; 5:00 pm (Pacific Time, US)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
How does higher spiritual and psychological development translate into the demonstrable evolution of our personal attitudes and cultural values? In this dynamic virtual seminar, Cohen will guide participants into a direct experience and understanding of the life-transforming power and perspective of Evolutionary Enlightenment. Always teaching within the context of an Integral framework, Cohen will help us to see in clear and simple terms how our experience of higher consciousness can lead not only to our own personal liberation but also to the evolution of our shared beliefs and cultural values. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Evolution Changes Everything: 
How the Discovery of Progress Is Transforming the Spiritual Path&lt;br&gt;
FREE Conference Call with Carter Phipps &lt;br&gt;
Thursday, October 15, 2009; 3:30 pm (Pacific Time, US)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Once upon a time, there was only the cycle of birth, life, and death. Then God created Darwin, whose theory of evolution transformed a static wheel of existence into a great arc of change, with bacteria, beast, biosphere and even human consciousness caught up in the currents of an evolutionary universe. This still radical revelation poses a fundamental challenge to some of our most cherished spiritual beliefs. In this teleseminar, Carter Phipps will upend traditional concepts of enlightenment and spiritual awakening, showing how the latest insights in science, philosophy, and spirituality are destined to transform our relationship to life, God, and…well, everything!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, no, that's &lt;i&gt;insane&lt;/i&gt;. Darwin is now a messianic prophet who changed the universe? Sorry, but he was just a guy with a smart idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, to two very dumb con artists like Andrew Cohen and Carter Phipps, that might seem god-like. After all, Darwin made it possible for them to bilk gullible people out of their money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/i_get_spam.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/cBseXt5Vr1g" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255361937169"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-2493181987903394440">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6a83aa99de341e47</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Intelligent Design Creationism</title><published>2009-10-12T14:39:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-12T14:47:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/10/intelligent-design-creationism.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/2493181987903394440/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=2493181987903394440" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Some people in the intelligent design community don&amp;#39;t like it when we refer to their beliefs as &amp;quot;Intelligent Design Creationism.&amp;quot; They claim they aren&amp;#39;t creationists when they talk about an intelligent designer who created spoke designed life.

Making these decisions on linguistic grounds is difficult enough, but political, cultural, and social considerations often intervene, to compound the difficulty. The latest &lt;em&gt;Ethnologue&lt;/em&gt; (16th ed., 2009) advertises itself as "an encyclopedic reference work cataloging all of the world's 6,909 known living languages", but the introduction lays out the &lt;a href="http://www.ethnologue.org/ethno_docs/introduction.asp#language_id"&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; in identifying and counting languages and acknowledges that the methods used in reaching this very exact number are not the only possible ones and that these methods involve judgment calls at several points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Same thing in counting ethnic groups. But sometimes an authority just stipulates a figure, as in this report on school textbooks in China ("The fragility of truth", &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;, October 10, p. 45):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authorities have said that 56 columns erected on Tiananmen Square for the celebrations [the recent 60th anniversary celebrations] will stay put. They represent China's officially recognized 56 "ethnic groups". It is a number that few Chinese schoolchildren would dare to challenge. Yet when the communists came to power there were found to be more than 400. Officials eventually settled on the much lower figure and suppressed further debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(That's 55 official minority nationalities, plus Han Chinese.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't see any official pronouncement on the number of languages in China. What the &lt;em&gt;Ethnologue&lt;/em&gt; says is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of individual languages listed for China is 293. Of those, 292 are living languages and 1 has no known speakers. (&lt;a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=cn"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language and ethnicity are related in complex ways, but 291 languages (discarding the 2 special cases) seems to me to be an awful lot for only 56 ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Zwicky Arnold</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255361351994"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/marys_monday_metazoan_feelin_p.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b3e6562c9541e50c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Organisms"/><title type="html">Mary&amp;#39;s Monday Metazoan: feelin’ peckish?</title><published>2009-10-12T14:49:38Z</published><updated>2009-10-12T14:49:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/pIOG-6f0Zko/marys_monday_metazoan_feelin_p.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/marys_monday_metazoan_feelin_p.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Removed at photographer's request&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/marys_monday_metazoan_feelin_p.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/pIOG-6f0Zko" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255360829387"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=19511">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b62284c28a08508</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Jon Stewart"/><title type="html">Jon Stewart, International Man of News</title><published>2009-10-12T14:30:29Z</published><updated>2009-10-12T14:30:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/jon-stewart-international-man-of-news/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Just landed in the U.K. for a quick bout of pre-release publicity for SuperFreakonomics.

It’s passed numerous tests in the Solar System, scored a Nobel-worthy victory with the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_1913%2B16"&gt;binary pulsar&lt;/a&gt;, and gets the right answer even when extrapolated back to the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2005/12/19/the-universe-is-the-poor-mans-particle-accelerator/"&gt;first one second&lt;/a&gt; after the Big Bang.  But no scientific theory is sacred.  Even though GR is both aesthetically compelling and an unquestioned empirical success, it’s our job as scientists to keep probing it in different ways.  Especially when it comes to astrophysics, where we need &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2006/08/21/dark-matter-exists/"&gt;dark matter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/12/16/dark-energy-no-longer-a-surprise/"&gt;dark energy&lt;/a&gt; to explain what we see, it makes sense to put Einstein to the most stringent tests we can devise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3853"&gt;a new such test&lt;/a&gt;, courtesy of &lt;a href="http://www.astro.cornell.edu/~rbean/"&gt;Rachel Bean&lt;/a&gt; of Cornell.  She combines a suite of cosmological data, especially measurements of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_gravitational_lensing"&gt;weak gravitational lensing&lt;/a&gt; from the Hubble Space Telescope, to see whether GR correctly describes the behavior of large-scale structure in the universe.  And the surprising thing is — it doesn’t.  At the 98% confidence level, Rachel finds that general relativity is inconsistent with the data.  I’m not sure why we haven’t been reading about this in the science media or even on other blogs — it’s certainly a newsworthy result.  Admittedly, the smart money is still that there is some tricky thing that hasn’t yet been noticed and Einstein will eventually come through the victor, but this is serious work by a respected cosmologist.  Either the result is wrong, and we should be working hard to find out why, or it’s right, and we’re on the cusp of a revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3853"&gt;A weak lensing detection of a deviation from General Relativity on cosmic scales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Authors: Rachel Bean&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    Abstract: We consider evidence for deviations from General Relativity (GR) in the growth of large scale structure, using two parameters, γ and η, to quantify the modification. We consider the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) in the WMAP Cosmic Microwave Background data, the cross-correlation between the ISW and galaxy distributions from 2MASS and SDSS surveys, and the weak lensing shear field from the Hubble Space Telescope’s COSMOS survey along with measurements of the cosmic expansion history. We find current data, driven by the COSMOS weak lensing measurements, disfavors GR on cosmic scales, preferring η &amp;lt; 1 at 1 &amp;lt; &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 2 at the 98% significance level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see if we can’t unpack the basic idea.  The real problem in testing GR in cosmology is that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; particular kind of spacetime curvature can be a solution to Einstein’s theory — all you need are the right sources of matter and energy.  So in order to do a real test, you need to have some confidence that you understand what is creating the gravitational field — in the Solar System it’s the Sun and planets, in the binary pulsar it’s two neutron stars, and in the early universe it’s radiation.  For large-scale structure things are a bit less clear — there’s ordinary matter, and dark matter, and of course dark energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, even though there are some things we don’t know about dark matter and dark energy, there are some things we think we do know.  One of those things is that they don’t create any “anisotropic stress” — basically, a force that pulls different sides of things in different directions.  Given that extremely reasonable assumption, GR makes a powerful prediction: there is a certain amount of curvature associated with &lt;em&gt;space&lt;/em&gt;, and a certain amount of curvature associated with &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;, and those two things should be equal.  (The space-space and time-time potentials φ and ψ of Newtonian gauge, for you experts.)  The curvature of space tells you how meter sticks are distorted relative to each other as they move from place to place, while the curvature of time tells you how clocks at different locations seem to run at different rates.  The prediction that they are equal is testable:  you can try to measure both forms of curvature and divide one by the other.  The parameter η in the abstract is the ratio of the space curvature to the time curvature; if GR is right, the answer should be one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a straightforward way, in principle, to measure these two types of curvature.  A slowly-moving object (like a planet moving around the Sun) is influenced by the curvature of time, but not by the curvature of space.  (That sounds backwards, but keep in mind that “slowly-moving” is equivalent to “moves more through time than through space,” so the curvature of time is more important.)  But light, which moves as fast as you can, is pushed around equally by the two types of curvature.  So all you have to do is, for example, compare the gravitational field felt by slowly-moving objects to that felt by a passing light ray.  GR predicts that they should, in a well-defined sense, be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve done this in the Solar System, of course, and everything is fine.  But it’s always possible that some deviation from Einstein shows up at much larger distance and weaker gravitational fields than we have access to in our local neighborhood.  That’s basically what Rachel’s paper does, considering different measures of the statistical properties of large-scale structure and comparing them to the predictions of a phenomenological model of the gravitational field.  A crucial role is played by gravitational lensing, since that’s where the deflection of light comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is the answer: the likelihood, given the data, for different values of 1/η, the ratio of the time curvature to the space curvature.  The GR prediction is at 1, but the data show a pronounced peak between 3 and 4, and strongly disfavor the GR prediction.  If both the data and the analysis are okay, there would be less than a 2% chance of obtaining this result.  Not as good as 0.01%, but still pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3853"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/10/bean-eta.jpg" alt="bean-eta" title="bean-eta" width="557" height="542"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are we supposed to make of this?  Don’t get me wrong:  I’m not ready to bet against Einstein, at least not yet.  Mostly my pro-Einstein prejudice comes from long experience trying to come up with alternative theories of gravity that are simultaneously logically sensible and observationally consistent; it’s just very hard to do.  But more generally, good scientists naturally have a strong suspicion of any claimed observational result that purports to overthrow an extremely well-established theory.  That’s just common sense, not hidebound establishmentarianism; most such anomalies eventually go away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean that you &lt;em&gt;ignore&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/07/17/a-new-cmb-anomaly/"&gt;anomalies&lt;/a&gt;; you just treat them with caution.  In this case, there could be an unrecognized systematic error in the data set, or a subtle error in the analysis.  Given 1:1 odds, that’s certainly where the smart money would bet right now.  It’s also possible that the fault lies with dark matter or dark energy, not with gravity — but it’s hard to see how that could work, to be honest.  Happily, it’s an empirical question — more data and more analysis will either reinforce the result, or make it go away.  After all, some anomalies turn out to be frighteningly real.  This one is worth taking seriously, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255358251264"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=1628">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/85d431dd563879c7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Australia"/><category term="Blogroll"/><category term="Challenges to Science"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Pseudoscience"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="anti-vaccination"/><category term="Bill Maher"/><category term="health"/><category term="homeopathy"/><category term="news"/><title type="html">Reliance On Homeopathy Poses A Threat And AntiVaxers.Com</title><published>2009-10-12T13:53:45Z</published><updated>2009-10-12T13:53:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/Ep08NSrVSm0/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/2009/10/reliance-on-homeopathy-poses-a-threat-and-antivaxerscom/"/><content xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been hideously busy and this will continue for a while, especially since I seem to have two battling email systems that eat all my important documents.

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Some days it feels like it’s ‘one step forwards - two back’, so these two links were a nice finding.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, I have just one question for our health regulators: how do you sleep at night knowing you continue to allow homoeopathic products to be legally peddled in the healthcare marketplace as substitutes for effective therapeutic treatment for the most helpless and vulnerable members of the community, our children?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why target the Australian Vaccination Network?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Australian Vaccination Network (AVN) is Australia’s largest anti-vaccination organisation. They have been running a campaign of misinformation and fear-mongering since 1994. Many people who now refuse to vaccinate cite the information that they received from the AVN as being partly, or wholly, responsible for their decision not to vaccinate.&lt;br&gt;
This site will include evidence that the AVN provide misleading information, promote dangerous practices, subscribe to various conspiracy theories, and therefore should not be allowed to continue their campaign which is contributing to a degradation in public health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GLM is a very strange site which has, as Revere points out, declared itself to be an important go-to place to find out about language trends across the world.  I have not decided what I think about this site except when I browse around it it I feel my guard going up, and up and up.  In &lt;a href="http://www.languagemonitor.com/news/top-politically-incorrect-words-of-2009"&gt;a recent post&lt;/a&gt;,  the GLM lists cases of inappropriate political correctness.  The GLM says "Once again, we are seeing that the attempt to remove all bias from language is itself creating biases of their own" and they point out as the number one example of this ... &lt;em&gt;Swine Flu&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

It will roll from the Vehicle Assembly Building to launch pad 39B on that date, and prep for &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/news/releases/2009/release-20091009.html"&gt;an October 27 launch&lt;/a&gt;. The launch window is from 08:00 – 12:00 EDT (12:00 – 16:00 UTC). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a tad early for me to wake up to live tweet it (I’m two hours earlier) but if the launch holds off a couple of hours I’ll see what I can do. Remember too it’ll be covered on &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/ntv"&gt;NASA TV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ares I-X is not NASA’s final rocket assembly that will take humans back into space in the post-Shuttle era; it’s a test vehicle to check out some of the hardware and procedures that will be used in the full-up &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/ares/aresl/index.html"&gt;Ares I rocket&lt;/a&gt;. And NASA plans on building the larger and more powerful &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/ares/aresV/index.html"&gt;Ares V&lt;/a&gt;, which is what will return us to the Moon, assuming all goes &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/11/the-future-of-nasa/"&gt;according to the current plan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255356397538"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=3360">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/00970ede7c1718b3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">More Review Action for Unscientific America</title><published>2009-10-12T13:19:15Z</published><updated>2009-10-12T13:19:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/10/12/more-review-action-for-unscientific-america/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;More than two months after pub, the dialogue continues…now Isis&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/unscientific_america_and_the_m.php"&gt; is reviewing&lt;/a&gt; the book, and so far I have really enjoyed what she had to say–e.g., the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;To be entirely honest, I could give two left nuts if some quiz tells us that some Americans don’t remember that an electron is smaller than an atom.  I guarantee that if I were quizzed on some topic outside of the scholarly areas I have chosen to pursue as an adult, I might come out looking like a dumbass. A hot dumbass, but a dumbass none the less.  There is plenty of information that I don’t think about everyday that I learned about as a high school or college student that I could not instantly recall.  If that is the definition of illiteracy, then we’re all pretty much screwed.  I would argue, however, that what keeps me from being “illiterate” is the fact that I could find the knowledge if I ever came to need it again, that I have the ability to discern high quality information from low quality information, and that I have the tools to think critically about a problem.  A major source of scientific illiteracy, or unscientific-ness, is a result of the public’s exposure to pseudoscience and antiscience that they have been unable or unwilling to distinguish from the real deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read her first post on the book &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/unscientific_america_and_the_m.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;–and now there is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/so_what_does_outreach_by_scien.php"&gt;a second&lt;/a&gt; about networking scientists for better communication, which contained this nugget:&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;I’ll grant you that our public schools are in dire need of resources.  After all, that’s why many of us are participating in &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/leadershipboard.html?category=111"&gt;the DonorsChoose program&lt;/a&gt;. That said, if we have to rely on educating children who are in kindergarten now to cure scientific ignorance and apathy (I think I like these terms more than illiteracy) then it’s going to be at least 30 years before we begin to see a change in the nation’s scientific climate.  30+ years!  Dr. Isis will still be hot, but she’ll be well into her 60s.  Some of you &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey"&gt;folks will be&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://physioprof.wordpress.com/"&gt;diapers by then&lt;/a&gt; and FWDAOTI from &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground"&gt;your nursing homes&lt;/a&gt;.  In the meantime, there is a lot that the people in charge can fuck up waiting for our well-educated children to finally come of age. So, I am not going to discount the idea of reforming science education in our schools, but I am going to call bullshit in the idea that it is a sufficient solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I deliberately quote all of this before going on to link a &lt;a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/2009/6/a-thin-broth"&gt;negative review&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;American Scientist &lt;/em&gt;that we just received from political scientist Jon Miller of Michigan State. Miller is a top expert on international scientific literacy–we cite his work numerous times in the book–but in a paradigm we have diverged from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s hard to account for perceptions sometimes, I don’t think we devalue science education in the book as much as Miller seems to suggest. Our view is essentially Isis’s view quoted above: Science education is critically important, woefully underfunded, and lamentably under attack; but fixing it is not a cure-all, either, given how long that project would take and the problems that lie before us much more immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I take any issue with Miller’s review, it’s probably in his dismissal of us for a “light and journalistic treatment” of the topic; the word “journalism” is one he seems to repeatedly use with disdain. As you might imagine, I feel very differently about the virtues of journalistic treatments and popularizations; and this is something I plan to say more about…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255355235298"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7904/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1dca6cd57223d80d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Obama Urged to Intensify Push for Climate Measure</title><published>2009-10-12T14:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-12T14:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7904/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;President Obama is coming under renewed pressure internationally and in the United States to throw his weight behind climate-change legislation, which advocates fear has suffered in light of the president's sweeping domestic agenda. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;from the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; (Registration Required)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx</id><title type="html">Science In The News Daily</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255355235292"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7903/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0f6e82a5a3bc2139</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Training to Climb an Everest of Digital Data</title><published>2009-10-12T13:58:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-12T13:58:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7903/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- It is a rare criticism of elite American university students that they do not think big enough.

&lt;p&gt;We’re &lt;a href="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;amp;cid=1254573498385&amp;amp;pagename=Zone-English-News/NWELayout"&gt;teaching Iraqis about atheism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s dangerous for anyone to say they don’t believe in a god in such a predominantly Muslim nation, but some brave Iraqis are even forming groups!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Iraq is a land without God or any other kind of major protective superior form,” claims one atheist who declined to be named fearing reprisal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have been forgotten and it is better to think only rationally than emotionally. I left behind my old beliefs because it is the only way to protect my children from any harm that God isn’t being able to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yasser (not his real name) is grouping up with others who have also renounced their faiths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we first decided to organise ourselves, we were only eight people,” he told IOL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And after seven months, our number has reached to 34 but many other groups are being formed countrywide according to my contacts in northern and southern Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe that today in Iraq, there are at least 220 atheists linked to the groups nationwide.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take serious pride in this statement from a religion teacher in Iraq: “No one is guiltier than the Americans who brought such ideas to Iraqis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re welcome &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’ll be a while before rationality takes a stronghold in the country, but if the movement can grow, it’ll help bring the country out of the darkness it’s in right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:right"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anonymous&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), nutritionism — meaning the unexamined assumption that food is only a conveyor of the substances it contains &lt;sup&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt; — has evolved independently of science and medicine since the 1970s, and has caused so much wondering and confusion about food and diet that many Americans have become unable to eat properly. Today, there isn’t a popular magazine that doesn’t have a “health and nutrition” section that — often with the backing of very little science — promises many health benefits of a nutrient or warns against the harms of another; and then provides a list of foods that contain it. The same publication might time and again write the exact opposite, further adding to the already-prevalent nutritional confusion. Nutritionism is thus an ideology sourced by popular beliefs, academic reveries, and the food and dietary supplements industry, where food is simply seen as a mean to achieve a specific health goal. In its latest form, however, coupled with genomics and biomedical informatics, and called “nutrigenomics” or “nutritional genomics,” nutritionism takes  academic reveries to such an extent that it could be accurately described as “science fiction.” The &lt;a href="http://nutrigenomics.ucdavis.edu"&gt; Center of Excellence for Nutritional Genomics&lt;/a&gt; at UC Davis writes indeed (in bold) on its website that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The promise of nutritional genomics is personalized medicine and health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; based upon an understanding of our nutritional needs, nutritional and health status, and our genotype. Nutrigenomics will also have impacts on society — from medicine to agricultural and dietary practices to social and public policies — and its applications are likely to exceed that of even the human genome project. Chronic diseases (and some types of cancer) may be preventable, or at least delayed, by balanced, sensible diets. Knowledge gained from comparing diet/gene interactions in different populations may provide information needed to address the larger problem of global malnutrition and disease.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nutritional genomics is one of the “omics” that have come out of the human genome project — meaning the mapping of the 3 billion base pairs that make up the 20,000-25,000 genes in the human genome — and claims that it can develop means to optimize nutrition by exploring “personalized” or “genome-based” nutrition, in which foods are optimized for each individual’s unique genetic makeup. This goal is presumably achieved by correlating gene expression or single-nucleotide polymorphisms in health and disease with the consumption of a food or a combination of foods. The website of the UC Davis Center also states that its goal is to “devise genome-based nutritional interventions to prevent, delay, and treat diseases such asthma, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and prostate cancer.” The Center also adds (again in bold) that its goal is also to “&lt;strong&gt;reduce and ultimately eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities&lt;/strong&gt; resulting from environment and gene interactions, particularly those involving dietary, economic, and cultural factors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental clinical medicine and public health assumptions that underlie this narrative are (1) the supposition that our lack of understanding of the precise mechanisms of environment/gene interactions is at the origin of our failure to prevent or to delay these diseases; and (2) that the futuristic cognitive tools of nutrigenomics can convert the large, complex, high-dimensional and nonlinear data on the complex interactions between the genetic makeup of a susceptible population and multiple environmental variables into useful knowledge. Identifying the positive and negative connections between the common constituents of their diet with genetic determinants of health and disease, will presumably uncover the insufficient intake or overconsumption of certain nutrients, and a population’s inability to absorb, metabolize or excrete them. To encounter that, nutritional genomics claims to be able to recommend specific, “personalized” and “genome-based” nutritional adjustments. According to the Center of Excellence’s Director, Raymond Rodriguez, nutritional genomics has been identified “as an emerging research focus of critical importance to global health and a vital link between agriculture, food and human health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the nutritionism in these assumptions, and the “sciencefictional” nature of the promised solutions to the current epidemic of obesity, Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the US, let us first consider the last time nutritionists undertook such grandiose public health and clinical ambitions. I am referring to the fat-free diet craze of the late 1980s, which Gary Taubes and Michael Pollan independently deconstruct as politically-motivated nutritionism. As Taubes writes in The Soft Science of Dietary Fat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since the early 1970s, for instance, Americans’ average fat intake has dropped from over 40% of total calories to 34%; average serum cholesterol levels have dropped as well. But no compelling evidence suggests that these decreases have improved health. Although heart disease death rates have dropped–and public health officials insist low-fat diets are partly responsible–the incidence of heart disease does not seem to be declining, as would be expected if lower fat diets made a difference.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, obesity in America, which remained constant from the early 1960s through 1980, has surged upward since then–from 14% of the population to over 22%. Diabetes has increased apace. Both obesity and diabetes increase heart disease risk, which could explain why heart disease incidence is not decreasing. That this obesity epidemic occurred just as the government began bombarding Americans with the low-fat message suggests the possibility, however distant, that low-fat diets might have unintended consequences–among them, weight gain.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that Michael Pollan, the author of The Omnivore’s Dilemma, adds in a New York Times article called Unhappy Meals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last winter came the news that a low-fat diet, long believed to protect against breast cancer, may do no such thing — this from the monumental, federally financed Women’s Health Initiative, which has also found no link between a low-fat diet and rates of coronary disease. The year before we learned that dietary fiber might not, as we had been confidently told, help prevent colon cancer.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it appears that nutrition-based clinical medicine and public health in the last decades not only have been unable to prevent, delay, and treat diseases, but have actually contributed to the current rise of metabolic syndrome, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other conditions arising from glucose intolerance and metabolic syndrome. According to Gary Taubes, the rampaging epidemic of obesity in America is partially due to the disastrous ambitions of Senator George McGovern’s Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs that changed the nutritional and public health policy in this country in the late 1970s.  McGovern’s Committee had a mandate to eradicate malnutrition and disease, but in the mid-1970s the original mandate was replaced by an overzealous fight against “overnutrition,” and the health concerns associated with the dietary excesses of Americans. The Committee held hearings in July 1976, at the end of which McGovern — who was heavily influence by the diet-guru Nathan Pritikin’s very low fat diet and exercise program — with the aid of a handful of his staff members created the basis for the disastrous fat-fear-mongering of the next three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the panel’s recommendations, to which a 1982 National Academy report added the association of dietary fat with cancer,&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Americans did change their diets; and their average fat intake dropped significantly. But instead of fruits, vegetables and legumes, the average person replaced the missing fat with refined carbohydrates and high-fructose corn syrup, ostensibly as a way to avoid the evils of fat. Gary Taubes adds that the food industry which had little incentive in advertising non-proprietary items such as vegetables has been a major contributor to this public health blunder, for it spends the great bulk of the $30-billion-plus spent yearly on food advertising on selling carbohydrates in the guise of fast food, sodas, snacks, and candy bars. Michael Pollan writes that paradoxically Americans got really fat on this new low-fat, high-carbohydrates diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that two of the top leading causes of death in the US, meaning heart disease (1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;) and diabetes (6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;),&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; are predominantly arising from decades of nutritional confusion and fear-mongering, nutritional genomics, armed with Artificial Intelligence, data mining and pattern-recognition technology is poised to “sniff” through the 3 billion-byte-long code of the human genome, and uncover genetic patterns that would explain why and how the low-fat and high-carbohydrates diet recommendations of George McGovern’s Select Committee are causing glucose intolerance, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in susceptible individuals and populations! But all we need for this purpose is some common sense, a little knowledge of American public health history, and the initiative to look through the grocery bills, the refrigerators, the restaurant menus or the trash cans of susceptible individuals and populations, and we can easily find out how super-sized refined carbohydrates and high-fructose corn syrup have made their way to their diet. For this, there is no need to analyze their genome with the aid of computational biology and pattern recognition technology, unless we have a taste for science fiction and Digital Age divination — none of which merits to promise medicine and health!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nutritionism about prostate cancer has a connection to the dietary supplement industry that deserves to be mentioned here. A diet rich on  animal fats and poor in grains, fruits and vegetables has been blamed for not providing enough of the presumably needed lycopenes, selenium, vitamins C and E, green tea, sulforaphane (found in broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower) and soy, and thus supplements, as David Heber, the Founding Director of UCLA Center  for Human Nutrition, and coincidentally the Chairman of &lt;a href="http://www.herbalifescience.com/advisory-board/david-heber"&gt;Herbalife’s Nutrition Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt; claims, could be used to prevent the occurrence of prostate cancer.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; According to a &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2004/1004/116.html"&gt;2004 Forbes article&lt;/a&gt;, Heber joined the Board at roughly the same time the multilevel marketer of supplements and weight-loss products made a $3 million donation to establish the Mark Hughes Cellular &amp;amp; Molecular Nutrition Laboratory at the Center for Human Nutrition, leading to the criticism of Heber’s nutrition-based preventive claims as unfounded and pro-supplements, for obvious reasons.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; As for the value of any type of nutritional intervention to prevent, delay, and treat prostate cancer, Bill Nelson, a pioneer in the study of diet as preventive medicine at Johns Hopkins Brady Urological Institute tells us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d have almost no reservations about advising someone to make sure his selenium levels are not too low, says Nelson. Beyond that, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and less red meat. And beyond that, take every story about a new dietary “wonder drug” with — pardon the food imagery — the proverbial grain of salt.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nutritional management of asthma is even less in need of avant-garde nutritionism. Merck Manual briefly mentions  that “diets low in vitamins C and E and in ω–3 fatty acids have been linked to asthma, as has obesity,” and nothing beyond that.&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; But if the deficiency of these nutrients and obesity are truly linked do asthma, then all we need is to “eat food, not too much, mostly plants,” as Michael Pollan recommends, and get them local, organic, seasonal and diverse, as others have suggested. And if you think that the link between obesity and asthma is a new discovery; and that the knowledge of how dietary chemicals alter gene expression or structure is required to address the problem, then read Galen of Pergamum’s (ca. 130-ca. 200) humbling treatise on the Thinning Diet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The thinning diet is indicated for the majority of chronic diseases, which can, indeed, frequently be treated by such means alone, and without recourse to drugs.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;It is therefore important to form a clear idea of this diet; for wherever a result can be achieved purely by regimen, it is preferable to refrain from pharmaceutical prescriptions. Even with complaints of the kidneys and joints (provided the patient is not yet presenting joints full of ’stones’), I have known many cases where the thinning diet lead either to complete remission or at least to a lessening of the pain. I have also known quite a few sufferers from chronic breathing difficulties derive such benefits from it that they returned completely to normal, or else suffered very few attacks over a long period.&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To summarize, the AAI decided to recognize Bill Maher with their award named after Dr. Dawkins. The award is for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Richard Dawkins Award will be given every year to honor an outstanding atheist whose contributions raise public awareness of the nontheist life stance; who through writings, media, the arts, film, and/or the stage advocates increased scientific knowledge; who through work or by example teaches acceptance of the nontheist philosophy; and whose public posture mirrors the uncompromising nontheist life stance of Dr. Richard Dawkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part that caused controversy was the bit about “advocates increased scientific knowledge.” A number of skeptics (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/my_last_entry_on_the_maher_issue_probabl.php"&gt;Orac, I think, was most verbose&lt;/a&gt;)  had a problem with this because Bill Maher is an advocate for medical pseudoscience. He does not believe in vaccines, he denigrates “western medicine” as a scam, and he has a problem with germ theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;On &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,4388,n,n"&gt;RichardDawkins.net&lt;/a&gt; Josh Timonen gave was appears to be the official defense of the decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst Richard was not involved in the decision, he is nevertheless happy to go along with it. Just as he worked with Bishop Harries to protest against creationist schools in the UK, and just as he regularly recommends Kenneth Miller’s books on evolution to religious people, he understands that it is not a prerequisite to agree with a person on all issues in order to unite in support of a common objective. Richard and Christopher Hitchens don’t see eye to eye on all political matters, but that doesn’t stop them from working together against the dangers of religion. Honoring the creation of ‘Religulous’ does not imply endorsement of all of Bill Maher’s other views, and does not preclude Richard’s arguing against them on future occasions. It is simply showing proper appreciation of his brilliant film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This misses the point, in my opinion. If the award were solely for Religulous, and that were clear, I don’t think anyone would have a problem with it. But the award specifically cites “science” as a necessary criterion for the award. Giving the Richard Dawkins Award to Maher was the equivalent of giving a prominent advocate of creationism and intelligent design a science award because of their opposition to the 911 truther movement. I suspect that such a decision would not sit well with Richard Dawkins and some others who were perceived to be soft on AAI’s decision. The analogies to Miller and Hitchens are not apt – Maher is so far outside the scientific mainstream on medicine that it is incongruous to give him any science award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not attend the AAI conference, but reports from those who did say that Dawkins, in introducing Maher, took care to criticize his views on medicine. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/aai_evening_award_ceremony.php"&gt;PZ Myers writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news for all the critics of this choice is that Dawkins pulled no punches. In his introduction, he praised &lt;em&gt;Religulous&lt;/em&gt; and thanked Maher for his contributions to freethought, but he also very clearly and unambiguously stated that some of his beliefs about medicine were simply crazy. He did a good job of walking a difficult tightrope; he made it clear that the award was granted for some specific worthy matters, his humorous approach to religion, while carefully dissociating the AAI from any endorsement of crackpot medicine. It won’t be enough, I know, but the effort was made, and talking to Dawkins afterwards there was no question but that Maher’s quackery was highly objectionable. I also got the impression that he felt the critics of the award were making good and reasonable points, and that he felt the awkwardness of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be seen as recognition by Dawkins that there were problems with the award. I can only assume that this was specifically in response to criticism about giving Maher the award, since when Dawkins was first asked about the decision he simply said that he was not aware of Maher’s views on medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final analysis, the problem that many of us have with Maher getting the award is that the totality of his views clearly indicates that Maher is not a rationalist. Because his religious views happen to coincide with those of the AAI does not mean that his views stem from a rational or scientific worldview. In my opinion, AAI simply got snookered. They focused on one aspect of Maher’s opinions, ignored the big picture, and in the end gave a science award to a pseudoscientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will get past this, but it is a sore spot that will continue to ache, because Maher is not going away. Every time he spouts his nonsense about medicine it will cut a little deeper. He is still at it – take a look at this recent interview with Bill Frist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/tB5DLf1Qt78%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frist is a doctor who has apparently kept up with the literature, and he seems to know what he is talking about. Although I have criticized Frist in the past for putting his own ideology ahead of science on the Terry Schiavo case. But in this interview, Frist was the side of reason. Maher repeated his denigration of “western” medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also gets his facts wrong – he quotes Jonas Salk about the risks of live virus vaccines, without pointing out that the flu vaccine injections he is referring to are dead virus vaccines. Maher further argues that the flu vaccine does not work, when the data say otherwise. Here is an &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2040"&gt;excellent review by Mark Crislip&lt;/a&gt;. The bottom line is that the flu vaccine works, but it is not perfect, and the primary problem (which Maher did get right sort of – it seems he can know the facts when it suits him) is that the flu strains are constantly evolving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maher also downplays the risks of the H1N1 pandemic. Here he is simply wrong – while H1N1 is not any more risky overall than the regular seasonal flu (which kills 36,000 people a year in the US alone), it kills more young healthy adults and pregnant women. Maher was telling pregnant women not to get vaccinated – Maher’s advice kills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that leads us back to the specific reason why many of us had a problem with the AAI award – it adds to the reputation of a medical crank who is using his celebrity to harm the public health (not intentionally, but that is irrelevant).  There is direct harm in Maher’s medical views, and to me that trumps any other view he might have.&lt;/p&gt;

To summarize, the AAI decided to recognize Bill Maher with their award named after Dr. Dawkins. The award is for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Richard Dawkins Award will be given every year to honor an outstanding atheist whose contributions raise public awareness of the nontheist life stance; who through writings, media, the arts, film, and/or the stage advocates increased scientific knowledge; who through work or by example teaches acceptance of the nontheist philosophy; and whose public posture mirrors the uncompromising nontheist life stance of Dr. Richard Dawkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part that caused controversy was the bit about “advocates increased scientific knowledge.” A number of skeptics (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/my_last_entry_on_the_maher_issue_probabl.php"&gt;Orac, I think, was most verbose&lt;/a&gt;)  had a problem with this because Bill Maher is an advocate for medical pseudoscience. He does not believe in vaccines, he denigrates “western medicine” as a scam, and he has a problem with germ theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,4388,n,n"&gt;RichardDawkins.net&lt;/a&gt; Josh Timonen gave was appears to be the official defense of the decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst Richard was not involved in the decision, he is nevertheless happy to go along with it. Just as he worked with Bishop Harries to protest against creationist schools in the UK, and just as he regularly recommends Kenneth Miller’s books on evolution to religious people, he understands that it is not a prerequisite to agree with a person on all issues in order to unite in support of a common objective. Richard and Christopher Hitchens don’t see eye to eye on all political matters, but that doesn’t stop them from working together against the dangers of religion. Honoring the creation of ‘Religulous’ does not imply endorsement of all of Bill Maher’s other views, and does not preclude Richard’s arguing against them on future occasions. It is simply showing proper appreciation of his brilliant film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This misses the point, in my opinion. If the award were solely for Religulous, and that were clear, I don’t think anyone would have a problem with it. But the award specifically cites “science” as a necessary criterion for the award. Giving the Richard Dawkins Award to Maher was the equivalent of giving a prominent advocate of creationism and intelligent design a science award because of their opposition to the 911 truther movement. I suspect that such a decision would not sit well with Richard Dawkins and some others who were perceived to be soft on AAI’s decision.

&lt;p&gt;I give up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried. I really, really did try. I tried really, really hard not to look at the flaming idiocy of Bill Maher again, much less comment on it again. Here I am, in Chicago at the American College of Surgeons annual meeting, taking in all sorts of surgical goodness, trying to take a break from blogging. It's not so much to ask, is it? I didn't think so, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, exactly a week after he &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/my_last_entry_on_the_maher_issue_probabl.php"&gt;accepted the Richard Dawkins Award&lt;/a&gt;, Bill Maher couldn't help it but let his freak flag fly! In fact, he started out an interview with Bill Frist by asking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Conservatives always say about health care, especially, you know, are you going to let the government run health care? They screw everything up. So why would you let them be the ones to stick a disease into your arm?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Bill Frist interjected to ask whether Maher was talking about the swine flu vaccine Maher continued, "I would never get a swine flu vaccine or any vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's right, the 2009 recipient of the Richard Dawkins Award is an anti-vaccine wingnut, and he couldn't even wait a week to spew even more pseudoscience to dishonor the name of Richard Dawkins. Look for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, neuromarketers have have used the word in the following fashion:Neurocinema is a new filmmaking process that studies a viewer&amp;#39;s sensorimotor, cognitive, and affective response to film stimuli. Researchers use technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure changes in activity in parts of the brain,electroencephalography (EEG) to measure activity in specific regional spectra of the brain response, and/or sensors to measure changes in one&amp;#39;s physiological state (heart rate, respiratory rate, galvanic skin response) to learn exactly what scenes excite or disinterest the viewer.There have been no peer-review studies on this methodology, only articles in the popular press (e.g., Wired.com and CNN.com). And from what was available in those reports, there was plenty to be neurocritical about.On the other hand, Uri Hasson and his NYU colleagues published an article entitled Neurocinematics: The Neuroscience of Film in Projections: The Journal for Movies and Mind. Granted, that article is lacking the methodological details one would see in NeuroImage or Human Brain Mapping, but in fact the authors have published their work in prestigious journals (like Science and Neuron) without the &amp;quot;Neurocinematics&amp;quot; title.In their Projections article, Hasson et al. (2008) state:We propose that ISC [inter-subject correlation analysis] may be useful to film studies by providing a quantitative neuroscientific assessment of the impact of different styles of filmmaking on viewers’ brains, and a valuable method for the film industry to better assess its products. Finally, we suggest that this method brings together two separate and largely unrelated disciplines, cognitive neuroscience and film studies, and may open the way for a new interdisciplinary field of “neurocinematic” studies.Hasson and colleagues first described the ISC method in their 2004 paper. In that study five subjects watched 30 min of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly while laying supine in an MRI scanner. Unlike a typical fMRI experiment involving controlled presentation of individual pictures and performance of a categorization task, free viewing of a dynamic film is a more naturalistic situation. It also presents a more challenging data analysis problem. To tackle this, the researchers eschewed standard hypothesis-testing and adopted a purely data-driven approach to determine commonalities in brain activation across subjects.1Figure 1B (Hasson et al., 2008). The ISC analysis measures similarity in brain activity across viewers by comparing the response time course in each brain region from one viewer with the response time courses obtained in the same brain region from other viewers during movie watching.The results (Hasson et al., 2004) demonstrated that...Despite the free viewing and complex nature of the movie, we found an extensive and highly significant correlation across individuals watching the same movie. Thus, on average over 29% ± 10 SD of the cortical surface showed a highly significant intersubject correlation during the movie..... Close inspection of this across-subject correlation revealed that the synchronization was far more extensive than the boundaries of well-known audiovisual sensory cortex defined with conventional mapping approach. ...the across-subject correlation covered most of the visual system, including early retinotopic areas as well as high-order object areas within the occipitotemporal and intraparietal cortex. Moreover, the correlation extended far beyond the visual and auditory cortices to the entire superior temporal (STS) and lateral sulcus (LS), retrosplenial gyrus, even secondary somatosensory regions in the postcentral sulcus, as well as multimodal areas in the inferior frontal gyrus and parts of the limbic system in the cingulate gyrus.When corrected for non-selective elements, the intersubject correlation remained at 24% ± 8.5.  The other 75% of the brain not &amp;quot;in sync&amp;quot; across subjects included parietal lobe areas (supramarginal and angular gyri) and the bulk of prefrontal cortex. Subcortical areas important for emotion and memory (amygdala and hippocampus) were not examined.A second analysis was also performed, which took a &amp;quot;reverse-correlation&amp;quot; approach to examine activity in two well-know category-specific areas: the fusiform face area (for faces) and the parahippocampal place area (for buildings). This type of functional specialization was demonstrated in an earlier paper as well (Bartels &amp;amp; Zeki, 2004). In that study, the participants watched a James Bond movie (Tomorrow Never Dies). Activity in category-specific regions (for color, faces, language, and human bodies) was correlated with the perceived intensity of these specific attributes (as rated by a separate group of subjects who watched the same movie)...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

It forwarded the proposal that the difference between larval and adult forms of insects--between caterpillars and butterflies, to give one example--arose because insects are the product of a hybridization event between a caterpillar-like organism and something that looked like the adult. The two different forms represent what once were two different species. There's no evidence for this, and any number of reasons to indicate it's wrong. The person who wrote the article is retired after having pushed similar ideas for decades; he's apparently so poorly read on the subject that he doesn't realize that there's already data that addresses the test of his proposal that he puts forward (and shows that he's wrong).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But things apparently &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=national-academy-as-national-enquirer"&gt;get weirder still&lt;/a&gt; when you &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/091009/full/news.2009.985.html?s=news_rss"&gt;look at the history of the paper&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the National Academies of Science are able to shepherd papers through the review process at its Proceedings journal (a practice that will end next year), which is the only reason this got through. The member in this case is Lynn Margulis, who got into the NAS because of her endosymbiosis hypothesis for the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts. But since then she's been suggesting hybridization and endosymbiosis as the explanation for just about anything in biology, whether the data support it or not. The paper looks to be her way of thumbing her nose at a scientific club that would have her as a member, as she hand-picked a group of equally disgruntled reviewers (choice quote from one: "I'm willing to lower that bar.").&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things have now descended into chaos. PNAS is refusing to put the paper, which is available online, in one of its print editions, and its editor is sitting on other papers from Margulis while awaiting an explanation for what happened here. &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to that explanation... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/10/bizarre_paper_on_interspecies.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255335088183"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DenimAndTweed/~3/tD41KTdE5QE/first-step-to-mutualism-doesnt-look-so.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/149097be85391c1c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">First step to mutualism doesn&amp;#39;t look so friendly</title><published>2009-10-12T03:05:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-12T03:05:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/7xUq_dYHc0s/first-step-to-mutualism-doesnt-look-so.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DenimAndTweed/~3/tD41KTdE5QE/first-step-to-mutualism-doesnt-look-so.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Ant-plant protection mutualism is a widespread and elegant species interaction. How do species strike bargain like this, requiring specialized behaviors and structures in each partner, in the first place? A new report in The American Naturalist suggests an answer: maybe ants took the initiative [$-a].

In exchange for protection from herbivores and competitors [big PDF], &amp;quot;myrmecophytic&amp;quot; host plants grow hollow structures called domatia and often produce nectar to shelter and feed a colony of ants. This mutualism is really a sort of negotiated settlement between the partners; both ants and plants do what they can to get the most out of the interaction. We have evidence in some cases that host plants cut back support for ants if there aren&amp;#39;t any herbivores around; and, in other cases, that ants prune their host plants to prompt the growth of more domatia.

Photos by Alastair Rae and Russian_in_Brazil.So it isn&amp;#39;t entirely surprising that there might be cases where that bargain hasn&amp;#39;t been established yet, and that&amp;#39;s what the new paper reports. The observation turned up in connection with one of the most interesting forms of the ant-plant mutualism: the &amp;quot;devil&amp;#39;s gardens&amp;quot; of the Amazonian rainforest. Devil&amp;#39;s gardens are created by colonies of the ant Myrmelachista schumanni, which attacks possible competitors to its preferred host [$-a], Duroia hirsuta, leaving patches where nothing but D. hirsuta grows.

Clued in by native research assistants, the group studying the devil&amp;#39;s garden interaction discovered that trees growing at the edge of a garden are often afflicted with swollen, distorted trunks. Cutting into the swellings, they found them riddled with passages and populated by M. schumanni. The trees in question are not known as myrmecophytes, and it&amp;#39;s not clear that they receive any benefit from hosting ants. In fact, the authors report that ant-occupied trunks are weakened, and prone to breakage under their own weight or under heavy wind. 

The paper doesn&amp;#39;t present direct evidence that the ants create the galls, but as the authors explain, this seems likely -- M. schumanni kills its hosts&amp;#39; competition by injecting them with formic acid, which parallels the irritants other gall-making insects inject into their host plants. It make sense that gall-making might have started as ants&amp;#39; attempts to kill off trees that are too big to succumb to formic acid outright, but respond to it by growing galls like scar tissue. Furthermore -- and this is pure speculation, of course -- this looks like a first evolutionary step toward true ant-plant mutualism. Domatia may have originally evolved to redirect ants from more damaging gall-making, and since ants are naturally territorial about their nests, it might not take much behavioral change before they end up protecting their host.

You might recall that when I first read the book, my reaction to the premise that scientists need to engage the public more was initially:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;What the balls more do you want from me Chris and Sheril?  I am only one scientist!  Now I have to solve scientific illiteracy too?  Fuck!!!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I am willing to entertain the notion that more interaction with scientists could alter the current climate.  I mean, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/unscientific_america_and_the_m.php#comment-1991547"&gt;we can poo-poo Carl Sagan&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="http://www.carlsagan.com/"&gt;Cosmos&lt;/a&gt; was seen by 500 million people.  I&amp;#39;ll grant you that our public schools are in dire need of resources.  After all, that&amp;#39;s why many of us are participating in &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/leadershipboard.html?category=111"&gt;the DonorsChoose program&lt;/a&gt;. That said, if we have to rely on educating children who are in kindergarten now to cure scientific ignorance and apathy (I think I like these terms more than illiteracy) then it&amp;#39;s going to be at least 30 years before we begin to see a change in the nation&amp;#39;s scientific climate.  30+ years!  Dr. Isis will still be hot, but she&amp;#39;ll be well into her 60s.  Some of you &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey"&gt;folks will be&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://physioprof.wordpress.com/"&gt;diapers by then&lt;/a&gt; and FWDAOTI from &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground"&gt;your nursing homes&lt;/a&gt;.  In the meantime, there is a lot that the people in charge can fuck up waiting for our well-educated children to finally come of age. So, I am not going to discount the idea of reforming science education in our schools, but I am going to call bullshit in the idea that it is a sufficient solution.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/10/so_what_does_outreach_by_scien/conference.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/10/so_what_does_outreach_by_scien/conference-thumb-400x213-20573.jpg" alt="conference.jpg" height="213" width="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/strollerderby/2008/12/conference.jpg"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;: "Boy, I really hope our parents don't blow us all up while we're stuck here waiting to go through puberty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's fairly clear that the popular media is not sufficiently engaging the public and does not always accurately report scientific findings. There is a strong culture of distrust between scientists and journalists and I think journalists have &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/sarah_arnquist_you_suck_swine.php"&gt;earned a lot&lt;/a&gt; of that distrust.  It&amp;#39;s also fairly clear that there are factions of our current political system that have subscribed to a culture of anti-science, but I will leave that for its own post.   So, the question I&amp;#39;d ask here is, is it reasonable to ask scientists to fill the void left by the craptastic work of the media and how will they do it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is realistic to ask of scientists currently engaged in active research?  I&amp;#39;ll tell you the source of uneasiness among many of the scientists who read this book, including myself, and heard the call to engage the public -- in the context of my current research program, I haven&amp;#39;t had time to shave my legs in three days, let alone engage the public as a professional journalist.  I write a blog because I enjoy it, but I do it at the expense of other things I enjoy.  Like sleeping.  And bubble baths.  And sleeping.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current academic scientific system does not reward outreach in the same way it rewards the creation of novel research.  The day I &amp;quot;came out&amp;quot; to one of the more senior guys at MRU about keeping a blog he said, &amp;quot;Isis, I don&amp;#39;t care if you build model ships and blow them up in your spare time.  Just don&amp;#39;t let your hobbies get in the way of the data.&amp;quot;  I&amp;#39;m not sure I disagree with him.  I have been trained to be a lean, mean, data generating machine.  I&amp;#39;ve spent a lot of years training to do the types of experiments that I am now uniquely qualified to manage.  Research should be my focus.  It&amp;#39;s what I was educated to do.  it&amp;#39;s what I love to do.  It&amp;#39;s what I am good at.  Public outreach should be a minor time commitment for me lest I get distracted from the things I have been trained to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their book, Sheril and Chris lament the death of the renaissance scientist -- the scientist who dabbled in many different areas and performed a variety of experiments.  The scientist with more diverse interests, toiling away in his laboratory towards the next great discovery.  I think that&amp;#39;s a bit like lamenting switching from hand transcribing books to printing them on a press or switching from assembling cars one at a time to assembly line production (this analogy may come back to bite me in the ass, but I&amp;#39;m going to run with it anyway). Many of us are renaissance scientists in our minds.  I have enough experiments in a notebook to keep me busy for the rest of my career. But, I am most productive and well-funded when I set clear goals that utilize my specific talents and do my science in a collaborative environment, working with others who have talents that compliment my own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That collaborative environment might be part of the key to engaging the public.  I think a lot of scientists like the idea of engaging the public, but are overwhelmed by the idea of starting some type of outreach program alone while simultaneously maintaining the level of scientific productivity they enjoy and are rewarded for. Not all of us can be Carl Sagan. However, a collaborative information network could be substantially more effective than any solo effort.  Let me show you a little data to prove it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/10/so_what_does_outreach_by_scien/Isis%27s%20Traffic.jpg" alt="Isis&amp;#39;s Traffic.jpg" height="297" width="434"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 2: Isis the Scientist's blog traffic while at Blogspot and ScienceBlogs based on my Google Analytics statistics for the Blogspot blog and Sitemeter statistics for the ScienceBlogs blog. I had a very successful racket going over at Blogspot, but since joining the ScienceBlogs my traffic has increased 1000%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Certainly, there have been things that I have done that have increased my exposure.  For example, the peak in my blogspot blog traffic (in blue) coincides with the &lt;a href="http://isisthescientist.blogspot.com/search?q=recipe+war"&gt;Recipe War&lt;/a&gt;.  I got a bit of a boost when I joined ScienceBlogs and then plateaued.  The next jump in my traffic coincided with me learning to more effectively use social media.  The peak in my traffic coincided with the funding of our &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/03/help_dr_isis_fund_an_award_for.php"&gt;David Bruce Award&lt;/a&gt; (which I hope to do again this year) and some residual aftermath.  I&amp;#39;ve hit another plateau where my traffic is largely based on my posting frequency and how often I say &amp;quot;boobs&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;over the knee spanking&amp;quot; in a post.  That should be good for at least and extra 1,000 hits this month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/10/so_what_does_outreach_by_scien/kate_moss-over-knee-boots1.jpg" alt="kate_moss-over-knee-boots1.jpg" height="271" width="286"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 3: And if I include a picture indexed with the phrase "over the knee," I have a gangbuster month.  I have been waiting for an excuse to shoe off Kate Moss's hot boots.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, I digress.  The point of showing you this (not Kate Moss&amp;#39;s boots, but the effect of joining a network on my traffic) is to demonstrate how important belonging to a network is for exposure.  A large network with a professional staff in charge of its administration can increase the visibility of the individuals within it as a result of Google indexing, collateral traffic as individuals travel from site to site, and as a result of active promotion by the network&amp;#39;s managers.  Name recognition is a powerful tool.  Additionally, I have learned things via interactions &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/coturnix"&gt;with others&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath"&gt;the network&lt;/a&gt; that I might never have learned on my own at Blogspot.  Strives by an individual to benefit the network tend to benefit us all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sheril and Chris discuss blogging in the last chapter of their book and come to the general conclusion that bloggers are not going to solve the problem.  But, I still think that the blogging network model might.  The traffic generated by the current established networks is nothing to scoff at, and yet the number of active researchers who write/blog about their work is minimal. It&amp;#39;s hard to write off a medium of communication when so few individuals are actually engaged in it.  As it is now, some of the loudest voices (for better or worse) establish the tone.  How would the climate change if scientists engaged the public in this medium, en masse?  Who knows because no one, except for PLoS (kind of),  has &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; done it yet and I guarantee that mainstream science isn&amp;#39;t seriously considering it.   With the right tools, our scientific societies might be  uniquely poised to establish similar networks to distribute information without any individual scientist having to leave their life of data collection.  500 extra words for the lay public when you publish a major finding is trivial extra work.  What would a network like this need?  A professional staff to run the network and promote it?  Scientists who are willing to post information about their experiments to the network? A professional writing staff to consult in tailoring posts to the lay public? The totally out there writer to occasionally say &amp;quot;over the knee spanking&amp;quot; to bring in the traffic?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To the folks at the American Physiological Society, I am totally willing to do that last job.&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/so_what_does_outreach_by_scien.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/zZj7dL6xRbE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255329073925"><id gr:original-id="http://yrif.org/?p=1119">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8a795b6f5b7e8cca</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="astronomy"/><category term="catholicism"/><category term="chewbacca defense"/><category term="dick cheney"/><category term="galileo"/><category term="guy consolmagno"/><category term="oakland raiders"/><category term="science"/><title type="html">Worst Jobs: Vatican Astronomer</title><published>2009-10-12T05:37:01Z</published><updated>2009-10-12T05:37:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org/2009/10/11/worst-jobs-vatican-astronomer/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://yrif.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You probably think you’ve heard them all.  Lifeguard at the sewage plant. Public school teacher.  Dick Cheney’s hunting buddy.  Bill collector for Dr. Kevorkian.  &lt;a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=AjBv0NlFjn8e7Dz2rGi7Cn05nYcB?slug=ms-hansonspeaks101009&amp;amp;prov=yhoo&amp;amp;type=lgns"&gt;Oakland Raiders assistant coach&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, now there’s a new one to add to the list: &lt;a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20091011/NEWS01/910110483/1003/NEWS01/An-astronomer-at-the-Vatican"&gt;Vatican astronomer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, the hours are OK, and Rome is full of easily-charmed young women, and you can spend most of the workday goofing off and theorizing whether &lt;a href="http://pewforum.org/news/rss.php?NewsID=15613"&gt;space aliens&lt;/a&gt; are allowed to take communion or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there’s also the real possibility that if you start doing, you know, &lt;i&gt;science&lt;/i&gt;, then you might be &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_affair"&gt;arrested as a heretic&lt;/a&gt; and locked away in the basement where they keep confiscated copies of &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this doesn’t seem to worry star astronomer Brother Guy Consolmagno:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: Is there something spiritual in it for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Anybody who’s looked at the stars, it’s got to be spiritual. Now, I don’t want to say I find God in the stars. It’s the other way around. … You know, the reason that they fund us … is to show the world that the church embraces science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, the world seems not to be convinced about the whole “embraces science” thing yet.  Perhaps when the church abandons its evidenceless claims of human parthenogenesis and resurrection and transsubstantiation and miracle cures “they” don’t want you to know about, &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; we might start taking Brother Guy’s claim seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Plus, “it’s got to be spiritual” is not exactly scientific reasoning at its finest.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that’s not to say that the job doesn’t have its perks.  For instance, while non-Vatican scientists have to spend lots of time becoming familiar with what counts as “evidence” for things, Brother Guy gets to remain blissfully unaware:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Q: Any evidence of Heaven in the heavens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: In a funny way, yes. It’s not enough that the universe makes sense, and that we can study it — that there are laws to be found. … But the fact is, the skies are beautiful. And even the laws of physics that describe the skies are beautiful. And to me that is the beauty of the creator coming through.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Any evidence that after you die you go to heaven or hell depending on whether you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal lord and savior, ate his cracker-flesh, and let a priest fondle you in a dark booth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: In a funny way, yes.  The skies are beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Any evidence that Barack Obama is a secret Muslim?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: In a funny way, yes.  The skies are beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Any evidence that there’s a lost city of Atlantis somewhere under the ocean and that it’s populated by bloodthirsty merpeople who are waiting for the Mayan Prophecy Year of 2012 to come aboveground and conquer us all as revenge for the plastic we’ve been dumping into the Pacific?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: In a funny way, yes.  The skies are beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or come up with your own.

It must be Tuesday.</title><published>2009-10-12T05:41:12Z</published><updated>2009-10-12T05:41:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/10/11/dr-oz-says-something-stupid-it-must-be-tuesday/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:block;width:425px;margin:0 auto"&gt; [Unfortunately, I couldn't get the video to embed, so you can just see it &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/dr-oz-promotes-dan-style-dietary-intervention-to-treat-inflammation-in-autism.html"&gt;here over at the repulsive Age of Autism site&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. First, Oz says presents his baseless conjecture that autism is truly increasing. This is something that nobody on Earth actually knows. In fact, more and more evidence is starting to suggest that autism is not showing a true increase. So either Oz possesses god-like knowledge the rest of us aren’t privy to or he’s flat-out lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. No Oz, autism has nothing to do with trees or leaves. &lt;a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-10/biom-gso100509.php"&gt;As research this week concluded, it’s a single-letter difference in the genetic code&lt;/a&gt;. Also, I hate to be the one to tell you this but when grandpa died, he didn’t go on a magical journey. Your parents just didn’t have the heart to tell you he’s fertilizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. No Oz, dietary supplements have never proven effective at all in treating autism, only behaviorist treatments. And dairy in moderation is good for you. I think it speaks volumes that the embed of this video on the Age of Autism site is surrounded by ads for their dietary supplement masters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we will. Click HERE. Visit our sponsors ARI, TACA, SafeMinds,  National Autism Association, and Generation Rescue for more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And below the video, it reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment category is sponsored by &lt;span style="font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"&gt;Lee Silsby&lt;/span&gt;, the leader in quality compounded medications for autism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no conflict of interest here. That’s ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff, a pharmacy student in Richmond writes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing about Richmond is that most everyone in the city has a tattoo. After living here for 3 years I finally gave into peer pressure and got a tattoo. The only thing I could think of getting that I wouldn’t regret later in life was something nerdy/chemistry related, organic chemistry to be specific. While searching for inspiration I stumbled upon this story about the German chemist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_August_Kekul%C3%A9_von_Stradonitz"&gt;August Kekule &lt;/a&gt;who is responsible for discovering the ring structure of benzene.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kekule claims that he stopped writing and dozed off to sleep. He saw atoms whirling and dancing before his eyes. The atoms then began to reassemble themselves into long rows that seemed to move about in a snake-like motion. As he watched the snake dance, the vision progressed until the snake formed itself into an image he had seen years before at a 1850 murder trial: the snake devouring its own tail.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So there it is…a benzene ring with an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros"&gt;Ouroborus&lt;/a&gt; around it…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The writer is a conservative evangelical sympathetic to ID, but does sometimes indicate some ability to look at evidence, thus leading to above-average arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhoo, this afternoon I came across his post “&lt;a href="http://www.thinkingchristian.net/2009/10/maybe-they-really-cant-tell-the-difference/" rel="external "&gt;Maybe They Really Can’t Tell the Difference&lt;/a&gt;” [between creationism and ID].  TC starts:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several times in the last few days the term “Intelligent Design Creationism” has crossed my line of sight. It’s a misnomer, a duct-taped concatenation of concepts that overlap somewhat, but not enough to merit being stuck together the way ID opponents have done. Robert Pennock is perhaps the worst, but Barbara Forrest, Richard Dawkins, and P.Z. Myers are also frequent offenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between the two terms is straightforward. Creationism begins in Genesis and argues for certain conclusions based on a certain understanding of the Scriptures. It is known for its persistence in seeking scientific data that fits that interpretation of Genesis, and for finding creative but irregular interpretations to help in that search. As such it has gained an unsavory scientific reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I have a few thoughts on this topic, and posted them.  The whole dirty history of the ID movement seemed to be news to him – at least, it wasn’t addressed in his opening argument, even though some of it seems pretty obviously relevant to discuss for someone who is claiming that ID is clearly different from creationism, and not a variety of it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in the course of the thread, all I got was from TC was the equivalent of “even if that’s true, you’re still wrong and ID and creationism are different.”  I summarized my view of the discussion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s your argument: ID is a religiously-motivated movement, historically derived from creationism by literally a search-replace creation/design word switch, a movement mostly made up of creationists who believe in special creation rather than common ancestry, a movement devoted to challenging evolution, a movement which to this day is after the public schools, which we nevertheless are supposed to think of as a movement obviously different from creationism, and any disagreement raising any of these points is just “worldview blindness.” Yeah, right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This argument might give you some inkling about why ID has failed so spectacularly in the scientific community, the press, and the courts. Evading evidence with hair-splitting and arbitrary, convenient re-defining terms does not get you very far in any long-term, informed discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few posts later, the thread was summarily closed, and a post later added by TC accusing me of lying and other reprehensibles.  Too bad.  With a bit more time, I might have clarified that I was simply describing his argument that he was right about the differentness of creationism and ID, despite him saying that even if I was right about all the historical facts (which are undeniable), I would still be wrong about asserting that ID was a form of creationism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about the thread was that TC’s original proposal was that people who thought ID was a form of creationism were suffering from “worldview blindness” – immune to any counterevidence.  Yet when some of the counterevidence to his position was raised, Thinking Christian first insisted that he was right, whatever the evidence showed, and then shut down the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this thread is an example of how the ID movement hurts its own potential supporters.  Anyone who takes seriously the Discovery Institute’s pronouncements about “the” definition of ID and nope-no-way-its-creationism is being set up for a fairly painful and embarassing fall.  Even if their confidence in their own position survives, think about how it looks to a neutral observer or someone new to the debate.  Basically, TC had to argue “ignore everything that happened 2005 or before, ID is defined by the Discovery Institute’s current definition” – whereas I was able to roll out cdesign proponentsists and the rest.  It’s quite a pickle they’re in, and avoiding the issue by ignoring it only works in press releases and very short news clips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s the big damn deal with all of this 2012 hysteria?  Supposedly it has to do with the Mayan calendar, specifically one version called the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Long_Count_Calendar"&gt;Long Count calendar&lt;/a&gt;, which is set to end and reset on Dec. 12, 2012 on the Western calendar (much like how our Western calendar resets from Dec. 31 to Jan. 1 every year).  And for this reason, a number of nutty New Agers are going crazy about “cosmic alignments” and how this will result in all manner of horrendous things for humanity… you know, the typical doomsday junk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what makes all of this truly hilarious is what &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; Mayans (yes, there are still some around) say when you ask them about all of this 2012 nonsense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091011/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_mexico_apocalypse2012"&gt;2012 isn’t the end of the world, Mayans insist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091011/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_mexico_apocalypse2012"&gt;&lt;img title="mayan" src="http://d.yimg.com/a/p/ap/20091010/capt.3728977169824fadaf26ae4a630d85fe.mexico_apocalypse_2012_gua301.jpg?x=229&amp;amp;y=345&amp;amp;q=85&amp;amp;sig=jd2T4Ra0dnogwp8QXgO_xg--" alt="" width="229" height="344"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apolinario Chile Pixtun is tired of being bombarded with frantic questions about the &lt;span style="border-bottom:1px dashed #0066cc"&gt;Mayan calendar&lt;/span&gt; supposedly “running out” on Dec. 21, 2012. After all, it’s not the end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely not, the Mayan Indian elder insists. “I came back from England last year and, man, they had me fed up with this stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can only get worse for him. Next month Hollywood’s “2012″ opens in cinemas, featuring earthquakes, &lt;span style="background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;meteor showers&lt;/span&gt; and a tsunami dumping an aircraft carrier on the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Cornell University, &lt;span style="background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;Ann Martin&lt;/span&gt;, who runs the “Curious? Ask an Astronomer” Web site, says people are scared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s too bad that we’re getting e-mails from fourth-graders who are saying that they’re too young to die,” Martin said. “We had a mother of two young children who was afraid she wouldn’t live to see them grow up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile Pixtun, a Guatemalan, says the doomsday theories spring from Western, not Mayan ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Another piece of evidence which suggests that the Mayans never bought into this 2012 b.s. is the fact that their calendar references dates far past the year 2012, which would seem to be at odds with the notion of the end of humanity…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spooky, perhaps, but Bernal notes there are other inscriptions at Mayan sites for dates far beyond 2012 — including one that roughly translates into the year 4772.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if the Mayans themselves didn’t ever buy into any of these apocalyptic visions which are so busy running around the Internet and, soon, in the movies, why are people getting themselves so freaked out?  It seems as if the long-standing notion of the end-of-the-world from Western Christianity is being transplanted upon other cultures as the traditional doomsday scenarios fail to pan out…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernal suggests that apocalypse is “a very Western, Christian” concept projected onto the Maya, perhaps because Western myths are “exhausted.” …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Westerners have been trying for more than a century to pin doomsday scenarios on the Maya. And while fascinated by ancient lore, advocates seldom examine more recent experiences with apocalypse predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No one who’s writing in now seems to remember that the last time we thought the world was going to end, it didn’t,” says Martin, the astronomy webmaster. “There doesn’t seem to be a lot of memory that things were fine the last time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that last point bears repeating: what is the common feature of every single doomsday, apocalyptic, or end-of-the-world scenario?  They’ve all been &lt;em&gt;dead wrong&lt;/em&gt;, because we’re still here, folks  &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what the source of the End Times prediction, these predictions have always clearly been wrong.  And before the prediction of humanity’s destruction has failed to pan out, time after time, the true believers in the prophecy have always had what they considered “iron clad evidence” that proved it would happen.  And, again, every single time &lt;em&gt;they’ve been wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, take a look at the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/appendix3.html"&gt;list of failed end-of-the-world predictions at James Randi’s Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult &amp;amp; Supernatural.&lt;/a&gt; It’s a pretty exhaustive list, folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to give the last word to the article I’ve been referencing in this blog post, as it does a really good job of putting all of this 2012 silliness into a realistic context…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I went to some Mayan-speaking communities and asked people what is going to happen in 2012, they wouldn’t have any idea,” said Jose Huchim, a Yucatan Mayan archaeologist. “That the world is going to end? They wouldn’t believe you. &lt;strong&gt;We have real concerns these days, like rain.&lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&amp;#39;m planning to set my work aside for a while and fix a bowl of hot soup — it&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;cold&lt;/i&gt; here, with a snow storm on the way — and see if they actually do it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First half hour wasn't bad: nice overview of the practice of finding old bones, and a good illustration of the fragmentary nature of the fossil. At the same time, though, it's also doing a good job of showing how they know the pieces of Ardi are from a single individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S l o w i n g   d o w n. So far this program is taking longer to watch than it took me to read the original papers. It&amp;#39;s got some nicely done bits, but it sure is taking it&amp;#39;s time, and it&amp;#39;s annoyingly repetitive. It&amp;#39;s also got &lt;i&gt;commercials&lt;/i&gt;, and the frequency of commercial breaks is steadily increasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought we Americans were supposed to have short attention spans. How is this sort of drawn out programming supposed to appeal to the average person with a general interest in evolution?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/discovering_ardi.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/bkU3T0GQShA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255311114592"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4436">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/63310457c0c7bf7b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Assault on Science" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="discoveryinstitute" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Discovery Institute"/><title type="html">IDiots can&amp;#39;t read.</title><published>2009-10-12T01:14:57Z</published><updated>2009-10-12T01:21:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/10/idiots-cant-rea.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is discussed in an &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/10/darwins-darkest.html#comment-195512" rel=""&gt;earlier comment thread&lt;/a&gt; but I thought I’d promote it.  The Disco ‘Tute is in a swivet over the California Science Center’s cancellation of a showing of &lt;em&gt;Darwin’s Dilemma&lt;/em&gt;, the latest excretion of Illustrata Media, producer of the late unlamented &lt;em&gt;Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed (at the Disco ‘Tute)&lt;/em&gt;.  Disco Dancer Robert Crowther, of course, attributes the cancellation to the machinations of the Loyal Order of Dogmatic Darwin Conspirators.  However, &lt;a href="http://www.antievolution.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?s=4ad0ec2ba5123627;act=ST;f=14;t=6497" rel="external "&gt;Doc Bill of antievolution.org&lt;/a&gt; has the story.  In its glee about the showing, the ‘Tuters issued a press release that strongly implied that the Science Center and Smithsonian are somehow involved in the film’s premiere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there may be some question about whether the press release actually violated the Science Center’s contract with the ostensible sponsor of the showing, the &lt;a href="http://www.americanfreedomalliance.org/" rel="external "&gt;American Freedom Alliance&lt;/a&gt; – IANAL, and don’t know the connection, if any, between AFA and the Disco ‘Tute.  However, the first sentence of the Disco ‘Tute’s &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS135002+05-Oct-2009+PRN20091005" rel="external "&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; says &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate over Darwin will come to California on October 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, when the Smithsonian Institution’s west coast affiliate premieres Darwin’s Dilemma: The Mystery of the Cambrian Fossil Record, a new intelligent design film which challenges Darwinian evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That plainly says it’s the Smithsonian that’s doing the premiering.  And that’s flatly false.  It’s the institutional version of &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/09/science-non-sci.html" rel=""&gt;inflationary credentialism&lt;/a&gt;, one of the hallmarks of pseudoscience.  Note that the press release also identifies Stephen Meyer as a scientist, more inflationary credentialism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synopsis&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Long-winded Libertarians lead the fight against an extra-terrestrial insectish species in this 1983 sci-fi novel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had such high hopes for this book. Its cover promised all sorts of awesome. And then, I discovered the author &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708480/"&gt;wrote the Star Trek “Trouble with Tribbles” episode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheezy cover! History of Tribbles! Silly rhyming title!  (War/Chtorr)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, it was not to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most &lt;a title="Insect version of Plan 9 Outer space" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2007/06/21/cicada-summer/"&gt;sci-fi&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a title="warrior bees. Bleah." href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2007/07/16/goddess-blessed-bees-as-a-plot-device/"&gt;fantasy&lt;/a&gt; books I’ve reviewed here, the biology is a bit muddled.  Although, really. When you have a post-apocalyptic world invaded by aliens, who’s going to quibble about a little bad biology?&lt;br&gt;
(Well, besides me, anyway?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chtorr are described as insects in several places, but also as having “purple skin and varicolored fur.”  Or as “giant, pink, fur-covered caterpillars.”  Or “a large, purple and red, man-eating caterpillar.”  An eye-witness account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It was huge! Nearly twice the length of a man, bright red and more than a meter thick at the head! Its eyes were black and lidless. It reared up into the air and waved its arms and made that chirruping sound again; its mouth was a flashing maw. “&lt;/em&gt;Chtorr&lt;em&gt;!” it cried. “&lt;/em&gt;Chtorrrrrr&lt;em&gt;!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the Chtorr are foreshadowing &lt;a href="http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2009/07/the-best-worst-of-lady-gaga-fashion/"&gt;Lady Gaga’s&lt;/a&gt; wardrobe and career?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998 the world is destroyed by a series of plagues, and only a few Americans are left. They are gathered into “re-education” locations and given mandatory civics classes on the duties of citizens in this new world.  Apparently, those classes make an impression, because fully &lt;strong&gt;one third of this 397 page book&lt;/strong&gt; is the main character flashing back to high school discussions of wealth redistribution and federal abuse of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is just about as fascinating as you would expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a shame, because the fundamental concept of the book (which you figure out when you FINALLY arrive at page 213) is centered around &lt;a href="http://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/"&gt;invasive species&lt;/a&gt; displacing the native inhabitants of Earth’s ecosystems. Aliens are terraforming the Earth by ecological invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a brilliant thing to build a novel around!  The invaders are more competitive ecologically. Alien plants change the light transmittance and oxygen level in water.  Alien insecty-things become the top predators in their new ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add to that the invaders can only be killed by fire or explosives, and you’ve got a firecracker of a book.&lt;br&gt;
Um, unless you bog it down with tedious discussions of what money is, and how the state and individual power balance is maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portrayal of women in this book just adds to the Dismal.  All but one of the female characters in the book are “comfort women.” In fact, a topic covered in that high school civics class is the duty of all hotties under 18 to put out for the betterment of humankind.  Not the most enlightened future society, but if you’re going to kill everyone, I guess stockpiling nubile young women as well as weapons is to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

So upset was he, that he filed a complaint with the NSW Health Care Complaints Commission, a government body that keeps track of and prosecutes based on claims of malfeasance regarding medical issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;So what was Joseph Ierano's complaint? He's upset that the Australian Skeptics republished an article by TAMLondon speaker Simon Singh. He sent Australian Skeptics a very detailed list of questions based on the article, even though they were merely reprinting it and not the original authors. When he hadn't received an answer in two weeks, he filed his complaint. In fact, a very detailed response was sent three weeks after the original request by Ierano.</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255306920676"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/michele_bachmann_you_lie.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7c7613566dc13e0c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Michele Bachmann"/><title type="html">Michele Bachmann:  YOU LIE!!!!</title><published>2009-10-12T01:14:53Z</published><updated>2009-10-12T01:14:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/p9cV4X-dVyY/michele_bachmann_you_lie.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/michele_bachmann_you_lie.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of the DNC via &lt;a href="http://dumpbachmann.blogspot.com/2009/10/call-michele-bachmann-out-on-her-lies.html"&gt;DMB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So to follow up here&amp;#39;s another new paper on a similar topic: religion and volunteering.Religious people do more voluntary work than non-religious people.  According to a June 2009 Canadian report, the 15% people who go to Church every week make up 26% of the volunteer workforce.It&amp;#39;s difficult to figure out exactly why this should be. Is it spiritual beliefs? The evidence I put up in my previous post, linking religious beliefs to a small increase in work ethic, might make lead you to think so. Religious people get an extra reward from volunteering (they usually believe they&amp;#39;ll get some kind of bonus from their God): that makes it more attractive.But maybe it&amp;#39;s cultural. Religious people tend to swim in a sea of &amp;#39;volunteerism&amp;#39;, so volunteering might simply be something that&amp;#39;s expected of them by their peers. They also get more opportunities to volunteer, by virtue of being plugged into a ready-made volunteer network.In contrast, non-religious people might be excluded from volunteering because (especially in a religious society), many opportunities for volunteering come with a lot of religious baggage. That can be a turn-off for the non-religious.The new study, by Bianca Suanet and colleagues at VU University in the Netherlands, is interesting because it takes a fresh angle on the problem (VU University, by the way, has its historical roots as a Christian university).They looked at two samples of Dutch people, a set who were around 60 years old in 1992, and a set of people who turned 60 in around 2002. In other words, the second set of people was born 10 years later.They found that 43% of people who were 60 in 1992 did voluntary work, but this had dropped to 37% of those who were 60 in 2002. A small drop, but statistically significant.Next they looked at the factors that might explain the drop. Most had no effect: it didn&amp;#39;t matter whether they were employed, had a father who was a church member, had a mother who did volunteer work, or had well educated parents.What did matter is their own level of education - highly educated people were 2.7 times more likely to volunteer than people with low education levels. That might be, of course, because highly educated people tend to also have high levels of self-motivation. But presumably the psychological characteristics of the cohorts were the same, which suggests that it&amp;#39;s a direct effect of education on volunteerism.And the other factor that made a difference was religious involvement. People who had religious beliefs but didn&amp;#39;t go to Church were not more likely to volunteer. But people who did go to Church were.For religious non-Christians and Catholics, the effect was impressive - they were over 2.5 times more likely to volunteer than the non-religious. But for practising Calvinists, the effect was dramatic - they were 4.7 times more likely to volunteer.Now, the actual effects of religion remain pretty small. Overall, they could explain only 16% of the variation among individuals. And religion is only a fraction of that (it&amp;#39;s pretty hard to tell from the stats they present, but it probably explains about 5-10% of the variability). It&amp;#39;s small, but it&amp;#39;s there.So in light of this, there&amp;#39;s one other fascinating fact that comes out from the study. It turns out that, after controlling for all the other factors (including the increase in their education levels and the loss of religious belief), the more recent set of &amp;#39;oldies&amp;#39; were actually more likely to be volunteers.In other words, the decline in religion causes a negative hit on volunteering. That&amp;#39;s made up for a bit by the increase in education. But there&amp;#39;s something else going on that&amp;#39;s increasing volunteering.And that something may well be cultural. To me, it seems likely that Dutch society is reinventing itself as religion becomes increasingly marginalised. Whereas religion and volunteering were once intimately connected, now volunteering is something for non-believers as well (incidentally, this is reflected in the constitution of VU University itself, which transformed itself in the 1960s from a religious university to a secular, state funded one).So a secular future may not mean a future without volunteers. And the good news from Canada is that this is probably the case.Canada, like other Western nations, has seen plummeting religious participation (Statistics Canada). And volunteering went down from 191 hours per person in 1987 to 149 hours in 1997 (here&amp;#39;s the 1997 report). But the last report shows an uptick, with volunteer rates climbing to 166 hours in 2007.I think that the take-home from this is that religion probably does stimulate volunteering. But religion is not the only way to achieve this, and it&amp;#39;s probably not the best, either._______________________________________________________________________________________Suanet, B., Broese van Groenou, M., &amp;amp; Braam, A.

In a moment of abandon, Ilsa returns to her lover's arms only to later change her mind and choose the more stable life she would have with her long-term partner.  But what if something as simple as a pill had caused Ilsa to feel differently and make the opposite choice?

In a new paper in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution biologists Alexandra Alvergne and Virpi Lummaa at the University of Sheffield in England raise the possibility that taking the birth control pill could affect a woman's choice of who she chooses to have sex with as well as her choice of a long-term partner.  Could modern reproductive technology cause women in Ilsa's position to make a choice they might later regret?

Of course &lt;a href="http://www.empowher.com/news/herarticle/2009/10/09/cervarix-did-not-cause-british-girls-death"&gt;we learnt&lt;/a&gt; soon after that Natalie Morton had a malignant chest tumour but that was after the vaccination programme had taken a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this furore really leads to a conducive atmosphere in which we can talk about possibly extending the vaccination to boys, but I’ll give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week the British Medical Journal published &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/oct08_2/b3884"&gt; a study into the cost-effectiveness &lt;/a&gt; (or not) of extending the HPV vaccine programme to boys as well as girls. Of course, cervical cancer is not the only cancer associated with HPV 16 and 18, which the Cervarix vaccine covers, but also vulvar, vaginal, and oropharyngeal, anal, and oral cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccine would therefore not only have direct health benefits for males but also to indirect health benefits (for sexual partners) through reduced transmission of HPV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear (&lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/10/jabs-as-bad-as-the-cancer/"&gt;unlike the Sunday Express&lt;/a&gt;) this was research done in the US on Gardasil not on Cervarix which is being rolled out in the UK. There has however, been similar research in the UK by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation which lead to the current recommendation that the vaccination programme should only cover girls (cost-effectiveness of vaccine to girls &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/jul17_2/a769"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BMJ research continued that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given currently available information, including boys in an HPV vaccination programme generally exceeds conventional thresholds of good value for money, even under favourable conditions of vaccine protection and health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put simply, there would not be enough benefit from boys being vaccinated to make the extension to the programme value for money. What is interesting is that it does highlight where a pure cost-effectiveness analysis can miss important social policy aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British Medical Association voted at its last Annual Representative Meeting (not a hotbed of radical feminism) &lt;a href="http://news.scotsman.com/cancerinchildren/Boys-39should-be-vaccinated39-in.5425635.jp"&gt; for the vaccine to be rolled out to boys &lt;/a&gt;as well as girls. The arguments did not rest only on the effectiveness of the extended coverage but also on the impact that limiting the vaccine to girls – namely, that both men and women should take responsibility for eradicating HPV from the population rather than women taking sole responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not just a political point or an abstract notion of ‘fairness’, it is also a public health one. Due largely to the risk of pregnancy, women routinely &lt;a href="http://www.fhi.org/en/rh/pubs/network/v18_3/nw183ch1.htm"&gt; take more responsibility for sexual health &lt;/a&gt;then men (I won't go into it here, but this still has implications for lesbian and gay people). Therefore, gender discrimination and inequality impacts on sexually transmitted infections when for example, women are not in a position to insist on condom use. This is not just the role of sexual or public health education, our systems and programmes need to support the principle of men and women taking responsibility for sexual health matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo spawned the ‘&lt;a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/population/conference/"&gt;Cairo Consensus&lt;/a&gt;' which acknowledged the need to increase male responsibility for family planning and recommended expanding services in ways that protect the reproductive health of both men and women. However, cost is always going to be a barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I’m accused of being in the pocket of Big Pharma on this one (er, unlikely) it is important to acknowledge the well-founded concerns regarding &lt;a href="http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/Gardasil-Could-Be-Effective--but-Aggressive-Marketing-Raises-Ethical-Concerns-23147-1/"&gt;Merck’s aggressive marketing of Gardasil&lt;/a&gt; in the US and the suspicion that Merck would be behind any extension to the vaccination programme. Believe me the last thing I want to do is contribute to Merck’s profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not arguing that Cervarix should definitely be rolled out to boys as well as girls, simply that (rather ironically) focusing on evidence-based medicine can be overly simplistic if it fails to take into account important social factors and the cumulative impact of focusing sexual health interventions on women and girls. I also acknowledge the economic need to ration health care and that cost-benefit analyses are important but necessarily cannot factor in every eventuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccine policy based on QALYs alone? Unfortunately society's a bit more complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;

One complaint is that they&amp;#39;re forever lurking about getting drunk. Now Erling Moxnes and Lene Jensen have come up with a rather radical proposal based on the idea that teenagers often don&amp;#39;t mean to get as drunk as they do. According to the researchers, teenagers frequently over-inebriate because they fail to take account of the stomach delay - the fact that alcohol continues to enter the blood-steam long after a person stops drinking.Moxnes and Jensen challenged fifty-five 16 and 17-year-olds to achieve a specific blood alcohol concentration level using a personalised computer simulation of the drinking process. The programme asked the teenagers to choose how many bottles of beer to consume each fifteen minutes, whilst giving them periodic feedback on their current blood alcohol level. The simulation had a built in stomach delay of either 22.5 minutes (fairly average for a typical person) or 4.5 minutes.As the researchers expected, the teenagers massively over-shot the required blood alcohol level, especially when using the simulator with a longer stomach delay. Just as they likely do in real life, the teenagers merely used current feedback of blood alcohol level to inform their decision about how much more to drink. They completely failed to take into account that the blood alcohol level would continue to rise for some time without further intake.So can youngsters be taught to take account of the stomach delay? A group of students given an advance explanation of the stomach delay performed no better than their peers. However, information about the delay plus the chance to see an advance simulation of the stomach delay (based on a drinking mouse!) did significantly improve the performance of another group, such that they over-shot far less when they completed the simulator challenge.Moxnes and Jensen said their approach holds great promise - many of their teenage participants reported occasions when they&amp;#39;d gotten far more drunk than they intended, 98 per cent said they found the experiment interesting and 87 per cent said it would make a great teaching tool.Another implication of these findings it that the folk advice to never go out drinking on an empty stomach may not be so wise after all. It&amp;#39;s sensible for people who intend to drink a fixed amount but not for people intending to drink until they reach a desired level of inebriation. &amp;quot;Here we show that it may not be sound advice for inexperienced juveniles that drink according to a simple feedback strategy,&amp;quot; the researchers said. &amp;quot;Drinking on a full stomach massively extends the stomach delay, thereby making it much harder to manage one&amp;#39;s blood alcohol level. _________________________________Moxnes E, &amp;amp; Jensen L (2009).

However, it is - of course - a bit more complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should declare an interest from the outset - I am a shade over six feet tall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, by Deaton and Arora in &lt;i&gt;Economics and Human Biology&lt;/i&gt; looked at phone survey data (in America) from over 454,000 adults who were asked their height and to evaluate their lives on a ladder scale. Top of the ladder is 'the best possible life for you' and bottom is 'the worse possible life for you'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that, overall, people who are above average height (5'10" for men and 5'4" for women) put themselves higher on the ladder than people below average height. The finding applied to all demographic and ethnic groups. The difference is more marked between tall and short men than it is with women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tall people reported that they experience more enjoyment and happiness, less pain and sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they reported &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; stress and anger; taller women also worry more. There is a noticeable increase in the stress levels reported by tall people, with tall women suffering more. So life is not all rosy for lankies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, the study reports, a very close correlation between height, income and education although the reasons for this are not known. Income has &lt;i&gt;strong beneficial effects on all outcomes&lt;/i&gt;, it says. It would appear that it's not being taller per se that makes people happier but the benefits that accrue from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that tall people earn more has been known for some time, so there's nothing new there. A real weakness of the survey is that people were asked during just one phone call how they had felt on the previous day - which is very unlikely to give an accurate assessment of how they feel about their lives in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research does not uncover if there is a cut-off point beyond which increasing height gives diminishing happiness returns. For example, one man had his job offer as an air traffic controller withdrawn when it was found that, at 6'10", he was too tall to fit under the fixed desk. Beyond a certain height, buying clothes becomes difficult and expensive, there is never enough leg room, desks and beds don't fit, back ache and joint problems become common and regular people start to act like they're at a freak show. None of this contributes to general contentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, one finding of the research is that people who put themselves right at the top of the ladder and say their lives are 'the best possible' are slightly shorter than average. Deaton and Arora say that perhaps the 8% of people at the top 'are different in some other respect'.

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the Telegraph, Express, Mirror and Mail do ignore them. Brownie points to the BBC for including them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the conclusion is that taller people are happier with their lives than most short people, but not all of them and not in all areas. In other words, being tall is a bit of a mixed blessing. Probably. No shit, Sherlock.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course &lt;a href="http://www.empowher.com/news/herarticle/2009/10/09/cervarix-did-not-cause-british-girls-death"&gt;we learnt&lt;/a&gt; soon after that Natalie Morton had a malignant chest tumour but that was after the vaccination programme had taken a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this furore really leads to a conducive atmosphere in which we can talk about possibly extending the vaccination to boys, but I’ll give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week the British Medical Journal published &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/oct08_2/b3884"&gt; a study into the cost-effectiveness &lt;/a&gt; (or not) of extending the HPV vaccine programme to boys as well as girls. Of course, cervical cancer is not the only cancer associated with HPV 16 and 18, which the Cervarix vaccine covers, but also vulvar, vaginal, and oropharyngeal, anal, and oral cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccine would therefore not only have direct health benefits for males but also to indirect health benefits (for sexual partners) through reduced transmission of HPV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear (&lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/10/jabs-as-bad-as-the-cancer/"&gt;unlike the Sunday Express&lt;/a&gt;) this was research done in the US on Gardasil not on Cervarix which is being rolled out in the UK. There has however, been similar research in the UK by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation which lead to the current recommendation that the vaccination programme should only cover girls (cost-effectiveness of vaccine to girls &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/jul17_2/a769"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BMJ research continued that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given currently available information, including boys in an HPV vaccination programme generally exceeds conventional thresholds of good value for money, even under favourable conditions of vaccine protection and health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put simply, there would not be enough benefit from boys being vaccinated to make the extension to the programme value for money. What is interesting is that it does highlight where a pure cost-effectiveness analysis can miss important social policy aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British Medical Association voted at its last Annual Representative Meeting (not a hotbed of radical feminism) &lt;a href="http://news.scotsman.com/cancerinchildren/Boys-39should-be-vaccinated39-in.5425635.jp"&gt; for the vaccine to be rolled out to boys &lt;/a&gt;as well as girls. The arguments did not rest only on the effectiveness of the extended coverage but also on the impact that limiting the vaccine to girls – namely, that both men and women should take responsibility for eradicating HPV from the population rather than women taking sole responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not just a political point or an abstract notion of ‘fairness’, it is also a public health one. Due largely to the risk of pregnancy, women routinely &lt;a href="http://www.fhi.org/en/rh/pubs/network/v18_3/nw183ch1.htm"&gt; take more responsibility for sexual health &lt;/a&gt;then men (I won't go into it here, but this still has implications for lesbian and gay people). Therefore, gender discrimination and inequality impacts on sexually transmitted infections when for example, women are not in a position to insist on condom use. This is not just the role of sexual or public health education, our systems and programmes need to support the principle of men and women taking responsibility for sexual health matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo spawned the ‘&lt;a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/population/conference/"&gt;Cairo Consensus&lt;/a&gt;' which acknowledged the need to increase male responsibility for family planning and recommended expanding services in ways that protect the reproductive health of both men and women. However, cost is always going to be a barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I’m accused of being in the pocket of Big Pharma on this one (er, unlikely) it is important to acknowledge the well-founded concerns regarding &lt;a href="http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/Gardasil-Could-Be-Effective--but-Aggressive-Marketing-Raises-Ethical-Concerns-23147-1/"&gt;Merck’s aggressive marketing of Gardasil&lt;/a&gt; in the US and the suspicion that Merck would be behind any extension to the vaccination programme. Believe me the last thing I want to do is contribute to Merck’s profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not arguing that Cervarix should definitely be rolled out to boys as well as girls, simply that (rather ironically) focusing on evidence-based medicine can be overly simplistic if it fails to take into account important social factors and the cumulative impact of focusing sexual health interventions on women and girls. I also acknowledge the economic need to ration health care and that cost-benefit analyses are important but necessarily cannot factor in every eventuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccine policy based on QALYs alone? Unfortunately society's a bit more complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;

However, it is - of course - a bit more complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should declare an interest from the outset - I am a shade over six feet tall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, by Deaton and Arora in &lt;i&gt;Economics and Human Biology&lt;/i&gt; looked at phone survey data (in America) from over 454,000 adults who were asked their height and to evaluate their lives on a ladder scale. Top of the ladder is 'the best possible life for you' and bottom is 'the worse possible life for you'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that, overall, people who are above average height (5'10" for men and 5'4" for women) put themselves higher on the ladder than people below average height. The finding applied to all demographic and ethnic groups. The difference is more marked between tall and short men than it is with women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tall people reported that they experience more enjoyment and happiness, less pain and sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they reported &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; stress and anger; taller women also worry more. There is a noticeable increase in the stress levels reported by tall people, with tall women suffering more. So life is not all rosy for lankies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, the study reports, a very close correlation between height, income and education although the reasons for this are not known. Income has &lt;i&gt;strong beneficial effects on all outcomes&lt;/i&gt;, it says. It would appear that it's not being taller per se that makes people happier but the benefits that accrue from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that tall people earn more has been known for some time, so there's nothing new there. A real weakness of the survey is that people were asked during just one phone call how they had felt on the previous day - which is very unlikely to give an accurate assessment of how they feel about their lives in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research does not uncover if there is a cut-off point beyond which increasing height gives diminishing happiness returns. For example, one man had his job offer as an air traffic controller withdrawn when it was found that, at 6'10", he was too tall to fit under the fixed desk. Beyond a certain height, buying clothes becomes difficult and expensive, there is never enough leg room, desks and beds don't fit, back ache and joint problems become common and regular people start to act like they're at a freak show. None of this contributes to general contentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, one finding of the research is that people who put themselves right at the top of the ladder and say their lives are 'the best possible' are slightly shorter than average. Deaton and Arora say that perhaps the 8% of people at the top 'are different in some other respect'. Newspaper headlines can ignore them but they are annoying outliers that spoil the nice clean results and cannot be glossed over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the Telegraph, Express, Mirror and Mail do ignore them. Brownie points to the BBC for including them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the conclusion is that taller people are happier with their lives than most short people, but not all of them and not in all areas. In other words, being tall is a bit of a mixed blessing. Probably. No shit, Sherlock.&lt;/p&gt;

The mortality rate is quite low----even at it's worst, flu mortality rarely goes about 1-2%, as it did in the 1918 pandemic.  But this flu is attacking a very large number of people; 1% of a large number is still a large number.  For a low mortality rate to reflect large numbers, a disease has to hit a lot of people.  If you can lower that number significantly, the mortality rate remains the same, but fewer cases will be reflected in fewer deaths.  Since this flu tends to hit the young and otherwise healthy, the deaths from swine flu may disproportionately affect the young.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, pediatric mortality from the flu is at twice the level usual for this time of year, and rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;      &lt;i&gt;Click to embiggen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, we have a way to reduce the number of cases, thereby reducing the number of  deaths.  Vaccination reduces deaths from the flu in two ways---by reducing the overall number of cases, and by reducing the severity of cases in people who get the disease despite being vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may look at the national data and think, &amp;quot;Well, less than 150 kids have been killed by the flu so far this year.  That doesn&amp;#39;t seem like anything to be alarmed about.&amp;quot;  As a parent, I&amp;#39;m alarmed.  Presumably, none of these dead children had been vaccinated---the swine flu vaccine is not yet widely available and most of these cases were swine flu.  Think of the hundreds of other deaths we can actually prevent with vaccination this year.  There are potentially hundreds of more children who will die of the flu this year, not because it is more virulent, but because it is more common.  We can reduce this number with one simple intervention.  Do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/whats_the_harm_pediatric_flu_d.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/2GA0Gx_jqT4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255292587338"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=1627">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/987f9604160ff016</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Paranormal"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Technology"/><category term="You Tube"/><category term="binary"/><category term="Brain to Brain"/><category term="cybernetics"/><category term="cyborg"/><category term="EEG"/><category term="electronics"/><category term="ESP"/><category term="Kevin Warwick"/><category term="news"/><category term="studies"/><category term="University of Southhampton"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">Brain To Brain Communication (With No Mention Of ESP, Mind)</title><published>2009-10-11T18:34:26Z</published><updated>2009-10-11T18:34:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/LherydM3x1c/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/2009/10/brain-to-brain-communication-with-no-mention-of-esp-mind/"/><content xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have already zipped out an email regarding this one to a friend who has done research on ESP tasks - this, however, appears to be more about EEG amplifiers being used to transmit binary signals. So don’t get too excited, oh fans of the para-fantastical!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2009/oct/09_135.shtml"&gt;Dr Christopher James from the University’s Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, from the University of Southhampton, “&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2009/oct/09_135.shtml"&gt;Communicating person to person through the power of thought alone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2009/oct/09_135.shtml"&gt;“:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr James comments: “Whilst BCI is no longer a new thing and person to person communication via the nervous system was shown previously in work by Professor Kevin Warwick from the University of Reading, here we show, for the first time, true brain to brain interfacing. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay - I’m going to stop quoting at this point and direct you to &lt;a href="http://www.kevinwarwick.com/Cyborg1.htm"&gt;Prof Kevin Warwick’s work - the Cyborg 1.0 site&lt;/a&gt;, in particular. Yes, I bet you thought that Doctor Who had some interesting cyberman-action going on for all those years in a fictional sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do note, however - last updated? &lt;em&gt;2005&lt;/em&gt;. Back to the original press release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have yet to grasp the full implications of this but there are various scenarios where B2B could be of benefit such as helping people with severe debilitating muscle wasting diseases, or with the so-called ‘locked-in’ syndrome, to communicate and it also has applications for gaming.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;…While attached to an EEG amplifier, the first person would generate and transmit a series of binary digits, imagining moving their left arm for zero and their right arm for one. The second person was also attached to an EEG amplifier and their PC would pick up the stream of binary digits and flash an LED lamp at two different frequencies, one for zero and the other one for one. The pattern of the flashing LEDS is too subtle to be picked by the second person, but it is picked up by electrodes measuring the visual cortex of the recipient. The encoded information is then extracted from the brain activity of the second user and the PC can decipher whether a zero or a one was transmitted. This shows true brain-to-brain activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the YouTube video, supplied with that press release - enjoy:&lt;/p&gt;

She drunk anti freeze and waved an advance directive in the face of the doctors when she was pushed into the ER. It said (1):14/09/2007 To whom this may concern  If I come into hospital regarding an overdose or any attempt of my life, I would like for NO life saving treatment to be given. I would appreciate it if you could continue to give medicines to help relieve my discomfort, painkillers, oxygen etc. I would hope these wishes would be carried out without loads of questioning.  Please be assured that I am 100% aware of the consequences of this and the probable outcome of drinking antifreeze, eg death in 95-99% of cases and if I survive then kidney failure, I understand and accept them and will take 100% responsibility for this decision.  I am aware that you may think that because I called the ambulance I therefore want treatment, THIS IS NOT THE CASE! I do however want to be comfortable as nobody wants to die alone and scared and without going into details there are loads of reasons I do not want to die at home which I realise you will not understand and I apologise for this.  Please understand that I definitely don't want any form of ventilation, resuscitation or dialysis. These are my wishes please respect and carry them out.  Yours sincerely  Kerrie WooltortonThe Mental Health Act 2005, is a very complicated bit of law, under which this case was dealt with. In summary, the law stated that a person with mental capability to deny treatment must not be given any, and if give the treating doctor would be charged with assault. Now if you are Greg House (the TV show doc... remember him?) you can get away with it, but in the real world, things spin to a different tune.Apparently, Ms. Wooltorton had been treated as many as 9 times the previous year for similar incidents of consuming anti freeze. However, this time, when she was rolled into the ER, she was conscious, and she shoved in an advance directive, putting the doctors in a fix (2).Now, the whole thing has cleared up, Ms Wooltorton has died, the doctor has been patted on the back for his law savvy attitude, etc. etc. etc. But what still bothers me is that does this type of directive provide suicidal patients the "way out"? Or maybe patients considering euthanasia (here we go again. Off on my favorite ethics topic). I don't know about the UK scene, but in India, suicide attempts are punishable by law. Here it is (3):                                                                       Section 309. Attempt to commit suicide                      Whoever attempts to commit suicide and does any act towards the commission of such offence, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for term which may extend to one year 1[ or with fine, or with both].                           1. Subs. by Act 8 of 1882, sec.7, for "and shall also be liable to fine".And granting an advance directive after suicidal attempts seems to my simple mind to clash with that law above.So what is the way out? I believe in the sanctity of life. I believe that suicidal patients should not be let to die (maybe because I lost a dear friend that way). I believe that granting validity to such advance directives ti suicidal people are BS! The simple way out could be to consider the Advance Directive such as this null and void (oh come on, can't you see the woman is trying her best to kill herself off in that advance directive of hers?) when there is suspicion of suicidal attempt.Either ways, I'd hate to be Kerrie Wooltorton's doctor...References:1. http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Living-Will-Of-Suicide-Victim-Kerrie-Wooltorton---Andrew-Jones-Of-Mackrell-Turner-Garrett-Explains/Article/2009101153970732. http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2009/10/01/sheila-mclean-on-advance-directives-and-the-case-of-kerrie-wooltorton/3. http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/IndianPenalCode/S309.htmDyer, C.

It really does have a supercharging effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, mere infringement of copyright is not a criminal act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are indeed criminal sanctions contained in the relevant UK legislation: the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. These are generally in respect of the wrongful distribution of copyright material, usually on some commercial basis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the private end user copying a copyright work for personal use is not a criminal; he or she is not a thief; their wrongful act is not theft. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Tim O'Reilly has pointed out, &lt;a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/2425"&gt; the right term is copyright infringement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this point, the vested interests - showing their legal illiteracy - will suggest that I am suggesting that it is somehow alright to infringe copyright.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not. An infringement of copyright is still wrong; more precisely it is &lt;em&gt;a wrong&lt;/em&gt;, for copyright infringement is a &lt;em&gt;tort&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;a wrong&lt;/em&gt; is what the word &lt;em&gt;tort&lt;/em&gt; actually means.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course someone committing a tort - the wonderful legal word is &lt;em&gt;tortfeasor&lt;/em&gt; - should pay compensation, just as the negligent driver pays compensation to a victim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do not support copyright infringement any more that I support negligent driving; but just because it is a wrong, it doesn't mean you can pretend it is also a criminal offence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the compensation should correspond to the money lost had the tort not been committed, which for copyright infringement will be the equivalent of a licence fee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many people would, I suspect, happily (correct meaning) pay an appropriate licence fee for using copyright material, if only the media content providers would make the works more easily available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The media content providers are wedded to a commercial model which means they want to pick and choose when to make content available to the public; but the technology and ease of file replication is against them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It cannot be a pleasant experience, but they are not being set upon by a band of thieves; they are instead suffering a mass tresspass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have written before that &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2008/10/on-history-of-music.html"&gt; making money out of recorded music&lt;/a&gt; may well turn out to be a hundred year blip in the millennia of the history of music.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I also suspect that the prevalence of the three minute popular song and half-hour album may also soon cease to exist, as it was only the 45" and 33" vinyl records which made such timings the standard.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The commercial models may change - and innovations such as Spotify seem to show that the models are changing - and so there may still be a way of making money from recorded music in the copy-and-paste era.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the meantime, it would be good to hear fewer accusations against end-users that they are thieves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, this is not the first time that anxious "property" owners have used the vocabulary of criminal law to deter those likely to commit torts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For, contrary to all those threatening roadside signs, individual trespassers will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be prosecuted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simple trespass to normal private land &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; is a tort not an offence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;But they wouldn't want you to know that would they?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-6759339387589030616?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255289365891"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=16996">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/af266e38dc9d2587</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Speaking About the IFI Incident</title><published>2009-10-11T19:00:03Z</published><updated>2009-10-11T19:00:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/11/speaking-about-the-ifi-incident-2/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, October 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, I will be giving a talk for the North Shore Chapter of Americans United for Separation of Church and State (in Illinois).

In El Paso, Texas, parents and teachers around the world have chimed in regarding a 10-year-old with boy with Asperger’s who got a ticket for $260 for disrupting class. Students can be ticketed and their parents fined in the state for such actions, and the mom says her son kept falling asleep in class, made noise in the hall, and got down on the floor and refused to get up. She agrees the behavior is not okay and that he should be punished, but she disagrees that this punishment was “suitable” for what her son did, claiming he he didn’t hurt anyone or break anything. The ticket was later dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local news outlet &lt;a href="http://www.kfoxtv.com/news/21223358/detail.html"&gt;KFOX &lt;/a&gt;got several e-mails and comments regarding the story from parents, teachers, and others around the country and the world, some sympathetic and others saying the citation was warranted. Some said the punishment hits the parent and teaches the child nothing; others said the mom should “pay up and shut up” and that the fine was justified. The mom, a single parent, said she was upset by the latter comments, and that she is having trouble finding a doctor who will take her insurance to treat him. She also added that at the time her son wasn’t in a “appropriate classroom that addressed his needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is it hard to know where to come down on the fining, it’s hard to say if people around the world have the right to comment — like I’m doing here, I guess — on such a sticky situation about which they can’t possibly have all the facts. Opinions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 14-year-old Canby, Ore., boy with Asperger’s slipped through security at Portland International Airport and boarded a Chicago-bound flight using his mother’s name and credit card. The boy , who is 6′ 2″ and about 200 pounds, was reportedly asked by a TSA screener if his name was “Virginia,” the first name of the passenger listed on the ticket. The boy said yes, was allowed through security and made the flight. Minors are not required to show ID to pass through airport security; children 11 and older aren’t required to have an adult escort to the gate, and there is no government-issued ID for a 14-year-old. Cell phone tracking eventually located the young man near a Chicago airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little provision, of course, is made by TSA for screening for Asperger’s or other ASDs. The mom reported that Saturday’s flight was the second time in a week that her son has run away, and said that her son had exchanged thousands of text messages with someone purporting to be a Chicago girl. Talk about stuff the Net has unleashed.&lt;/p&gt;

Here is the standard language from the &lt;a href="http://scjobs.sciencemag.org/JobSeekerX/ViewJob.asp?cjid=33879&amp;amp;accountno=103&amp;amp;keywords=purdue"&gt;ad in Science&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;
The Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Purdue University School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position at the level of Assistant Professor. Research in the Department is highly interdisciplinary with strengths in molecular pharmacology, cancer biology, neuroscience, chemical biology, drug design, systems biology, and computational chemistry (website:&lt;a href="http://www.mcmp.purdue.edu/research/"&gt;http://www.mcmp.purdue.edu/research/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The successful candidate will have a Ph.D. in pharmacology or a related field, appropriate postdoctoral experience, and the potential to establish a vigorous research program and will participate in undergraduate, pharmacy, and graduate education.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Applicants are sought with research interests in any area of molecular pharmacology including, but not limited to, signal transduction, protein structure and function, drug-receptor interactions, drug discovery, and pharmacogenomics.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For full consideration, please submit a single PDF file to Ms. Angie Schutz, e-mail: &lt;a href="mailto:arschutz@purdue.edu"&gt;arschutz@purdue.edu&lt;/a&gt; containing the following items: a cover letter, a full curriculum vitae (including publications and research and teaching experience) and a statement of research plans (not to exceed two pages). Applicants should arrange to have three letters of reference sent directly to the same e-mail address. Please direct any questions regarding this position or application requirements to the Chair of the Search Committee, Dr. Gregory Hockerman, e-mail: &lt;a href="mailto:gregh@purdue.edu"&gt;gregh@purdue.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Purdue University is an Equal Opportunity/Equal Access/Affirmative Action Employer fully committed to achieving a diverse work force.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;









&lt;p&gt;This little birdie also mentioned that the search committee for this position is especially interested in interviewing qualified minority and women candidates.  As this little birdie says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;As monocultural as my department looks on paper, everyone here is really cool people, we have a great atmosphere and a very friendly, down-to-earth departmental community. People here TRULY COLLABORATE without fearing for their independence. I have been welcomed without hesitation into the group and feel very at home here, and our department head is really fantastic. In general people here are just straight-up folks. We have a formalized junior faculty mentorship program as well as an informal weekly lunch together that I have found totally invaluable to getting on my feet. Our tenure requirements are very rigorous, but everyone seems to be doing their best to help each other make it through (rather than trying to turf each other out). All in all, I think this is an excellent place to start a career and I couldn't be happier with my choice to join this department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yet, I tell myself, I need a break. Usually, I handle the problem by setting up several old posts from at least a couple of years a go to repeat, you know, to see how well or badly they've aged. Sometimes, however, material is given to me. For example, this e-mail from someone named John who happens to have a .au (Australia) e-mail address:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;WHY ARE YOU SO AFRAID...

&lt;p&gt;To put your real name to this Blog---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;its probably because you are not a Real person and don't actually exist--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen Direct evidence of Vaccinations as per Mouldens photos in&lt;br&gt;
children around me, in my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their parents get told by Doctos all sorts of excuses as to why they have&lt;br&gt;
the problems they do---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;someone would try and make you believe they were Born 'WITH A LAZY EYE" but&lt;br&gt;
they weren't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Any way if such Vaccinations programmes were so successful around the world&lt;br&gt;
we wouldn't see the problems we have today. The Medical system has failed&lt;br&gt;
us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you know if all your Science was so successful, and based on Truth, then&lt;br&gt;
it wouldn't need Defending---so&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHY ARE YOU OUT THERE ATTEMPTING TO DEFEND THE TRUTH---THE TRUTH DOESN'T&lt;br&gt;
NEED DEFENDING!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let us others make their own choice------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So have you taken the Swine Flue Shot yet?---based on your ponderings you&lt;br&gt;
would have been the first one lining up for one.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infact why don't you take 2 just for good measure.................&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a rough week for the public's health education.  The flu pandemic is &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2008-2009/picILI39.htm"&gt;still on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, and if trends continue, we will hit a record number of cases quite soon.  Currently &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1229"&gt;the best primer on influenza&lt;/a&gt; is Joe Albietz's, which I encourage you to read. But rumors about the flu are spreading nearly as fast as the virus, and we need a nearly real-time response to keep up.  I've been doing quite a bit of tweeting and facebooking, responding to specific questions and concerns, and here I'll summarize a bit of that.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took Friday off from work and drove with my friend Anders to Avesta, an industrial town in Dalecarlia, where our friend Pär and his lovely wife, both teachers, have recently settled. We spent the afternoon and evening walking in the sunshine, admiring their house, eating like kings, listening to some pretty far-out and eclectic music (including Earth, Heino, Om, Demis Roussos and Sunn) and playing the Swedish 70s board game &lt;em&gt;Marinattack&lt;/em&gt;. It's notable for coming with an electronic device that replaces dice and outcome tables. They kicked my ass five games in a row. The shame!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/10/weekend_fun/PIC_0153.jpg" width="500" height="353" alt="PIC_0153.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then on Saturday Anders and I returned to Stockholm where my son and I went to the &lt;a href="http://www.retrogathering.se/"&gt;Retro Gathering&lt;/a&gt; vintage video gaming event. (He made me take him to it!) There was a surprisingly large number of attendees and a surprisingly large percentage of them were women. I ran into my friendly one-time editor Jonas Svensson that I hadn't seen in almost 15 years. During the early 90s I made some extra money writing reviews and making translations for a couple of video game magazines, &lt;i&gt;Nintendo Magazinet&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Super Power&lt;/i&gt;. My perspective on the games -- being an archaeologist and a non-video-gamer -- was a bit strange. For instance, when reviewing a 1991 &lt;em&gt;Defender&lt;/em&gt; clone for the SNES, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_Twin"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darius Twin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I remember explaining who Darius the Persian king was and informing my 12-y-o readers that he was actually named Dārayavahush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this I have two &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2007/03/quest_for_dick_spotted_2.php"&gt;Spotted Dicks&lt;/a&gt; steaming on the stove and two loaves of bread in the oven. Tomorrow the two most beautiful girls in the world are coming home from China. Tonight, though, is gaming night. And we are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; playing &lt;em&gt;Marinattack&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you feeling it now? We all should hope for a world where all the differences between us are no obstacle to full participation in civic life by all people; whether you're gay or godless, black or white, the law should treat us all the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are people who don't share that dream and want to constrain minority positions, and make non-heterosexuals second class citizens. Equality is not what they want. We have to act to improve our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contribute to the &lt;a href="https://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/5841/shop/custom.jsp?donate_page_KEY=2566"&gt;Support No on 1/Protect Maine Equality campaign&lt;/a&gt;. If you live in Maine, vote NO on 1 in the election booth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the country, contribute to the &lt;a href="https://www.upwardstech.net/approvereferendum71"&gt;Approve Referendum 71&lt;/a&gt; campaign, and if you live there, vote YES on Ref. 71. I have a lot of family in that state, so I'll be contributing there, and will also be calling up family and reminding them that they ought to vote FOR this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in the middle of the country, you can &lt;a href="http://www.ndhrc.org/wp-publish/donate"&gt;donate&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="http://www.ndhrc.org/wp-publish/"&gt;North Dakota Human Rights Coalition&lt;/a&gt;. But you know this is an issue &lt;i&gt;everywhere&lt;/i&gt; — look for local groups you can help. You&amp;#39;ve got google, even if you aren&amp;#39;t getting up off your butt today, use it! Contribute! Work with your GLBT friends and neighbors! Make a difference!&lt;/p&gt;

Here's one of them: Bridget Jankowski, from the University of Toronto, "Grammatical and register variation and change: A multi-corpora perspective on the English genitive".  She was kind enough to send me a copy of her slides, from which I've taken (most of) the graphs below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to study the history of choices like "Ontario's government" (s-genitive) vs. "the government of Ontario" (of-genitive), she created two small historical corpora, sampling Maclean's magazine and the Hansard transcripts of debates of the Ontario Provincial Legislature at three time points: 1906, 1956, and 2006. She picked three authors or three speakers from each source at each time point. All of the speakers and authors were men aged 30-60 at the time of the sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her first result is a replication of the observation that the s-genitive has been gaining ground:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Bridget1.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Bridget1.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare, for example, this figure from  Hinrichs and Szmrecsanyi, "&lt;a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~bresnan/LabSyntax2006/week6/Hinrichs_Szmrecsanyi_ELL.pdf"&gt;Recent changes in the function and frequency of standard English genitive constructions: a multivariate analysis of tagged corpora&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;English Language and Linguistics&lt;/em&gt; 11(3): 437–474, 2007:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Hinrichs1.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Hinrichs1.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jankowski then broke the trends down further by coding the possessors as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human: a student’s schoolwork, Mrs. Hale’s reaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizations (animate “collectivities of humans which display some degree of groupidentity”): the local school board’s ruling; the federal government’s plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Places: Canada’s foreign language press, Ontario’s roads, the streets of Rome, the raw edge of the world, the people of this American continent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inanimate objects, activities, units of time, states&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made it clear that the increase in use of s-genitives has been especially strong in the case of organizations,  and even stronger in the case of places:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Bridget2.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Bridget2.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Bridget3.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Bridget3.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her category 4 ("Inanimate objects, activities, units of time, states") was realized overall with of-genitive 96% in Maclean’s and 99% in Hansard. So her results are generally consistent with Otto Jespersen's observation in &lt;em&gt;A Modern English Grammar on Historical Principles: Part VII&lt;/em&gt; (1949) that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In poetry and in higher literary style, the genitive of lifeless things is used in many cases where &lt;em&gt;of &lt;/em&gt;would be used in ordinary speech. […] During the last few years the genitive of lifeless things has been gaining ground, (especially among journalists)…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but only if "lifeless things" is taken to include organizations and places, and not "inanimate objects, activities, units of time, states".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also compared her results to data from a corpus of conversational speech collected recently in Toronto, using speaker age to create two "apparent time" collections comparable to the 1956 and 2006 samples. This suggests that in the spoken language, human possessors have almost always gotten the s-genitive, consistently across time, while inanimate possessors (in this graph including her categories 3 and 4) have consistently gotten the of-genitive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Bridget4.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Bridget4.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this analysis, the increase in s-genitives for human possessors in Maclean's magazine makes the journalistic prose more and more like the spoken language; but the parallel increase in s-genitives for inaminate possessors makes the journalistic prose less and less speech-like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her presentation also considered the effect of the length of the possessor (a shorter possessor is more likely to take an s-genitive) and the possessum (&amp;quot;shorter possessum will be more likely to take an of-genitive and so appear first in the construction, while a longer possessum is more likely to take the s-genitive&amp;quot;), as well as other relevant features such as  &amp;quot;lexical density&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Bridget5.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and &amp;quot;thematicity&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Bridget6.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and did a multivariate analysis of all the various factors taken together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll have to read her (I trust forthcoming) paper to learn how it all comes out — I have a 6:40 a.m. plane to catch — but I hope that this much is enough to convince you that there&amp;#39;s a rich and interesting pattern of variation to be untangled here. It certainly convinced me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And it also increased my general feeling that the time is right for the application of automatic or semi-automatic methods of analysis (here in assigning her four categories of possessors, in determining the lengths of the possessor and possessum constituents, in counting local phrases co-referential with the possessor, etc.) to the study of syntactic variation across time, genre, register and so on. Because she had to annotate everything by hand, Jankowski&amp;#39;s sample was fairly small — 50K words of Maclean&amp;#39;s, and 100K words of Hansards. With automatic or semi-automatic annotation, she could look at larger collections with denser time samples of more sources, and easily add other features, like various word and phrase frequencies, grammatical role and phrasal position of the whole genitive construction, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255252437444"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/clock_quotes_440.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/37e4da686040f3c0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-10-11T09:20:44Z</published><updated>2009-10-11T09:20:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/qWPvS8WZlCw/clock_quotes_440.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/clock_quotes_440.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you really want to do something, you'll find a way; if you don't, you'll find an excuse.In times when the passions are beginning to take charge of the conduct of human affairs, one should pay less attention to what men of experience and common sense are thinking than to what is preoccupying the imagination of dreamers. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In his most recent (and &lt;a href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=352"&gt;David Kirby-like&lt;/a&gt;) post, &lt;strong&gt;Hepatitis B Vaccine: An Unmitigated Disaster&lt;/strong&gt;, J.B. trots out the sciency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As most readers of AoA know, the Hep B vaccine was added to the CDC’s childhood immunization schedule in the early 1990s, requires four doses before a child is eighteen months old, and is the only vaccine on the CDC’s schedule that is recommended to be given on an infant’s first day of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When&lt;/em&gt; it was added to the schedule is irrelevant. It’s a &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/downloads/child/2009/09_0-6yrs_schedule_pr.pdf"&gt;3-dose&lt;/a&gt; vaccine (4 are permissable when a 4th dose is part of a combination vaccine). Safe contribution to local and herd immunity as early as possible is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What else do we know about this vaccine? Quite a bit, actually. In no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) A recent study published in the journal Neurotoxicology called “Delayed Acquisition of Neonatal Reflexes in Newborn Primates Receiving a Thimerosal-containing Hepatitis B Vaccine: Influence of Gestational Age and Birth Weight” found that monkeys who received a Hepatitis B vaccine on the first day of life experienced a significant delay in survival reflexes versus monkeys who received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps J.B. will tell us exactly what these reflexes have to do with autism? Not likely. Besides the fact that this study is irrelevant to autism (never mind that Hep B hasn’t contained Thimerosal since 2001 either), it looks more like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/some_monkey_business_in_autism_research_1.php"&gt;monkey business&lt;/a&gt; rather than relevant and sound science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) A recent study published in the journal the Annals of Epidemiology titled “Hepatitis B Vaccination of Male Neonates and Autism” found that “Boys who received the hepatitis B vaccine during the first month of life had 2.94 greater odds for ASD [autism] compared to later- or unvaccinated boys.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, no such “study” has been published that I’ve seen. I’m sure there’s one forthcoming, but for now, all I’ve seen is an abstract and a poster presentation. The &lt;a href="http://www.safeminds.org/news/pressroom/documents/HepBAutismposterstudy2009Gallagher.pdf"&gt;poster&lt;/a&gt; is underwhelming to say the least. As the authors of this poster themselves noted (among other things), “cross-sectional design limits causal inferences”, “autism diagnosis is parent-reported”, and “secondary data analysis does not support conclusions regarding risk attributable to specific vaccine components”. The data is represented as being for boys age 3-17 between 1997 and 2002, which means the age group spans the evolution of the term “autism” to “autism spectrum disorders” (with the addition of PDD-NOS and Asperger Syndrome). It also means they span broadening of the criteria for autism itself. I wonder how they’ll control for the changing definition of “autism”, and the impact of awareness and recognition, which is especially important since this is based on partental reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) A recent study published in the journal Neurology called “Hepatitis B vaccine and the risk of CNS inflammatory demyelination in childhood” found that the Engerix B vaccine for Hep B (the one my son received) appears to increase the risk of central nervous system inflammatory demyelination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except it found the &lt;a href="http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/72/10/873"&gt;opposite&lt;/a&gt;. “&lt;em&gt;Vaccination within this period was &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; associated with an increase in the rate of CNS inflammatory demyelination (adjusted OR, 0.74; 0.54–1.02), neither &amp;gt;3 years nor as a function of the number of injections or brand type.&lt;/em&gt;” and “&lt;em&gt;Conclusions: Hepatitis B vaccination does not generally increase the risk of CNS inflammatory demyelination in childhood.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relevance to Autism? Zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) A recent study published in Toxicological and Environmental Chemistry titled “Hepatitis B triple series vaccine and developmental disability in US children aged 1-9 years” stated “the odds of receiving EIS [special education services] were approximately nine times as great for vaccinated boys as for unvaccinated boys after adjustment for confounders. This study found statistically significant evidence to suggest that boys in United States who were vaccinated with the triple series Hepatitis B vaccine, during the time period in which vaccines were manufactured with thimerosal, were more susceptible to developmental disability than were unvaccinated boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right. Special education services in general. Good luck with that one J.B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;5) In 2002, the Institute of Medicine (which I personally believe is a corrupt agent of the vaccine industry but many believe is the final word on medical issues) published a study titled, “Immunization Safety Review: Hepatitis B Vaccine and Demyelinating Neurological Disorders” in which they reached the following non-conclusion: “Additionally, the committee found that the epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between the hepatitis B vaccine in adults and multiple sclerosis. However, the evidence was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship between the hepatitis B vaccine and all other demyelinating conditions.” (Author’s note: If you’re a vaccine, and you can’t get an “all clear” from the vaccine-loving IOM, you’re in big trouble.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me thinks J.B. missed the part where the I.O.M. said, “hepatitis vaccine &lt;strong&gt;in adults and multiple sclerosis&lt;/strong&gt;” More irrelevancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;6) Generation Rescue analyzed the vaccine schedules of 30 first-world countries. 60%, or 18 countries, have Hep B vaccine on their schedule. That means 12 countries, or 40% of the countries, DO NOT require the Hep B vaccine, despite the fact that it has been readily available for 19 years. Of countries that do require Hep B vaccine, we could only find a few Eastern European countries like Bulgaria and Latvia who also give the shot to babies on the first day of life. Many other countries appear to pursue a more balanced approach to Hep B vaccine, here are some direct quotes from country vaccination schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid logic - an appeal to popularity among 40% of selected countries. Warning, valid ad-hominem follows: Actually, I was ready to stop reading point #6 at the “&lt;em&gt;Generation Rescue analyzed…&lt;/em&gt;” Generation Rescue sucks at analysis. Don’t take my word for it, read more about their &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/generation_rescue_and_fourteen_studies.php"&gt;14 studies&lt;/a&gt;, their phone survey (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/fun_with_phone_surveys.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.blogspot.com/2007/06/survey-says-nothing.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/09/simple-selection-bias-model-explains.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), their take on &lt;a href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=103"&gt;mercury excretion&lt;/a&gt; (based on part of their “25 Myths” mecury document of days gone by).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor guy. The shiny new (not really new, it’s actually a recycle of the mercury nonsense) hypothesis has all the looks of the Sirens of Ulysses. Will J.B. be drawn in like an insect to the bug-zapper? Or will another vaccine-centric, yet completely merit-free autism hypothesis attract his attention in the nick of time in another few months?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Do'C</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Autism Street</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255246580693"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AbhishekTiwarisBlog/~3/XqXXmQIbOTo/what-synthetic-biology-can-learn-from.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/13ce4b6a028621c4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">What synthetic biology can learn from programming languages</title><published>2009-10-11T00:28:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-11T00:28:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/RVN0S4jnDyY/what-synthetic-biology-can-learn-from.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AbhishekTiwarisBlog/~3/XqXXmQIbOTo/what-synthetic-biology-can-learn-from.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">What is synthetic biology? In simple words Synthetic biology is nothing but putting engineering into biology. An engineered genetic toggle switch developed by Tim Gardner and Jim Collins is a good example of how engineering principles are driving the boat of synthetic biology. Researchers are now trying to adapt  concepts developed in area of programming language development &amp;amp; software engineering for synthetic biology applications. A latest paper in PLoS Computational Biology shows how methods used by computer scientists to develop programming languages can be applied to DNA sequences. They report an  attribute grammar based formalism  to model the structure-function relationships in synthetic DNA sequences. An attribute grammar is constructed as an extension of a context-free grammar and in computer science it is commonly used to  translate the text of a program source code or the syntax tree directly into the computational operations or machine level instructions. FurtherThe translation of a gene network model from a genetic sequence is very similar to the compilation of the source code of a computer program into an object code that can be executed by a microprocessor (Figure 1). The first step consists in breaking down the DNA sequence into a series of genetic parts by a program called the lexer or scanner. Since the sequence of a part may be contained in the sequence of another part, the lexer is capable of backtracking to generate all the possible interpretations of the input DNA sequences as a series of parts. All possible combinations of parts generated by the lexer are sent to a second program called the parser to analyze if they are structurally consistent with the language syntax. The structure of a valid series of parts is represented by a parse tree (Figure 2). The semantic evaluation takes advantage of the parse tree to translate the DNA sequence into a different representation such as a chemical reaction network. The translation process requires attributes and semantic actions. Attributes are properties of individual genetic parts or combinations of parts. Semantic actions are associated with the grammar production rules. They specify how attributes are computed. Specifically, the translation process relies on the semantic actions associated with parse tree nodes to synthesize the attributes of the construct from the attributes of its child nodes, or to inherit the attributes from its parental node.Figure. 1 Figure 2.Proposed formalism can be quite useful to understand how a set of genetic components relates to a function with potential to assemble a new biological systems of desired functionality or phenotype using BioBricks standard biological parts. It will be implemented into GenoCAD, a  web-based tool used for genetic engineering of cells.Reference:Cai, Y., Lux, M., Adam, L., &amp;amp; Peccoud, J. (2009).

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When atheist &lt;strong&gt;Rob Sherman&lt;/strong&gt; filed a lawsuit against our state last year over this illegal earmark, it resulted in an &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/04/04/its-dangerous-for-children-to-know-atheism-exists-says-illinois-state-legislator/"&gt;infamous exchange&lt;/a&gt; with State Representative &lt;strong&gt;Monique Davis&lt;/strong&gt; during which she stated, “it’s dangerous for our children to even know that your philosophy exists,” referring to Sherman’s atheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherman now has good news to report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilgrim Baptist Church &lt;a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/godless-in-chicago/2009/10/illinois-cancels-million-dollar-grant-to-pilgrim-baptist-church.html"&gt;won’t be getting any of that money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excuse that the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity used for cancelling the Grant was that there was insufficient money to fund the grant, but we know what the real reason was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how much of a role Sherman actually played in the reversal but as long as we got a happy outcome, who cares?&lt;/p&gt;

Not surprisingly, Kirby had questions. Also not surprisingly, even though he essentially discards Thimerosal and MMR, his question boils down to vaccines. From his post (a question he apparently attempted to ask on a conference call with the NIMH director, Dr. Thomas Insel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: there are now two &lt;em&gt;very different&lt;/em&gt; versions - David Kirby apparently revised his post after I’d read it, and cut and pasted the relevant part of the first version a little over a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are both versions. I don’t know when the post was actually changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;Version 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, here is my (expanded) question, directed to Dr. Insel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Insel, thank you for arranging this call. I understand that the estimated average ASD rate increased from 66-per-10,000 to 100-per-10,000 between the 1994 and 1996 birth cohorts. Officials on this call believe this increase could be attributed purely to expanding diagnostic criteria and greater awareness, though they don’t know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how could you attribute a 50% increase in just two years to wider diagnostics, especially when the 1994 cohort would have been diagnosed, on average, in 1998 and the latter cohort in 2000? The expansion of the ASD definition to include Asperger and PDD-NOS occurred in the early 1990s, so how can you explain this sudden and delayed explosion in the numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, you have declared that the vaccine-autism link had been disproven, yet all the studies you cite have only looked at MMR and thimerosal. But why is the IACC, which you chair, not investigating the possible role of Hep-B vaccine, given the following facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) For the 1994 birth cohort, Hepatitis-B vaccine was given to 27% of all newborns, but in 1996 it had jumped to 82%. (HERE)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) An abstract just published in the Annals of Epidemiology said that giving Hepatitis B vaccine to newborn baby boys more than triples the risk of ASD. (HERE)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) A study just published in Neurotoxicology reported that infant male primates who received one dose of Hepatitis-B vaccine were far more likely to display developmental delays than unvaccinated controls. (HERE)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) A study last year in Toxicological and Environmental Chemistry showed that boys getting the 3-shot HepB vaccine series were eight times more likely to require early intervention services than boys who did not have the series. (HERE)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) A study in the journal Neurology found that children who received the Hepatitis B vaccine series were 50% more likely to develop “central nervous system inflammatory demyelination” than children who did not receive the vaccine. (HERE)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, why does your committee ignore evidence associating heavy metals and other toxins with ASD, why did you jettison the vaccinated-vs.-unvaccinated study that your own committee had previously voted to recommend, and why are you spending only 39 minutes speaking with the community that represents, according to your boss, one of the nation’s “top health priorities?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also sending this question to HHS, to see if I can get a proper response. But I am not holding my breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, here is my (expanded) question, directed to Dr. Insel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Insel, thank you for arranging this call. I understand that the estimated average ASD rate increased from 66-per-10,000 to 100-per-10,000 between the 1994 and 1996 birth cohorts.

&lt;p&gt;But how could you attribute a 50% increase in just two years to wider diagnostics, especially when the 1994 cohort would have been diagnosed, on average, in 1999 and the latter cohort in 2001? The expansion of the ASD definition to include Asperger and PDD-NOS occurred in the early 1990s, so how can you explain this sudden and delayed explosion in the numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, you have declared that the vaccine-autism link has been disproven, yet all the studies you cite have only looked at MMR and thimerosal. But why is the IACC, which you chair, not investigating the possible role of Hep-B vaccine, given the following facts?:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) A study in the journal Neurology found that children who received Merck’s Engerix B brand Hepatitis B vaccine series were 74% more likely to develop “central nervous system inflammatory demyelination” than children who did not receive the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, why did you jettison the vaccinated-vs.-unvaccinated study that your own committee had previously voted to recommend, and why are you spending only 39 minutes speaking with the community that represents, according to your boss, one of the nation’s “top health priorities?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also sending this question to HHS, to see if I can get a proper response. But I am not holding my breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not particularly interested in irrelevant and likely misleading (newborn vs. 3-shot Hep B series numbers) that Kirby has apparently removed from his original post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His numbers looked like something he made up (to me anyway), and the link he provided was not to any actual data. Contrary to the misinformation provided in version 1 of Kirby’s post, Hep B vaccination coverage (for the entire 3-shot series) was already 82% for the majority of the 1994 birth year cohort! I’m not sure which data David Kirby was using in his non-specific link, but you don’t have to take my word for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;37% Hep B vaccine coverage was already seen in the group closest to the 1992 birth year cohort (NIS, 19-35 month-olds in 1994).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00038532.htm"&gt;http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00038532.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;82% Hep B vaccine coverage was seeen in the group closest to the 1994 birth year cohort (NIS, 19-35 month-olds in 1996).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00048503.htm"&gt;http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00048503.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;87% Hep B vaccine coverage was seeen in the group closest to the 1996 birth year cohort (NIS, 19-35 month-olds in 1998).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss4909a1.htm"&gt;http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss4909a1.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Edite to add: Kirby was smart to eliminate his original post’s reference to increased Hep B vaccine coverage if he wants to keep a “Hep B vaccine causes autism hypothesis alive”. The data wouldn’t support it. Hep B vaccine coverage went from 8% to 82% between 1992 and 1996 - full three-shot series.  Autism “numbers” during that time of increase? Probably not too favorable to his hypothesis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also not too interested abstracts of unpublished papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not terribly interested in totally irrelevant-to-autism citations that seem to attempt to redefine “developmental delays” in the context of autism either. Some might call it “&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/some_monkey_business_in_autism_research_1.php"&gt;Monkey Business&lt;/a&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not-specific-to-autism-at-all survey information? Yawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“CNS inflammatory demyelination”? Is David Kirby an idiot, or what? The paper he linked to concludes with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rates of HB vaccination in the 3 years before the index date were 24.4% for the 349 cases and 27.3% for their 2,941 matched controls. &lt;strong&gt;HB vaccination within this period&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;was not associated with an increase in the rate of CNS inflammatory demyelination (adjusted OR, 0.74; 0.54–1.02), neither &amp;gt;3 years nor as a function of the number of injections or brand type.&lt;/strong&gt; When the analysis was restricted to subjects compliant with vaccination, HB vaccine exposure &amp;gt;3 years before index date was associated with an increased trend (1.50; 0.93–2.43), essentially from the Engerix B vaccine (1.74; 1.03–2.95). The OR was particularly elevated for this brand in patients with confirmed multiple sclerosis (2.77; 1.23–6.24).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt; Hepatitis B vaccination does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; generally increase&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;the risk of CNS inflammatory demyelination in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasis mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, Kirby’s #4 (#5 in the old post) looks like an outright lie - but I suppose it could be sheer ignorance. The linked study found &lt;strong&gt;no association&lt;/strong&gt; when comparing children based on vaccination status, although Kirby claimed otherwise. What it did find was an increased odds ratio amongst the smaller vaccinated-only percentage (the study was in France), predominantly in confirmed Multiple Sclerosis patients. Relevance to autism? None!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part of Kirby’s original post that did interest me, was this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how could you attribute a 50% increase in just two years to wider diagnostics, especially when the 1994 cohort would have been diagnosed, on average, in 1998 and the latter cohort in 2000? The expansion of the ASD definition to include Asperger and PDD-NOS occurred in the early 1990s, so how can you explain this sudden and delayed explosion in the numbers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I’d written about his first version about a week ago, but not yet had a chance to publish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Actually, the inclusion of PDD-NOS (which along with Asperger Syndrome, accounts for about two-thirds of all autism spectrum disorder diagnoses) occurred in 1987, not the early 1990’s. Additionally, Kirby has correctly noted that Asperger Syndrome was added in the early 1990’s (1994), but he’s failed to mention that the criteria for autistic disorder itself were greatly expanded (to be less restrictive) in 1994 too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why on earth would I point out Kirby’s error about PDD-NOS, and omission with respect to to expansion of the criteria for autistic disorder, when it would appear to support his point that an “explosion in numbers” was delayed and sudden? It’s because the notion that this increase was delayed and appears sudden is not surprising, and probably irrelevant. Here’s the bottom line - The specific diagnoses that account for nearly a full two-thirds of all autism spectrum disorder diagnoses weren’t added to the DSM until 1987 and 1994. Additionally, the specific diagnosis that accounts for the other third of all autism spectrum disorder diagnoses, saw its criteria revised to be much more inclusive in 1994. We should expect that a significant increase (ceterus paribus) will follow 1994!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about David Kirby’s notion that the increase was delayed? He asserts, with the numbers, that the average age of an ASD diagnosis at the time would have been about 48 months (1998 for for 1994 birth year cohort, and 2000 for the 1996 birth year cohort), but is that really accurate? Here’s the deal, it IS likely that the average age at diagnosis for autistic disorder was pretty close to 48 months (actually, about 3 and a half years of age) at the time, but Kirby has missed the point of the very question he himself asked! He wants to know how an increase in ASD numbers could be delayed, with the additions of PDD-NOS and Asperger Syndrome in “the early 1990’s”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, David Kirby completely failed to put together an accurate premise for his first post. The average age of diagnosis for PDD-NOS for the birth year cohort in 1994 is likely much closer to 4.6 years, and the average age of diagnosis for Asperger Syndrome for the birth year cohort in 1994 is likely closer to 7.5 years. Of course an increase due to the addtions of PDD-NOS and Asperger Syndrome was delayed beyond 4 years - in 1998 the average age of diagnosis was well above 48 months! Yes, those numbers are not really even close to Kirby’s, but that’s not all. Watch what happens when we look at age of diagnosis for the 1996 birth year cohort: PDD-NOS likely around 3.6 years, and Asperger Syndrome likely around 5.4 years! So between the 1994 and 1996 birth year cohorts, the average age of diagnosis for both PDD-NOS and Asperger Syndrome plummets! Don’t forget, PDD-NOS and Asperger Syndrome account for about two-thirds of all autism spectrum disorder diagnoses. I could be wrong, but I’m inclined to think that increased awareness and recognition are probably largely responsible for these decreasing ages of diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a starting point, see (Mandel et al., 2005) for more on age of diagnosis, if you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factors Associated With Age of Diagnosis Among Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders&lt;br&gt;
PEDIATRICS Vol. 116 No. 6 December 2005, pp. 1480-1486&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/116/6/1480"&gt;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/116/6/1480&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, A) the increase is expected, and B) for contribution by the additions of PDD-NOS and Asperger Syndrome, delay well beyond 48 months is also expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having failed to consider these points, Kirby launched into a predictible “vaccines dunnit” indictment of the HepB vaccine. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, now, David Kirby has changed his original claim/question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how could you attribute a 50% increase in just two years to wider diagnostics, especially when the 1994 cohort would have been diagnosed, on average, in 1999 and the latter cohort in 2001? The expansion of the ASD definition to include Asperger and PDD-NOS occurred in the early 1990s, so how can you explain this sudden and delayed explosion in the numbers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second version is &lt;em&gt;a little&lt;/em&gt; safer by the numbers for Kirby, as he’s now in the ballpark of a little bit closer to correct about average age of diagnosis at the time, but my point is unchanged. Kirby has ignored the fact that it is expected that any increase based on the inclusion of PDD-NOS and Asperger Syndrome will be delayed (and very real) when you consider the changes in average age of diagnosis for the years in question. Don’t forget about that broadening of the criteria for autism itself in 1994 that Kirby doesn’t mention, it’s likely to have had an impact as well. It wouldn’t hurt to consider the likely impact of the adoption of new diagnoses in practice either - I’m pretty sure those things don’t happen overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Kirby’s closing indignation, I’ll just make a few short comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re probably ignoring so-called “evidence” of an association between heavy metals (and other toxins) and ASD, because the evidence-to-date, is not what the anti-vaccine folks believe it to be. See the recent decisions by the Special Masters in the United States Court of Federal Claims’s Omnibus Autism Proceeding re the state of the science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ve probably let go of the vaccinated vs. unvaccinated study idea due to ethics and feasibility considerations (not to mention the dearth of scientific evidence that suggests such a study would even be fruitful), but I suppose it’s possible that they’re simply growing tired of the wasted time and resources demanded by the anti-vaccine groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Kirby, you and the anti-vaccine groups, are NOT TEH autism community!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Do'C</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Autism Street</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255239423521"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AbhishekTiwarisBlog/~3/pRYvHKPoo5o/bioengineered-personalized-human-bone.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/df7e0b4124e1fdff</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">BioEngineered personalized human bone grafts created  from bone marrow stem cells</title><published>2009-10-10T22:24:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-10T22:24:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/gD1MiyNE7U8/bioengineered-personalized-human-bone.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AbhishekTiwarisBlog/~3/pRYvHKPoo5o/bioengineered-personalized-human-bone.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Scale up of engineered bone grafts towards clinical applications is always a central challenge in regenerative medicine.  In latest article PNAS Grayson et. al report an approach to develop clinically sized viable bone grafts of human temporomandibular joint (TMJ) condylar or Jaw bone seeded with human bone marrow stem/progenitor cells (hMSCs).  This study was carried out by a research group led by Dr Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic at the Columbia University and it appears in the online issue of journal PNAS. This is first time that anatomically shaped bone graft has been reported and this work has major implications. As these grafts are engineered from  the patient’s own stem cells  hence there is a low risk of graft rejection. This work opens door for many possible clinical applications such bone reconstructions after congenital defects, cancer resections, bone grafts for spinal fusion (also called arthrodesis) and many more. In following figure B is the a real jaw while C is the bioengineered one.  Image Credits PNASThe whole approach is described belowAnatomically shaped scaffolds were generated from fully decellularized trabecular bone by using digitized clinical images, seeded with hMSCs, and cultured with interstitial flow of culture medium. A bioreactor with a chamber in the exact shape of a human TMJ was designed for controllable perfusion throughout the engineered construct. By 5 weeks of cultivation, tissue growth was evidenced by the formation of confluent layers of lamellar bone (by scanning electron microscopy), markedly increased volume of mineralized matrix (by quantitative microcomputer tomography), and the formation of osteoids (histologically). Within bone grafts of this size and complexity cells were fully viable at a physiologic density, likely an important factor of graft function. Moreover, the density and architecture of bone matrix correlated with the intensity and pattern of the interstitial flow, as determined in experimental and modeling studies.However the engineered graft does not replicate the whole system, for instance it does not include other tissues such as cartilage layer which is often damaged in TMJ disorders. Future challenges include engineering of vascularized bone that can be immediately connected to the blood supply of the host and hybrid grafts including bone and tissues.Reference:Grayson, W., Frohlich, M., Yeager, K., Bhumiratana, S., Chan, M., Cannizzaro, C., Wan, L., Liu, X., Guo, X., &amp;amp; Vunjak-Novakovic, G.

&lt;p&gt;The last time I looked at the figures, &lt;a href="http://health.yahoo.com/news/ap/us_med_swine_flu.html"&gt;76 children&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,559062,00.html"&gt;28 pregnant women&lt;/a&gt; had been killed by H1N1. Apparently though, “alternative” “medicine” “gurus” Gary Null (who’s also an HIV denialist in addition to being an anti-vaccine quack) and Mike Adams (who’s probably also an HIV denialist) aren’t happy with such low figures, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/altmed_guru_not_killing_enough.php"&gt;so now they’ve introduced a lawsuit against the FDA to remove the current H1N1 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the mountains of evidence showing both the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, I doubt this lawsuit will get any real traction, but swift action should be taken to stop these psychopaths before it even gets the chance. Also against them is the sheer amount of money that our government has put into manufacturing these vaccines and getting them out there to the public. Unless there really were some seriously substantial evidence could be presented to prove something was wrong with the vaccine, too much money has been invested to just throw them all out now. And of course if these fools had such evidence, the scientific community would have already known about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I still can’t confirm this but as far as I know Mr. Null is still &lt;a href="http://view.fdu.edu/default.aspx?id=2716"&gt;a faculty member at my local Fairleigh Dickinson University&lt;/a&gt;. Although I’m sure he tons of blood money selling snake oil and books that promote snake oil, I recommend possibly starting a campaign to get his ass fired.&lt;/p&gt;

Once upon a time Dr. Isis received a review copy of &lt;a href="http://www.unscientificamerica.com/"&gt;Unscientific America: How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens our Future&lt;/a&gt; (that's &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/business/media/06adco.html?_r=4&amp;amp;hp"&gt;my disclosure&lt;/a&gt;), the now notorious book by &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/"&gt;Sheril Kirshenbaum and Chris Mooney&lt;/a&gt;.  However, since receiving it, I have had a bit of a problem. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t seem to keep my copy of the book in my possession.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/10/unscientific_america_and_the_m/Catch%20Unscientific%20America.jpg" alt="Catch Unscientific America.jpg" height="279" width="424"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: Dr. Isis tries to catch her elusive copy of Unscientific America.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the book first arrived, my husband snatched it up and read it.  When I got it back I sat it on my desk, where it stayed for about 1 hour.   It was then snatched up by a friend.  I finally got it back last week and finished it while I was traveling.  While I was away on my trip, I stayed with one of my favorite people in the world where I ate some delicious food, engaged in the performance of some live music with some friends, and drank a little bit of wine.  Okay, between the five of us we made a significant dent into a case of wine on the first evening.  Then, in my wine induced zeal, I took the book out of my briefcase  to show someone in the group.  I ended up exhausted and asleep on the living room couch and the book ended up on the coffee table.  The book remained on the coffee table and my friend, perhaps having read it, is mailing it back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the point is, I&amp;#39;ve read it and I have some fairly strong opinions about what I read. I also, eventually, have a thing or two to say about Chapter 8 and the definition of civility in the scientific discourse.  That will come, little muffins.  &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Program_Finalization/"&gt;That will come&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a general review, let me say this:  Sheril and Chris are gifted writers and communicators and this book is well-researched.  It was a relatively easy read; I finished it in a plane ride plus one car trip.  The central argument of the book seems to be that Americans, in general, are becoming less interested in and knowledgeable about science and that a large part of the blame for this falls on the shoulders of scientists who have failed to communicate effectively with the public.  Indeed, Sheril and Chris identify scientists as a target audience when they write in the prologue to the book:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our deepest aspiration is that this book will push these young scientists, and those who share their enthusiasm and sense of mission, along that path. They are the future, and we need their help to break down the walls that have for too long separated the "experts" from everybody else. If we can combine the restoration of science in Washington with a renewed effort, partly grassroots in nature, to reconnect it with our broader society, perhaps we can finally create a stronger rapport between American science and mainstream American culture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right now the public needs that very badly, but so too do the scientists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I like to think of myself as a young, totally smoking hot scientist.  I won&amp;#39;t lie that this made the book hard to read at times (not my being hot, but being the audience).  Sheril and Chris are frequently critical of scientists, especially academic scientists.  There were times that I found myself stomping my feet (as much as one can on a plane without getting thrown off), balling up my fists, and asking, &amp;quot;What the balls more do you want from me Chris and Sheril?  I am only one scientist!  Now I have to solve scientific illiteracy too?  Fuck!!!&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/LZ7lI6Ic9cw%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x006699%26color2%3D0x54abd6&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;height=265" width="320" height="265"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video 1: Because, seriously, you're never too old to deal with something by just throwing a tantrum and pouting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, after I pondered Sheril and Chris's book over a bottle of Cabernet and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FqA2WINPF4"&gt;my friend's rendition of Free Fallin'&lt;/a&gt;, I came to this conclusion -- I can either be upset that I've been identified as part of the problem or, in the words of my high school English teacher, I can be of the solution. Or, you know, some shit like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As we begin, I think it is important that we be in agreement about the problem we are trying to solve.  What exactly is &amp;quot;scientific illiteracy?&amp;quot;  This is an area in which I might be in agreement with Sheril and Chris.  In Chapter 2 Sheril and Chris write:&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Such complexities call into question whether quizzes about a few canonical 
"facts" or the nature of the scientific process really tell us much about a 
society's outlook on the science issues that matter most. Indeed, it's doubtful 
that a baseline level of scientific literacy is remotely adequate for engaging 
with the science-centered debates that play out regularly in the news media and 
the political arena. Is the goal to have a public that can dig into complicated 
scientific disputes and determine who is right or wrong? If so, then let's 
remember that many anti-evolutionists and global warming deniers are scientists 
themselves, couching their claims in sophisticated scientific language and 
regularly citing published articles in the peer-reviewed literature.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;To be entirely honest, I could give two left nuts if some quiz tells us that some Americans don&amp;#39;t remember that an electron is smaller than an atom.  I guarantee that if I were quizzed on some topic outside of the scholarly areas I have chosen to pursue as an adult, I might come out looking like a dumbass. A hot dumbass, but a dumbass none the less.  There is plenty of information that I don&amp;#39;t think about everyday that I learned about as a high school or college student that I could not instantly recall.  If that is the definition of illiteracy, then we&amp;#39;re all pretty much screwed.  I would argue, however, that what keeps me from being &amp;quot;illiterate&amp;quot; is the fact that I could find the knowledge if I ever came to need it again, that I have the ability to discern high quality information from low quality information, and that I have the tools to think critically about a problem.  A major source of scientific illiteracy, or unscientific-ness, is a result of the public&amp;#39;s exposure to pseudoscience and antiscience that they have been unable or unwilling to distinguish from the real deal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, with that in mind, and if scientists and the public are going to co-mingle in a productive way, I would propose the following goals (or, dare I say, specific aims?) for the endeavor that I think Sheril and Chris would agree with:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To convince the public of the importance of our work so that they are enthusiastic about continuing to fund and support it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To ensure that anyone who wants to pursue more than a cursory knowledge of science has the tools they need to satisfy their own curiosity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To provide the public with reliable sources of information while also teaching them to scrutinize the information given to them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Many of my scientific and blogger colleagues, including &lt;a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/2009/6/a-thin-broth"&gt;Jon Miller of Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt; have been critical of Unscientific America for not outlining a three point plan that would change the face of science.  As the scientist to whom this book was, in part,  written for, I am kind of okay with that.  I mean, if I am going to respond to an &lt;a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/search_results.htm?year=active&amp;amp;scope=rfa"&gt;RFA from the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; by submitting a grant application to conduct research, they don&amp;#39;t provide me with all of the methodology, data, and then interpret the results for me.  They outline a problem that needs to be solved and then hope that the scientific community will rise to the occasion and solve the problem.  That is largely what Unscientific America does -- it outlines a problem and offers a prospective that many scientists may not have considered with the hope that scientists will find ways to redesign their culture to solve the problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, I suppose the question to discuss in the next few posts is, what are we going to do about it?&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/unscientific_america_and_the_m.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/nwnbR3b8CAA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255235644719"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/dont_ask_dont_tell_dont_wait_m.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a085f9fc6ab87cdc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="GLBTA"/><title type="html">Don't ask, don't tell, don't wait much longer.</title><published>2009-10-11T04:39:16Z</published><updated>2009-10-11T04:39:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/9XueoMQTniw/dont_ask_dont_tell_dont_wait_m.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/dont_ask_dont_tell_dont_wait_m.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;President Barack Obama pledged to end the ban on homosexuals serving openly in the military in a speech Saturday, but acknowledged to a cheering crowd that the policy changes he promised on the campaign trail are not coming as quickly as they expected.

&lt;div style="width:490px"&gt;&lt;img title="venusflytraps5" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/venusflytraps52.jpg" alt="Tis the Season..." width="480" height="360"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tis the Season...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you ready for the holiday season? Have you planned that big celebration for 2010? Are you up for something totally new and even a little bit bizarre for your most descriminating guests? Or are you looking to do it yourself?&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you are in need of a All Hallows Seance, a prediction of the future, a lecture on superstitions, a fun jinxing ceremony for your boss, the reading of palms, seeing through solid matter, a pendulum party, a pet psychic, a levitation or regurgitation, an ESP boot camp, chupacabra chili, handwriting analysis, a ghost tour, a telephone to the dead, automatic writing, a talking tea kettle, fortune cookie readings ….or even a banana reading, …look no further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m here at your service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above are mysterious events and attractions anyone could probably perform for themselves after reading up a bit on the stuff I have posted here at Skepticblog for the last year. I have tried to make it easy for the skeptical mind to venture out into the woo world fully equiped to appear miraculous. Each of the subjects I have covered are ready for the enterprising host you to take a shot at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you feel a lack of courage and confidence to pull any one of them off and want to take the plunge, I’m ready to come to you: &lt;em&gt;Have Seance Will Travel. &lt;/em&gt;Think of me as your one-stop paranormal gourmet and resource center. With all the props and endless woo ready for your most critical audience, I’m good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img title="0VFCATKKI48CADK5T1JCAZON8AACAKM33A1CA5FDY8JCAN8QWVPCAXFOUP1CA5Z8FYCCA111XAHCAAAL9SDCASX6I7ICADKYWXQCAASGB0ECA0B3O8NCAGABC53CAC6M9K8CAUB3GROCALQU4VDCAFGTXJS" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/0VFCATKKI48CADK5T1JCAZON8AACAKM33A1CA5FDY8JCAN8QWVPCAXFOUP1CA5Z8FYCCA111XAHCAAAL9SDCASX6I7ICADKYWXQCAASGB0ECA0B3O8NCAGABC53CAC6M9K8CAUB3GROCALQU4VDCAFGTXJS1.jpg" alt="0VFCATKKI48CADK5T1JCAZON8AACAKM33A1CA5FDY8JCAN8QWVPCAXFOUP1CA5Z8FYCCA111XAHCAAAL9SDCASX6I7ICADKYWXQCAASGB0ECA0B3O8NCAGABC53CAC6M9K8CAUB3GROCALQU4VDCAFGTXJS" width="82" height="110"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As The Psychic Freinds Network spokespeople Linda Georgian and Dione Warwick used to say: “…All it takes is an open mind.”  To which I would add: …and an open pocketbook as well. In my case, all it takes is an email, a deposit check …and a will to believe.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="7Y5CAWTJBWACAMVCN0CCA04113SCAJAUX8ZCAFYOKHMCAW4GAN8CAIP2IM0CAH0ELAUCAKCH5PDCAEBDXLWCAQHEMTYCA77OHMNCAFDCNZPCA9KYYS6CACT2QBLCA7SJIL3CA2SNB7XCAP0CV8OCA8IM36V" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/7Y5CAWTJBWACAMVCN0CCA04113SCAJAUX8ZCAFYOKHMCAW4GAN8CAIP2IM0CAH0ELAUCAKCH5PDCAEBDXLWCAQHEMTYCA77OHMNCAFDCNZPCA9KYYS6CACT2QBLCA7SJIL3CA2SNB7XCAP0CV8OCA8IM36V1.jpg" alt="7Y5CAWTJBWACAMVCN0CCA04113SCAJAUX8ZCAFYOKHMCAW4GAN8CAIP2IM0CAH0ELAUCAKCH5PDCAEBDXLWCAQHEMTYCA77OHMNCAFDCNZPCA9KYYS6CACT2QBLCA7SJIL3CA2SNB7XCAP0CV8OCA8IM36V" width="112" height="150"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this s shameless cry for bookings? You bet it is. The paranormal marketplace is going through a dry spell even as we speak. It appears that I might have been wrong when I predicted a few months ago that there would be a landslide of new executive psychics and woo. Maybe it’s the calm before the storm, but it looks strangely quiet on the psychic front these days. The low-rent psychics are suffering. And even some of the big gypsy schemers are down to standing in soup kitchen lines across the country.  Some (curse of all curses!) have gone so far as to even take &lt;em&gt;real jobs &lt;/em&gt;like bartending or becoming “legit” spititual coaches. It has gotten that bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="y215655368571693" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/y215655368571693.jpg" alt="y215655368571693" width="100" height="75"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why else do you think the Coffey’s and the Brownes’ out there are getting so desperate and giving their “Fairwell Tours?”  We should only be so lucky…   In Sylvia’s case, it’s more like that corner used furniture store that endlessly hangs a “Going Out of Business Sale” sign in their window. It’s just another con to make you think they are disappearing from the scene. You can sell lots more tickets if people think you are dead or dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike times in the past when bad economies and wartime deaths brought about a windfall of golden opportunities to fleece the public, it seems like even the biggest sages, mediums and soothsayers are really hurting this season. Private readings may be up, but the corporate party circuit is definitely not up to it’s usual bombastic escapades into extravagance and poor taste. I’m beginning to miss all that free food and the annual parade of trophy wives. Even J.P. Morgan Chase Bank has had to cut back on their holiday psychic budget this year. I did some close-up magic at Eddie Murphy’s boxing party for the big match the other night and there was a conspicuous absence of psychics. This was quite unusual. I was shocked. Eddie usually stocks his soires with every concievable attraction. I have also noticed the local Malibu Shaman has had to cut back his price for a chakra cleaning to keep afloat. Hollywood just isn’t the same anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="63RCASL75FJCA3D240HCA82NOFJCAC722HHCAVTCFC4CAUBDSF0CARIHBJYCA1SIP5XCAMEF5J0CAILPYRICA9LFNZKCAW6E0HBCAPKS3GOCAIR2B49CA8O31D0CAA6UU2BCASWXQS4CA2OS6KNCAX1U8SI" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/63RCASL75FJCA3D240HCA82NOFJCAC722HHCAVTCFC4CAUBDSF0CARIHBJYCA1SIP5XCAMEF5J0CAILPYRICA9LFNZKCAW6E0HBCAPKS3GOCAIR2B49CA8O31D0CAA6UU2BCASWXQS4CA2OS6KNCAX1U8SI10.jpg" alt="63RCASL75FJCA3D240HCA82NOFJCAC722HHCAVTCFC4CAUBDSF0CARIHBJYCA1SIP5XCAMEF5J0CAILPYRICA9LFNZKCAW6E0HBCAPKS3GOCAIR2B49CA8O31D0CAA6UU2BCASWXQS4CA2OS6KNCAX1U8SI" width="112" height="136"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to think that the skeptical movement is partially responsible for this decline. I hope I’m right. It may be a combination of economics and the present obsession with change and getting to some truth that’s making it difficult for the con artists to make the money they once made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But never mind all that negativity. Mercury must be in retrograde or something. Plan a big bash and forget all that bad news! Change up to something besides Beany Babies on your mantle and that whacky Yule Log video loop on your television this season. Don’t be a party pooper! Get that “special something” to brighten up your holiday festivities, trim your downmarket  mood and put some high gloss mystery on your holiday cheer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize it's been a while since the last blog update on &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/index/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline2010&lt;/a&gt;, though bits and pieces showed up on Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook over the past few weeks. You should follow the updates on the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/News_and_Updates/" title=""&gt;News and Updates&lt;/a&gt; page and also on the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/BlogMedia_Coverage/" title=""&gt;Blog and Media Coverage&lt;/a&gt; page on the wiki in order to stay up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two new important pages on the wiki for you to check out: &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Travel_and_Hotel_Information/" title=""&gt;Travel and Hotel Information&lt;/a&gt; page has the relevant information (the exact rate for the hotel rooms will come shortly, probably Monday) on how to get here, where to stay, and how to get around. If you are driving in, or want to share a room, use the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Carpooling_and_Room-sharing/" title=""&gt;Carpooling and Room-sharing&lt;/a&gt; page to find the other interested people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are trying to organize an Early Bird dinner on Thursday, January 14th 2010, together with &lt;a href="http://www.themonti.org/" title=""&gt;The Monti&lt;/a&gt; - a local organizer of storytelling events. For this occasion, the stories will have a science theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, January 15th 2010, there will be &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Food_Tours/" title=""&gt;Food Tours&lt;/a&gt; at breakfast and lunch times, workshops at the &lt;a href="http://www.rtp.org/main/index.php?pid=202&amp;amp;sec=2" title=""&gt;PRC&lt;/a&gt; Training Facilities in RTP at 10am-12noon, and &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Lab_Tours/" title=""&gt;Lab Tours&lt;/a&gt; in the afternoon, followed by a dinner (and a talk) at the &lt;a href="http://www.rtp.org/main/index.php?pid=233&amp;amp;sec=1" title=""&gt;RTP&lt;/a&gt; Headquarters, co-sponsored by &lt;a href="http://sconc.org/" title=""&gt;Science Communicators of North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main portion of the conference - a number of sessions and demos, will be held at &lt;a href="http://www.sigmaxi.org/" title=""&gt;Sigma Xi&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday January 16th (all day) and Sunday January 17th (half day). We will have a fun evening at the Radisson hotel on Saturday night with an Ignite session and a band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Program_Suggestions/" title=""&gt;Program Suggestions&lt;/a&gt; page got so big, full of interesting ideas and discussions, that the wiki started balking - it refuses to save your edits. So I made a new page - &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Program_Finalization/" title=""&gt;Program Finalization&lt;/a&gt; - where I migrated only those sessions that have made some traction. All of the sessions listed on that page are either 'set in stone' or almost there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Program is essentially/almost finalized and will be completely finalized within about 10 days. After that, each session will get its own individual page where moderators and other participants can start discussions, ask questions, provide useful links, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you looked at the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Volunteers/" title=""&gt;Volunteers page&lt;/a&gt; before and sent a message to us offering your time and effort, don't despair - we have received them all, have a list of all of you and will get in touch with you soon about the ways you can help us. We appreciate everyone who did so already, as well as anyone who does so in the future - this is a community-organized conference and more people pitch in, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will open for registration in about a week or two. Sign up for &lt;a href="https://mistersugar.wufoo.com/forms/scienceonline2010-get-updates/" title=""&gt;e-mails&lt;/a&gt; in order to get notified on time. There are 250 spots (and all the moderators/presenters HAVE to be registered first), while almost 500 people showed some interest in showing up. So, faster you register, more likely you will be to get in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a small registration fee this year, to help us provide for you, in this bad economy, what you have learned to expect from us over the years: excellent food, coffee and program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of bad economy, this is a difficult year for everybody. The conference is bigger than ever, with more moderators/presenters than ever, with many of the moderators in need of financial help to travel, and with some of our returning sponsors hurting as well. In the past years, we always managed to provide some financial help to poor students, unemployed bloggers and people traveling from very far away (including from developing world) and we are hoping we will be able to help such folks this year again. So we need more sponsors - if you and your organization can do something for us: cash, travel grants, sponsoring a meal, sponsoring the technical support (wifi, A/V, livestreaming/recording), donating swag or advertising, etc. let us know at: info@scienceonline2010.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NESCent has already received a nice batch of blog posts submitted to their &lt;a href="http://www.nescent.org/news/TravelAward.php" title=""&gt;Travel Award contest&lt;/a&gt;. Write an evolutionary biology blogpost and send it in to them if you want to be considered for one of their two $750 travel grants for the conference - we are keeping those two spots open for the two winners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you blog about the conference, please use one of the logos/buttons from the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Promo_materials/" title=""&gt;Promotional materials&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out some of the science/nature/medicine &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/NC_blogs/" title=""&gt;NC blogs&lt;/a&gt; as many of their authors will be attending the meeting and you will be able to meet them in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also stay up to date with the news by following our &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/scio10" title=""&gt;official Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; and if you tweet, please use the &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=scio10" title=""&gt;#scio10&lt;/a&gt; hashtag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=118219988767" title=""&gt;Facebook event page&lt;/a&gt; gives us some indication of who (and how many people) intends to register. Check it out - if you have done so before but have changed your mind between "Attending", "Maybe Attending" and "Not Attending" please change your choice accordingly so we can have a better idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Science 2.0 folks have realized that FriendFeed works better than blogs, Twitter or Facebook for liveblogging conferences. Thus, for live coverage of the sessions, you should join the official &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/scienceonline2010" title=""&gt;FriendFeed group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is getting close, and it is getting exciting. I can't wait!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline2010_update_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/1aIdW800iVI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255212274666"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=17012">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/53387780b1d56ee2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Humanist Chaplain at Rutgers</title><published>2009-10-10T22:00:55Z</published><updated>2009-10-10T22:00:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/10/humanist-chaplain-at-rutgers/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was a &lt;a href="http://news.rutgers.edu/focus/issue.2009-09-21.7408167606/article.2009-10-07.9141422393"&gt;great profile&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Rutgers FOCUS&lt;/em&gt; about &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://rutgershumanist.org/"&gt;Barry Klassel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the Humanist Chaplain at the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Klassel, who has a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Columbia University, and a master’s degree in theater from the University of Pittsburgh, grew up in a Jewish household and gravitated to Humanism in college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It started with a sincere effort to try to understand what it is that human beings can know and cannot know,” he said. “My conclusion was that this world is something we can know while the spirit world is something we cannot really know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why not pay attention to what we can know?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a chaplain, Klassel said he would draw on Humanist principles of compassion and respect rather than prayer and belief in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s extremely important is compassion, the compassion of another human being who goes through issues, who has difficulties,” he said. “That kind of connection from one human being to another is just as powerful as any other type of connection.”

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007378" title=""&gt;ECG Response of Koalas to Tourists Proximity: A Preliminary Study&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Koalas operate on a tight energy budget and, thus, may not always display behavioral avoidance reaction when placed in a stressful condition. We investigated the physiological response of captive koalas Phascolarctos cinereus in a conservation centre to the presence of tourists walking through their habitat. We compared, using animal-attached data-recorders, the electrocardiogram activity of female koalas in contact with tourists and in a human-free area. One of the koalas in the tourist zone presented elevated heart rate values and variability throughout the recording period. The remaining female in the exhibit area showed a higher field resting heart rates during the daytime than that in the isolated area. In the evening, heart rate profiles changed drastically and both the koalas in the exhibit and in the tourist-free zones displayed similar field resting heart rates, which were lower than those during the day. In parallel, the autonomic nervous systems of these two individuals evolved from sympathetic-dominant during the day to parasympathetic-dominant in the evening. Our results report ECG of free-living koalas for the first time. Although they are preliminary due to the difficulty of having sufficient samples of animals of the same sex and age, our results stress out the importance of studies investigating the physiological reaction of animals to tourists.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000160" title=""&gt;Packages of Care for Mental, Neurological, and Substance Use Disorders in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: PLoS Medicine Series&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This Perspective introduces a new series in PLoS Medicine on mental health disorders in low- and middle-income countries that reviews the evidence for packages of care for ADHD, alcohol misuse disorders, dementia, depression, epilepsy, and schizophrenia.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007412" title=""&gt;Identification of Plasmodium malariae, a Human Malaria Parasite, in Imported Chimpanzees&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is widely believed that human malaria parasites infect only man as a natural host. However, earlier morphological observations suggest that great apes are likely to be natural reservoirs as well. To identify malaria parasites in great apes, we screened 60 chimpanzees imported into Japan. Using the sequences of small subunit rRNA and the mitochondrial genome, we identified infection of Plasmodium malariae, a human malaria parasite, in two chimpanzees that were imported about thirty years ago. The chimpanzees have been asymptomatic to the present. In Japan, indigenous malaria disappeared more than fifty years ago; and thus, it is most likely inferred that the chimpanzees were infected in Africa, and P. malariae isolates were brought into Japan from Africa with their hosts, suggesting persistence of parasites at low level for thirty years. Such a long term latent infection is a unique feature of P. malariae infection in humans. To our knowledge, this is the first to report P. malariae infection in chimpanzees and a human malaria parasite from nonhuman primates imported to a nonendemic country.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000681" title=""&gt;Plasticity of the Chemoreceptor Repertoire in Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rapid adaptation and phenotypic plasticity to the chemical environment are essential prerequisites for survival; and, consequently, large families of genes that mediate the recognition of olfactory and gustatory cues have evolved. We asked how flexible the expression of these genes is in the face of rapidly changing conditions encountered during an individual's lifetime. We used the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to address this question, since both the genetic composition and environmental rearing conditions can be controlled precisely in this experimentally amenable model organism. By measuring expression levels of all chemosensory genes simultaneously, we identified genes that show altered expression at different developmental stages, during aging, in males and females, following mating, and in different social conditions. We asked whether chemosensory genes are regulated independently or whether their regulation is structured. We found that chemosensory genes that are located in close proximity to one another on the chromosome are often regulated independently. However, statistical analysis showed that groups of chemosensory genes are coordinately expressed in response to a range of environmental conditions, revealing an underlying modular organization of the phenotypic plasticity of the chemosensory receptor repertoire.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007351" title=""&gt;Long-Term GPS Tracking of Ocean Sunfish Mola mola Offers a New Direction in Fish Monitoring&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Satellite tracking of large pelagic fish provides insights on free-ranging behaviour, distributions and population structuring. Up to now, such fish have been tracked remotely using two principal methods: direct positioning of transmitters by Argos polar-orbiting satellites, and satellite relay of tag-derived light-level data for post hoc track reconstruction. Error fields associated with positions determined by these methods range from hundreds of metres to hundreds of kilometres. However, low spatial accuracy of tracks masks important details, such as foraging patterns. Here we use a fast-acquisition global positioning system (Fastloc GPS) tag with remote data retrieval to track long-term movements, in near real time and position accuracy of &amp;lt;70 m, of the world&amp;#39;s largest bony fish, the ocean sunfish Mola mola. Search-like movements occurred over at least three distinct spatial scales. At fine scales, sunfish spent longer in highly localised areas with faster, straighter excursions between them. These &amp;#39;stopovers&amp;#39; during long-distance movement appear consistent with finding and exploiting food patches. This demonstrates the feasibility of GPS tagging to provide tracks of unparalleled accuracy for monitoring movements of large pelagic fish, and with nearly four times as many locations obtained by the GPS tag than by a conventional Argos transmitter. The results signal the potential of GPS-tagged pelagic fish that surface regularly to be detectors of resource &amp;#39;hotspots&amp;#39; in the blue ocean and provides a new capability for understanding large pelagic fish behaviour and habitat use that is relevant to ocean management and species conservation.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_60.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/Ftsj3d8G1uc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255204081454"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=9882">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2da1d64a14dc24f3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">AI: Eugenics</title><published>2009-10-10T19:00:24Z</published><updated>2009-10-10T19:00:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/10/ai-eugenics/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7f8dc9b4af2d865e06ed52ad165c9589&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve been a bit light and fluffy around here lately, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but here’s something a bit heavier for you to chew on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the comments to my latest &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/10/9825/"&gt;post on human evolution and “stupidity”&lt;/a&gt;, it was suggested that perhaps I underestimate the support for eugenics among skeptics.  History aside, I personally can’t get past the fact that it just feels wrong.  Not very objective, I know; i’m still thinking about it.  It seems to me that it commoditizes human life in a way that can never be ethical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think?  Could a human selective breeding program be carried out ethically?  Is this something you think will be necessary to the future survival of humanity?  &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255203141080"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=17032">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3bb825bfdf8b1578</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Sell the Vatican, Feed the World</title><published>2009-10-10T18:56:10Z</published><updated>2009-10-10T18:56:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/10/sell-the-vatican-feed-the-world/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah Silverman&lt;/strong&gt; offerer her solution to the hunger crisis on last night’s &lt;em&gt;Real Time with Bill Maher&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

The material was finally published in Science &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/ardipithecus/" rel="external "&gt;and is open access&lt;/a&gt;. I will discuss the morphology of &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus ramidus&lt;/em&gt; and its implications in a second post. In this post I would like to look at the geological, environmental, and taphonomic background to the discoveries. I examine these first because they provide strong evidence to back up some of the behavioral interpretations of &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus ramidus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;big&gt;Geology&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Middle Awash area of Ethiopia contains strata ranging in age from the Late Miocene to the Pleistocene. These strata have yielded a wide variety of botanical, invertebrate, and vertebrate fossils. Of particular importance is the Lower Aramis Member of the Sagantole Formation. The Lower Aramis Member sits atop the Gaala Vitric Tuff Complex (GATC) and below the Daam Aatu Basaltic Tuff (DABT) and crops out along a ~9 km arc. The Lower Aramis Member ranges in thickness from 3-6 m and is composed of silt, sand , and clay deposited on a low relief floodplain at some distance from the river channel. The two tuffs that sandwich the Lower Aramis member have been dated via the &lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Ar/&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar laser fusion method.  The Gaala Vitric Tuff Complex dates to 4.419 ± 0.068 Ma and the Daam Aatu Basaltic Tuff dates to 4.416 ± 0.031 Ma. These results are statistically indistinguishable and raises the question of how much time elapsed between the two.  WoldeGabriel &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, in their paper on the geology of the area argue that this time span may be somewhere between 100-10,000 years - although it could be as high as 100,000.  This is an important point, the group argues that most hominid bearing sites elsewhere represent significant periods of time and because of that do not say much about the environment of the hominids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;big&gt;Environment&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways one can reconstruct an ancient environment. White’s group used quite a few of them. First, they looked at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope_analysis" rel="external "&gt;stable isotopes&lt;/a&gt;, particularly carbon and oxygen. Results suggest the the environment ranged from woodland to grassy woodland savanna. One can also look at plant and animal fossils. One of the footnotes to the paleobiology papers tells how this material was collected and I can’t resist quoting it in full:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1994, the Middle Awash project instituted “crawls” of sedimentary outcrop between the GATC and DABT to collect all available fossil material. Crawls were generally upslope in direction, done by teams of 5 to 15 collectors who crawled the surface on hands and knees, shoulder to shoulder, collecting all fossilized biological materials between a prescribed pair of taut nylon cords. Surfaces were repeatedly collected with this technique, invariably resulting in successively depressed specimen recovery numbers in subsequent field seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of this procedure was the collection of a large quantity of botanical, invertebrate, and vertebrate fossils (including a number of new species).  The botanical material included phytoliths, endocarps and fossilized wood. Analysis of the material indicated an open grassland with ~40% tree cover in the east and increasing to ~65% in the western sites. Interestingly enough no primates were found at the eastern sites. The invertebrate fossils include insect larvae, dung beetle broodballs, gastropods, millipedes, pupal cases, and solitary bee brood cells. Most of these are rather fragile and do not survive transport well so we can conclude that they are locally derived. What these fossils indicate is a lowland forest in a semi-arid region with a high water table. The vertebrate fossils include catfish, cichlids, giant terrestrial tortoise, various species of turtle, frogs, snakes, lizards, crocodiles, 32 genera of small mammals (including 20 new species), 29 different taxa of birds (mainly terrestrial - small species being abundant and derive from owl pellets), bovids, primates, and a wide variety of carnivores. The fauna present support the picture revealed by the geomorphological, isotopic, and botanical evidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;big&gt;Taphonomy&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fossil assemblages can arise from a wide variety of different factors. They can, for example, be collected and gnawed on by porcupines, pass through the digestives system of carnivores, be trampled by other wildlife, be transported by fluvial processes, suffer exfoliation and cracking due to exposure to the elements, and a wide variety of other processes. A key to understanding them is in understanding the history of the bones themselves. One example of this is the fish fossils mentioned above. The environment is an open canopied woodland on a floodplain. The fish fossils arose via overbank flooding, yet without understanding the geomorphology of the region one might be lead to think that the environment was much wetter than it actually was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were no signs of fluvial transport  such as rounding or abrasion of the bones, nor was there indication of sorting. Most showed signs of subaerial weathering and exfoliation. Evidence of trampling was rare.  This indicates the bones were exposed for a brief period before burial. The lack of evidence for transport of the larger bones is consistent with the evidence for local derivation and burial of the small mammals and invertebrate fossils. In connection with this, I should mention that the precise location, orientation and dip of the bones was recorded.  I mention this because mudcracking does occur in this type of environment. Inevitably, rodent limb bones get tipped into them and become vertically aligned - which I think is really cool. At any rate, most of the large mammal bones showed signs of toothmarks and digestive etching by stomach acids. Complete destruction of the articular surfaces of long bones was also common - something hyenas do to extract bone marrow.  This is all summarized in one paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall Ardipithecus-bearing locality and sublocality assemblages indicate that the competition for large mammal carcasses must have been intense. Abundant shaft fragments, rare epiphyseal portions, and the extremely low representation of axial postcrania as compared to those of the appendicular and craniodental skeletons, combined with the high tooth-marking rates, suggest that the Aramis ecosystem may have matched highly competitive modern settings such as Ngorongoro Crater (10). The rarity of late-stage weathering damage characterized by
deep cracking and exfoliation (&amp;lt;3% of total specimens at stages 4 and 5) suggests that exposure to subaerial conditions before burial was brief and/or buffered by tree cover and/or leaf litter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the short time depth of the Lower Aramis Member (mentioned above) White and his group argue that the earliest of hominids did not evolve in a mixed mosaic environment, &lt;em&gt;rather they evolved in more closed habitats until the origin of the Australopithecines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Although it acts on mutations that turn up randomly, natural selection is highly nonrandom, in that (all else being equal) traits that help their owners make more babies are always the ones that spread through a population.

However, even if natural selection predictably aims for the same target, that target is not necessarily fixed. The most obvious case of this is in the coevolution of interacting species, where adaptation by one forces adaptation in the other. This is a field of study in its own right; but one recent innovation is a theory paper by Gandon and Day, which tracks changes in the &amp;quot;fitness landscape&amp;quot; resulting from adaptations and counter-adaptations [$-a]. (For more detail on the paper, see Coevolvers.)

Photo by kookr.Empirical studies have shown that selection&amp;#39;s target can move in unexpected ways, too. One of the best examples of this turned up in the course of the ongoing, decades-long study of finches on the Galapagos Island Daphne Major. As rainfall on the island fluctuated from year to year, the mix of available seeds changed as well, and the finches&amp;#39; beaks -- the size of which determines what seeds are easily cracked and eaten -- evolved to keep up [$-a]. The resulting evolutionary path looks like a drunkard&amp;#39;s walk, and the study&amp;#39;s authors, Peter and Rosemary Grant, put the word unpredictable right in the title.

Making things still more complicated, there is actually a random component to the effects of natural selection. That is, in the real world, advantageous traits may not automatically result in greater fitness -- they result in greater expected fitness. Last year, Sean Rice published a mathematical model of evolution in which fitness is a random variable. He found that greater variation around the expected fitness can increase the strength of natural selection; that is, more uncertainty about the relationship between fitness and a given trait may actually make that trait adapt more rapidly. In a just-published extension of this work, Rice and Anthony Papadopolous examined the effect of random migration among different populations on adaptive evolution in each population, and found that greater variation in migration rates can reduce the effect of migration on local evolution.

Introducing all this randomness into our view of evolution doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily make evolution unpredictable. As an excellent recent Radiolab episode discusses, there are patterns to be extracted from randomness. It takes more work -- larger sample sizes, longer-term studies -- for these patterns to become apparent. Yet it&amp;#39;s clear that this is work we&amp;#39;ll have to do in order to understand biological systems.

Today, the 10th of October is &lt;strong&gt;‘Squid Day/Cuttlefish Day, or Squidturday, covering the &lt;strong&gt;ten&lt;/strong&gt;tacular species’.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here is a special interview with the award-winning, Science Blog Anthology published and regularly quoted, cited and loved blogger - &lt;a href="http://www.digitalcuttlefish.blogspot.com"&gt;Digital Cuttlefish!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping to secure an interview with them for the Cephalopodcast show in the near future - in the meantime, they have kindly agreed to the following blog interview. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kylie: “The Digital Cuttlefish” as a name is quite unique! Why a cephalopod? Why that one?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Cuttlefish:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; I didn’t actually choose the name; it was given to me.  Part of it, anyway.  A friend called me a cuttlefish–I had no idea what she meant.  Turns out, anyone who hides in their ink (poets, writers–especially anonymous or pseudonymous writers) are “cuttlefish” where she lives.  The “digital” part was simply a recognition that my hiding in ink is actually hiding in pixels. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K: When did you first begin writing verse?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My parents have, framed on their wall, a calligraphic rendition of a verse I wrote in, I think, first grade (or grade one, depending on your nationality).  Six lines, iambic tetrameter, aabbcc.  I still can quote it.  But I won’t.  I have handed in assignments in high school and college, which I wrote as sonnets.  Not because it was required, but because I could.  Verse comes very easily to me–much easier than unrhymed poetry, which always sounds horrible.  (Mine, that is; I very much appreciate good poetry.  I just don’t write it.) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K: You’re an Order of the Molly winner and recently &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/pharyngula"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt; blog, the site of PZ Myers, linked to you about a poem on astronomy. You have quite a range of topics, from religion, social commentary, psychology and ethics - however, do you have a preference for cephalopod poetry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Myers has linked to me a few times–once for astronomy, once for a religiously motivated double suicide (a modern Romeo and Juliet), once for a gay marriage verse… there might be more.  I usually just write about whatever I see that interests me, and virtually everything interests me, to the point where I have to set limits for myself.  Specializing in cephalopods may be a way of limiting, rather than a way of opening up.  Besides, they are so cool.  And with my moniker, there comes a bit of cephalopod oblige, and I feel a bit compelled to report on, say, Truman the Octopus, or the latest NY Times story on cuttlefish coloration, or Cephalopod Appreciation Days, or Squidmas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K: Which particular verse form do you prefer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.digitalcuttlefish.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" src="http://img79.imageshack.us/img79/7854/digcuttlefishbanner1.jpg" alt="" width="249" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wow.  Um… I would like to think that I try to stretch a bit, and throw the occasional challenge at myself, playing with metrical feet (iamb, anapest, dactyl, etc.), tetrameter, pentameter, hexameter… I have written dozens of sonnets, hundreds of limericks (obviously, not all of my verse is on my blog), a handful of other formal poems (villanelles, terza rima, etc.). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;But.  In truth, I tend to keep coming back to a very small handful of very simple forms, and these other things are exceptions to the rule.  I don’t know if there is a label for my usual form (I’m not a trained poet, so I don’t know all the vocabulary); it is close to a classic ballad form, but with variations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I like to play around with the forms some, so that a very light form reports on a tragedy, for instance, or an epic poem describes something silly.  But sometimes (like with the double suicide mentioned above) nothing but a sonnet will do, or sometimes nothing but an epigrammatic heroic couplet.  And I am very fond of parody poems, so Frost, or Marlowe, or Shakespeare, or Gilbert, get to help me with writing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think this is the long way of saying “I don’t know.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K: What advice would you give to those who are interested in communicating science concepts via verse?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why on earth would someone want to do that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K: &lt;/strong&gt;:p&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ok… advice.  Don’t suck.  There is too much bad verse out there (I have contributed my share) and much more even worse unrhymed poetry (there, I plead not guilty).  Science concepts are so interesting, so complex, so vast, that there is a good chance of being overwhelmed by the material.  It would be easy to oversimplify the science, or to overcomplicate the poem.  I have done both. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read lots of science.  Read lots of poetry.  Don’t write about something you don’t know about (yes, I have); once you do know, you will find that two wonderful things happen–first, the number of things you can write about will increase, and your vocabulary will become better tuned to the writing.  It is not always about having more words to choose from–sometimes having fewer words (but the right ones) is a tremendous help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Practice.  Lots.  Stretch your writing muscles.  Do parodies.  Challenge yourself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K: You have a &lt;a href="https://www.lulu.com/commerce/index.php?fBuyContent=4725658"&gt;book out on Lulu.com&lt;/a&gt;, which was the result of a year and a half’s work online - what will be your next step with your work? Is there another book on the way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Sort of.  It’s actually an expanded version of the first book (at least, this is the current plan), which honestly was put together because some people requested it for last christmas season, and got thrown together in a hurry, without proper chapters, or introduction, or anything.  The new version (and now that you ask, I may have to update the manuscript yet again) will also include some illustrations by the genius who drew my banner art cuttlefish–Michael McRae.  This version of the book, I hope, I may actually even take the additional steps to get the ISBN registration, and get into bookstores.  It is really a difficult thing to simultaneously be a cuttlefish hiding pseudonymously, and promote a book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K: Well, I hope to help by doing my part in promoting it! Thanks, Digital Cuttlefish! &lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So 
I decided to switch my recipe posts to saturday. I'll try to be reliable about posting a
recipe every saturday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; I tried making homemade salsa for the first time about about two
months ago. Once I'd made a batch of homemade, that was pretty much
the end of buying salsa. It's really easy to make, and fresh is just
&lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much better than anything out of a jar. When it takes just
five minutes of cooking to make, there's just no reason to pay someone
else for a jar of something that's not nearly as good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This recipe isn't much to look at. It's a tomato salsa - it looks
pretty much like a salsa you'd buy in a store, except that it's a
paler pink, because the tomatoes weren't cooked down. But in terms of
taste, it's an absolute knockout.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; The original version of this recipe came from
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0898155177?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=goodmathbadma-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0898155177"&gt;Mark
Miller's Salsa
cookbook.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=goodmathbadma-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0898155177" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt;, which is a fantastic little book. But
since I first made it, I've made enough changes that it's really a
very different salsa. Obviously, I like mine better :-).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/10/saturday_recipe_home-made_roas.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/10/saturday_recipe_home-made_roas.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/uTmnaNPMo10" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255192533662"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/?p=1926">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c69a2bbc9410d48b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Ardipithecus Is Ready For Her Close-Up</title><published>2009-10-10T16:32:02Z</published><updated>2009-10-10T16:32:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/10/10/ardipithecus-is-ready-for-her-close-up/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow the Discovery Channel will show an &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/10/01/ardipithecus-we-meet-at-last/"&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/a&gt; documentary. I’ve embedded a couple preview clips they’ve been sending around. I don’t have cable myself (the same way an alcoholic doesn’t keep cases of gin). So I’ll leave it to commenters to offer reviews tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s obviously a striking parallel with the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/05/27/big-ratings-for-darwinius-day-so-how-was-it-cable-viewers/"&gt;TV mania&lt;/a&gt; that recently surrounded another primate fossil, Darwinius. Personally, I don’t see anything amiss (a priori, at least), with a documentary coming out right after a journal paper gets published. What I don’t relish is when the publicity for a show distorts the news coverage of a fossil, as happened with Darwinius. So I’d be curious what people who watch the show think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re not taking sips from the same Cup of Jesus’ Blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re not shaking hands to greet each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottles of Purell hand sanitizer now rest upon the altar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silly rituals aside, the precautions make a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That led a Raleigh citizen to write a letter-to-the-editor in which she &lt;a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/letters/story/118300.html"&gt;accused Church leaders&lt;/a&gt; of “suffering from a crisis of faith” because, of course, the blood of Jesus can never be contaminated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So my household will continue to serve the Lord and to partake of the blood of Jesus, believing that the blood of our Lord Jesus cannot be contaminated by the evils of this world and will never harm us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it distressful that the pandemic flu has the power to change ancient Roman Catholic ritual, even temporarily. What would Mother Teresa say?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last question poses a fun little mind game for you…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Todd Stiefel&lt;/strong&gt;, a Humanist from the area, wrote a rebuttal to her letter and it was &lt;a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/story/128011.html"&gt;published earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;.  It offers an answer to the Mother Teresa question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Contending that doctrine asserts that the blood of Jesus in such rituals cannot be contaminated does not refute reality and leads people to unnecessary disease exposure. Putting ancient ritual and baseless belief ahead of modern science leads to the deaths of innocent people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone with a primary immune deficiency, I urge people to act by putting human lives, like my own, ahead of unfounded wishful thinking. &lt;strong&gt;You ask what would Mother Teresa say? Given her opposition to the use of condoms to prevent the spread of another virus, HIV, she would likely agree that it is better to put faith ahead of life. I believe this is vile.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a humanist, I implore the religious to keep the good in their doctrines and cast aside the false, immoral and intolerant.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the response is an excellent one.  It’s not snarky or mean.  It just spells out her own erroneous beliefs about condoms.  It’s bad enough when people have blind faith.  It’s even worse when people’s faith makes them blind to reality (even more than usual, anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also stresses the importance of reality.  Just because you think Jesus is magic doesn’t deny the fact that churchgoers are not immune from the diseases of the world.  They would be wise to play it safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(By the way, in the spirit of full disclosure, I should mention that Todd has offered the &lt;a href="http://secularstudents.org"&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt; a generous matching grant — I’ll write more about that soon.)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Crislip calmly explains the evidence regarding flu vaccination and why it's safe and effective. Perhaps the most important point there is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;So it's a suboptimal vaccine.  And that's a problem. One, because it will make it more difficult to prove efficacy in clinical studies and two, there is a sub group of anti vaccine goofs who seem to require that vaccines either be perfect, with 100% efficacy and 100% safe, or they are not worth taking.

&lt;p&gt;The influenza vaccine is not 100% efficacious in preventing disease, but it is as close to 100% safe, and much safer than the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest bits of nonsense about the flu vaccine (and, come to think of it, most vaccines) that the anti-vaccine movement promulgates is that if it isn't 100% safe and 100% effective, then it's crap. Unfortunately, virtually nothing in medicine is 100% effective or safe, but vaccines come pretty darned close to 100% safe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/now_theres_a_cage_match_id_like_to_see_w.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/now_theres_a_cage_match_id_like_to_see_w.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/qvI8rgUQjL8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255188672745"><id gr:original-id="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/?p=1161">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8e2c80c8e82046a3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Photo</title><published>2009-10-10T15:05:14Z</published><updated>2009-10-10T15:05:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/10/10/photo/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian’s &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2009/10/photo_of_the_day_728_hidden_fa.php"&gt;waterfall photo&lt;/a&gt; reminded me that I had a couple of stream and waterfall photos:&lt;/p&gt;

Tear into it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I neglected to say more clearly, but should have, is that what I'm complaining about is the creationists' blithe conflation of complexity with order. We can build up immense amounts of complexity from nothing but noise, so just babbling about how complicated something is says nothing about the impossibility of its origin from chance events. Order, functionality, and, as &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/10/jonathan-wells-3.html#comment-195048"&gt;Joe Felsenstein defined it&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;adaptedness&lt;/i&gt; are more relevant properties, and we have a natural mechanism for generating those, too.

&lt;p&gt;Someone over at the RDF also mentioned that he thought the Q&amp;amp;A was really good, too. I agree — I need to learn to shut up more and just get the interactivity going.

It was a horrible spectacle, but Dawkins kept his cool. Look at O'Reilly's arguments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/ECE77Imki9M%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm, let&amp;#39;s see. O&amp;#39;Reilly claims we don&amp;#39;t know everything, which is entirely true, so somehow this justifies his belief in Jesus. Dawkins had a great answer to that: &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a most of extraordinary piece of warped logic to say because science can&amp;#39;t fill in a particular gap you&amp;#39;re going throw in your lot with Christianity.&amp;quot; Another point I like to toss in against that line of nonsense is that science at least has the integrity to say that we don&amp;#39;t know yet what happened in a particular gap (but we may be working on it, and have a more useful strategy than waiting for a holy man to have a vision), while the religious wackaloons will instead fill that gap with pious certainty…a kind of clot of myth that we&amp;#39;re eventually going to have to rip out in the face of great resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we got the usual arguments: science provides no moral framework, but Jesus does. If that's the case, why have Christians always been such a warring, nasty, oppressive lot? They've got this ideal of a self-sacrificing man of peace at their center, but Christianity itself seems to drive in the opposite direction. Please explain to me the opulence of the Vatican, the Thirty Years War, and the Prosperity Gospel, just as a preliminary exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O'Reilly is committing a stupid logical fallacy when he trots out the old "there are more Christians than atheists" argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, we get the usual O'Reilly tactic of shouting at his guest that he's a fascist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn't a very enlightening interview, except in that it confirms that O'Reilly is a blustering moron while Dawkins is an intelligent gentleman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/oreilly_dawkins_or_what_happen.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/k-F7tEZf-Jg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255188064840"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/weekend_diversion_is_your_scho.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/37038918931c72b0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Random Stuff"/><title type="html">Weekend Diversion: Is Your School Prepared for H1N1 Zombies?!</title><published>2009-10-10T16:03:41Z</published><updated>2009-10-10T16:03:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/weekend_diversion_is_your_scho.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's nothing quite like a Bob Dylan song performed to perfection by someone &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; than Bob Dylan.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Along_the_Watchtower"&gt;All Along the Watchtower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockin&amp;#39;_on_Heaven&amp;#39;s_Door"&gt;Knockin' on Heaven's Door&lt;/a&gt; are the most common ones, but a little further off the beaten path is &lt;a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/#/songs/girl-north-country"&gt;Girl from the North Country&lt;/a&gt;, which is knocked out-of-the-park here by &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcIDjl2w1E0"&gt;Sam Bush&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Now, the college I'm at has issued warnings about the symptoms of both swine and regular flu, and what to do in case of infection.  But they've said nothing about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkeye_(South_Park)"&gt;that disease that turns you into a zombie&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/weekend_diversion_is_your_scho/zombies.jpg" width="500" height="366" title="Beer?  Brains?  Not like a zombie&amp;#39;s going to tell the difference..." alt="zombies.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the University of Florida has come &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-16753-Zombie-Examiner~y2009m10d1-University-of-Floridas-zombie-attack-plan"&gt;to the rescue&lt;/a&gt;, outlining a six-page procedure for &lt;a href="http://chalkboard.blogs.gainesville.com/11334/uf-site-has-emergency-plan-for-zombie-attack/"&gt;how to respond to a Zombie Attack&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to a little bit of basic strategy:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/weekend_diversion_is_your_scho/2193614078_177552e675.jpg" width="500" height="400" title="Even more informative than the &amp;#39;homeland security&amp;#39; posters from 8 years ago!" alt="2193614078_177552e675.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document details response plans, the appropriate Human Resources response of terminating the employee's salary upon zombification, and what &lt;i&gt;action items&lt;/i&gt; need to take place:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Equip all staff offices with "blackout curtains" to prevent identifying worker locations to zombies;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equip all offices with easily barricaded doors able to withstand prolonged zombie incursion attempts;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equip staff with laptops and ensure IPCC software is installed, tested, and working for staff who may find commuting to work to be difficult;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equip all staff with long range (e.g. rifles) and short range (e.g. hand guns) firearms or other weaponry (e.g. chain saws, baseball bats, LPs) for defense against the infected and to dispatch possibly infected co-workers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
But the best parts come at the end.  There's page five, which is a form to fill out concerning whom you killed, with what, and why you &lt;i&gt;thought&lt;/i&gt; they were a zombie.  (This is funnier in light of &lt;a href="http://www.shootfirstlaw.org/"&gt;an actual Florida law&lt;/a&gt; that was passed a few years ago that allows you to kill someone simply because "you feel threatened".)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on the very last page, we have the identifying mark of a UF document: &lt;b&gt;the obvious typo&lt;/b&gt;.  Yes, even with a zombie attack imminent, spellcheck is never an option:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/weekend_diversion_is_your_scho/zombietypo.jpg" width="500" title="Do witnessses have brainsss?" alt="zombietypo.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like zombie humor, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/weekend_diversion_is_your_scho/GS18357102.PDF"&gt;the 'official' UF document&lt;/a&gt; is good for a laugh, and who couldn't use one of those this weekend?

&lt;div style="width:346px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/10/cowboy-alex.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/10/cowboy-alex.jpg" alt="Photo/Jill Cornfield" width="336" height="480"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo/Jill Cornfield&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because we’ve all become Halloween-mad, or because of the kids or because autism makes it a bit of a project.  Whatever the reason, I’m glad to find that there are literally thousands of tips online for surviving and even enjoying the day (or week or month).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oneplaceforspecialneeds.com/resources_online/resource_online_results.html?words=halloween"&gt;One Place for Special Needs&lt;/a&gt; likes to post lots of videos among its resources.  If, unlike our family, you’re lucky enough &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to own your own DVD or video of “It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,” you can watch part of it on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Youtube&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;One place&lt;/em&gt; links to the trick-or-treating part, which can be helpful for kids to study how to trick-or-treat.  (We were thinking Ned should make the Charlie Brown ghost costume with all the extra holes — we have an old white sheet that would be perfect — but he’s chickening out.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Wondering how to make a Halloween costume for a child with sensory integration dysfunction? &lt;a href="http://www.autismsupport.org/halloween.html"&gt;Autismsupport.org&lt;/a&gt; has instructions and advice (sweatshirts and sweatpants are your best friends).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Kimmy Krocker has posted a fun &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAr9ZVr7S-M"&gt;Youtube video&lt;/a&gt; of herself making gluten-free, casein-free Halloween sugar cookies. It’s a straightforward video, but stick around for the recipe at the end, when she runs part of Bernard Herrmann’s mood-setting music from “Psycho.”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There’s no law saying you have to trick-or-treat.  Have your own small party or themed get-together or see what other community alternatives there are.  &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-22693-Philadelphia-Autism--Parenting-Examiner~y2009m10d2-Autism-101-Halloween-with-autistic-children"&gt;These and other tips&lt;/a&gt; are courtesy of Beth Kelleher, the Philadelphia Autism and Parenting Examiner.  Beth has other tips coming up for Halloween, so check &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-22693-Philadelphia-Autism--Parenting-Examiner"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;for more info.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe what we need are more comedians tackling these issues, mocking them mercilessly and letting people laugh at those who think diluted water can cure all ills, and that some people have the power to predict the future while never quite seeming to be able to win the lotto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I like David Mitchell and Dara O’Briain. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZemJD-9IIqk"&gt;They tell it like it is&lt;/a&gt;. And they’re really funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I say that, but there were 398 other people there too. And I didn’t actually get to meet Attenborough. Or even see him. But we were in the same room. I say ‘room’, but I mean the Science Museum. He touched Karen James’ shoulder! And she’s my friend, so that counts. Doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97355030@N00/383150395/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/182/383150395_b1c2bd8c28.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where was I? Oh yes. &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/UE19877E8/blog/2009/09/17/in-which-i-need-a-hero"&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/programmes/who/david_attenborough.shtml"&gt;David Attenborough&lt;/a&gt; is a hero to many. On the other hand, Charles Darwin has been turned into a &lt;em&gt;saint&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve reviewed the movie &lt;a href="http://www.lablit.com/article/543"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. These are some thoughts that didn’t quite make it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/about/editors/#editor"&gt;Philip Campbell&lt;/a&gt; welcomed us to the &lt;span&gt;IMAX&lt;/span&gt; theatre at the Science Museum, telling us that &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; is a magazine as well as a journal; the narrative is as important as the science. (There may have been a small cheer from the LabLit representatives at this point.) After welcoming various luminaries (the producer Jeremy Thomas, screenwriter John Collee and Toby Jones—who played Thomas Huxley), he introduced the director John Amiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This place is so cool!” Amiel said, before apologizing that the film was in 35 mm and not &lt;span&gt;IMAX&lt;/span&gt;. He played on the narrative theme again, explaining but not apologizing for the liberties taken with objective reality: He made the point that a ‘true’ dramatization would have to spend eight years studying barnacles: ’I’m not going to say, &lt;em&gt;guys it’s only a movie: get a life.&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film we were about to see was an imaginative rather than a literal truth, dealing with the spirit of Charles Darwin: man and scientist, because his ‘life and science were one piece’. I don’t know if it was intended, but I saw him drawing direct parallels with the Biblical account of creation. Truth in spirit if not in literal fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature selects for survival; man for appearance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film was a feast of visual elements and hidden meaning. The (fictionalized) account of Jemmy Button and the del Fuegians; the bad science (or medicine, rather) juxtaposed with the bad theology; Jenny the orangutan; the process of decay, Huxley’s bullying and the balance of nature with a fox and a stunt rabbit. The opening scene of the movie, with the finger of Charles reminding us forcefully of the finger of Michelangelo’s God. (And I would have cheerfully held Darwin’s coat while he thumped the vicar—or performed harm bodily and grievous myself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would do well not to idolize our scientific heroes. Darwin himself tells the doctor that ‘logic isn’t everything’—and tries to make a childish bargain with God for the life of Annie. All great scientific advances are made by human beings, heir to the same heartache and thousand natural shocks as all flesh: and the message of &lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt; is that this, not our idealized notions, is true cause for celebration.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Richard Grant</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/posts.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/posts.rss</id><title type="html">Confessions of a (former) Lab Rat</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.nature.com/rpg/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255183687035"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=1624">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a5e1a8846e9253e2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Challenges to Science"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Psychology"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Technology"/><category term="You Tube"/><category term="anxiety"/><category term="Australia"/><category term="BBC"/><category term="brain power"/><category term="Brain Science"/><category term="Juggling"/><category term="Magic"/><category term="mathematics"/><category term="multiple sclerosis"/><category term="news"/><category term="Oxford"/><category term="research"/><category term="therapy"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">This Is Your Brain On Juggling</title><published>2009-10-10T12:06:15Z</published><updated>2009-10-10T12:06:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/poles4xjRM8/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/2009/10/this-is-your-brain-on-juggling/"/><content xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img style="border:0" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" alt="ResearchBlogging.org"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Great looking headline at BBC News - “&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8297764.stm"&gt;Juggling Increases Brain Power&lt;/a&gt;“, about a forthcoming study in Nature Neuroscience, where results indicated a 5% increase in white matter - the ‘cabling network of the brain’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The scientists studied a group of 24 healthy young adults, none of whom could juggle. They divided them into two groups. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the groups was given weekly training sessions in juggling for six weeks and was asked to practice 30 minutes every day the other 12 continued as normal. After training, the 12 jugglers could perform at least two continuous cycles of the classic three ball cascade…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;…At the six week point, a 5% increase in white matter was shown in a rear section of the brain called the intraparietal sulcus for the jugglers… The Oxford team said this must be down to the time spent training and practising rather than the level of skill attained. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The famous juggling skills of &lt;span&gt;Michael Moschen is probably not what the average person is going to attain, I must point out!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjHoedoSUXY"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjHoedoSUXY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, work is still being done on the validity of the study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr Johansen-Berg said there were clinical applications for this work but there were a long way off. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;She said: “Knowing that pathways in the brain can be enhanced may be significant in the long run in coming up with new treatments for neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, where these pathways become degraded.” Professor Cathy Price, of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, said: “It’s extremely exciting to see evidence that training changes human white matter connections. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This compliments other work showing grey matter changes with training and motivates further work to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying these effects.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I was asking around if anyone had heard about further research on this topic. In particular, any correlation between juggling and mathematical ability. This was because my Calculus teacher taught us how to juggle in Year 11, saying that it ‘would help us to understand the subject better’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No idea what gave him that notion, but there’s certainly a lot of mathematics and science &lt;em&gt;involved&lt;/em&gt; in juggling, with a few &lt;a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/ebulletin/news/press-releases/2000-2009/2006/02/nparticle-5cy-jwt-3jd"&gt;science fairs and lectures&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a title="paper link" href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9890%28199406%2F07%29101%3A6%3C507%3AJDAD%3E2.0.CO%3B2-M"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; (also see the end of this blog entry!), websites on ‘&lt;a title="science of juggling" href="http://www2.bc.edu/%7Elewbel/jugweb/science-1.html"&gt;the science of juggling&lt;/a&gt;‘ and even &lt;a title="maths and juggling book" href="http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Juggling-Burkard-Polster/dp/0387955135"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; which expand on the applications of juggling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“There are detailed descriptions of jugglable and attractive juggling sequences, easy zero-gravity juggling, robot juggling, as well as fun juggling of words, anti-balls, and irrational numbers. The book also includes novel, or at least not very well known connections with topics such as bell ringing, knot theory, and the many body problem. In fact, the chapter on mathematical bell ringing has been expanded into the most comprehensive survey in the literature of the mathematics used by bell ringers.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, the ‘robot juggling’ bit? The late, great ‘father of the information age’ - &lt;a title="obit for Claude Shannon" href="http://www2.bc.edu/%7Elewbel/Shannon.html"&gt;Claude Shannon:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBHGzRxfeJY"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBHGzRxfeJY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When poking about, I discovered this study: ‘&lt;a title="paper" href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1876467"&gt;Effect of juggling therapy on anxiety disorders in female patients&lt;/a&gt;‘ (Nakahara, T., Nakahara, K., Uehara, M., Koyama, K., et al, 2007):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of juggling therapy for anxiety disorder patients… Depression, anger-hostility scores of POMS were improved more than non-jugglers. In the juggling group, activity scores on the vigor subscale of POMS and FAI score were significantly higher than those in the non juggling group (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Other mood scores of POMS did not differ between the two groups… These findings suggest that juggling therapy may be effective for the treatment of anxiety disorders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I’ll be heading down to the UWA Juggling club and asking if they’d mind helping out with my pool of subjects for a follow up study! I did find that the ‘juggling’ element &lt;a title="news item on it" href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s1029268.htm"&gt;stemmed from an earlier paper that I remembered seeing in the news&lt;/a&gt; - ‘Changes in gray matter induced by training’ (&lt;a title="paper" href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v427/n6972/abs/427311a.html"&gt;Dragansky, B., Gaser, C., Busch, V., Schuierer, G. et al, 2004&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here we use whole-brain magnetic-resonance imaging to visualize learning-induced plasticity in the brains of volunteers who have learned to juggle. We find that these individuals show a transient and selective structural change in brain areas that are associated with the processing and storage of complex visual motion. This discovery of a stimulus-dependent alteration in the brain’s macroscopic structure contradicts the traditionally held view that cortical plasticity is associated with functional rather than anatomical changes. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better than a bowling ball in the face, at least. Yet I have found &lt;a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/5615.php"&gt;questions about the longevity&lt;/a&gt; of any beneficial effects of juggling too, &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v427/n6972/abs/427311a.html"&gt;in that same study&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interestingly, increase in brain size does not last. After three months of no practice, the group that learned to juggle lost their gained brain power and the enhanced brain regions decreased in size.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘The brain is like a muscle, we need to exercise it,’ says May. While the effects appear to only be transient, the study provides an example of how activity may have growth benefits on the brain. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really shouldn’t be on the computer; I should be packing for my trip up to New York for a wedding.  But I wanted to say two things.  Like Hemant and PZ Myers (as well as countless others, no doubt) I read all the comments on my posts.  There was quite an unexpected reaction to my last post, so I looked back and realized I was unclear about my position.  That’s my mistake; I hope to write up a clarifying post this weekend, relatives and ceremonies allowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I couldn’t pass up the chance to share Herb Silverman’s &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/herb_silverman/2009/10/a_case_for_nothing.html"&gt;most recent post on On Faith&lt;/a&gt;.  I found myself wanting to quote too much – it’s a short entry – but I’ll try not to violate copyright law:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man entered a small courtyard and saw an altar with a large zero in the middle and a banner that said NIL. White-robed people were kneeling before the altar chanting hymns to The Great Nullity and The Blessed Emptiness. The man turned to a white-robed observer beside him and asked, “Is Nothing Sacred?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that Karen Armstrong and I would agree that nothing is sacred, but from opposite sides of this pun. Ms. Armstrong believes in a god about which or whom you can say nothing, and I see no thing worthy of worship. Our differences are less about supernatural beings than about supersemantical beings. Many liberal religionists define “God” in a way that totally blurs any distinction between theism and atheism, for example, as Nature, the Potential Within, Love, and so forth. One could easily “convert” me, an atheist, into a believer by a judicious definition of a deity, but so what?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: Herb Silverman is the president of my organization, the Secular Coalition for America.  But reading his writing at On Faith, you can see why I would be proud to link to him even if I had a different job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out and leave a comment for Herb!  Then come back to FriendlyAtheist and talk about how we can reach out to the ‘functional atheists.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.maia-krakow.org/images/logo.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.maia-krakow.org/images/logo.png" title="MAIA" width="347" height="351"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; What is the &lt;a href="http://www.krakowpost.com/article/1626"&gt;significance of this march&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“We want to show that there are non-believers living in Poland,” Ewelina Podsiad, the chief organiser of the march, told the &lt;em&gt;Krakow Post&lt;/em&gt;. According to the MAiA website, the non-theist minority needs to be recognised because “in a situation when a minority is not visible, it is easy to discriminate against it, to exclude its interests and rights, especially in the crucial area of legislation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The march’s organisers want to show Polish society that there are non-believers amongst them, and argue that the country’s legislation should reflect this. Ms. Podsiad also explained that it’s important for non-believers to realise that they are not alone. Around 300 participants are expected at the march tomorrow afternoon. While Ms. Podsiad does not expect trouble from religious or extremist groups, MAiA has nonetheless applied for police protection to ensure the safety of the marchers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a big deal in one of the most Pope-friendly cities in the world.  I wish them well and look forward to positive reports from the march. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met this pale wraith of a cat in Fredericksburg, Virginia, during the same trip that I visited the &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/30/a-day-at-the-museum/"&gt;National Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/dscn4139.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Cat sleeping on the stone fence at the Sunken Road, Fredericksburg, Va." src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/dscn4139.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="Cat sleeping on the stone fence at the Sunken Road, Fredericksburg, Va." width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It’s spectral appearance seemed appropriate, because it was sleeping atop the stone wall along the infamous Sunken Road of the &lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/frsp/historyculture/fburghist.htm"&gt;Battle of Fredericksburg&lt;/a&gt;. On December 13, 1862, in a series of massed assaults, 30,000 Union troops attempted to cross 400 yards of open space in order to reach the Confederate infantry entrenched behind the wall on which the cat lay. None made it. To the cat’s right, 8,000 Union soldiers fell, dead or wounded; a lesser number of Confederates fell behind the wall (right side of the photo). It was upon seeing this slaughter that Robert E. Lee remarked, “It is well that war is so terrible. We should grow too fond of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Have you ever been camping and you were worried about those mosquitos &lt;/em&gt;[sic]&lt;em&gt; outside near your camp light? Wondering how soon it will be before they attack you in your sleep? Well, today’s the day that the “AntiMosquito” app will save your life! It produces ultrasonic-sounds, ranging from 16 KHz to 20 KHz, at frequencies that are way too high for us — humans — to hear! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I personally tried this app when I was on vacation and it worked perfectly! There is one downside to this app, but it’s not really the developer’s fault but rather Mother Nature’s: other animals can here &lt;/em&gt;[sic]&lt;em&gt; these sounds and could make them go crazy. The only other problem is that a few people stated that some mosquitoes (again Mother Nature) aren’t affected by these sounds. So a “patch” would be appreciated to cover these specific mosquitoes.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, gentle readers, I believe you know what I’m going to say about this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BULL.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHIT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2008/09/09/do-those-mosquito-zappy-things-really-work/"&gt;covered, in detail, &lt;strong&gt;the utter failure of any ultrasound device&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to repel anything besides common sense.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And, perhaps, money is also repelled out of your wallet.&lt;a href="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/mozzywtf.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="bogus-display" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/mozzywtf.jpg?w=106&amp;amp;h=150" alt="bogus-display" width="106" height="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developers of this app have clearly gone to a great deal of time and trouble to make this thing look like it’s doing &lt;a title="screen shot" href="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/mozzywtf.jpg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And, for all I know, &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; the iPhone is *capable* of producing sound in these frequencies–which is doubtful–it may really be doing so.  However, that doesn’t change the fact that ultrasound has been shown again and again and again over the last 20 years to utterly FAIL at repelling mozzies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to direct your attention to this excellent publication by Purdue University’s Extension service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can provide that note in a PDF form, if you would like to print it out and have it handy to give to credulous folks that want to tell you that this app does anything.&lt;/p&gt;

So perhaps it&amp;#39;s not surprising that the rate of new findings is not so rapid as occurs in newer areas – such as stem cells.But fascinating new results on telomeres and telomerase do still appear, and one of them connects with more recent research areas – such as Wnt signaling and... stem cells.Here&amp;#39;s the press release:Discovery pinpoints new connection between cancer cells, stem cells (7/1/09)A molecule called telomerase, best known for enabling unlimited cell division of stem cells and cancer cells, has a surprising additional role in the expression of genes in an important stem cell regulatory pathway, say researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine. The unexpected finding may lead to new anticancer therapies and a greater understanding of how adult and embryonic stem cells divide and specialize.Don&amp;#39;t bother getting excited about the &amp;quot;new anticancer therapies&amp;quot; bit. That&amp;#39;s just boilerplate that about 77.3% of all press releases dealing with cell biology contain, presumably to impress the rubes. If you need something to get excited about, you might recall that telomerase is also being investigated intensively in connection with issues of aging and longevity, independently from cancer. However, while it&amp;#39;s possible that something of medical significance may come from this research, that&amp;#39;s probably way down the road.Before discussing the new research, let&amp;#39;s review some of the background on telomeres, telomerase, and Wnt signaling.To begin with, a telomere is a series of short repeated segments of DNA found at the ends of chromosomes in all eukaryotic cells. In cells of vertebrate animals the repeated segment is TTAGGG (where the letters represent nucleobases: T=thymine, A=adenine, G=guanine).The total number of nucleotides in these repeated segments varies a great deal from species to species, but in humans it is (initially) about 10,000 nucleotides (or ~1700 complete segments). I say &amp;quot;initially&amp;quot;, because part of the telomere is lost every time a cell divides – perhaps 50 to 200 nucleotides per division. Obviously, this means that an adult cell newly derived from a stem cell can divide at most 50-200 times before the telomere is all gone. In practice, the number is a lot less than the maximum, perhaps 40 to 60 times, which is called the Hayflick limit. Cells are programmed to stop dividing on reaching this limit, since otherwise useful DNA would be lost or damaged upon further division.Why does this loss occur? It seems to be somewhat of an accident of the nitty-gritty details of how DNA replication occurs during cell division. I won&amp;#39;t go into that, since it&amp;#39;s best explained with some diagrams; you can read about it at Wikipedia. In fact, in the early days of molecular biology (around 1972), what happens at the end of chromosomes during DNA replication was rather puzzling, and the puzzle was called the &amp;quot;end replication problem&amp;quot;. Now it&amp;#39;s pretty well understood, though somewhat messy.In any case, the loss of DNA from the telomeres during cell division is a fact, and it conveniently explains the existence of the Hayflick limit, which had been recognized since 1965. What happens when the teleomere is all used up and the limit is reached? Cells that have reached the limit don&amp;#39;t necessarily die (though they might), but they do stop dividing, and they enter a static phase of cell like known as senescence.If you think about it, senescence can be a problem, especially in certain tissues that need to continually replenish their cells, such as skin and the lining of the intestines, as well as hair, fingernails, etc. How is senescence circumvented in such tissues? The answer is (adult) stem cells. It turns out that stem cells are not subject to the Hayflick limit. It&amp;#39;s not clear whether they are subject to limits at all.Like any other cell type, stem cells also divide (by the process technically known as mitosis). But there is one difference from the way &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; cells divide. Stem cells can divide asymmetrically, where one daughter cell is another stem cell, but the other daughter is a &amp;quot;progenitor cell&amp;quot;, which is close to a normal, fully-differentiated adult cell of a fixed tissue type. Progenitor cells differentiate further into the final form when they divide, and they are able to divide only a limited number of times.So how is it that stem cells are able to escape the Hayflick limit, dividing an indefinite number of times, even though they are also subject to the same loss of telomere nucleotides with each division? The answer is the enzyme telomerase, which is able to rebuild shortened teleomeres. It&amp;#39;s fortunate for the longevity of complex organisms that telomerase exists, otherwise stem cells would not be able to divide often enough to allow tissues exposed to harsh conditions (such as skin and intestinal lining) to be replenished.In order to explain the results of the research to be described here we need to say more about telomerase, but first let&amp;#39;s summarize the function of telomeres. At first it may seem that all they do is compensate for the sloppy way that DNA replication works, by providing long stretches of expendable DNA at the ends of chromosomes. But there is one other notable function: teleomeres are a useful &amp;quot;cap&amp;quot; at the end of a chromosome that is recognizable to cellular mechanisms responsible for detecting DNA damage. If it weren&amp;#39;t for the telomeres, the ends of chromosomes would be indistinguishable from DNA damage, which can result from errors in the replication process, as well as damage due to external agents such as ionizing radiation or harmful chemicals. Cells have various mechanisms for repairing many kinds of damage, but even if repair isn&amp;#39;t possible, other mechanisms exist that recognize the damage and prevent further cell division or cause programmed cell death (apoptosis). Not all DNA damage can be repaired or compensated for by apoptosis or cessation of cell division. Unrepaired DNA damage (however it occurs) is the main cause of cancer (though not the only one). So the existence of the Hayflick limit as a result of teleomere shortening acts as one defense against cancer. Cancer can be defined as the uncontrolled proliferation of cells as a result of DNA damage (affecting existing mechanisms that normally control proliferation) or other causes. So fixed limits on the number of times a cell can divide is one of a number of mechanisms organisms have to guard against cancer.Before moving on, here&amp;#39;s a quick summary of the functions served by telomeres: (1) compensate for the chromosome &amp;quot;end replication problem&amp;quot;; (2) make it possible for cells to distinguish chromosome ends from damaged chromosomes; (3) provide natural limits to the number of times ordinary cells can divide, as protection against cancer.As noted above, the third of these functions is a problem for stem cells that do need the ability to divide an indefinite number of times. Repair of tissues exposed to harsh conditions is not the only circumstance this ability is needed. Another very important case is that of embryonic development. Multicellular, sexually-reproducing organisms start from a single cell (zygote). Yet there are close to 1014 cells in an adult human.It is true that a single cell that underwent 47 cycles of cell division could theoretically produce that many cells. But that&amp;#39;s really pushing the limits, since some cell types are needed in much larger numbers than others. The bottom line is that embryonic development is the other main circumstance when limits on cell division need to be overcome.Telomerase is what makes this overcoming of telomere limits possible. And it does it in a pretty straightforward way. Telomerase is a complex molecule with three distinct parts. Two of these are proteins: Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) and dyskernin, which are coded for by distinct genes. TERT does most of the work. The other part is a short piece of RNA, called the telomerase RNA component (TERC), which...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

It was pretty much what you would expect.  Dawkins makes good sense.  &lt;strong&gt;Bill O’Reilly&lt;/strong&gt; thinks he’s right because he yells and he has Jesus on his side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think these screen captures explain the interview completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Picture-5.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Picture-5.png" alt="Picture 5" title="Picture 5" width="550" height="344"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Picture-6.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Picture-6.png" alt="Picture 6" title="Picture 6" width="550" height="344"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Picture-4.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Picture-4.png" alt="Picture 4" title="Picture 4" width="550" height="344"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the actual interview.  With the slight time lag between O’Reilly yelling something and Dawkins hearing it, it’s quite entertaining to use the extra second to predict Dawkins’ reactions &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/ECE77Imki9M%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s the highlight of your day (at the 3:35 mark):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt;: You &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; see that it’s quite a remarkable piece of illogic to say that because science can’t fill a particular gap, therefore, we have to turn to Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O’Reilly&lt;/strong&gt; (shouting): You don’t have to &lt;em&gt;turn&lt;/em&gt; anywhere; you just have to &lt;em&gt;present&lt;/em&gt; it.  You don’t have to &lt;em&gt;turn&lt;/em&gt; to it.  You &lt;em&gt;present&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt;: Will you listen to me and stop shouting at me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O’Reilly&lt;/strong&gt;: Am I…?  Well, turn your earpiece down.  I’m not shouting.  That’s the way I usually talk.  Go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt;: I know it is.  I’ve been warned about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O’Reilly&lt;/strong&gt;: [Laughter]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful.  Dawkins handled himself well throughout.  Too bad his responses will go over the heads of the viewers, many of whom will just associate the interview with the word “fascism.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And I am sure, that this article is one which has the potential for a lot of debate!  In his column, which is entitled “Defending the Indefensible”, Des quite strongly puts forward his regret and sorrow for the vanishing art of medical swearing.   In this age of medical ethics (way to go Daniel Sokol!) and malpractice suits, doctors are often scared s***less to put in a word out of place in front of their patients in the fear that they may come around and bite them back. What goes around, comes around… Maybe it is true that swearing and cussing is a bad thing and not “physician-like”, but it has always been a part and parcel of the profession. I am sure, letting out steam at times is an essential way to prevent burn out!     …medicine has a private dark humour where swearing is central. I remember bursting through the doors to the hospital doctors’ mess to the sound of loud, repeated, almost stuttering swearing. Swearing was ubiquitous in theatre, in emergency departments, on ward rounds—under my breath, in my head, in my dreams. Swearing even has it own universal sign language. Swearing is an intrigue, part of the medical training and tradition. Indeed, if I could translate ancient Greek I would be surprised if swearing wasn’t part of the original version of the Hippocratic oath. Even those doctors who didn’t enjoy smoking and those with strong religious convictions enjoyed a good swear at 3 am during medical receiving.   I specially love the way he ends with a rather clever quip about how Orthopedic surgeons now are muted in the operation rooms having been lashed by the stringent laws of ethics and professionalism and therefore, have lost  95% of their vocabulary! He ends with almost lyrical support for the vanishing art and how he resents its now-demeaned stature:     Swearing is now enjoyed only between consenting adult doctors behind closed clinic doors. Young doctors now turn to dark therapeutic arts such as lavender oil, reiki healing, and saline flotation tanks. Orthopaedic surgeons are now mute at work, having lost 95% of their vocabulary and all their adjectives. I fear that the beautiful art of sarcasm and sweet cynicism, the other thundering source of medicine’s dark humour, is likewise under threat, replaced by nauseating bland positivity. Fiddlesticks and sugar to it all!       This article reminded me of the urban legend about the doctor who got dragged to the Institutional Ethical Committee by his “doctor-slang” savvy patient who deciphered the “TTFO” (told to f*** off) scribbled by his doctor on his ‘scrip. At the disciplinary hearing, the doctor successfully defended himself by saying that TTFO stood for “to take fluids orally” and not what the patient meant. Thankfully for the doctor in question, the IEC blokes were either too old to get the “real” meaning, or were the last of the dying tribe of doctors with a scrap of sense of humor, and hence they deemed his behavior to be “within lines” and set the doc free!

Hay una serie de distinguidos científicos hispanos, incluyendo varios que han ganado el premio Nobel (haga clic &lt;a href="http://coloquio.com/famosos/nobelalp.html"&gt;aquí&lt;/a&gt; para obtener más información sobre Severo Ochoa, Luis Walter Álvarez, y Mario Molina, por ejemplo).  Sin embargo, yo quería escribir sobre un científico activo, porque creo que es importante destacar la labor de los modelos actuales. Por esta razón, he decidido escribir de mi colega de &lt;a href="http://www.the-aps.org/"&gt;la American Physiological Society&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mc.uky.edu/physiology/people/andrade.asp"&gt;Francisco Andrade.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Andrade nació en Tijuana, México y asistió al Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey en Monterrey, México. Allí, recibió su licenciatura en Medicina.  Ganó un interés en matemáticas y estadística, física, y&lt;br&gt;programación de computadoras.  Luego, Dr. Andrade se trasladó a los Estados Unidos donde recibió su doctorado en la fisiología de la Texas Univeristy Health Science Center en San Antonio, Texas en 1994.  Completó su formación postdoctoral en el Baylor College of Medicine en Houston, Texas, la University of Kentucky Medical Center, en Lexington, KY, y Case Western Reserve University en Cleveland, OH. Una biografía del Dr. Andrade está en el &lt;a href="http://www.the-aps.org/careers/careers1/GradProf/Biosketches/gandrade.htm"&gt;sitio web de APS&lt;/a&gt; y su vita currículo formal está &lt;a href="http://www.mc.uky.edu/physiology/people/cv/Andrade.pdf"&gt;aquí.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Andrade.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/Andrade.jpg" style="margin:0pt 0pt 20px 20px;float:right" height="165" width="140"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Dr. Andrade es un profesor de fisiología en la Universidad de Kentucky. Allí, estudia la función de los grupos de músculos especializados, como los músculos que controlan los ojos y la laringe. Dr. Andrade está bien financiada y ha escrito más de 
cuarenta artículos científicos. Sin embargo, yo quería escribir sobre el Dr. Andrade porque es un maestro y mentor de excepción. Muchas de las cosas que él ha 
escrito me han guiado en mi carrera.  Por ejemplo, él escribió &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18988519?ordinalpos=4&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;este artículo&lt;/a&gt; en The Physiologist sobre el establecimiento de un nuevo laboratorio y la contratación de 
personal. Él es un miembro de &lt;a href="http://www.the-aps.org/committees/women/index.htm"&gt;la Comisión de las Mujeres en Ciencia del APS&lt;/a&gt;  
y &lt;a href="http://www.the-aps.org/education/profskills/Expertvoices.htm"&gt;ha respondido a las preguntas&lt;/a&gt; acerca de ser una mujer 
o minoría en ciencia .  Es porque el Dr. Andrade es un científico de 
talento y invierte en ayudar con las carreras de otras que tengo  un 
profundo respeto por él. De hecho, estoy muy orgulloso de llamarlo mi 
colega.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;English translation after the jump...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/diversity_in_science_-_dr_fran.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/diversity_in_science_-_dr_fran.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/-T-LUNCpokE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255148292892"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/10/jumper-girl-wears-her-other-superhero-guise.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7500942c7ec43654</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Jumper Girl Wears Her Other SuperHero Guise</title><published>2009-10-10T03:40:27Z</published><updated>2009-10-10T03:40:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/10/jumper-girl-wears-her-other-superhero-guise.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;So yes, she rides horses over biggish fences (not Olympic level, but still).  And she trains seriously in martial arts &lt;a href="http://www.erniereyes.com/"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Would you believe that &lt;a href="http://www.frcblog.com/2009/10/how-long-has-marriage-been-the-union-of-a-man-and-a-woman-scientists-say%E2%80%944-4-million-years/"&gt;Ardi supports their anti-gay stance&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;the article describes what C. Owen Lovejoy, an anthropologist at Kent State University, says about the social organization of this species:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The males, he argues, pair-bonded with females. Lovejoy sees male parental investment in the survival of offspring as a hallmark of the human lineage.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So, how long has marriage (i.e., "pair-bonding") been a male-female union? About four million, four hundred thousand years, if this secular scientist is to be believed. And what was its purpose? To insure "male parental investment in the survival of offspring"--something which the advocates of same-sex "marriage" contend is now no longer necessary.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And what will we be discarding, if we change the definition of marriage from being a union of a man and a woman? Only "a hallmark of the human lineage."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Marriage is not merely a religious institution, nor merely a civil institution. It is, rather, a natural institution, whose definition as the union of male and female is rooted in the order of nature itself. And it doesn't take a Bible to prove it. In this case, evolutionary theory points to the exact same conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. So much is wrong there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another characteristic of the human lineage is increased social behavior: Lovejoy could also talk about &lt;i&gt;general&lt;/i&gt; male investment, or community investment. There&amp;#39;s this concept called inclusive fitness that means non-parental relatives can also benefit from providing care…and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter whether they are gay or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have same-sex marriage, you could have &lt;i&gt;two males&lt;/i&gt; contributing to the success of their offspring. Male parental investment can occur in the absence of the females altogether! Another way to interpret this is that gay male parental investment is a further elaboration of this "hallmark of the human lineage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The naturalistic fallacy is still a fallacy. Even if this narrow (and inaccurate! Human sexual behavior has always been complicated, and there were almost certainly all kinds of homosexual behaviors going on) interpretation of what our ancestors were doing was correct, it says nothing about human behavior now. We have evidence of cannibalism in some fossils, this does not imply that we ought to start eating each other's brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most annoying of all to me is that the twit who wrote this piece, Peter Sprigg, also leads some of the FRC's anti-evolution initiatives. This is the guy who &lt;a href="http://www.christianpost.com/article/20080109/pro-evolution-book-says-science-and-god-compatible/page2.html"&gt;promotes the creationist "strengths and weakness" approach to education&lt;/a&gt;. He doesn't believe in evolution anyway!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since when does the religious right use the sexual behavior of a couple of apes as a model for good Christian sexual relations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, basically, Sprigg is another liar for Jesus who hypocritically uses a mangled version of evolutionary theory to support results he likes, and wants it removed from our curricula when it leads to answers he doesn't like.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/poor_ardipithecusexploited_aga.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/P5ZVdurL1Y4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255133444084"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/IngeniousMonkey-20Two5/~3/PsLxGMvW9IU/will-power-you-grow-with-task.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2793903b4348df75</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Will-Power: You Grow With The Task</title><published>2009-10-09T19:07:31Z</published><updated>2009-10-09T19:07:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/gDgxpELjgXg/will-power-you-grow-with-task.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/IngeniousMonkey-20Two5/~3/PsLxGMvW9IU/will-power-you-grow-with-task.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Following Baumeister et al.’s widely cited work on self-regulation, many psychologists view will-power as a depletable resource. According to this view, whenever we perform acts of self-regulation (e.g. resisting a delicious piece of cake) we tap into our individual will-power reservoir (think of it as a bank account), and thereby reduce the amount of will-power left for subsequent tasks. As a result, we find that people’s performance on self-regulatory tasks decreases from one will-power demanding task to an immediately following one. If we stick with this idea of will-power as a depletable resource, it is easy to imagine that a fast and continuous succession of tasks that require substantial amounts of self-regulation, might quickly make us run out of stock  (until we get a chance to replenish, of course). In other words, it seems quite possible that if we engage in multiple will-power demanding tasks, the depletion effect should lead to our becoming continually worse at self-regulation, until inevitably we have no more will-power left in our will-power bank account.  According to a study published in the Journal of Applied Psychology, however, this  plausible intuition does not necessarily seem to hold true entirely. Instead, the FIT and MSU  researchers conducting the study find that performing multiple tasks can trigger an adaptation to an increased self-regulatory demand; thus leading to improved performance on subsequent tasks; thus actually reversing the expected depletion effect. The theoretical definition of what self-regulation entails is fairly loose, and practically we all perform acts of self-regulation whenever we attempt to “regulate or alter [our] thoughts, feelings, or behaviors”. It is worth noting, however, that the concept of self-regulation is distinct from the concept attentiveness, although acts that require attention can tap into our will-power stock. Focusing attention on a task you do not like, might be a self-regulatory act to you, but it would also be self-regulatory to ignore something that seeks your attention.The experimental design of the study is very straight forward: Basically the researchers have people engage in self-regulation over a number of tasks and measure their performance. What they find over a number of trials, is that, in contrast to what would be intuitively expected from the depletion model, people who are faced with a large enough number and variety of difficult tasks (requiring a high degree of self-regulation) will adapt to the general level of required exertion. This adaptation effect –basically becoming accustomed to generally applying larger amounts of self-regulation to any task – then leads to improved, not reduced, self-regulation in a subsequent task.Prior engagement in more than two tasks seems necessary for this adaptation effect to hold, as only engagement in multiple tasks would provide sufficient opportunity to generalize the increased demand on self-regulation and transfer this demand to the subsequent task. Or as the author’s put it“the greater task variety in the three-task conditions led participants to develop a general rule or principle regarding the level of effort required in the situation […]. In situations involving more than one initial task of a particular exertion level learning processes, robust enough to result in transfer to subsequent tasks, may occur.”It is worth noting, that improved self-regulation is observed when moving from multiple difficult tasks (I.e. demanding high self-regulation) to easy tasks, but not when moving in the other direction. This speaks for the overall hypothesis of learned adaptation, and leads the authors to draw the practical conclusion: “that easing individuals into a high self-regulatory training task with lower demand practice opportunities may result in poorer performance than providing high-demand practice” Also, it is quite clear that the study does not negate the resource-model of self-regulation in any way, as it is unlikely that the adaptation process will continue indefinitely over long periods of time. Most likely, there is some task-threshold after which adaptation remains constant or even decreases, and the common depletion effect starts holding again.

The talk was based on the book he co-wrote with Simon Singh: &lt;i&gt;Trick or Treatment&lt;/i&gt;. This is my (unsystematic) review.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
Professer Ernst began by telling us that the book has received much criticism from advocates of alternative medicine - and was met with bewilderment from some, who seemed surprised that a professor of complementary medicine would criticise CAM. To that, Ernst said that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An uncritical scientist is a contradiction in terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His introductory slide included statements to the effect that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A large proportion of the general population uses CAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patient population figures for use of CAM are much higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the UK, we spend £1.6 billion on CAM each year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even the most fundamental questions remain unanswered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide number two highlighted four ways of attempting to find out if something works: plausibility; the test of time; ask the patient; do the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloodletting was used as an example for each of the first two options. &lt;i&gt;Plausibility&lt;/i&gt;: Ernst pointed out that (at the time) bloodletting was seen as a plausible treatment because of the belief that health was affected by the status of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism"&gt;four humours&lt;/a&gt;. He then went on to point out that acupuncture (based on the principles of "yin and yang"), chiropractic (based on the idea of "subluxations"), homeopathy (based on the principle that "like cures like"), and reflexology (based on the idea that points on the foot correspond to the internal organs of the body) are utterly implausible. Although he then pointed out that implausibility doesn't necessarily rule out a treatment being effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the &lt;i&gt;test of time&lt;/i&gt;, Ernst noted that bloodletting was used for hundreds, if not thousands of years despite being ineffective. He then quoted Oscar Wilde: "experience is the name we give to our mistakes", which I thought was a rather neat way to illustrate the problem with assuming that the longevity of a treatment was a reliable measure of its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tackling the option &lt;i&gt;ask the patient&lt;/i&gt;, Ernst showed a slide from Marja Verhoef that showed a hierarchy of the factors important to patients. "Gut feelings" were at the top of the pyramid, "trial-and-error" and media articles were also listed but I was unable to note all the factors or the order of importance of the factors. There is an &lt;a href="http://beta.medicinescomplete.com/journals/fact/current/fact0905a13a86.htm"&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt; of a qualitative study conducted by Verhoef and others which lists types of evidence relied upon by cancer patients searching for information on complementary therapies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific evidence ranked very low for most patients. Anecdotal evidence was among the top types of evidence patients relied on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we came to &lt;i&gt;research&lt;/i&gt;. Ernst related the proposal made by Jan Baptist van Helmont in 1662. Thanks to the &lt;a href="http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/essays/casting_of_lots/casting.html"&gt;James Lind Library&lt;/a&gt;, I am able to reproduce the quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Let us take out of the hospitals...200 or 500 poor people, that have fevers, pleurisies. Let us divide them into halves, let us cast lots, that one halfe of them may fall to my share, and the other to yours; I will cure them without bloodletting and sensible evacuation; but you do, as ye know...We shall see how many funerals both of us shall have.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was perhaps the first time that an RCT had been proposed. Unfortunately, it wasn't until 1809 and &lt;a href="http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/trial_records/19th_Century/hamilton/hamilton_commentary.html"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; that a trial of bloodletting is believed to have taken place. Ernst then moved on to James Lind himself and the famous trial of treatments for scurvy. The James Lind Library has a commentary of the trial here: &lt;a href="http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/trial_records/17th_18th_Century/lind/lind_1753_commentary.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. Ernst informed us that one of the treatments tried was "hard labour" and explained that as one of the symptoms of scurvy was lethargy, confusion over cause and effect had led to the belief that this may be a useful treatment. His comment that hard work was believed to be a treatment for "lazy bastards" brought laughter from the audience. I had expected the talk to be rather dry, but was pleased to note several moments where humour was employed by the professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Acupuncture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernst referred to a positive trial by Berman et al that studied the use of acupuncture for osteoarthritis, then pointed out that we must beware the cherry-pickers. A single trial cannot be expected to prove the efficacy of a treatment, but systematic reviews are more reliable. While acupuncture has been touted as a panacea (cure-all), Ernst noted that it has only been shown to be effective for pain and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chiropractic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section of the talk began with discussion of the origins of chiropractic, which some may have been surprised to find was not invented as a treatment for back problems. A slide was shown that listed systematic reviews of chiropractic spinal manipulation for various conditions alongside percentages of chiropractors who (wrongly in most cases) believed that chiropractic was an effective treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernst then moved on to the risks of chiropractic, noting that mild to moderate adverse effects of the treatment were not disputed - in comparison to severe adverse effects which were hotly disputed. Discussion of chiropractic ended with a slide showing a pair of scales labelled "harm" and "benefit", with the harms being shown as heavier than the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Homeopathy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning with a slide showing a homeopathic pamphlet featuring Queen Elizabeth II, we were told that the royal family were "staunch supporters" of alternative treatments such as homeopathy. Ernst went on to say that the treatment was based on the principles that "like-cures-like" and "less-is-more" - principles that are totally implausible. Ernst told us of a study he had conducted into homeopathic arnica which made him "very unpopular with British homeopaths" (who were "quite outraged" - but which was later confirmed by two independent systematic reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noting that some homeopaths complained that trials of homeopathy that did not study individualised treatment of patients, Ernst referred to a trial of individualised homeopathy for childhood asthma which provided no evidence that individualised homeopathy was superior to placebo as an adjunctive treatment. Cautioning us once more against the reliance upon single trials, Ernst then told the audience of a systematic review of systematic reviews. I believe this is the paper in question: &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12492603"&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt; on Pubmed. Ending the section on homeopathy with reference to harm and benefit, Ernst discussed the possibility that, while an inert treatment such as homeopathy may not cause harm, homeopaths themselves might - for example by offering homeopathy as an alternative treatment for swine flu. Again, the slide showing a pair of scales with the balance tipped towards "harm" was shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernst digressed from discussion of the four complementary / alternative therapies at this point to point out that he doesn't see himself as a "Quackbuster" - but as having to choose whether or not to tell the truth about his investigation of complementary and alternative therapies. Telling the truth seems to lead to him being labelled as a Quackbuster. Ernst then pointed to studies into St John's Wort for depression as an example of investigation into CAM that found an effective therapy, before pointing out the risks (particularly that St John's Wort can interact with prescription medication). Leading on from this discussion of an effective CAM treatment, Ernst moved to the last of the four therapies that were the focus of his talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reflexology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernst points out that reflexology may be relaxing and thus beneficial for patients. While the theory behind reflexology is implausible, massage therapy can be beneficial. I have struggled to find the systematic review of massage therapy Ernst referred to, but believe that this may be it: &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19148685"&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt; on Pubmed. On the whole, the evidence was positive (albeit there were concerns over methodology). From the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[the trials] suggest that massage can alleviate a wide range of symptoms: pain, nausea, anxiety, depression, anger, stress and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Summing-up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were told that CAM is popular, used by patients, and in fact is driven by patients. Because of this, Ernst believes it is important to address the general public. He pointed out that of the research into CAM:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...you find some gems in this mess but you find a lot of disappointing results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then reaffirmed his stance that he is not a Quackbuster, but is a scientific investigator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Questions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having invited questions from the audience and promised a copy of his book for the three best efforts, the first questioner was a gentleman who had got his copy of &lt;i&gt;Trick or Treatment&lt;/i&gt; signed by Ernst before the lecture and hence did not need a copy as a prize. He asked about the gold-standard of trials, the RCT, and whether there were problems with this approach to discovering the truth about medical therapies. Ernst stated that while there were problems with RCTs, they were the best option we had for investigating treatments. Referring to the issue that trials of this nature tell us about the group rather than individuals, Ernst reminded us that in medical science we must deal in probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question about placebo brought a response to the effect that the placebo response can be powerful. The professor then pointed out that a genuine treatment given by a practitioner who was able to empathise with the patient would have both specific and placebo effects. CAM treatments that are no better than placebo cheat us of the specific effects that genuine treatments can offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lady sitting to my left then asked about clinicians' views (with reference to the hierarchy of patients' views Ernst had shown us earlier). Ernst replied that clinicians often rely on experience rather than the best available evidence - and that "that is wrong" (I paraphrase here, as I cannot remember the verbatim quote).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a question about the regulation of CAM (with regard to the Prince of Wales's FIH and the CNHC, better known as OfQuack). Ernst pointed out that regulated nonsense remains nonsense and complained that CAM practitioners have no requirement to use the evidence-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there were many elements of the talk (and questions &amp;amp; answers following the talk) that I failed to note down. I hope that my scrawled notes and imperfect memory have conveyed an accurate impression of the views of Professor Ernst but I would not be surprised to find that my notes and memory of the event are both far from perfect. I have also failed to recall or to make note of the humourous moments of the talk which brought laughter from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My overall impression was that Ernst is keen to engage with the general public and to inform them about evidence-based medicine and also the pitfalls that they should avoid. For example, being misled by cherry-pickers giving single studies as proof of a treatment's efficacy, or reliance upon inadequate evidence of other kinds - such as anecdotal evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

Two previous studies used artificial grammar stimuli/tasks (Bahlmann, Schubotz, &amp;amp; Friederici, 2008; Friederici, Bahlmann, Heim, Schubotz, &amp;amp; Anwander, 2006). Syllable sequences were presented according to one of two rules (presented to different groups of subjects). One rule involved only adjacent (linear) dependencies (e.g., [AB][AB]) and one involved hierarchical dependencies (e.g., [A[AB]B]). Once learned, subjects were presented with “grammatical” and “ungrammatical” strings during fMRI scanning.  Violations of either grammar type showed activation in the frontal operculum, whereas only violations for the hierarchical grammar showed activity in the pars opercularis region. This latter finding is held up as evidence for the claim that the pars opercularis supports hierarchical structure building. I’m not sure what to conclude from studies involving artificial grammars so I’d like to focus on a more recent study that aimed at the same issue using natural language stimuli.Makuuchi, et al. (2009) used a 2x2 design with STRUCTURE (hierarchical vs. linear) and DISTANCE (long vs. short) as the factors.  Hierarchical stimuli involved written German sentences that were center-embedded (e.g., Maria who loved Hans who was good looking kissed Johann) whereas the linear stimuli were non-center embedded (e.g., Achim saw the tall man yesterday late at night). Already I have a problem: the notion that non-center embedded sentences are linear is puzzling (see below). The number of words between the main subject (noun) of the sentence and the main verb served as the distance manipulation.  Restricting their analysis only to the left inferior frontal gyrus, Makuuchi et al. report a main effect of STRUCTURE in the pars opercularis, a main effect of DISTANCE in the inferior frontal sulcus, and no significant interactions. This finding was interpreted as evidence for distinct localizations supporting hierarchical structure building on the one hand (in the pars opercularis) and non-syntactic verbal working memory related processes on the other (inferior frontal sulcus) which was operationalized by the distance manipulation.   (LPO=left pars opercularis, LIFS=left inferior frontal sulcus, A=Hierarchical &amp;amp; long-distance, B=hierarchical &amp;amp; short-distance, C=linear &amp;amp; long-distance, D=linear &amp;amp; short-distance.)I find this study conceptually problematic and experimentally confounded.  Conceptually the notion “hierarchical” is defined very idiosyncratically to refer to center-embedding.  This contradicts mainstream linguistic analyses of even simple sentences which are assumed to be quite hierarchical.  For example, the English translation of a “linear” sentence in Makuuchi et al. would have, minimally, a structure something like, [Achim [saw [the tall man] [yesterday late at night]]], where, for example, the noun phrase the tall man is embedded in a verb phrase which itself is in the main sentence clause.  Most theories would also assume further structure within the noun phrase and so on. Thus, in order to maintain the view that the pars opercularis supports hierarchical structure building, one must assume that (i) center-embedded structures involve more hierarchical structure building than non-center embedded structures, and (ii) that hierarchical structure building is the only difference between center-embedded and non-center embedded structures (otherwise the contrast is confounded). Makuuchi et al. make no independent argument for assumption (i), and assumption (ii) is false in that center-embedded sentences are well known to be more difficult to process than non-center embedded sentence (Gibson, 1998), thus there is a difficulty confound.  One might argue that center-embedded structures are more difficult because they are hierarchical in a special way. But the confound persists in other ways. If one simply counts the number of subject-verb dependencies (the number of nouns that serve as the subject of a verb), the “hierarchical” sentences have more than the “linear” sentences. It is perhaps revealing that the activation response amplitude in the pars opercularis to the various conditions qualitatively follows the pattern of the number of subject-verb dependencies in the different conditions: “hierarchical long” (HL) = 3 dependencies, “hierarchical short” (HS) = 2 dependencies, “linear long” (LL) = 1 dependency, “linear short” (LS) = 1 dependency, which corresponds with the pattern of response to these conditions in pars opercularis which is HL &amp;gt; HS &amp;gt; LL ≈ LS (see left bar graph above).I also have a problem with the working memory claim, namely that inferior frontal sulcus = non-syntactic working memory.  This claim is based on the assumptions that (i) the distance manipulation taps non-syntactic working memory, (ii) that the hierarchical manipulation does not tap non-syntactic working memory, and (iii) that inferior frontal sulcus showed only a distance effect and no interaction.  You might convince me that (i) holds to some extent but both (ii) and (iii) are dubious.  Center-embedded sentences are notoriously difficult to process and even if such structures invoke some special hierarchical process, isn’t it also likely that subjects will use whatever additional resources they have at their disposal, like non-syntactic working memory?  Regarding (iii) a quick look at the amplitude graphs for the inferior frontal sulcus activation (right graph above) indicates that most of the “distance” effect is driven by the most difficult sentence type, the long-distance center-embedded condition.  Thus, the lack of an interaction probably reflects insufficient power.  In short, I think all of the effects Makuuchi et al. see are driven by general processing load. Increased load likely leads to an increase in the use of less exciting processes such as articulatory rehearsal, which drives up activation levels in posterior sectors of Broca’s area.  In fact, a recent study that directly examined the relation between articulatory rehearsal and sentence comprehension found exactly this: rehearsing a set of nonsense syllables produced just as much activation the pars opercularis as this comprehending sentences with long-distance dependencies (Rogalsky et al., 2008).

This word means different things to different people, but to me it means pride in my nation, one founded by brilliant thinkers and built on the acknowledgment of basic human rights.  It does not mean that I agree with everything my country does or with all of my fellow citizens.  It means that I believe in our basic values enough to love this country.  Patriotism also recognizes a shared fate.  There can be no patriotism unless there is a shared identity and a shared fate.  Because we share this space, these values, what happens to you very much matters to me.  To maintain our identity as a nation, we have public education and other public services which ensure our health and welfare.  Since I am a patriot, I believe in caring for my fellow citizens, for sacrificing through taxes or through service in order to maintain the health and well-being of us all.  In return, I benefit from these same services, and from knowing that I am helping to build and maintain my country.

&lt;p&gt;While I may not like it, I can understand the economics of shutting down a textile mill or a furniture plant. It's a new world we are living in. But Dell? Computers?! If the leading computer manufacturer is suffering during the recession, what can anyone else hope for? Is there any industry that can still compete and grow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it seems that the answer may, perhaps, be Yes - the green industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ginnyskal.com/" title=""&gt;Ginny Skalski&lt;/a&gt;, a good friend and local &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/GinnySkal" title=""&gt;uber-social-networking-maven&lt;/a&gt; recently got a job with &lt;a href="http://www.cree.com/" title=""&gt;CREE&lt;/a&gt; as their &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/cree" title=""&gt;social media person&lt;/a&gt;. And she invited me and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/AshleySue" title=""&gt;Ashley&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.greengrounded.com/" title=""&gt;Sue Allen&lt;/a&gt; to attend yesterday's press conference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cree1.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Cree1.jpg" width="448" height="336" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first surprise was the size of the Cree campus in RTP - it is enormous. I was not aware until yesterday that this is a 20 years old company and how big it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a blogger, I was, forwardthinkingly (is that a word?) of them, seated up front with the media, sitting right next to state &lt;a href="http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/members/viewMember.pl?sChamber=S&amp;amp;nUserID=228" title=""&gt;Rep. McKissick&lt;/a&gt; of Durham and not needing a telephoto lens or zoom to take this picture of Governor Beverly Purdue who was sitting just a few feet in front of me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cree2.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Cree2.jpg" width="448" height="336" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was the press conference about? The announcement by Cree of &lt;a href="http://www.cree.com/press/press_detail.asp?i=1255034042325" title=""&gt;almost 600 new job openings&lt;/a&gt;, about half of them to be filled by the end of the year, some in RTP and most in their plant in Mecklenburg County. As Cree's CEO Chuck Swoboda said, Cree started at home - by replacing all the incandescent and fluorescent lightbulbs with their own LED lights in all of their own buildings. I have to say that I did not notice any difference in lighting - the room was bright and warmly lit and welcoming:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governor Purdue greeted the good news by saying that she also started at home - making her own house energy-efficient and outfitted by LED lights....which she also did not notice when they were installed: the light looks just like the incandescent light (and much more pleasant than the metallic fluorescent light).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also connected the news to the importance of education. Cree was started by a group of students at NCSU 20 years ago and she stressed how such inventions, as well as jobs in such companies, require a strong educational system in the State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cree set up a little demo in the back of the room where we could see (and have demonstrated) the difference between incandescent, fluorescent and LED light as well as get information about the energy savings, longevity of the lights, ease of installing them into the existing sockets, and environmental impact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, before I left, Ginny showed me some cool colors that LEDs come from. I have used the infrared LEDs in my research many years ago, and was interested to learn about the advancements in technology since then, as well as other uses for LEDs apart from home and business lighting, e.g., in research, medicine and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

But there's more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, Keller argues skeptics should “doubt your doubts.” He claims: “All doubts, however skeptical and cynical they may seem, are really a set of alternative beliefs. You cannot doubt Belief A except from a position of faith in Belief B.” Writing to skeptics he claims that “The reason you doubt Christianity’s Belief A is because you hold unprovable Belief B. Every doubt, therefore, is based on a leap of faith.” [&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reason-God-Belief-Age-Skepticism/dp/1594483493?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;link_code=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969"&gt;The Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;l=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1594483493" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important;padding:0px!important"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;(New York: Riverhead Books, 2008), p. xviii]. We have faith, he opines, whenever we accept something that is “unprovable,” and all of us “have fundamental, unprovable faith commitments that we think are superior to those of others.” [Ibid., p. 20]. So he argues skeptics likewise “must doubt your doubts.” [Ibid., p. xix]. &lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I said, I do not accept Keller’s definition of faith. He’s manipulating the debate by using a language game in his favor. I reject his game and his conclusion. Here is why, based on something David Eller argues: “&lt;b&gt;knowing is not believing&lt;/b&gt;.” He argues that if believers “can drag down real knowledge to their level and erase any distinctions between the true and the false, the known and the merely felt or believed or guessed, they can rest comfortably in their own undeserved self-certainty.” He defends the view that “knowledge is about reason and that belief is about faith, and the two are logically and psychologically utterly different and even incompatible.” [David Eller, &lt;i&gt;Natural Atheism&lt;/i&gt;, pp, 132-33]. The word faith (and belief) must be reserved to apply in this context to beliefs about that which cannot be empirically sensed or tested, like ghosts, angels, demons and gods. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Craig responds as Keller does when it comes to questions I've raised about his claim that the inner witness of the Holy Spirit "trumps all other evidence" &lt;a href="http://www.reasonablefaith.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;amp;id=6489"&gt;in his Q &amp;amp; A&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Craig wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;...most of our beliefs cannot be evidentially justified. Take, for example, the belief that the world was not created five minutes ago with built-in memory traces, food in our stomachs from meals we never really ate, and other appearances of age. Or the belief that the external world around us is real rather than a computer-generated virtual reality. Anyone who has seen a film like The Matrix realizes that the person living in such a virtual reality has no evidence that he is not in such an illusory world. But surely we're rational in believing that the world around us is real and has existed longer than five minutes, even though we have no evidence for this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I find these examples to be strange ones, very strange. So let’s see if I can put this into perspective. He's arguing that since it’s rational to believe we’re not in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; or that we have not been created five minutes ago, it’s also rational to believe in God without evidence. Is there truly no evidence against our beliefs that we were not created five minutes ago or that we're not living in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;? These examples are bandied about among philosophers as if they are self-evident, including the evil demon and dream conjectures of Rene Descartes. We are told there is no evidence for what we believe about such things &lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt; we are told by Reformed Epistemologists like Plantinga and Craig that these examples parallel their belief in the “great truths of the gospel.” Let’s look at these things in turn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, I think there is evidence to suggest we were not created five minutes ago, depending on what we mean by evidence. &lt;strong&gt;Evidence in its broadest conception includes anything and everything used to demonstrate the truth of a claim, which includes our arguments based on the things we’ve experienced&lt;/strong&gt;. What we believe will be based on the probability of the evidence, all of it, as broadly defined. As such, I think there is evidence against the existence of a creator God. The arguments for the existence of God are not persuasive. I do not think such a God could create the first moment in time if he is somehow “outside of time.” And I do not think a spiritual Supreme Being could create a material world. Even if a creator God exists I find no evidence that he would create us into such a massively deceptive world five minutes ago anyway. Therefore there is evidence against our having been created five minutes ago. All they have left is a mere remote possibility, not anything like a probability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far the existence of an external world goes G. E. Moore offered a good enough argument in his &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._E._Moore#Proof_of_an_external_world"&gt;"Proof of an External World"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The demon hypothesis of Rene Descartes, in which there might be a demon who is deceiving me right now, fails because of the same evidence just mentioned above with regard to God creating us five minutes ago. Descartes uses his extreme method of hypothetical doubt like a massive sword. The mere possibility that there is such a demon was enough to cast doubt on his knowledge about the external world. But why must we base what we accept as the case on a mere possibility? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to the question of whether I’m dreaming right now a good case has been made by Norman Malcom [in his book &lt;em&gt;Dreaming and Skepticism&lt;/em&gt;], and Bernard Williams [in his book &lt;em&gt;Descartes&lt;/em&gt;], that there is a difference between dreams and our waking experience. The fact that we can distinguish between them presupposes we are aware of them both and of their differences. It’s only from the perspective of being awake that we can explain our dreams. Hence we can only make sense of this distinction if we are sometimes awake. And since this is the case, all of our experiences throughout our entire lives cannot be made up merely of a sequence of dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What about the world depicted in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; film? There are several responses to such a radical scenario which would upstage most everything we accept as true about our existence in this world. Such a scenario is a mere possibility, if it is possible at all, and a very unlikely one at that. The story is just implausible. I see no reason why there would be any human resistance or knowledge of the Matrix at all by people living in the Matrix, since it determines all of their experiences…all of them. I also see no reason why a pill or a decision by Neo could make any difference at all while inside the Matrix. Apart from the story line itself I see no reason for the Matrix in the first place, and I see no reason why our bodies are better at fueling it than other sources. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As David Mitsuo Nixon argued, “The proper response to someone’s telling me that my belief could be false is, “So what?” It’s not possibility that matters, it’s probability, So until you give me a good reason to think that my belief is not just possibly false, but probably false, I’m not changing anything about what I believe or what I think I know.” [“The Matrix Possibility” in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix and Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;, ed. William Irwin (p. 30)]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So even if the Matrix is a possibility, it too is an extremely unlikely one. To overturn nearly everything we think in order to accept it would be to go against the overwhelming evidence (as defined above) about that which we claim to know. In fact, it would be self-defeating to accept it, for if we did then how do we know that THAT world isn't just another kind of Matrix? That is, if we accept the claim about the Matrix then it would cause us to distrust everything we experience. And since this is the case, then Neo would have no reason for trusting the experiences he had while supposedly outside the Matrix in the so-called “real world?” When it comes to Neo knowing the real world in distinction from the Matrix he has been given no reason to think one world is real and the other is illusionary. The red pill could have been nothing more than a hallucinogenic drug, for instance. So Neo would have no basis for trusting those experiences supposedly outside the Matrix in the real world, and as such he would end up as an “epistemological solipsist,” not having any reason for trusting there is a world outside his mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Craig also wrote…&lt;blockquote&gt;Many of the things we know are not based on evidence. So why must belief in God be so based? Belief in God and the great truths of the Gospel is not a blind exercise of faith, a groundless leap in the dark. Rather, as Plantinga emphasizes, Christian belief is part of the deliverances of reason, grounded in the inner witness of the Holy Spirit, which is an objective reality mediated to me from God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Notice the impossibly huge leap Craig makes here. From the fact that we cannot be absolutely certain &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(a) that we were not created five minutes ago, or &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(b) that we are not living in a Matrix,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Craig claims, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(c) we can know with some real assurance that the Christian God exists and that the gospel is true. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think a proper conclusion from what he’s argued can only lead him to conclude that since it’s a remote possibility that (a) and (b) obtains, it’s therefore a remote possibility that (c) obtains. What Craig argues is therefore extremely problematic. As I’ve argued in my book, Christians repeatedly retreat to the position that what they believe is “possible,” or “not impossible,” rather than what is probable. When they do this they are admitting the evidence is not on their side. They’re trying to explain the evidence away. Just because all of these things are possible he cannot conclude that what he believes is probable. A possibility is not a probability. How he slips in a probability because of a possibility is beyond me. The inference does not follow. It's a huge non-sequitur.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[First posted 10/9/09]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-2681763895365098029?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, not quite.  We've funded some great projects, helping out &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=307196&amp;amp;challengeid=24230"&gt;kids with hearing impairments&lt;/a&gt;, giving inner city girls &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=305898&amp;amp;challengeid=24230"&gt;a view into a remarkable future&lt;/a&gt;, but there's more work to do.  I found &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=307032&amp;amp;challengeid=24230"&gt;another project that looks important&lt;/a&gt;.  The kids in this school can't play outside (!) and need some indoor sports equipment to keep healthy, play, and fight obesity.  How 'bout we do this?  They need $501.00 to be fully funded (apparently indoor soccer balls are rather expensive).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/donors_choose---you_guys_are_h.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/JrvHuuKQ8PE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255118004557"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/altmed_guru_not_killing_enough.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3f72d522a9e47d57</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Absurd medical claims"/><title type="html">Altmed gurus not killing enough people, trying to improve</title><published>2009-10-09T18:41:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-09T18:41:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/y-Zm3BuV-kA/altmed_guru_not_killing_enough.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/altmed_guru_not_killing_enough.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Alternative medicine boosters promote bad health practices that hurt real people---that's been a theme in my writing for nearly three years.  It's bad enough that they sell people fake cures and encourage them to avoid real medical care, but apparently, that's not enough anymore.  It's getting to the point where they might as well line their victims up against a wall and shoot them.  You see now, not satisfied with their current body count, &lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/027205_vaccines_swine_flu_the_FDA.html"&gt;they are &lt;i&gt;suing&lt;/i&gt; the FDA&lt;/a&gt; to remove the current pandemic flu vaccine.  This not only affects the members of their medical cults, but &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of us.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Mike Adams(!), the lawsuit is being filed on behalf of Gary Null, whom he generously describes as a "licensed health care worker".  The actual lawsuit is nowhere to be found yet, but what possible standing could Gary Null, Fake Doctor, have to file such a suit?  What claim of  harm could he possibly make?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, assnuts, if you're weird health religion doesn't let you get a flu shot, fine.  But the rest of us don't need you fucking with the public health.  What's next, suing the drain commission to allow us to have access to pure, untreated brown water?  I thought these idiots were supposed to be about prevention!  Poor John Snow is turning in his grave, batting away images of pump handles being placed on contaminated wells.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I very much hope that if this gets filed, some wise judge tosses these guys out on their asses, preferably with onerous fines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/altmed_guru_not_killing_enough.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/y-Zm3BuV-kA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255117637062"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/todays_carnivals_437.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b21bb99b1234ab30</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2009-10-09T18:04:28Z</published><updated>2009-10-09T18:04:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/_P2BvtM4OA4/todays_carnivals_437.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/todays_carnivals_437.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Carnival of the Blue #29 is up on &lt;a href="http://cephalopodcast.com/blog/2009/10/le-carnaval-du-bleu-no-29/" title=""&gt;Cephalopodcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Frank posts them weekly on his blog and the result is a beautiful, funny, sad and often dark piece of insight into people’s souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secrets are tricksy things.  Keeping them inside can make you crazy, sharing them is almost always a risk. Finding the right person to share the right secret with can be a joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can you keep a secret? When someone shares a secret with you, is it a burden or a pleasure? How do you handle it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s hard to make that kind of move — the responsible faculty and administrators should be congratulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I saw it for the first time yesterday, I thought that the motto on the University's seal expressed just the right attitude: &lt;em&gt;quaecumque vera&lt;/em&gt;, or after translation from the Latin, "whatever". Well, I suppose literally it means "whatever [things are] true", but the "true" part is redundant, right? I mean, when you say "OK, whatever", isn't what you mean "OK, whatever is true, I'm fine with it"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More seriously, the university senate's web site &lt;a href="http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/senate/nav02.cfm?nav02=36793&amp;amp;nav01=12485"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The University Motto, &lt;em&gt;Quaecumque vera&lt;/em&gt;, is taken from the Latin Vulgate version of the Bible, the Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians, Chapter 4, Verse 8:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;De cetero, fratres, quaecumque sunt vera,quaecumque pudica, quaecumque justa, quaecumque sancta, quaecumque amabilia, quaecumque bonae famae, si qua virtus, si qua laus disciplinae, haec cogitate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The same passage from the King James version is: Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and there be any praise, think on these things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right; whatever. Or to avoid using what is &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1801"&gt;allegedly the most annoying phrase in English&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;quaecumque vera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255115778612"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/los_angeles_venue_cancels_inte.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a64800a9c96e0c9c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Los Angeles Venue Cancels Intelligent Design Film</title><published>2009-10-09T19:02:16Z</published><updated>2009-10-09T19:02:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/GbFU-2p3cEo/los_angeles_venue_cancels_inte.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/los_angeles_venue_cancels_inte.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You'll recall that it was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/intelligent_design_documentary.php"&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that the Californial Science Center, which is loosely affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution, had planned a screening of "Darwin's Dilemma: The Mystery of the Cambrian Fossil Record" which is apparently a creationist documentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I gave a colloquium yesterday at Caltech, and afterwards one of the folks who came to dinner was &lt;a href="http://virgo.physics.ucdavis.edu/~knox/"&gt;Lloyd Knox&lt;/a&gt;, an old friend and a cosmologist at UC Davis.  Talk naturally turned to his most well-known work:  the Dark Energy Song, sung to his class and (inevitably) captured to video and posted to YouTube by a quick-thinking student.  But to my surprise, it only has about 1,000 views!  Surely we can help bring this masterpiece to a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;

So he’s been getting their newsletter for a little while now.  A recent article stood out to him.  It was about &lt;a href="http://www.camp-quest.org/"&gt;Camp Quest&lt;/a&gt;, the summer camp for children of atheist parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the article by clicking on the images below or &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/au/the-quest-for-kids"&gt;just go here for the online version&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/scan0001.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/scan0001-300x279.jpg" alt="scan0001" title="scan0001" width="300" height="279"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/scan0002.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/scan0002-234x300.jpg" alt="scan0002" title="scan0002" width="234" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gotta love the comic on the second page…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s notable that the article contained some glaring errors.  (Some of which have since been rectified in the online piece with footnotes.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the article mentions this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So these children, whose worldview is helping to be formed by those who teach them at the camp, are supposedly “encouraged to think for themselves”? Is that why the young people are given a free T-shirt that states “It’s Okay To Be An Atheist”? And why a “nine-year old Camp Quest camper, who after being De-Baptized [using a hairdryer], raised her arms skyward and loudly proclaimed, ‘I can see!’”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, they were not being taught to think for themselves, as any “bright” “free-thinker” can easily see. These children were being indoctrinated against Christianity, especially with their adult-led mockery of Christian baptism. They were explicitly taught to reject God!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shot the video of that nine-year-old girl saying what she did.  You can see it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/wAo_rEgR4xU%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does that look like an outdoor camp?  Of course not.  It took place at a &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/08/04/scenes-from-an-atheist-de-baptism-ceremony/"&gt;party last year&lt;/a&gt; during which participants could voluntarily get in line for a de-baptism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AiG eventually realized this and issued this clarification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since this article was posted, we learned that the “mass de-baptism” did not occur at Camp Quest but at a different venue in Ohio. We inferred from a statement in the &lt;em&gt;American Atheist&lt;/em&gt; article referenced above — that a “nine-year-old Camp Quest camper who, after being De-Baptized, raised her arms skyward and loudly proclaimed, ‘I can see!’” — that the sacrilege occurred at Camp Quest. This belief was fostered by noting that the AA article featured a photo of the founder of the Camp Quest movement conducting the de-baptism and also because photos depicted a rustic camp-like setting — all suggesting that this event was held at a camp that Camp Quest has become known for hosting. So, even though the young girl was described in the article as a Camp Quest camper (and thus we took the article to say that the de-baptism happened at Camp Quest), we made a logical yet inaccurate inference, and, so, we regret that in a fallen world, fallible people can make inadvertent mistakes like this. For this reason, we wish to retract the inference we had made that the incident took place at Camp Quest.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good for him for issuing a retraction.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s the crux of the entire piece.  They claim that Camp Quest is all about childhood indoctrination into atheism, yet the primary examples they give are &lt;em&gt;all wrong&lt;/em&gt;.  There’s no mass de-baptism at the camp — not even in jest.  Nor did Camp Quest issue shirts reading “It’s Okay To Be An Atheist” as the AiG piece claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is typical of &lt;strong&gt;Ken Ham&lt;/strong&gt; and Answers in Genesis.  They latch onto something minor which can easily be explained by those with more knowledge on the subject and stretch it into some major condemnation of non-Christian belief.  And it’d be laughable if it weren’t so serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What AiG needs to do is print the footnote explanation in their next newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I’m still looking forward to the clarification which states they were wrong about the entire Creation Museum.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, &lt;strong&gt;Amanda Metskas&lt;/strong&gt; is the director of Camp Quest.  Here’s what she told me about the camp in response to Ham’s article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We definitely do not debaptize children at Camp Quest.  We don’t label the campers of Camp Quest with a worldview, and that includes avoiding rituals like debaptism at camp.  Besides, if you know anything about our demographics, a fair number of our campers were never baptized in the first place, so debaptism isn’t only inappropriate at camp, but also largely unnecessary!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally think that both baptism and debaptism are more appropriate for adults.  One of the problems with baptism is that it is a decision often made by parents for children before the children are old enough to consent or understand the ritual they are participating in.  Debaptism is a humorous response to that very problem by letting people revoke their participation in a ritual that they never consented to in the first place.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken Ham also claims that we have shirts that say “It’s okay not to believe in God,” which is not true.  That sentence was a comment written by an anonymous camper in 2004 on his/her camp evaluation form in response to a question asking “What have you learned at Camp Quest 2004?”   Note that the camper didn’t write that there isn’t a god, just that it is okay not to believe.  We aren’t trying to convert campers to a particular worldview at camp, but we are trying to send them the message that there is nothing wrong with them or with their parents for not believing in a god.  In our pervasively religious culture, this is something that a lot of our campers really need to hear, and that is exactly the message that this camper got from the Camp Quest experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answers in Genesis has a history of mischaracterizing Camp Quest.  I think they like to make us the bogeyman to scare their supporters into donating more money or buying more products from them.  In the future, I encourage them to contact us when they are writing an article, or at least do some basic fact checking before going to press.  I’d be happy to be interviewed for a future AiG newsletter article that would correct some of the errors they’ve made in this article.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an eloquent response from the head of the organization.  I imagine she’d have even more interesting thoughts to share with Ham’s followers if he took her up on that last line.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will he do that?  I doubt it.  But I’d love to be proven wrong here.&lt;br&gt;

The talk was based on the book he co-wrote with Simon Singh: &lt;i&gt;Trick or Treatment&lt;/i&gt;. This is my (unsystematic) review.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
Professer Ernst began by telling us that the book has received much criticism from advocates of alternative medicine - and was met with bewilderment from some, who seemed surprised that a professor of complementary medicine would criticise CAM. To that, Ernst said that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An uncritical scientist is a contradiction in terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His introductory slide included statements to the effect that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A large proportion of the general population uses CAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patient population figures for use of CAM are much higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the UK, we spend £1.6 billion on CAM each year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even the most fundamental questions remain unanswered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide number two highlighted four ways of attempting to find out if something works: plausibility; the test of time; ask the patient; do the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloodletting was used as an example for each of the first two options. &lt;i&gt;Plausibility&lt;/i&gt;: Ernst pointed out that (at the time) bloodletting was seen as a plausible treatment because of the belief that health was affected by the status of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism"&gt;four humours&lt;/a&gt;. He then went on to point out that acupuncture (based on the principles of "yin and yang"), chiropractic (based on the idea of "subluxations"), homeopathy (based on the principle that "like cures like"), and reflexology (based on the idea that points on the foot correspond to the internal organs of the body) are utterly implausible. Although he then pointed out that implausibility doesn't necessarily rule out a treatment being effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the &lt;i&gt;test of time&lt;/i&gt;, Ernst noted that bloodletting was used for hundreds, if not thousands of years despite being ineffective. He then quoted Oscar Wilde: "experience is the name we give to our mistakes", which I thought was a rather neat way to illustrate the problem with assuming that the longevity of a treatment was a reliable measure of its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tackling the option &lt;i&gt;ask the patient&lt;/i&gt;, Ernst showed a slide from Marja Verhoef that showed a hierarchy of the factors important to patients. "Gut feelings" were at the top of the pyramid, "trial-and-error" and media articles were also listed but I was unable to note all the factors or the order of importance of the factors. There is an &lt;a href="http://beta.medicinescomplete.com/journals/fact/current/fact0905a13a86.htm"&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt; of a qualitative study conducted by Verhoef and others which lists types of evidence relied upon by cancer patients searching for information on complementary therapies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific evidence ranked very low for most patients. Anecdotal evidence was among the top types of evidence patients relied on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we came to &lt;i&gt;research&lt;/i&gt;. Ernst related the proposal made by Jan Baptist van Helmont in 1662. Thanks to the &lt;a href="http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/essays/casting_of_lots/casting.html"&gt;James Lind Library&lt;/a&gt;, I am able to reproduce the quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Let us take out of the hospitals...200 or 500 poor people, that have fevers, pleurisies. Let us divide them into halves, let us cast lots, that one halfe of them may fall to my share, and the other to yours; I will cure them without bloodletting and sensible evacuation; but you do, as ye know...We shall see how many funerals both of us shall have.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was perhaps the first time that an RCT had been proposed. Unfortunately, it wasn't until 1809 and &lt;a href="http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/trial_records/19th_Century/hamilton/hamilton_commentary.html"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; that a trial of bloodletting is believed to have taken place. Ernst then moved on to James Lind himself and the famous trial of treatments for scurvy. The James Lind Library has a commentary of the trial here: &lt;a href="http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/trial_records/17th_18th_Century/lind/lind_1753_commentary.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. Ernst informed us that one of the treatments tried was "hard labour" and explained that as one of the symptoms of scurvy was lethargy, confusion over cause and effect had led to the belief that this may be a useful treatment. His comment that hard work was believed to be a treatment for "lazy bastards" brought laughter from the audience. I had expected the talk to be rather dry, but was pleased to note several moments where humour was employed by the professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Acupuncture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernst referred to a positive trial by Berman et al that studied the use of acupuncture for osteoarthritis, then pointed out that we must beware the cherry-pickers. A single trial cannot be expected to prove the efficacy of a treatment, but systematic reviews are more reliable. While acupuncture has been touted as a panacea (cure-all), Ernst noted that it has only been shown to be effective for pain and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Chiropractic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section of the talk began with discussion of the origins of chiropractic, which some may have been surprised to find was not invented as a treatment for back problems. A slide was shown that listed systematic reviews of chiropractic spinal manipulation for various conditions alongside percentages of chiropractors who (wrongly in most cases) believed that chiropractic was an effective treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernst then moved on to the risks of chiropractic, noting that mild to moderate adverse effects of the treatment were not disputed - in comparison to severe adverse effects which were hotly disputed. Discussion of chiropractic ended with a slide showing a pair of scales labelled "harm" and "benefit", with the harms being shown as heavier than the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Homeopathy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning with a slide showing a homeopathic pamphlet featuring Queen Elizabeth II, we were told that the royal family were "staunch supporters" of alternative treatments such as homeopathy. Ernst went on to say that the treatment was based on the principles that "like-cures-like" and "less-is-more" - principles that are totally implausible. Ernst told us of a study he had conducted into homeopathic arnica which made him "very unpopular with British homeopaths" (who were "quite outraged" - but which was later confirmed by two independent systematic reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noting that some homeopaths complained that trials of homeopathy that did not study individualised treatment of patients, Ernst referred to a trial of individualised homeopathy for childhood asthma which provided no evidence that individualised homeopathy was superior to placebo as an adjunctive treatment. Cautioning us once more against the reliance upon single trials, Ernst then told the audience of a systematic review of systematic reviews. I believe this is the paper in question: &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12492603"&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt; on Pubmed. Ending the section on homeopathy with reference to harm and benefit, Ernst discussed the possibility that, while an inert treatment such as homeopathy may not cause harm, homeopaths themselves might - for example by offering homeopathy as an alternative treatment for swine flu. Again, the slide showing a pair of scales with the balance tipped towards "harm" was shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernst digressed from discussion of the four complementary / alternative therapies at this point to point out that he doesn't see himself as a "Quackbuster" - but as having to choose whether or not to tell the truth about his investigation of complementary and alternative therapies. Telling the truth seems to lead to him being labelled as a Quackbuster. Ernst then pointed to studies into St John's Wort for depression as an example of investigation into CAM that found an effective therapy, before pointing out the risks (particularly that St John's Wort can interact with prescription medication). Leading on from this discussion of an effective CAM treatment, Ernst moved to the last of the four therapies that were the focus of his talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Reflexology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernst points out that reflexology may be relaxing and thus beneficial for patients. While the theory behind reflexology is implausible, massage therapy can be beneficial. I have struggled to find the systematic review of massage therapy Ernst referred to, but believe that this may be it: &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19148685"&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt; on Pubmed. On the whole, the evidence was positive (albeit there were concerns over methodology). From the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[the trials] suggest that massage can alleviate a wide range of symptoms: pain, nausea, anxiety, depression, anger, stress and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Summing-up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were told that CAM is popular, used by patients, and in fact is driven by patients. Because of this, Ernst believes it is important to address the general public. He pointed out that of the research into CAM:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...you find some gems in this mess but you find a lot of disappointing results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then reaffirmed his stance that he is not a Quackbuster, but is a scientific investigator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Questions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having invited questions from the audience and promised a copy of his book for the three best efforts, the first questioner was a gentleman who had got his copy of &lt;i&gt;Trick or Treatment&lt;/i&gt; signed by Ernst before the lecture and hence did not need a copy as a prize. He asked about the gold-standard of trials, the RCT, and whether there were problems with this approach to discovering the truth about medical therapies. Ernst stated that while there were problems with RCTs, they were the best option we had for investigating treatments. Referring to the issue that trials of this nature tell us about the group rather than individuals, Ernst reminded us that in medical science we must deal in probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question about placebo brought a response to the effect that the placebo response can be powerful. The professor then pointed out that a genuine treatment given by a practitioner who was able to empathise with the patient would have both specific and placebo effects. CAM treatments that are no better than placebo cheat us of the specific effects that genuine treatments can offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lady sitting to my left then asked about clinicians' views (with reference to the hierarchy of patients' views Ernst had shown us earlier). Ernst replied that clinicians often rely on experience rather than the best available evidence - and that "that is wrong" (I paraphrase here, as I cannot remember the verbatim quote).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a question about the regulation of CAM (with regard to the Prince of Wales's FIH and the CNHC, better known as OfQuack). Ernst pointed out that regulated nonsense remains nonsense and complained that CAM practitioners have no requirement to use the evidence-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there were many elements of the talk (and questions &amp;amp; answers following the talk) that I failed to note down. I hope that my scrawled notes and imperfect memory have conveyed an accurate impression of the views of Professor Ernst but I would not be surprised to find that my notes and memory of the event are both far from perfect. I have also failed to recall or to make note of the humourous moments of the talk which brought laughter from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My overall impression was that Ernst is keen to engage with the general public and to inform them about evidence-based medicine and also the pitfalls that they should avoid. For example, being misled by cherry-pickers giving single studies as proof of a treatment's efficacy, or reliance upon inadequate evidence of other kinds - such as anecdotal evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;one ring to find them.
&lt;br&gt;One ring to bring them all
&lt;br&gt;and in the darkness bind them. &lt;i&gt;--J.R.R. Tolkien&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Of course we're all familiar with the planet Saturn.  Gas giant, many moons, and, of course, its prominent rings:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/saturn_when_one_ring_doesnt_ru/saturnPic1.jpg" width="500" title="And do you know what Galileo called them?  Ears!" alt="saturnPic1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that word, ring&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;.  Sure, at a distance, it may just look like one elongated ring.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/saturn_when_one_ring_doesnt_ru/lordoftherings20037.jpg" width="500" title="That is *not* the one ring we were talking about, Ethan." alt="lordoftherings20037.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But our tools for measurement are better than our mere naked eyes.  Saturn was known, very clearly, to have seven separate rings, many of which are separated by large moons in their orbits.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/saturn_when_one_ring_doesnt_ru/inset-saturn-rings-large.jpg" width="500" title="And what are the moons made out of?  Orange stars, yellow moons, green clovers, blue diamonds..." alt="inset-saturn-rings-large.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But very recently, a team of astronomers from Maryland and Virginia have discovered that far beyond the seven standard rings, millions of miles out away from Saturn, is a large, diffuse, and tilted &lt;i&gt;eighth ring&lt;/i&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/saturn_when_one_ring_doesnt_ru/saturn_1496881c.jpg" width="500" title="Artists rendition, but what else are you gonna do?" alt="saturn_1496881c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the rings are a bit of a mystery.  Are they billions of years old?  Are they recent, having just arisen from a collision with a Saturnian moon?  Are they as old as the Solar System itself?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this question is still an open one for the inner seven rings, we have strong reasons to believe the eighth one is relatively new.  Why?  Whenever you have a rotating system, particles get separated out by density, just like in a centrifuge.  The Earth has a different elemental composition than Mercury, Saturn, or Pluto, and for the same reason, Saturn's inner moons have a different composition than its outermost moons.  But in between the seventh and eighth rings lies a very interesting moon, Iapetus.  Why is Iapetus so interesting?  Just have a look at it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/saturn_when_one_ring_doesnt_ru/iapetus-bright.jpg" width="500" title="Most worlds don&amp;#39;t look like this, do they?" alt="iapetus-bright.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iapetus is two-toned.  The brown-ish side?  That's basically insects smashed against its windshield.  As Iapetus speeds around Saturn, it continuously runs into this material that's trying to fall in from the eighth ring.  And where did this eighth-ring material come from?  It looks like Saturn's moon Phoebe -- which has clearly been struck by comets and/or asteroids before -- is responsible.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/saturn_when_one_ring_doesnt_ru/148216main_image_feature_565_ys_4.jpg" width="500" title="The root of all... debris?" alt="148216main_image_feature_565_ys_4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since they're at such different distances from Saturn, they're made up of different materials, and so have different colors and densities.  Something must have collided with Phoebe, knocking all of this dusty material up and into a ring around Saturn.  And a small amount of it falls in and is swept up by Iapetus, changing one side of its color, but not the other!  (Why?  Since Iapetus doesn't rotate freely; it's locked to Saturn.)

&lt;p&gt;It's a look that's been painted and photographed untold times: a mother gazing deep into her infant's eyes while the two smile and kiss. Psychologists believe this interplay helps a child's emotional and cognitive development. The behavior was thought to exist only in humans and to a lesser extent in our closest kin, chimpanzees. Now, scientists have discovered similarly intense shared gazing and facial expressions in monkeys. And that means, the researchers say, that this kind of maternal communication dates back at least 30 million years. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author

You cannot doubt Belief A except from a position of faith in Belief B.” Writing to skeptics he claims that “The reason you doubt Christianity’s Belief A is because you hold unprovable Belief B. Every doubt, therefore, is based on a leap of faith.” [&lt;i&gt;The Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism &lt;/i&gt;(New York: Riverhead Books, 2008), p. xviii]. We have faith, he opines, whenever we accept something that is “unprovable,” and all of us “have fundamental, unprovable faith commitments that we think are superior to those of others.” [Ibid., p. 20]. So he argues skeptics likewise “must doubt your doubts.” [Ibid., p. xix]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I said, I do not accept Keller’s definition of faith. He’s manipulating the debate by using a language game in his favor. I reject his game and his conclusion. Here is why, based on something David Eller argues: “&lt;b&gt;knowing is not believing&lt;/b&gt;.” He argues that if believers “can drag down real knowledge to their level and erase any distinctions between the true and the false, the known and the merely felt or believed or guessed, they can rest comfortably in their own undeserved self-certainty.” He defends the view that “knowledge is about reason and that belief is about faith, and the two are logically and psychologically utterly different and even incompatible.” [David Eller, &lt;i&gt;Natural Atheism&lt;/i&gt;, pp, 132-33]. The word faith (and belief) must be reserved to apply in this context to beliefs about that which cannot be empirically sensed or tested, like ghosts, angels, demons and gods. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Craig responds similarly to Keller when it comes to questions I've raised about his claim that the inner witness of the Holy Spirit "trumps all other evidence" &lt;a href="http://www.reasonablefaith.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;amp;id=6489"&gt;in his Q &amp;amp; A&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Craig wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;...most of our beliefs cannot be evidentially justified. Take, for example, the belief that the world was not created five minutes ago with built-in memory traces, food in our stomachs from meals we never really ate, and other appearances of age. Or the belief that the external world around us is real rather than a computer-generated virtual reality. Anyone who has seen a film like The Matrix realizes that the person living in such a virtual reality has no evidence that he is not in such an illusory world. But surely we're rational in believing that the world around us is real and has existed longer than five minutes, even though we have no evidence for this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I find these examples to be strange ones, very strange. So let’s see if I can put this into perspective. He's arguing that since it’s rational to believe we’re not in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; or that we have not been created five minutes ago, it’s also rational to believe in God without evidence. Is there truly no evidence against our beliefs that we were not created five minutes ago or that we're not living in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;? These examples are bandied about among philosophers as if they are self-evident, including the evil demon and dream conjectures of Rene Descartes. We are told there is no evidence for what we believe about such things &lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt; we are told by Reformed Epistemologists like Plantinga and Craig that these examples parallel their belief in the “great truths of the gospel.” Let’s look at these things in turn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, I think there is evidence to suggest we were not created five minutes ago, depending on what we mean by evidence. &lt;strong&gt;Evidence in its broadest conception includes anything and everything used to demonstrate the truth of a claim, which includes our arguments based on the things we’ve experienced&lt;/strong&gt;. What we believe will be based on the probability of the evidence, all of it, as broadly defined. As such, I think there is evidence against the existence of a creator God. The arguments for the existence of God are not persuasive. I do not think such a God could create the first moment in time if he is somehow “outside of time.” And I do not think a spiritual Supreme Being could create a material world. Even if a creator God exists I find no evidence that he would create us into such a massively deceptive world five minutes ago anyway. Therefore there is evidence against our having been created five minutes ago. All they have left is a mere remote possibility, not anything like a probability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The demon hypothesis of Rene Descartes, in which there might be a demon who is deceiving me right now, fails because of the same evidence just mentioned above with regard to God creating us five minutes ago. Descartes uses his extreme method of hypothetical doubt like a massive sword. The mere possibility that there is such a demon was enough to cast doubt on his knowledge about the external world. But why must we base what we accept as the case on a mere possibility? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to the question of whether I’m dreaming right now a good case has been made by Norman Malcom [in his book &lt;em&gt;Dreaming and Skepticism&lt;/em&gt;], and Bernard Williams [in his book &lt;em&gt;Descartes&lt;/em&gt;], that there is a difference between dreams and our waking experience. The fact that we can distinguish between them presupposes we are aware of them both and of their differences. It’s only from the perspective of being awake that we can explain our dreams. Hence we can only make sense of this distinction if we are sometimes awake. And since this is the case, all of our experiences throughout our entire lives cannot be made up merely of a sequence of dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What about the world depicted in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; film? There are several responses to such a radical scenario which would upstage most everything we accept as true about our existence in this world. Such a scenario is a mere possibility, if it is possible at all, and a very unlikely one at that. The story is just implausible. I see no reason why there would be any human resistance or knowledge of the Matrix at all by people living in the Matrix, since it determines all of their experiences…all of them. I also see no reason why a pill or a decision by Neo could make any difference at all while inside the Matrix. Apart from the story line itself I see no reason for the Matrix in the first place, and I see no reason why our bodies are better at fueling it than other sources. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As David Mitsuo Nixon argued, “The proper response to someone’s telling me that my belief could be false is, “So what?” It’s not possibility that matters, it’s probability, So until you give me a good reason to think that my belief is not just possibly true, but probably false, I’m not changing anything about what I believe or what I think I know.” [“The Matrix Possibility” in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix and Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;, ed. William Irwin (p. 30)]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So even if the Matrix is a possibility, it too is an extremely unlikely one. To overturn nearly everything we think in order to accept it would be to go against the overwhelming evidence (as defined above) about that which we claim to know. In fact, it would be self-defeating to accept it, for if we did then how do we know that THAT world isn't just another kind of Matrix? That is, if the we accept the claim about the Matrix then it would cause us to distrust everything we experience. And since this is the case, then Neo would have no reason for trusting the experiences he had while supposedly outside the Matrix in the so-called “real world?” When it comes to Neo knowing the real world in distinction from the Matrix he has been given no reason to think one world is real and the other is illusionary. The red pill could have been nothing more than a hallucinogenic drug, for instance. So Neo would have no basis for trusting those experiences supposedly outside the Matrix in the real world, and as such he would end up as an “epistemological solipsist,” not having any reason for trusting there is a world outside his mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Craig also wrote…&lt;blockquote&gt;Many of the things we know are not based on evidence. So why must belief in God be so based? Belief in God and the great truths of the Gospel is not a blind exercise of faith, a groundless leap in the dark. Rather, as Plantinga emphasizes, Christian belief is part of the deliverances of reason, grounded in the inner witness of the Holy Spirit, which is an objective reality mediated to me from God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Notice the impossibly huge leap Craig makes here. From the fact that we cannot be absolutely certain &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(a) that we were not created five minutes ago, or &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(b) that we are not living in a Matrix,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Craig claims, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(c) we can know with some real assurance that the Christian God exists and that the gospel is true. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think a proper conclusion from what he’s argued can only lead him to conclude that since it’s a remote possibility that (a) and (b) obtains, it’s therefore a remote possibility that (c) obtains. But this is extremely problematic. As I’ve argued in my book, Christians repeatedly retreat to the position that what they believe is “possible,” or “not impossible,” rather than what is probable. When they do this they are admitting the evidence is not on their side. They’re trying to explain the evidence away. Just because all of these things are possible he cannot conclude that what he believes is probable. A possibility is not a probability. How he slips in a probability because of a possibility is beyond me. The inference does not follow. It's a huge non-sequitur.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-8843154234126316071?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It is likely that Obama is the most surprised of all. I’m sure the uniform reaction is: “But what has he actually done?” He’s been President less than nine months. And it’s not like he had major “peace” accomplishments in his short tenure as a Senator. So has the Swedish Academy (or, actually, the Norwegian Parliament, which is an interesting story in its own right) gone insane? No. It’s fairly apparent that Obama is receiving the Nobel because he has been forcefully articulating a compelling future. In his speeches and actions, he is attempting to bring together Israelis and Palestinians, Christians and Muslims, Blacks and Whites, Rich and Poor. He has a clear vision of a world at peace, in a broad sense of the term. Although this may be unattainable, we can certainly get a lot closer than we are now. The Prize is “to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations,” and indeed, over the past year Obama stands apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the scientific perspective, Obama has had tremendous impact (the Peace Prize singles out his “constructive role in meeting the great climatic challenges the world is confronting”). His appointees are first-rate, and there is a feeling that we are finally starting to move in the right direction. It is hard, of course, to point to tangible scientific results that have arisen because of Obama. There simply hasn’t been time enough. But this does not negate his impact; the momentum is apparent and encouraging. It is a similar story in international diplomacy. Obama also benefits from eight preceding years of Bush. Within the scientific community, the Bush administration represented a dark age. Any subsequent reasonable policy would seem to be enlightened. Thus to have a truly exceptional policy, informed by actual science and scientists (instead of cynical political aims), has a profound effect on the state of affairs. It is a similar story in international diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that the Nobel committee wants to be relevant. A major criticism of the Physics Prize is that it has a relatively minor impact on the field of physics. It’s almost always given decades after the fact, to researchers that are already well known and well established. For the vast majority of recipients, their work is not suddenly transformed by the Prize. If anything, they become significantly less productive, as they’re now busy traveling the world and giving talks and (justifiably) enjoying the prominence only a Nobel can confer. Do not misunderstand: I am certainly not criticizing the Nobel Prize. It brings much positive attention to the field, and for the most part singles out very deserving recipients. It is the ultimate advertising campaign for physics, and we all benefit from it. (It would nonetheless be interesting to compare it to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_medal"&gt;Fields Medal&lt;/a&gt; [effectively the Nobel for mathematics], which is only given to mathematicians under the age of 40.) In this context, giving the Peace Prize to Obama is an inspired choice. They are hoping to give him more stature and leverage to help him achieve his goals; they want to help make the world a better place. It affirms the importance of American leadership on the world stage, and endorses our President’s vision of a world at peace. All Americans, regardless of political affiliation, should celebrate this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>daniel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255110582718"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=9873">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4d253f0561503e2a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Comments"/><title type="html">Super-Massive Comment o’ the Week!</title><published>2009-10-09T17:00:04Z</published><updated>2009-10-09T17:00:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/10/super-massive-comment-o-the-week/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAM London got in the way of me posting a COTW last Friday, so this week I’ve decided to award two — TWO! — Comment o’ the Weeks!

&lt;p&gt;I feel like memetics is missing from this discussion. We have, after all, produced the Internet, which has allowed memes to flourish wildly. And while there’s probably a genetic component to intelligence, there’s also undeniably a memetic one: you can’t learn an idea that you’re never even exposed to. We’ve seen a rise in skepticism and a drop in religiosity just in the past few years, and I think that has nothing to do with genetics and everything to do with a war of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to put it another way, Randi’s never had kids, but most of us here are like his brain-babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WIN:&lt;/strong&gt; An alleged quack who allegedly sold herbal cures for cancer &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33234411/ns/health-cancer/"&gt;has been slapped with a fraud lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;. The charges are that this ordained Pentecostal minister preyed on vulnerable terminal cancer patients using religious trappings. Nice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOSE:&lt;/strong&gt; The Natural News &lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/027205_vaccines_swine_flu_the_FDA.html"&gt;altmed website&lt;/a&gt; — which promotes all sorts of nonsense, including connecting vaccines and autism — reports that a &amp;quot;health freedom attorney&amp;quot; (heh) has filed a suit against the FDA to halt the distribution of swine flu vaccine. However, their claims of this vaccine being rushed, untested, and so on, &lt;a href="http://www.antivaxxers.com/?p=512"&gt;are all completely false&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y’know, if people want to take tinctures and poultices and whatever that does nothing whatsoever instead of real medicine, that’s their right. But when they try to stop others from getting real medicine — medicine that can save many lives — because of their own gross misunderstanding of science, then that becomes a public threat. I hope the judge throws this case out of court, and then fines all those involved for frivolous lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not-so-incidentally, the Natural News website says this suit is being filed on behalf of Gary Null, and a perusal of his website shows him to be antivax as well as an AIDS denialist (someone who doesn’t think HIV causes AIDS)… and I am shocked, &lt;em&gt;shocked&lt;/em&gt;, to find out he has his own line of alternative cures. These are the kinds of folks we’re dealing with, and why I get so very upset about all this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this really isn’t a &amp;quot;lose&amp;quot; yet, but it’s a lose in the sense that people with such a tenuous grasp of reality attack it with such fervor. They are putting everyone at risk: you, me, &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;. That’s why I am so vocal, and will continue to be.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255108971729"><id gr:original-id="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/?p=1823">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e888e6aed2a8b653</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="1"/><title type="html">Canada succeeds in university rankings</title><published>2009-10-09T16:26:43Z</published><updated>2009-10-09T16:26:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/canada-succeeds-in-university-rankings/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/" type="html">I was just thinking some more about the THE-QS University Rankings, but instead of looking at the list from an institutional point of view (see previous post), I was thinking about how they reflected the Canadian approach to academia and research.

Right from the beginning, you know &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/creationists-science-bible-disprove-ardi-fossil-evidence-evolution/Story?id=8766121&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;this article is bunk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite the excitement from the paleontology community, another group of researchers, many of them with advanced degrees in science, are unimpressed by Ardi, who they believe is just another ape -- an ape of indeterminate age, they add, and an ape who cannot be an ancestor of modern man for a range of reasons, including one of singular importance: God created man in one day, and evolution is a fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole article is like that: they cite Creation Ministries International, the Institute for Creation Research, and Answers in Genesis, puffing up the credentials of these loons and credulously reporting their dissent. None of these fellows is any kind of researcher, all are looked upon as utterly crazy, and there is no reason to consult &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; of them on a science story, let alone dedicating a long article solely to their batty position (they quote one of the real researchers just once, saying that the discovery was an important find — but it is more to lend weight to the parade of nutcases declaring it trivial.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They give a lot of space to Answers in Genesis, especially to one of their pet frauds-with-a-degree, David Menton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What creationists believe about human origins we get from the Bible," said David Menton an acclaimed anatomist and also a creationist. "The creation of the world takes place on page one of the Bible. If you throw out the first page of the Bible you might as well throw out the whole thing. If you can't live with the first page then pitch out the remaining thousand pages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Menton is not an acclaimed anatomist. His sole claim to fame is his weird belief that the earth is only 6000 years old. Although, I must say, I agree with his sentiment here: the first page is metaphorical, poetical nonsense and should be thrown out, and the rest should be tossed right after it. But what really annoys me is the patent disrespect for knowledge in these people. &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; is a genus that lived &lt;i&gt;over 4 million years ago&lt;/i&gt;. Shouldn't there be a little bit of awe at that? Not from the ICR.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a meaningless discovery of another ape. As far as the creationist community is concerned, this is a big yawn. There is nothing about Ardi that has anything to do with the evolution of man," said John Morris, president of the Institute for Creation Research in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Menton just keeps on bringing the dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menton believes scientists sat on the Ardi discovery for over a decade just to roll it out during the Darwin anniversary. He questions the ability to accurately date any fossils more than a few thousand years old, let alone millions, and he said the condition of the skeleton was so incomplete and fragile that serious research was almost impossible.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Menton said Ardi's skull and feet are exactly the kind of skull and feet you would expect an ape to have and have none of the features of modern humans.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Evolutionists want to call Ardi 'ape-like.' This creature is ape-like, because she is an ape. Just call it an ape," he said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The biggest problem Menton has with Ardi is her estimated age. The Earth, he says, is no more around 5,000 years old, a number creationists have estimated by counting the generations of man named in the Bible from Adam to Jesus.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Evolution is supposedly based on science, but the science does not prove what they want it to. Creationism is not based on scientific observation but on God's word. God created everything in six days, and that's it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Errm, the scientists all agree: Ardi was an ape. They say it right out. They'll also tell 'acclaimed' anatomist Menton that, based on the anatomy, we humans are also apes. We also regard the even older last common ancestor of chimps (which are apes) and humans (also apes) to have been an ape. Therefore, any transitional form between an ancient ape and a modern ape is expected to be an ape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did Menton expect? A frickin' giraffe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the rest…anyone in the 21st century who rants about the earth being 6000 years old and unthinkingly accepts the scientific authority of an ancient book cobbled together by tribes of sheepherders really needs to be shuffled off to a rubber room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is ABC News doing getting a story on a serious scientific issue from a series of lunatic asylums? I don't know. Who is this 'journalist,' Russel Goldman, who scribbled up this gullible slop? I don't know and I don't care, except that I'll know to throw anything else he writes in the rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;

One thing that hospitals notice is that the surgery schedule in the O.R. often slows down considerably for several days. If you're the junior surgeon or otherwise the low man on the totem pole, you suddenly find that it's easy to get O.R. time, that you can book cases at times you normally couldn't before, and that you might even get the better rooms. The reason? Simple. The middle of October is the time when the &lt;a href="http://www.facs.org/clincon2009"&gt;American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress&lt;/a&gt; takes place, and that's where I'm going this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What that means for the ol' blog is that things will slow down. What will probably happen is that I'll post the usual collection of "best of" posts (if there is a such thing for this blog). However, much of what I will repost will be more than three years old, which means it'll new to you if you haven't been following the wild and woolly world of the Insolence that is Orac  for at least two or three years. Of course, as nearly always, there will be some new stuff interspersed with the old, frantically typed out between meetings or in the morning before I head off to McCormick Place to take in all that surgical science-y goodness. (It's all part of my evil plan to keep readers from simply deciding not to check back her until the middle of next week.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'll even manage to find some awesome EneMan tchotchkes. Part of the reason I haven't done any &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/medicine/eneman/"&gt;EneMan posts&lt;/a&gt; for a while is because...well, Fleet never sent me a &lt;a href="http://www.enemangoesto.com"&gt;2009 Calendar&lt;/a&gt; (despite my asking) and, more importantly, I simply haven't had a lot of inspiration for something to do with our intrepid anti-woo blog mascot. That will have to change. Our old friend with the thing sticking out of his head about whose purpose you really don't want to inquire in too much detail will put up with a lot, but a year out of the limelight? Even that may be too much. Maybe he'll even be at the Fleet display in the Exhibit Hall, in which case I must get a picture of myself with our old friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, maybe I'll end up meeting up with some of my readers. The last time I suggested such a thing, it went over like the proverbial led balloon, but we'll see this time. A reader facetiously (I think) suggested just the place:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/im_off_to_chicago_and_the_woo_doth_flow.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/im_off_to_chicago_and_the_woo_doth_flow.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/K3pqWW0UoVE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255105348437"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/tuberculosis_detected_in_bones_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/07f520f82d35032c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">Tuberculosis Detected in Bones from 9 kya Israeli Neolithic Site</title><published>2009-10-09T17:11:05Z</published><updated>2009-10-09T17:11:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/Z4QfFNj_Cbs/tuberculosis_detected_in_bones_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/tuberculosis_detected_in_bones_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A team of archaeologists working offshore from Haifa, Israel in the Mediterranean has discovered both direct and indirect evidence of human tuberculosis.  This is important because, if confirmed, the TB cases date to 3,000 years earlier than expected:  The disease should not be in skeletons this old.  Also, this research seems to indicate that Tuberculosis did not originally arise in cattle to be later transmitted to humans, but rather, the other way around.  &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherman now has good news to report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilgrim Baptist Church &lt;a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/godless-in-chicago/2009/10/illinois-cancels-million-dollar-grant-to-pilgrim-baptist-church.html"&gt;won’t be getting any of that money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The excuse that the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity used for cancelling the Grant was that there was insufficient money to fund the grant, but we know what the real reason was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame on the Christians of Pilgrim Baptist for trying to steal our tax dollars from us.  It’s not like they didn’t know that they can’t do that.  I spent many hours on the phone with leaders of that church, last year, explaining that what they were trying to do was illegal, but they didn’t care.  They decided to go for the money, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not surprised by their decision to try to perpetrate this crime against us.  After all, they’re Christians.  They don’t have the same high ethical standards that we atheists have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time, I’ll stop holding back and tell you how I really feel.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if Sherman was the sole reason the church isn’t getting the money — he’s certainly patting himself on the back about it — but no doubt that without complaints like his, these illegal marriages between church and state would happen far more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/godless-in-chicago/2009/10/illinois-cancels-million-dollar-grant-to-pilgrim-baptist-church.html"&gt;hats off to you, Rob Sherman&lt;/a&gt;.  Nice work being persistent about this issue, keeping it in the minds of the politicians, and ultimately getting something positive to show for it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A new study just published gives us some new information about Archaeopteryx. It turns out the structure of its bones was more like a dinosaur’s than a bird’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has led to some annoying headlines: ‘&lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/animals/091008-bird-growth.html"&gt;First Bird’ Not Very Bird-Like&lt;/a&gt;. The new study actually does not change our thinking about Archaeopteryx – it is a basal bird, so it has some primitive bird features, and some dinosaur features. Now we know its bones were more like a dinosaur – just like its teeth and tail. This is what we would expect from a transitional species like Archaeopteryx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For background, Archaeopteryx lithographica was first discovered in 1861 – what is now called the London specimen. There are currently a total of &lt;a href="http://www.fossilmuseum.net/paleo/paleonews/Archaeopteryx.htm"&gt;10 specimens&lt;/a&gt; plus one separate feather (many sources I found still give the outdated number of 8 specimens, but there have been a couple more recent finds). Pictured above is the Berlin specimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archaeopteryx is perhaps one of the most famous fossil species because of its timing – right around the time of the publication of Darwin’s &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;. Darwin’s Bulldog, T.H. Huxley, was among the first to speculate that perhaps birds evolved from dinosaurs. So the discovery of Archaeopteryx was timely confirmation of both evolution and the dino-to-bird hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is one of the most spectacular transitional species we have. It has primitive &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/archaeopteryx/info.html#features"&gt;avian features&lt;/a&gt;: feathers, an opposable hallux, and a fercula (wishbone). It also seems that Archaeopteryx was able to fly. But simultaneously it has many reptilian features: it lacks a bill or beak, free rather than fused truncal vertebrae, elongated cerebral hemispheres, a long bony tail, teeth, rear-attaching skull (birds’ attach from below), abdominal ribs, and claws on three unfused digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also lacked some modern adaptations to flight, such as a triosseal canal, a specialized structure that enables modern birds to perform a wing flip maneuver that helps them take off from a standing start on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, Archaeopteryx retains many more features of theropod dinosaurs than it has modern avian features, and it lacks sophisticated adaptations of flight. It was more a flying feathered dinosaur than a bird. Again – a compelling transitional species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new study, therefore, fits right in with our current view of Archaeopteryx (which doesn’t make for splashy headlines). &lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/animals/091008-bird-growth.html"&gt;Looking at the bones of Archaeopteryx&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bones from these early birds looked similar to those of same-sized dinosaurs, as they were dense with small blood vessels and bone cells that were flattened and parallel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This implies that Archaeopteryx was slow growing, like dinosaurs, rather than fast growing like birds, which we would then infer was a later adaptation in the line that led to modern birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stunning evidence for the evolution of birds from dinosaurs does not stop evolution deniers, who are immune to evidence. Answers in Genesis has an &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/nab/did-dinosaurs-turn-into-birds"&gt;article on Archaeopteryx&lt;/a&gt;, and they get just about everything wrong. They grossly misrepresent the factual evidence (claiming, for example, that there is little evidence for feathered dinosaurs) and resort to their go-to logical fallacies (Archaeopteryx is just another kind of creature that God made). I will leave it to my interested readers to take it apart further – it’s a good primer on the logical fallacies of denial.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255102845826"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/impeach_obama.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/88a95330fc6a26d2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">Impeach Obama?</title><published>2009-10-09T16:10:16Z</published><updated>2009-10-09T16:10:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/MgbjCYvwQDs/impeach_obama.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/impeach_obama.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The news that Obama has won a Nobel peace prize was weird — and don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I don&amp;#39;t think he has done badly at promoting peace, I just don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s made the kind of exceptional effort that something with the prestige of the Nobel ought to reward — but here&amp;#39;s something much, much crazier: WhirledNutDaily has begun a campaign to &lt;i&gt;impeach&lt;/i&gt; Obama. You might be wondering on what grounds they would commit this act…but they don&amp;#39;t seem to have anything specific. I just got email from WND begging for donations for their little crusade, and here&amp;#39;s the best reason they offer, from some wingnut radio personality, Tammy Bruce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... ultimately, it comes down to... the fact that he seems to have, it seems to me, some malevolence toward this country, which is unabated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ranks right up there with the "he looked at me funny" excuse for starting a fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole piece is a detestable incitement to take any action necessary to bring down Obama. Look at their 'reasoning':&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Make no mistake.  We're now in the middle of a bloodless coup - 
				the takeover of an entire nation by the hate-America crowd - a cold-blooded gang that despises American's 
				prosperity, our standing in the world, our trust in God and our generosity and goodness.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    
America is a monument to the triumph of freedom.  When Barack Hussein Obama thinks about freedom... he sees a world in which some people, due 
to personal initiative and good fortune, will do better than others... live better than others.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    
And in that regard, he is right.  But Barack Obama sees that as unfair.  Where you see freedom, liberty and the opportunity for 
any American to be all that he or she can be, Obama sees greed and bigotry.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    
And, like so many on the far-left before him, going all the way back to Karl Marx, he believes that it&amp;#39;s his mission to promote 
&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"equality of outcome" &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;over &lt;i&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"equality of opportunity"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; 
&lt;span style="background-color:#ffffb9"&gt;&lt;i&gt;even if Americans must learn to live in chains to make it happen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;i&gt;(in fact, servitude to the iron will of government will be required). &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    
That worldview makes Barack Hussein Obama a very dangerous man and one of the greatest threats to your personal liberty today.     
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    
That dangerous worldview also explains why he has already gobbled-up major banks and why the government now controls more and 
more of our money - yours and mine.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    
And if you &lt;span style="background-color:#ffffb9"&gt;&lt;i&gt;wake up one day to discover you're broke... don't be surprised... 
and while you're at it, don't feel bad either because at least everyone will be broke... 
destitute... under the iron yoke of government... but everything will be fair 
and equal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;... that's what extremists, like Obama, mean when they use 
the term... &lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;social justice.&amp;quot; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    
And he&amp;#39;ll make it happen... he can make it happen... he&amp;#39;s already started to 
make it happen.  &lt;span style="background-color:#ffffb9"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Barack Hussein Obama is Bernie Madoff with the political power of the presidency at
his disposal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.       
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    
That dangerous worldview explains the sudden and shocking erosion of your freedom to make a living, to run your own business, 
whether a Mom-and-Pop grocery store or General Motors.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    
That dangerous worldview explains why his Attorney General, Eric Holder, despises the 2nd Amendment... why, if he had his way, 
he would take away our guns, leaving us defenseless against gangs and hoods - and, more to the point, against Obama&amp;#39;s own 
shock-troops from 
&lt;i&gt;ACORN&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;SEIU&lt;/i&gt;.  Remember, it was the healthy and rational fear of government that led to the inclusion of the 
2nd Amendment in the Constitution of the United States.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    
And that dangerous worldview explains why Obama intends to take away your freedom to choose your own doctor... your own 
treatment.  Wherever government controls health care, bureaucrats decide who gets treatments... who gets transplants... 
who gets dialysis... who gets costly medication... and who needs to die for the common good.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    
What can we do to stop this monomaniac... this American dictator?  There&amp;#39;s only one answer.       
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    
Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution reads: &lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"The President, Vice President and all civil 
officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, 
or other high crimes and misdemeanors."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes on and on like that — you can just picture the authors frothing at the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess I'd have to say that maybe a Nobel was a useful counterbalance to the lunacy going on here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/impeach_obama.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/MgbjCYvwQDs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255102428189"><id gr:original-id="http://conservationbytes.com/2009/10/09/managing-for-extinction/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dbfe0a9d7156b5b0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Managing for extinction</title><published>2009-10-09T10:22:18Z</published><updated>2009-10-09T10:22:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/iNmmBtTlE4A/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://conservationbytes.com/2009/10/09/managing-for-extinction/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Ah, it doesn’t go away, does it?

Sci-cat, Sci's constant blogging companion (someone has to keep those papers and books warm and furry!), managed to hop up on something Sci thought she could not reach, and stand curiously over a burning candle, wondering where that smell of burning fur was coming from.  All would be lost had not I noticed the smell, spied the cat, and immediately dumped her in the sink where I happened to be doing dishes.  Sci-cat STILL does not realize what danger she was in, and is now angry at Sci for yelling and soaking her with water.  Small minds...

Sci is not burning candles anymore, despite the fact that they were pumpkin scented and awesome.  Sci-home now smells like burned fur.  And Sci then needed some drinks, and Sci-cat needed some treats, to calm them both down following the potential loss of Sci's furry blogging companion and paperweight.

On the other hand, I think I just found a GREAT excuse not to go on a date: "I'm sorry, I just CAN'T tonight, my cat is on fire..."

Anyway.

Today's weird science is HISTORICAL weird science, and is an AWESOME paper sent to me by the charming and handsome gg of SkullsintheStars.  At first he wondered if we were close enough for him to send me a paper about bee sex.  We ARE that close, gg, of course we are!  :)

And yes, it's about bee sex.  OLD FASHIONED bee sex.  It's a paper from 1777, and so old that half the 's's are 'f's.  This makes the paper even more amusing, because now, rather than reading "Discoveries on the Sex of Bees", I got to read "Difcoverief of the Sex of Bees".  Whenever Sci reads one of these old papers, I want to pronounce the extra "f"s like "th"s and so I read the whole thing in my mind with a lisp. 

 Debraw, J. "Difcoveries on the Sex of Bees, explaining the manner in which their species is propagated; with an account of the utility that may be derived from thofe Difcoveries by the actual application of them to practice".  Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 1777.

Tempting as it if, Sci will not write the rest of the post like thif.  Though it would give her many laughf.

And there's one other thing about this paper.  It's completely and utterly wrong.  But other than that, it's really awesome, and a testimony to this guy's sheer perseverance.

It was first described by the German mathematician David Hilbert in 1891. In a recent article Aiden et al. describe a new method called as Hi-C for reconstructing the three-dimensional architecture of the human genome which not only reveals folding principles of the human genome but also resembles a polymer analog of Hilbert&amp;#39;s curve at the megabase scale. Their finding suggest that Chromosomes are organized in a fractal knot-free conformation or  fractal globule  that is densely packed while easily folded and unfolded contrary to what was previously hypothesized as an equilibrium globule.  This study has shown that each Chromosome is organized into two separate compartments, keeping active genes accessible while sequestering unused DNA in a denser storage compartment. Each chromosome alternates between regions of active, gene-rich DNA and inactive, gene-poor stretches.Abstract We describe Hi-C, a method that probes the three-dimensional architecture of whole genomes by coupling proximity-based ligation with massively parallel sequencing. We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C at a resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.

Maybe because the job sucks?

There’s a refreshingly honest quote in this blog post, to which I’ve added some emphasis:

    “People were questioning why there weren’t more women in science, and I had to point out that we are not going to be banging down the doors to enter a profession that just sounds so awful,” said Wu, who just completed her doctorate at the Pratt School of Engineering at Duke.


The article goes on to talk about the importance of peers, time management, and stereotype threat, all the while ignoring the elephant in the room:

Science careers don’t have a lot going for them.

We have this weird Jekyll and Hyde relationship with young scientists. We tell them over and over that we want more people to enter technical careers. But then we sip the potion, and unleash upon them academic hazing rituals that go on for over a decade....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

A improved data access  and sharing not only helps to maximize the research potential but it also reinforces open scientific research which encourages diversity of analysis and opinion. In a latest article published in October 9 issue of journal Science, Dawn Field, John Wilbanks and others highlights several issues  related to convergence and confluence of data sharing efforts-1. Data  managing versus data sharing Funding agencies are more focused on data managing efforts such creating institutional infrastructure and repositories rather than data sharing. Authors suggest that although such centralization efforts provides economy of scale, institutional memory, and reusable capability, in long term it also finds a substantial direct cost that may compete with research funding.2. Heterogeneity and seamless interoperabilityDespite the fact that most funding agencies are committed to data sharing efforts they can hardly avoid the  heterogeneity and overlap of these kind of efforts due to different types of communities served by each funder and the data types they generate. Seamless interoperability should be prime focus in this kind of matters.Image credits Biosharing3. Challenges due to proliferation of standardization effortsThere is an exponential increase in number of community-driven efforts  to create minimal information guidelines, ontologies  and file-format projects. On one side it seems a positive sign of community engagement, but on the other side this proliferation brings  new challenges because most of these projects are focused on a particular biological domain and due to their domain specific virtue most of these projects are fragmented and not suitable for the interoperability. Also on several occasions one can observe unnecessary overlaps and duplication of these efforts.4. Intellectual and ethical issuesNot all but few researchers&amp;#39; are concerned about intellectual ownership and the commercial aspects of their research work. Ethical issues  such as whether or not patient specific data should be open especially to avoid the potential misuses (For instance a recent  UK government scheme to establish nationality through DNA testing using recent development of large SNP databases has sparked a intense debate)5.  Lack of fundingLast but not least lack of funding may be detrimental for these substantial and long term undertakings.RecommendationsFurther authors recommend that there should be a single detailed multi-level data sharing guideline which can serve as a template for policy documents at the various levels such as funder, community, and project level. For enforcement of policy they suggest that funding agency should bring a clear  mandate for the inclusion of data-sharing plans in grant applications including the compulsory deposition of data generated due to funding of research in appropriate databases within a specified time line adhering with best  standards.They also emphasize the requirement of a centralize  hub which can build essential linkages between various topdown(guided by public and private funding agencies) and buttom-up (grassroots developments such as Science Commons, MIBBI, OBO, BioPortal, FUGE etc) data sharing initiatives to serve a &amp;quot;one-stop shop&amp;quot; for those who are in pursuit of data sharing policies and information.

The main problem is that no one has figured out how to grow T. pallidum in any type of culture medium.  T. pallidum can be propagated only by growing the spirochete in the testes of rabbits.  Consequently, investigators have not even begun to develop the genetic tools (e.g., gene knock outs, shuttle plasmids) necessary to unravel the regulatory mechanisms that control T. pallidum gene expression.Despite the limitations imposed by T. pallidum upon those who wish to study gene regulation, a group of syphilis researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle have started to dissect the regulation of several members of the 12-gene tpr (Treponema pallidum repeat) family.  No one has figured out what the Tpr proteins do, but syphilis researchers are interested in them in part because they show how the immune response battles T. pallidum infections.  For example, antibodies generated against TprK during  infection bind to TprK exposed on the surface of T. pallidum and mark them for destruction by macrophages.  More recent studies suggest that TprK undergoes antigenic variation (a topic of a future post), which may allow T. pallidum to persist in the host.The Seattle group&amp;#39;s studies on gene regulation have focused on the Subfamily II tpr genes tprE, tprG, and tprJ, as reported in the journal Molecular Microbiology.  The sequences upstream of their transcription start sites contain a sequence that closely matches the consensus binding sequence for the E. coli global transcriptional regulator CRP (cAMP regulatory protein), also known as CAP (catabolite activator protein).  The T. pallidum genome encodes a CRP homolog designated TP0262.  In E. coli and a few other Gram negatives, CRP is an integral component of the complex network of transporter, regulatory, and enzymatic proteins that allow bacteria to selectively metabolize the preferred sugar, usually glucose, from those available in the environment.  When glucose is absent, the enzyme adenylate cyclase is activated and synthesizes the second messenger cAMP (cyclic AMP), which turns on CRP by allosteric activation.  (Here&amp;#39;s a nice description of the allosteric activation of CRP.)  The cAMP-CRP complex then binds upstream of various promoters and activates transcription by recruiting RNA polymerase to the promoter.  Additional layers of regulation ensure that the genes are transcribed only when the sugar that is to be broken down by the gene products is present.Because it&amp;#39;s not possible to examine gene regulation in T. pallidum, the Seattle group transferred the tpr genes to E. coli, a genetically pliable bacterium.   They fused each tpr gene, including the upstream sequences containing the proposed CRP binding site and the promoter,  to a gene whose product is easily measurable, green fluorescent protein (gfp).  They then introduced the plasmid carrying the gene fusion into an E. coli strain missing its crp gene so that they could measure tpr-driven GFP levels in the presence and absence of a second plasmid expressing TP0262.  They found that TP0262 increased tprE&amp;#39;-gfp and tprJ&amp;#39;-gfp fusion expression while decreasing trpG&amp;#39;-gfp expression.  The ability of TP0262 to control tpr&amp;#39;-gfp expression was lost when the CRP binding site was removed from the fusion constructions.  They also showed that control of the tprJ&amp;#39;-gfp fusion by TP0262 was lost when the adenylate cyclase gene in E. coli was removed, indicating that cAMP was needed to activate TP0262 (data for tprE and tprG were not presented). Their in vitro experiments demonstrated binding of purified recombinant TP0262 to the proposed CRP binding site upstream of the three tpr genes by DNase I protection and gel shift assays.What was missing from the study, as acknowledged by the authors, were experiments to demonstrate that TP0262 does the same thing in T. pallidum.  For future studies, they plan to show that TP0262 is bound upstream of the Subfamily II tpr genes in T. pallidum by  chromatin immunoprecipitation, which entails determining the sequence of the segment of DNA that is bound when TP0262 is immunoprecipitated from a T. pallidum extract. Such experiments would not require genetic manipulation or the ability to cultivate T. pallidum.  It would only require harvesting a large number of T. pallidum spirochetes from infected rabbits.What signal does TP0262 respond to?  Does it respond to the glucose found in the host?  The insightful Commentary by Radolf and Desrosiers sheds some light on the question.  They note that T. pallidum is missing the special transporter genes that in E. coli encode the components necessary to link sugar availability to cAMP and CRP.  They surmise that TP0262 has thus been freed to regulate genes not related to sugar metabolism, such as the tpr genes.  Since CRP is a global transcriptional regulator in other bacteria, it is likely to regulate  expression of not only the Subfamily II tpr genes but also additional genes in T. pallidum.Near the end of their commentary, Radolf and Desrosiers made one comment that stood out:One of the most important outcomes of the present study is that it will help put to rest the pregenomic view of the syphilis spirochaete as a transcriptionally invariant organism.Maybe I&amp;#39;m too young to appreciate their point, but I can&amp;#39;t believe that there ever was a time when syphilis researchers believed that T. pallidum genes were not regulated!Featured articlesGiacani, L., Godornes, C., Puray-Chavez, M., Guerra-Giraldez, C., Tompa, M., Lukehart, S.A., &amp;amp; Centurion-Lara, A.

Due primarily to Watson-Crick basepairing, our ability to sequence nucleic acids has shot far past our ability to characterize the proteins they may encode.  If I want to measure an RNA&amp;#39;s expression, I can generate an assay almost overnight by designing specific real-time PCR (aka RT-PCR aka TaqMan) probes.  If I want to analyze any specific protein&amp;#39;s expression, it generally involves a lot of teeth gnashing &amp;amp; frustration.  If you&amp;#39;re lucky, there is a good antibody for it -- but most times there is either no antibody or one of unknown (and probably poor) character.  Mass spec based methods continue to improve, but still don&amp;#39;t have an &amp;quot;analyze any protein in any biological sample anytime&amp;quot; character (yet?).One result of this is that there are a lot of ORFs of unknown function in any sequenced genome.  Bioinformatic approaches can make guesses for many of these and those guesses are often around enzymatic activity, but a bioinformatic prediction is not proof and the predictions are often quite vague (such as &amp;quot;hydrolase&amp;quot;).  Structural genomics efforts sometimes pull in additional proteins whose sequence didn&amp;#39;t resemble anything of known function, but whose structure has enzymatic characteristics such as nucleotide binding pockets.  There have been one or two of such structures de-orphaned by virtual screening, but these are a rarity.Attempts have been made at high-throughput screening of enzyme activities.  For example, several efforts have been published in which cloned libraries of proteins from a proteome were screened for enzyme activity.  While these produced initial papers, they&amp;#39;ve never seemed to really catch fire.The new paper is audacious in providing an approach to detecting enzyme activities and subsequently identifying the responsible proteins, all from protein extracts.  The key trick is an array of golden nano anglerfish -- well, that&amp;#39;s how I imagine it.  Like an anglerfish, the gold nanoparticles dangle their chemical baits off long spacers (poly-A, of all things!).  In reverse of an anglerfish, the bait complex glows after it has been taken by its prey, with a clever unquenching mechanism activating the fluorophore and marking that a reaction took place.  But the real kicker is that like an anglerfish, the nanoparticles seize their prey!  Some clever chemistry around a bound Cobalt ion (which I won&amp;#39;t claim to understand)results in linking the enzyme to the nanoparticle, from which it can be cleaved, trypsinized and identified by mass spectrometry.  1676 known metabolites and 807 other compounds of interest were immobilized in this fashion.  As one test, the researchers applied separately extracts of the bacteria Pseudomonas putida and Streptomyces coelicolor to arrays.  Results were in quite strong agreement with the existing bioinformatic annotations of these organisms, in that the P.putida extract&amp;#39;s pattern of metabolized and not metabolized substrates strongly coincided with what the informatics would predict and the same was true for S.coelicolor (with a P...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The activity of this gene appears to be reduced in the brains of people with autism.

&lt;p&gt;Today I helped give a presentation in a Queens hospital to young doctors and the subject of how to deliver bad news about a child’s special needs to parents. The illumination factor in these events usually runs one way – to the docs, who are grateful to have parents reveal these feelings — but today the senior doc there surprised me. There exists denial about special needs not just on the part of some parents, he’s found, but also on the part of some physicians when it comes to delivering a formal diagnosis. I never thought of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Jersey, which last summer mandated insurance companies cover certain therapeutic services and behavioral intervention as it relates to autism and other developmental disabilities, has taken the plunge of an official &lt;a href="http://www.state.nj.us/governor/news/news/2009/approved/20091008.html"&gt;autism registry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gov. Jon Corzine claims the registry “will make it easier for families of children with autism and other special health care needs to be connected to the appropriate diagnostic, treatment and support services in their communities.” It will require psychiatrists, psychologists, neurologists and other medical professionals to register the children they are diagnosing with autism and birth defects such as Down’s Syndrome, cleft palate and heart or muscular defects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Jersey’s autism rate is 1 in 94. When I learned that a few months ago, I thought, “Wow, that’s high. Imagine of the overall autism rate were 1 in 100!” The registry will surely help streamline delivery of services, and let’s hope the police and fire departments are among the first with access to this potentially critical information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that subject, the Autism Society on &lt;a href="http://www.autismsociety.pe.ca/"&gt;Prince Edward Island&lt;/a&gt;, Canada, is working on ways to educate emergency responders about the special challenges of assisting people with autism. The society has created stickers that will let firefighters and police know that a person with autism is present.&lt;/p&gt;

The big fear card that the bad guys are playing is that our children will have to learn that families can include loving gay parents.  That's it.  It is not the fear that their children will catch teh gay jurmms as a result of this, it's just the fact that their children will learn it exists at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See, we on the other side don't get that, because we don't see how that could possibly be objectionable; we assume that more is being implied, and it seems the new No on 1 ad is trying to convince that this is a positive message.  It is, of course, but if they want to get this hateful proposition voted down in November's election, that positive message needs to be deferred for another four weeks.  Instead, the message needs to be: "Don't worry, your kids will still know absolutely nothing."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They also need to focus way more on this "outsiders" attacking Maine thing.  Play up the angle that Maine is being bossed around by states two thousand miles away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I thought their first ad (the one I have in the sidebar until November) was pitch perfect as an opening volley.  It gave people an image of gay marriage that was completely desexualized -- notice the son is always seated between his moms, never the moms next to each other -- and emphasized the negative effect Prop 1 would have on (straight) children, rather than on gay spouses.  This was a great reframing of the issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Yes On 1 assholes started spreading lies about indoctrination in schools and priests being forced to marry gay couples against their will under threat of imprisonment, though, I feel like the good guys needed to go way more on the attack than they have.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-2205734398140150026?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255098538133"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=5097">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4c0af4bd1a6b5740</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Crispian Jago"/><category term="South Park"/><title type="html">Respect mah skeptical authoritay</title><published>2009-10-09T14:00:24Z</published><updated>2009-10-09T14:00:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/10/09/respect-mah-skeptical-authoritay/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://crispian-jago.blogspot.com/2009/09/skeptic-park.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/09/crispianjago_skepticalpark.jpg" alt="crispianjago_skepticalpark" title="crispianjago_skepticalpark" width="223" height="303"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Crispian Jago is a UK skeptic and clearly someone who craves nothing more than attention from other skeptical blogs.

&lt;p&gt;This was all part of the LCROSS mission (Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite). Maybe it should have been called the Lunar Crater Creation Satellite because when the rocket hull hit the moon at 6,000 mph it made a new crater as big as a cricket-pitch (not sure how big that is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t help but think of Douglas Adams’ The HitchHiker’s Guide to the Universe (…I mean ‘Galaxy’) when a whale appears, out of all improbability, far above an alien planet, falls to the surface, and thinks to himself…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And what’s this thing coming toward me very fast? So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide sounding name like ‘Ow’, ‘Ownge’, ‘Round’, ‘Ground’! That’s it! Ground! Ha! I wonder if it’ll be friends with me? Hello Ground!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;….End Transmission….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="lcross1" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/lcross1.jpg" alt="lcross1" width="398" height="388"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nearby observer of this event is not the Starship Heart of Gold but a shepherding satellite with a suite of instruments including five cameras. Its job is to fly through the 350 pounds of debris ejected from the moon to see how much frozen water it can detect. It too then will follow its brother and crash into the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abundant water would obviously be a boon to future moon inhabitants with none of the yuck factor associated with drinking water made from urine. The hydrogen and oxygen could also be used for fuel as well, saving lots of money, obviating the need to launch these supplies from earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned…..at 10am ET today, NASA will give more details. I’ll let you know here if anything interesting turned up so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…Well, I’ve been trying to watch NASA tv at their website but they must be getting hammered with connections because it is unwatchable. Typically, I hear and see few seconds of the feed then it stops for a minute or two before resuming. Not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One new bit of news I gleaned is that the plume of debris was rather disappointing. One NASA commentator half jokingly asked if the gain was set properly on the video. One computer generated artist’s-conception video I saw yesterday showed a magnificent load of debris flying off the surface of the moon. Many of the public viewers at NASA who saw the video weren’t happy about getting up early to “see nothing”. One possibility is that the bottom of the crater that was impacted did not have loose moon dirt (regolith) but chunky boulders which limited the amount of ejecta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that makes sense but part of me thinks  that a 2.2 ton object moving at about 1.6 miles per second would pulverize almost anything and throw a good bit of it up and away. That’s some serious kinetic energy we’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anywho…I’m sure some interesting stuff will be learned over the next few days as the scientists pour over the gigabytes or terabytes of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to NASA and the LCROSS team!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bob Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255097681998"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/friday_cephalopod_death_from_a.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b0a0e9fa3b14f0b3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cephalopods"/><title type="html">Friday Cephalopod: Death from Above!</title><published>2009-10-09T14:37:58Z</published><updated>2009-10-09T14:37:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/gYV-WHfricA/friday_cephalopod_death_from_a.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/friday_cephalopod_death_from_a.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/10/friday_cephalopod_death_from_a/sepia_latimanus.jpeg" width="450" height="594" alt="sepia_latimanus.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sepia latimanus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an interesting report &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/326/5950/224"&gt;in Science magazine today&lt;/a&gt; [subscription needed] about a meeting held in Gibraltar earlier this month about human evolution. Most of the debate seems to have revolved around the classification of around 28 &amp;gt;500,000 year old fossil hominins from Sima in Spain. Some people argue they were &lt;em&gt;Homo heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt;, generally viewed as an ancestor of the Neandertals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; reports that &lt;a href="http://www.amnh.org/science/divisions/anthro/bio.php?scientist=tattersall"&gt;Ian Tattersall&lt;/a&gt;, from the American Museum of Natural History, argued that “two or more hominin lineages must have existed side by side in Europe for several hundred thousand years before &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; arrived from Africa. One line led to the Neandertals and may have included the Sima fossils; another, rightly called &lt;em&gt;H. heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt;, went extinct while the Neandertals lived on until at least 30,000 years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equally fascinating was the discussion about *how* we came out of Africa, and how many times. We seem to have originated in Africa around about 200,000 years ago, and to have left to colonize the world about 50,000 years ago. But in the “Levant” there are clear signs of co-habitation between humans and neanderthals from 75-130,000 years ago. Some people call this “the failed dispersal”. At the Gibraltar meeting, paleontologist &lt;a href="http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/MP1.html"&gt;Mike Petraglia (Oxford)&lt;/a&gt; summarized archeological evidence – stone tools and so on – that suggests the “failed” dispersal was not such a failure as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He argued that human populations may have gone on from the Levant into India and thence to Australia, where we turned up about 40,000 years ago. The archeological evidence suggests we crept along the sea-shore, at about 1km a year… If we didn’t leave the stone tools, who did? Some people at the meeting were skeptical, pointing out that archeology was not biology – without human fossils, you can’t tie the tools to us.

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/07/update-on-the-don-harris-and-david-barbour-election-2/"&gt;canned response&lt;/a&gt;, he finally &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/07/update-on-the-don-harris-and-david-barbour-election-2/#comment-373681"&gt;issued a real response&lt;/a&gt; to reader &lt;strong&gt;Gareth&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the response Harris should really have delivered days ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thank you for taking to time to write to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate your very thoughtful comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will not bring up Atheism in any future endeavor, as I have learned a great deal from this experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best regards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don Harris
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what exactly he has learned… Does he also regret the rest of his &lt;a href="http://newmexicoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/harris-barbour.jpg"&gt;attack ad&lt;/a&gt;?  Maybe he just wants to get all of us off his back.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this is a good step forward in acknowledging his mistake.  He did the right thing by issuing a private apology.  A public one would be even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also shows that with enough persistence from atheists, we can get politicians to listen to us.  Yes, Harris is just a local politician, but this is how we have to coordinate for the bigger battles in the U.S. House and Senate as well: Lots of well-written, heartfelt letters (&lt;strong&gt;Siamang&lt;/strong&gt; has a &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/07/update-on-the-don-harris-and-david-barbour-election-2/#comment-373130"&gt;great example&lt;/a&gt;) sent from all over the place and constant exposure of their offense.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t have enough time to do it here, but we have the power to change elections.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007390" title=""&gt;Was Dinosaurian Physiology Inherited by Birds? Reconciling Slow Growth in Archaeopteryx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archaeopteryx is the oldest and most primitive known bird (Avialae). It is believed that the growth and energetic physiology of basalmost birds such as Archaeopteryx were inherited in their entirety from non-avialan dinosaurs. This hypothesis predicts that the long bones in these birds formed using rapidly growing, well-vascularized woven tissue typical of non-avialan dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methodology/Principal Findings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We report that Archaeopteryx long bones are composed of nearly avascular parallel-fibered bone. This is among the slowest growing osseous tissues and is common in ectothermic reptiles. These findings dispute the hypothesis that non-avialan dinosaur growth and physiology were inherited in totality by the first birds. Examining these findings in a phylogenetic context required intensive sampling of outgroup dinosaurs and basalmost birds. Our results demonstrate the presence of a scale-dependent maniraptoran histological continuum that Archaeopteryx and other basalmost birds follow. Growth analysis for Archaeopteryx suggests that these animals showed exponential growth rates like non-avialan dinosaurs, three times slower than living precocial birds, but still within the lowermost range for all endothermic vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions/Significance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unexpected histology of Archaeopteryx and other basalmost birds is actually consistent with retention of the phylogenetically earlier paravian dinosaur condition when size is considered. The first birds were simply feathered dinosaurs with respect to growth and energetic physiology. The evolution of the novel pattern in modern forms occurred later in the group's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007395" title=""&gt;Molecular Signatures Reveal Circadian Clocks May Orchestrate the Homeorhetic Response to Lactation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Genes associated with lactation evolved more slowly than other genes in the mammalian genome. Higher conservation of milk and mammary genes suggest that species variation in milk composition is due in part to the environment and that we must look deeper into the genome for regulation of lactation. At the onset of lactation, metabolic changes are coordinated among multiple tissues through the endocrine system to accommodate the increased demand for nutrients and energy while allowing the animal to remain in homeostasis. This process is known as homeorhesis. Homeorhetic adaptation to lactation has been extensively described; however how these adaptations are orchestrated among multiple tissues remains elusive. To develop a clearer picture of how gene expression is coordinated across multiple tissues during the pregnancy to lactation transition, total RNA was isolated from mammary, liver and adipose tissues collected from rat dams (n = 5) on day 20 of pregnancy and day 1 of lactation, and gene expression was measured using Affymetrix GeneChips. Two types of gene expression analysis were performed. Genes that were differentially expressed between days within a tissue were identified with linear regression, and univariate regression was used to identify genes commonly up-regulated and down-regulated across all tissues. Gene set enrichment analysis showed genes commonly up regulated among the three tissues enriched gene ontologies primary metabolic processes, macromolecular complex assembly and negative regulation of apoptosis ontologies. Genes enriched in transcription regulator activity showed the common up regulation of 2 core molecular clock genes, ARNTL and CLOCK. Commonly down regulated genes enriched Rhythmic process and included: NR1D1, DBP, BHLHB2, OPN4, and HTR7, which regulate intracellular circadian rhythms. Changes in mammary, liver and adipose transcriptomes at the onset of lactation illustrate the complexity of homeorhetic adaptations and suggest that these changes are coordinated through molecular clocks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007130" title=""&gt;Evolution with Stochastic Fitness and Stochastic Migration&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Migration between local populations plays an important role in evolution - influencing local adaptation, speciation, extinction, and the maintenance of genetic variation. Like other evolutionary mechanisms, migration is a stochastic process, involving both random and deterministic elements. Many models of evolution have incorporated migration, but these have all been based on simplifying assumptions, such as low migration rate, weak selection, or large population size. We thus have no truly general and1 exact mathematical description of evolution that incorporates migration. We derive an exact equation for directional evolution, essentially a stochastic Price equation with migration, that encompasses all processes, both deterministic and stochastic, contributing to directional change in an open population. Using this result, we show that increasing the variance in migration rates reduces the impact of migration relative to selection. This means that models that treat migration as a single parameter tend to be biassed - overestimating the relative impact of immigration. We further show that selection and migration interact in complex ways, one result being that a strategy for which fitness is negatively correlated with migration rates (high fitness when migration is low) will tend to increase in frequency, even if it has lower mean fitness than do other strategies. Finally, we derive an equation for the effective migration rate, which allows some of the complex stochastic processes that we identify to be incorporated into models with a single migration parameter. As has previously been shown with selection, the role of migration in evolution is determined by the entire distributions of immigration and emigration rates, not just by the mean values. The interactions of stochastic migration with stochastic selection produce evolutionary processes that are invisible to deterministic evolutionary theory.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the most notable thing has been the outside temperature of 20 F or so, experienced on a morning walk around campus — the conference itself hasn&amp;#39;t started yet — but the &lt;a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/~aacl2009/AACL2009-Programme-Sept28.pdf"&gt;program&lt;/a&gt; looks interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that no reputable naming consultant would have approved the choice of the word &lt;em&gt;corpus &lt;/em&gt;– Latin for &amp;quot;body&amp;quot; — in &lt;em&gt;corpus linguistics&lt;/em&gt;, which involves the study of "bodies" or "collections" of text.  There's an unfortunate resonance with &lt;em&gt;corpse&lt;/em&gt;, which makes the whole enterprise sound faintly icky. (It isn&amp;#39;t — the method is used on living languages as well as dead ones. Not that the dead ones are icky either…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OED gives citations back to the 18th century for &lt;em&gt;corpus&lt;/em&gt; in the sense "A body or complete collection of writings or the like; the whole body of literature on any subject":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more specialized sense "The body of written or spoken material upon which a linguistic analysis is based" is cited only back to the 1950s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s more to be said about the ideas involved — methodological issues can become quasi-religious for some people, as Geoff Pullum &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000122.html"&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; here a few years ago, and he was describing the mere residue of earlier battles that were much more bitter.  But as Moore's Law and the digitization of society have made it easier and easier to apply corpus-linguistics methods, the methodological arguments about whether, when and how to apply them have become much less violent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255093933938"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/obama_wins_a_nobel.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/89e3b9b86d6d33fe</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">Obama wins a Nobel?</title><published>2009-10-09T13:37:25Z</published><updated>2009-10-09T13:37:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/jWiQ50h0hTo/obama_wins_a_nobel.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/obama_wins_a_nobel.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I know this award is heavily politicized, but this is ridiculous: &lt;a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2009/press.html"&gt;Barack Obama has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The word 'spirituality' is very much in fashion but is used in such a nebulous way to mean so many things that it has become virtually emptied of meaning. It has also become something of a sacred cow, not to be questioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://religions.pewforum.org/reports"&gt;Pew Survey&lt;/a&gt; in 2008 and a &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/192915"&gt;Newsweek survey&lt;/a&gt; in 2009 both found that Americans are increasingly identifying as spiritual rather than religious. Newsweek states that, of the people surveyed: &lt;i&gt;Nearly half (48 percent) described themselves as both 'religious and spiritual' while another 30 per cent said they were 'spiritual but not religious'&lt;/i&gt;. A &lt;a href="http://www.ipsospublicaffairs.co.uk/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=773"&gt;Mori poll&lt;/a&gt; in the UK in 2003 found that 24% of people considered themselves spiritual but did not belong to a religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seem to be four main flavours of spirituality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is used by religious people almost interchangeably with 'religion' and 'belief'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second covers people who have a faith but a more personal relationship with their deity, away from hierarchical, structured religion, formal worship and dogma. Some people's faith, whether they use the word 'spiritual' or not, is so loosely defined that it would barely be recognised as faith at all by the orthodox. &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/aug/25/religion-atheism-hume-verificationism"&gt;One such believer&lt;/a&gt; writes in the Guardian that  &lt;em&gt;'what I believe is that God is the ultimate aesthetic object, ultimate beauty, glory and power, and that the vision of God embodies the quintessence of every aesthetic experience and every sensual pleasure'&lt;/em&gt;. Hers is a very rarified conception and it's not clear why anyone would put themselves in a category and then go to great lengths to explain how different they are from everyone else in that category. Safety in numbers, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third is a secular, mostly New Age flavour that is personalized, pluralistic, mystical. This can take a particular form - for example, &lt;a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/nataspir.htm"&gt;Native American spirituality&lt;/a&gt; - or it can be just be a sense of connection with the universe, that there is 'something out there', a belief in the supernatural in the broadest sense. Words like 'energy', 'quantum' and 'natural' crop up a lot. For example, the all-embracing pick and mix nature of this spirituality is illustrated by the &lt;a href="http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/"&gt;Spiritual Forums&lt;/a&gt;, which welcome discussion on the &lt;i&gt;Spiritual, Paranormal, Metaphysical, Philosophical, Supernatural, Complementary Therapies and Esoteric subjects from Astral Projection to Zen, Angels and Yoga&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this alternative spirituality is New Agey, it is not new. Followers of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Swedenborg"&gt;Swedenborg&lt;/a&gt; and his brand of spirituality have been around since the 18th century and, although less fashionable now, they &lt;a href="http://www.spiritualwisdom.org.uk/"&gt;still exist&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Blavatsky"&gt;Madame Blavatsky&lt;/a&gt; was another precursor of New Age spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is spirituality-lite, a kind of life-style accessory involving scented candles, pictures of sunsets, having once read a book by Deepak Chopra and the buying of alternative medicine by people who probably went to India at some point or would like to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they all have in common is that they focus on something other than the purely physical. They often take a critical view of materialism although the last two flavours involve buying a lot of accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0fQbSv7TgZM/SpAPX_zHWHI/AAAAAAAAAIc/vZxRLluO5zI/s400/altar.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maslow's hierarchy of needs identifies five layers of human requirement. The first is the most basic, satisfying physical survival needs for food, water, sex, sleep and so on. The second is for safety, the third for relationships. The top two needs, once these basics have been achieved, are for esteem/self-esteem and self-actualisation. Spirituality seems to fall into these two categories, particularly the last (although deeply religious people might possibly put it into the relationship category). Anyone struggling to survive is not going to be pondering the meaning of life and their connection with the universe or admiring a dream catcher they picked up in the local garden centre while listening to whale music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is spirituality just an indulgence, a modern fad, or does it have benefits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP) have a leaflet called &lt;a href="http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mentalhealthinfo/treatments/spirituality.aspx"&gt;Spirituality and Mental Health&lt;/a&gt; which looks at the potential benefits. It states that: &lt;i&gt;In healthcare, spirituality is identified with experiencing a deep-seated sense of meaning and purpose in life, together with a sense of belonging. It is about acceptance, integration and wholeness&lt;/i&gt;. It also says that &lt;i&gt;Evidence for the benefits for mental health of belonging to a faith community, holding religious or spiritual beliefs, and engaging in associated practices, is now substantia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;. The Spirituality and Psychiatry Special Interest Group (SIG) has over 2000 members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaflet has a long list of spiritual practices, including &lt;i&gt;belonging to a faith tradition, acts of compassion, reading scripture, yoga, meditation, appreciation of the arts and engaging in creative activities, including artistic pursuits, cookery, gardening etc, group or team sports&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiritual practices, they say, include &lt;i&gt;being self-reflective and honest, developing greater empathy for others, achieving a peaceful state of mind, wisdom, equanimity, patience and joy&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a lot of the things on the lists are desirable both in life and in therapy, many of them are not what most people would consider spiritual. Is sport a spiritual activity? It appears that the RCP are using this catch-all term to cover pretty much anything that improves quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their claim that there is substantial evidence for the benefits of faith and belonging to a faith community is undoubtedly true for some people. But faith can also bring a whole lot of unwanted baggage such as guilt, prejudice, pressure to conform and conflict, especially for people whose lifestyle or identity is not mainstream. Faith communities can be supportive, a vital social safety net but some communities are very focussed on ritual, dogma, formal worship and other distinctly non-spiritual elements. So it seems that this leaflet is being over-general and optimistic, the word 'spiritual' bland to the point of uselessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHS has also recognised the need for using spirituality as part of 'holistic' and 'humane' treatment. Its &lt;a href="http://www.nimhe.csip.org.uk/silo/files/spiritualitybooklet3pdf.pdf"&gt;guidelines for staff&lt;/a&gt; state that &lt;i&gt;Recognising a person's spiritual dimension is one of the most vital aspects of care and recovery in mental health&lt;/i&gt;. While treating the whole person rather than regarding them as a set of symptoms is laudable, the guidelines are over-stating the case for spirituality and potentially putting a burden onto already over-loaded and under-funded medical staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0fQbSv7TgZM/SpAVBK1bUgI/AAAAAAAAAIs/airxNOecR_w/s400/images.jpeg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide defines spirituality as (among other things), &lt;i&gt;a life-force, what makes us unique, a sense of connectedness with other people, nature, &lt;i&gt;animals, sport, our life-pilgrimage and quest, what gives our life meaning&lt;/i&gt;. Again, the vague, hippyish, touchy-feely catch-all. And, again, sport features on the list.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the guide gives an unsurprisingly prominent place to religion as an aspect of spirituality, its aim is to include everyone. However, there is no recognition that some people may not want to use that term to define the part of their lives concerned with relationships, enjoying nature, art and so on, perhaps because it has religious or New Age connotations or perhaps because it is just inappropriate. Human spirituality is, for the NHS, a given. &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.nes.scot.nhs.uk/pfpi/documents/SpiritualCareFinalPolicy.doc"&gt;The Scottish version&lt;/a&gt; of the NHS guide begins with the quotation: &lt;i&gt;we are not human beings seeking spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings seeking what it means to be human&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promotion of spirituality either by people who claim to have it or by organisations that think everyone should want it, is not entirely benign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is sometimes a way for an individual to make themselves feel a bit 'special', a self-aggrandizing term that they cannot define or explain but which must not be challenged or even questioned. There is potential for misunderstanding between the different interpretations of the word and, although the 'right' to spirituality is assumed, different groups could well see their version as superior. A deeply religious person is unlikely to value Native American spirituality even if they pay lip service to tolerance. It is potentially yet another way of creating the Us and Them divide so well exploited by religions. My spirituality is more spiritual than yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, on the basis of the NHS and BPS definitions, if you are not spiritual at all, you are lacking. Anyone rejecting the need for this vapid labelling could be seen as somehow less than fully human, lacking in 'wholeness' - and this is the worrying element (that and the fact that tax-payers' money is being spent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One survey contradicts the findings that spirituality is essential for wholeness and a healthy emotional or mental life. &lt;a href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&amp;amp;page=galen_29_5"&gt;Profiles of the Godless&lt;/a&gt; questioned nearly 6000 individuals and looks in depth at atheists, agnostics and spiritual people, comparing them with believers. The distinctive element of this research is that it breaks down the category that many surveys use to lump all non-religious people together.&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It found that more women than men described themselves as spiritual (which touches on something I blogged about &lt;a href="http://tessera2009.blogspot.com/2009/07/whats-your-star-sign.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Interestingly, it also found that 'spirituals' (as the survey describes them) &lt;i&gt;reported lower satisfaction with their lives than those with other belief labels&lt;/i&gt;. It reports: &lt;i&gt;Those non-believers most confident in their non-belief tended to be the most emotionally healthy, relative to the 'fence sitters' (...) Therefore, having uncertainty regarding one's religious views appears to be associated with relatively greater emotional instability&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One conclusion of the survey was that being sure about what you think and believe, whether that manifests as being actively religious or atheist, is better for your mental health than being agnostic or spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0fQbSv7TgZM/SpCHi_ZL4hI/AAAAAAAAAI0/kwvC7oXzyWU/s320/MEDITATION-MAN.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it would be satisfying to have a term to apply to that part of our lives in which we enjoy things other than meeting survival needs or satisfying material desires, spirituality is not a good candidate. A word that means too many things means nothing and, in trying to be inclusive becomes exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why choose a term that has religious overtones and then stress that religion is not the only form of spirituality? The word also has the taint of dualism, separating body and spirit. This is an old view of the Self with wholly religious roots. There is also the marketing triad of Mind-Body-Spirit used in bookshops and places that sell spirituality accessories, which further splits the Self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a difference between being a materialist (not believing in unseen powers or a separate spirit or life-force) and being materialistic (placing too much value in, or reliance on, material things). I am a materialist but not materialistic and I reject the use of spirituality, in any of its meanings, to apply to my life. Does that mean there is something a bit wrong with me? I have a hole where my spirituality should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They just said "Ten minutes to impact.  Fight, are you go?" (go) "Payload, are you go?" (go) "Command, are you go?" (go) "Somebodyelse I can't remember are you go?" (go).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are seeing images being beamed back from the moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a problem with the transmission rate of the data which will force them to make a last minute adjustment of the resolution of some of the images the space craft will be sending back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical instrument has been checked out and it seems to work:  This is an instrument that will observe the flash of impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mission is dedicated to Wlater Cronkite, by the way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIVE MINUTES to centaur impact, they are showing this ever enlargenting image with a little white arrow onit where the impact is hgoing to happen.  This isinterlaced wiht a FC IR image (I think).  And, ther is an image of the cenatur craft shot from the LCROSS out ahead of it.  And an image of the two dots moving closer and closer to the moon, which looks like an image from earth but it could be from some satellite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting closer, closer, closer ...  They'll be able to put these refreshed GIF's (which is what they look like now) into a pretty nice youtube video. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TWO MINUTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, wait, is that a little vilage of moon people I see there? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixty seconds out ... Flash sequence starts.  They are changing the NRI to OPR9 ... Is that MRI or NRI?????  OH crap, November November?... Whas that NRI?  To OPR0??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever whatever!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMACT IMPACT... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don't see anything yet.  I don't see anything het.  We are getting closer to the crater&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are making very last  second adjustments to sampling rates for the photos.  I still don't see anything and the craft is getting closer and closer to its own impact.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see no plume.  Isn't there supposed to be a pllume? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, I don't think it worked.   We are about to hit themoon and there is no plume.  Noting looks different...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Oh holy crap, the signal just disappeared and everyone is freaking out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True panic as the visulal is lost and they are having trouble communicating.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only IR signal availbe and it is not too good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imact is about to happen, iI  see the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are getting a thermal signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's hit, LOS (impact) the second aircraft hit the moon,.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a bit different than other missions because there is not that ambiguity about whether or not they can keep the intrumetns working a little longer, collect a littele more data, etc...All the instruments are mushed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The mission analysits all look really worried I think something did screw up big time at the end. They are already starting to develop their excuses...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are replaying the mission and discussing it but the scientists have all gone silent to do their jobs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The word 'spirituality' is very much in fashion but is used in such a nebulous way to mean so many things that it has become virtually emptied of meaning. It has also become something of a sacred cow, not to be questioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://religions.pewforum.org/reports"&gt;Pew Survey&lt;/a&gt; in 2008 and a &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/192915"&gt;Newsweek survey&lt;/a&gt; in 2009 both found that Americans are increasingly identifying as spiritual rather than religious. Newsweek states that, of the people surveyed: &lt;i&gt;Nearly half (48 percent) described themselves as both 'religious and spiritual' while another 30 per cent said they were 'spiritual but not religious'&lt;/i&gt;. A &lt;a href="http://www.ipsospublicaffairs.co.uk/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=773"&gt;Mori poll&lt;/a&gt; in the UK in 2003 found that 24% of people considered themselves spiritual but did not belong to a religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seem to be four main flavours of spirituality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is used by religious people almost interchangeably with 'religion' and 'belief'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second covers people who have a faith but a more personal relationship with their deity, away from hierarchical, structured religion, formal worship and dogma. Some people's faith, whether they use the word 'spiritual' or not, is so loosely defined that it would barely be recognised as faith at all by the orthodox. &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/aug/25/religion-atheism-hume-verificationism"&gt;One such believer&lt;/a&gt; writes in the Guardian that  &lt;em&gt;'what I believe is that God is the ultimate aesthetic object, ultimate beauty, glory and power, and that the vision of God embodies the quintessence of every aesthetic experience and every sensual pleasure'&lt;/em&gt;. Hers is a very rarified conception and it's not clear why anyone would put themselves in a category and then go to great lengths to explain how different they are from everyone else in that category. Safety in numbers, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third is a secular, mostly New Age flavour that is personalized, pluralistic, mystical. This can take a particular form - for example, &lt;a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/nataspir.htm"&gt;Native American spirituality&lt;/a&gt; - or it can be just be a sense of connection with the universe, that there is 'something out there', a belief in the supernatural in the broadest sense. Words like 'energy', 'quantum' and 'natural' crop up a lot. For example, the all-embracing pick and mix nature of this spirituality is illustrated by the &lt;a href="http://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/"&gt;Spiritual Forums&lt;/a&gt;, which welcome discussion on the &lt;i&gt;Spiritual, Paranormal, Metaphysical, Philosophical, Supernatural, Complementary Therapies and Esoteric subjects from Astral Projection to Zen, Angels and Yoga&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this alternative spirituality is New Agey, it is not new. Followers of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Swedenborg"&gt;Swedenborg&lt;/a&gt; and his brand of spirituality have been around since the 18th century and, although less fashionable now, they &lt;a href="http://www.spiritualwisdom.org.uk/"&gt;still exist&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Blavatsky"&gt;Madame Blavatsky&lt;/a&gt; was another precursor of New Age spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is spirituality-lite, a kind of life-style accessory involving scented candles, pictures of sunsets, having once read a book by Deepak Chopra and the buying of alternative medicine by people who probably went to India at some point or would like to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they all have in common is that they focus on something other than the purely physical. They often take a critical view of materialism although the last two flavours involve buying a lot of accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;width:400px;height:138px;text-align:center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0fQbSv7TgZM/SpAPX_zHWHI/AAAAAAAAAIc/vZxRLluO5zI/s400/altar.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maslow's hierarchy of needs identifies five layers of human requirement. The first is the most basic, satisfying physical survival needs for food, water, sex, sleep and so on. The second is for safety, the third for relationships. The top two needs, once these basics have been achieved, are for esteem/self-esteem and self-actualisation. Spirituality seems to fall into these two categories, particularly the last (although deeply religious people might possibly put it into the relationship category). Anyone struggling to survive is not going to be pondering the meaning of life and their connection with the universe or admiring a dream catcher they picked up in the local garden centre while listening to whale music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is spirituality just an indulgence, a modern fad, or does it have benefits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP) have a leaflet called &lt;a href="http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mentalhealthinfo/treatments/spirituality.aspx"&gt;Spirituality and Mental Health&lt;/a&gt; which looks at the potential benefits. It states that: &lt;i&gt;In healthcare, spirituality is identified with experiencing a deep-seated sense of meaning and purpose in life, together with a sense of belonging. It is about acceptance, integration and wholeness&lt;/i&gt;. It also says that &lt;i&gt;Evidence for the benefits for mental health of belonging to a faith community, holding religious or spiritual beliefs, and engaging in associated practices, is now substantia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;. The Spirituality and Psychiatry Special Interest Group (SIG) has over 2000 members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaflet has a long list of spiritual practices, including &lt;i&gt;belonging to a faith tradition, acts of compassion, reading scripture, yoga, meditation, appreciation of the arts and engaging in creative activities, including artistic pursuits, cookery, gardening etc, group or team sports&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiritual practices, they say, include &lt;i&gt;being self-reflective and honest, developing greater empathy for others, achieving a peaceful state of mind, wisdom, equanimity, patience and joy&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a lot of the things on the lists are desirable both in life and in therapy, many of them are not what most people would consider spiritual. Is sport a spiritual activity? It appears that the RCP are using this catch-all term to cover pretty much anything that improves quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their claim that there is substantial evidence for the benefits of faith and belonging to a faith community is undoubtedly true for some people. But faith can also bring a whole lot of unwanted baggage such as guilt, prejudice, pressure to conform and conflict, especially for people whose lifestyle or identity is not mainstream. Faith communities can be supportive, a vital social safety net but some communities are very focussed on ritual, dogma, formal worship and other distinctly non-spiritual elements. So it seems that this leaflet is being over-general and optimistic, the word 'spiritual' bland to the point of uselessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHS has also recognised the need for using spirituality as part of 'holistic' and 'humane' treatment. Its &lt;a href="http://www.nimhe.csip.org.uk/silo/files/spiritualitybooklet3pdf.pdf"&gt;guidelines for staff&lt;/a&gt; state that &lt;i&gt;Recognising a person's spiritual dimension is one of the most vital aspects of care and recovery in mental health&lt;/i&gt;. While treating the whole person rather than regarding them as a set of symptoms is laudable, the guidelines are over-stating the case for spirituality and potentially putting a burden onto already over-loaded and under-funded medical staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;float:left;width:135px;height:122px" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0fQbSv7TgZM/SpAVBK1bUgI/AAAAAAAAAIs/airxNOecR_w/s400/images.jpeg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide defines spirituality as (among other things), &lt;i&gt;a life-force, what makes us unique, a sense of connectedness with other people, nature, &lt;i&gt;animals, sport, our life-pilgrimage and quest, what gives our life meaning&lt;/i&gt;. Again, the vague, hippyish, touchy-feely catch-all. And, again, sport features on the list.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the guide gives an unsurprisingly prominent place to religion as an aspect of spirituality, its aim is to include everyone. However, there is no recognition that some people may not want to use that term to define the part of their lives concerned with relationships, enjoying nature, art and so on, perhaps because it has religious or New Age connotations or perhaps because it is just inappropriate. Human spirituality is, for the NHS, a given. &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.nes.scot.nhs.uk/pfpi/documents/SpiritualCareFinalPolicy.doc"&gt;The Scottish version&lt;/a&gt; of the NHS guide begins with the quotation: &lt;i&gt;we are not human beings seeking spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings seeking what it means to be human&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promotion of spirituality either by people who claim to have it or by organisations that think everyone should want it, is not entirely benign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is sometimes a way for an individual to make themselves feel a bit 'special', a self-aggrandizing term that they cannot define or explain but which must not be challenged or even questioned. There is potential for misunderstanding between the different interpretations of the word and, although the 'right' to spirituality is assumed, different groups could well see their version as superior. A deeply religious person is unlikely to value Native American spirituality even if they pay lip service to tolerance. It is potentially yet another way of creating the Us and Them divide so well exploited by religions. My spirituality is more spiritual than yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, on the basis of the NHS and BPS definitions, if you are not spiritual at all, you are lacking. Anyone rejecting the need for this vapid labelling could be seen as somehow less than fully human, lacking in 'wholeness' - and this is the worrying element (that and the fact that tax-payers' money is being spent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One survey contradicts the findings that spirituality is essential for wholeness and a healthy emotional or mental life. &lt;a href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&amp;amp;page=galen_29_5"&gt;Profiles of the Godless&lt;/a&gt; questioned nearly 6000 individuals and looks in depth at atheists, agnostics and spiritual people, comparing them with believers. The distinctive element of this research is that it breaks down the category that many surveys use to lump all non-religious people together.&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It found that more women than men described themselves as spiritual (which touches on something I blogged about &lt;a href="http://tessera2009.blogspot.com/2009/07/whats-your-star-sign.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Interestingly, it also found that 'spirituals' (as the survey describes them) &lt;i&gt;reported lower satisfaction with their lives than those with other belief labels&lt;/i&gt;. It reports: &lt;i&gt;Those non-believers most confident in their non-belief tended to be the most emotionally healthy, relative to the 'fence sitters' (...) Therefore, having uncertainty regarding one's religious views appears to be associated with relatively greater emotional instability&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One conclusion of the survey was that being sure about what you think and believe, whether that manifests as being actively religious or atheist, is better for your mental health than being agnostic or spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;width:240px;height:320px;text-align:center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0fQbSv7TgZM/SpCHi_ZL4hI/AAAAAAAAAI0/kwvC7oXzyWU/s320/MEDITATION-MAN.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it would be satisfying to have a term to apply to that part of our lives in which we enjoy things other than meeting survival needs or satisfying material desires, spirituality is not a good candidate. A word that means too many things means nothing and, in trying to be inclusive becomes exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why choose a term that has religious overtones and then stress that religion is not the only form of spirituality? The word also has the taint of dualism, separating body and spirit. This is an old view of the Self with wholly religious roots. There is also the marketing triad of Mind-Body-Spirit used in bookshops and places that sell spirituality accessories, which further splits the Self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a difference between being a materialist (not believing in unseen powers or a separate spirit or life-force) and being materialistic (placing too much value in, or reliance on, material things). I am a materialist but not materialistic and I reject the use of spirituality, in any of its meanings, to apply to my life. Does that mean there is something a bit wrong with me? I have a hole where my spirituality should be.&lt;/p&gt;

Such is the real effect of libel chill.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And as for "misconceived", and insofar this really needs to be explained, see perhaps &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/06/why-bca-claim-is-misconceived.html"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt; - and, in picture terms, see &lt;a href="http://crispian-jago.blogspot.com/2009/08/british-chiropractic-association-hq.html"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whilst the BCA labour on with their case, Simon Singh, on the other hand, is receiving international acclaim for his steadfast and inspiring defence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, more widely, the support for Simon's predicament and the interest in this case have spawned two particular movements, both of which are becoming increasingly effective over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, there is the important campaign to reform England's libel laws so as to allow free discussion on scientific topics. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is being coordinated by the awesomely competent Tracey Brown and &lt;a href="http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2009/09/10/sile-lane-on-keeping-libel-laws-out-of-science/"&gt; Síle Lane &lt;/a&gt; at&lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/333/"&gt; Sense About Science&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sense About Science deserve the greatest credit for all their work on this and for the achievements so far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One recent highlight of this campaign, amongst many, was the address by &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/sep/20/richard-dawkins-libel-laws"&gt; Richard Dawkins at the Liberal Democrat party conference&lt;/a&gt;.  And more useful activity is on the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Sense About Science, practical libel reform to protect science discourse is now entirely possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second, there is the tireless enterprise of skeptic and science activists to hold chiropractors to account and to ensure chiropractors comply properly with all their legal and regulatory obligations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most prominent of these are &lt;a href="http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.com/"&gt; Simon Perry &lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.zenosblog.com/"&gt; Zeno&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their success in this quest has so far been astonishing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In particular, they - and others - have triggered interventions of the Advertising Standards Authority and local Trading Standards officials who are quite rightly ensuring that hundreds of misleading advertisements and communications are pulled or modified, including - astoundingly - &lt;a href="http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.com/2009/10/general-chiropractic-council-to-change_06.html"&gt; information put out by the UK chiropractic regulator itself, the General Chiropractic Council&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These activists are forcing through nothing less than a thorough reformation of how British chiropractors are presenting themselves to the public.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against this background comes the next hearing of the libel case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This hearing will deal with Simon Singh's attempt to appeal the &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/05/bca-v-singh-official-ruling.html"&gt; ruling on meaning by the High Court&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This will not, however, be a full appeal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To appeal a High Court ruling on meaning requires permission: it is not an entitlement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here Simon Singh has already lost twice. At the High Court hearing, he applied for permission immediately, but this was refused and the judge remarked that it was a straightforward case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was then a paper application to the Court of Appeal - and this &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/07/simon-singh-loses-first-attempt-at.html"&gt; turned down&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/08/length-of-simon-singhs-skeleton-reasons.html"&gt; reasons given by the Lord Justice of Appeal&lt;/a&gt; were:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Despite the length of the applicant’s skeleton, the judge seems to me to have been right in both his decisions. His approach as a matter of principle to the two questions was in accordance with authority, and the absence of any express reference to certain matters of context does not mean that he did not take them into account. Just because it may be difficult to prove a negative such as there not being a “jot of evidence” for a proposition does not mean that it is not an assertion of fact. All in all, I cannot see any realistic prospect of a successful appeal."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reference to "skeleton" is not of course to the subject matter of chiropractic treatment, but to Simon's skeleton argument; and the reference to "context" is to the point that later in the Guardian article the use of the word "bogus" is explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following such a refusal an applicant can make an "oral renewal" of the application, to be heard in open court. This what Simon has opted to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Simon succeed in this application? The fact that this is his third bite of this cherry suggests, in general terms, that he will not. The Court of Appeal does not lightly reverse rulings by the High Court in preliminary hearings in any case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nonetheless there is some chance of success here, though in my view less than 50:50.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More importantly, for Simon to take this case to the European Court of Human Rights for a ruling on whether in his case the UK government has - by allowing libel law to exist in this illiberal state - failed to afford protection to his right of free expression under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, he has to exhaust every domestic remedy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you happen to be in London on Wednesday, do come along to the Royal Courts of Justice to show support and solidarity.

Despite all the arguments against the role of GCR, there was a &lt;em&gt;solicited&lt;/em&gt; talk about ‘cosmoclimatology’ at the &lt;a href="http://meetings.copernicus.org/ems2009/"&gt;European Meteorological Society’s (EMS) annual meeting in Toulouse&lt;/a&gt;. Henrik Svensmark is further &lt;em&gt;invited&lt;/em&gt; by the &lt;a href="http://www.dnva.no/"&gt;Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters&lt;/a&gt; (NASL) to provide an introduction to their seminar on climate. So why is the GCR-hypothesis still perceived as an interesting explanation? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My impression from the solicited talk, is that the confidence in the GCR hypothesis now rests on two points that were made explicit in the presentation, and that we have not adequately addressed here. So, here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point I: When I asked Svensmark why he presented a curve describing low cloud-cover from the ISCCP – used for correlation study with GCR (&lt;a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/cosmic-rays-and-global-warming.htm"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) – that differed from the curves presented at the ISCCP web site &lt;a href="http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/climanal7.html"&gt;(link&lt;/a&gt;), he informed me that he used a &lt;em&gt;corrected&lt;/em&gt; version that has been published. Nevertheless, the ‘correction’ of the curve is controversial, and the ISCCP team is clearly not convinced, despite the likelihood of instrumental degradation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good practice would then be to present all the curves that cannot be ruled out because of errors. When asked why he didn’t present the other cures too, he said that he only wanted to show the one curve. Not a very convincing answer, and not very reassuring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point II involves a ‘remarkable’ correlation, meant to demonstrate a link between high GCR flux and cold conditions. This analysis is based on a comparison between band-pass filtered ice-rafted debris from iceberg drifts (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/294/5549/2130"&gt;Bond, 2001&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_14"&gt;Carbon-14&lt;/a&gt; (a cosmogenic isotope) over the last 12,000 years (e.g. after the most recent ice age). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between temperature and drifting icebergs, however, is complicated and not so straight forward. Icebergs are formed when chunks of ice break off glaciers and icesheets – a process known as ‘calving’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, icesheets and glaciers grow when the accumulation of precipitation at below freezing temperatures (snow) exceeds the summertime melting. Very low temperatures, tend to be associated with low precipitation, however. One the other hand, iceberg calving does not require very low temperatures (as long as the ice is present), but is favoured by reduced friction at the base of ice caps, resulting in a faster flow towards the sea. Melt water can lubricate the ice sheets and hence affect the ice flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the icesheets have calved and produced icebergs, they will drift according to the winds and ocean currents. The most influential ocean currents for iceberg drift in the North Atlantic include the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Greenland_Current"&gt;East Greenland Current&lt;/a&gt; EGC), which follows the east coast of Greenland and flows from northeast to southwest, the West Greenland current (WGC) into the Labrador Sea, and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador_Current"&gt;Labrador current&lt;/a&gt; (LC), a coastal current following along the perimeter of the Labrador sea basin in an anti-clockwise fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://williamcalvin.com/img/NADWretouched.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://williamcalvin.com/img/NADWretouched.jpg" alt="North Atlantic ocean current systems" align="left" width="300/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Many of the cores used to study the ice-rafted debris were from locations away from these currents. It is not clear whether anomalous cold conditions produced more southerly winds and ocean currents. However, many of the core locations are associated with a surface flow from the south in the present climate, so it is possible that the icebergs transported by the EGC, WGC, and LC end up in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Current"&gt;the North Atlantic current&lt;/a&gt;. One explanation is that the icebergs got caught in the warm currents from the south, and melted on their way north, but that does not necessary imply cold conditions in that region, as these warm ocean currents provide a heat transport and the melting of icebergs suggest higher temperatures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cold conditions favour the formation of sea-ice, which have very different characteristics to icebergs. Sea-ice forms when the sea surface freezes, and can affect the ocean circulation through their effect on salinity. However, sea-ice does not create debris of rocks and minerals, as the icebergs do when the bottom of the sliding icesheets scrape the rocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is plausible that very cold conditions can produce thick sea-ice that will lock icebergs in place near their sources in the Labrador sea and along the east coast of Greenland, but seasonal variations in the sea-ice may also imply open water in the summer. Nevertheless, very cold conditions may not necessarily favour the production of icebergs, as freezing temperatures will prevent the formation of melt water acting as lubrication and the accumulation of ice is expected to be less due to lower precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the ‘remarkable’ correlation does not seem to support the hypothesis that high flux of GCR produces a very cold climate. The question is rather whether the ocean and atmospheric circulation were influenced by the level of solar activity and associated changes in the total solar irradiation (TSI) – without involving GCR. After all, GCR is affected by the level of solar activity through its influence of the inter-planetary magnetic field, and anti-correlated with the sunspots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When taken in the context of the global warming, there are other problematic issues such as the lack of trend in GCR (&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/recent-warming-but-no-trend-in-galactic-cosmic-rays/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/recent-warming-but-no-trend-in-galactic-cosmic-rays/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), stronger warming during nighttime than daytime, large unknowns regarding the physical mechanisms  involved in the growth of ultra-small molecule clusters to much larger cloud condensation nuclei (&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/03/cosmoclimatology-tired-old-arguments-in-new-clothes/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/08/still-not-convincing/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and questionable data handling and statistical analysis (&lt;a href="http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/Laut2003a.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). In addition, it is difficult to statistically distinguish between the apparent response to solar forcing in the observations and GCM which do not take GCRs into account (&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008JD011639"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to a recent paper by Gavin and myself), implying that GCRs are not needed to explain past global temperature trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes the GCR-hypothesis so convincing that warrants a solicited talk at the EMS annual meeting and an invited presentation at the NASL? Is the support based on the &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/03/a-galactic-glitch/"&gt;attention in media&lt;/a&gt;, or does it have a scientific basis? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want a response from the community still supporting the GCR hypothesis, explaining why they find it convincing after all these misgivings. The spirit of science is about discussing different ideas and challenge unconvincing points of view. So far, I feel that many of these issues have gone unheeded outside the climate research community. Perhaps an improved dialogue between various research communities can help resolving these issues – the counter-arguments and GCR hypothesis represent a paradox that should be sorted out if the science is to progress. Either the supporters of the GCR hypothesis should convincingly explain why these misgivings are unfounded or irrelevant, or the GCR hypothesis should be buried. However, I feel that there is a lack of dialogue and willingness to listen, so I think that progress is not likely to happen regarding a commonly accepted solution on the GCR hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: According to a recent (October 16) news relsease  from the &lt;a href="http://nsidc.org/noaa/iicwg/IICWG_2009/IICWG_X_NEWS_RELEASE-2009-10-16.pdf"&gt;International Ice Charting Working Group (IICWG)&lt;/a&gt;, over 1,200 icebergs drifted into the trans-Atlantic shipping lanes in 2009, making the iceberg season in the North Atlantic the eleventh most severe since the tragic loss of the RMS Titanic in 1912.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. So far in 2009, three articles have been published in the arXhive on GCR and clouds (&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.4442"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.3959"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0901.0515"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  It is possible that such articles are more accessible to communities other than climate research, and hence enhances the awareness about the controversy surrounding the GCR-hypothesis. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>rasmus</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255072127874"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=4411">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bc9e5ddc31ca4fda</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Freedom of Speech"/><category term="feminism"/><category term="Beauty"/><category term="Boing Boing"/><category term="Cory Doctorow"/><category term="Ralph Lauren"/><title type="html">Boing Boing busts Ralph Lauren</title><published>2009-10-09T07:05:37Z</published><updated>2009-10-09T07:05:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/boing-boing-busts-ralph-lauren/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://a323.yahoofs.com/phugc/WLcXI.fflnzr/photos/eb725424f772fd450870310fb7dd5cfc/mr_a3445a414853c3.jpg?ug_____D0JCHfBVu"&gt;&lt;img src="http://a323.yahoofs.com/phugc/WLcXI.fflnzr/photos/eb725424f772fd450870310fb7dd5cfc/mr_a3445a414853c3.jpg?ug_____D0JCHfBVu" alt="" width="228" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/10/07/glamour-magazine-continues-to-dispel-beauty-myths/"&gt;Just yesterday I blogged&lt;/a&gt; about the great work&lt;em&gt; Glamour&lt;/em&gt; Magazine has been doing to promote realistic body images. &lt;a href="http://shine.yahoo.com/event/fallbeauty/image-of-ultra-thin-ralph-lauren-model-sparks-outrage-521480/"&gt;Now today, comes a related controversy&lt;/a&gt;. After Ralph Lauren created an ad using an emaciated model, a blog called “Photoshop Disasters” reposted it. And then the website Boing Boing reposted it with their own scathing article. This led to Lauren filing a copyright claim against the use of his ad in their article even though it clearly falls within fair use as commentary and criticism. But Boing Boing didn’t give up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, Boing Boing editor Cory Doctorow &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/10/06/the-criticism-that-r.html"&gt;issued a stern warning to Ralph Lauren yesterday on the website&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the company’s attempt to silence their criticism has only inspired them to step up their efforts in the future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Copyright law doesn’t give you the right to threaten your critics for pointing out the problems with your offerings. You should know better. And every time you threaten to sue us over stuff like this, we will:a) Reproduce the original criticism, making damned sure that all our readers get a good, long look at it, and;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Publish your spurious legal threat along with copious mockery, so that it becomes highly ranked in search engines where other people you threaten can find it and take heart; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) Offer nourishing soup and sandwiches to your models.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the more common laments about the flu vaccine is that it doesn’t work:  I got the flu vaccine and still got the flu. Well maybe. Maybe not.  It takes a few weeks to get protection, so the flu could have developed before the antibody response to the vaccine.  The vaccine does not protect to the numerous other viral infections that circulate each winter, so perhaps you had an adenovirus but thought it was the flu. Then there is the evidence.  Some readers of the blog are worried that the literature does not support the use of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My research for  good studies on the efficasy (sic) of seasonal flu vaccines so far has left me wondering if I’ve somehow missed the good research. Tom Jefferson of the Cochrane Institute says that Most studies are of poor methodological quality and the impact of confounders is high. I agree.  Please would you refer me to some of the best studies on the efficasy (sic) of seasonal flu vaccines.  After a critical appraisal of the best studies you know of I’d like to submit the same for publication in the interest of science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why some readers think I am a research librarian, I do not know. It is not an uncommon request. As an aside,   I have a full time job and a family to raise.  Don’t be asking me to do your grunt work. It’s called Pubmed. Use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the topic for this post concerns the efficacy of the flu vaccine. I am limiting myself to the use of the vaccine in adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flu vaccine is not out best vaccine for at least three reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, every year they have to make an educated guess which influenza strains will be circulating 9 months in the future.  The better the guess, the better the protection the vaccine should provide.  Some years they choose better than others. But often the match between the vaccine and the disease is not optimal, so vaccine efficacy can be decreased.  The vaccine works best when there is a good antigentic match between the vaccine and circulating strain of influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, response to the vaccine is not 100%.  The older and more immunoincompetent are the least likely to develop a good antibody response to the vaccine. In a bit of medical irony,  the more likely a patient is to need protection from the vaccine, the less likely they are to get a protective antibody response from the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, vaccination rates are often suboptimal to get benefit in populations, i.e. herd immunity.  The elderly will more likely benefit if they are not exposed to influenza at all rather than relying of vaccine mediated protection. It may be more important if those around them, say their health care provider or family, receives the vaccine and as a result does not pass flu on to more vulnerable people. But we rarely (never, ever, never) get vaccination rates at levels for herd immunity to kick in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s a suboptimal vaccine.  And that’s a problem. One, because it will make it more difficult to prove efficacy in clinical studies and two, there is a sub group of anti vaccine goofs who seem to require that vaccines either be perfect, with 100% efficacy and 100% safe, or they are not worth taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influenza vaccine is not 100% efficacious in preventing disease, but it is as close to 100% safe, and much safer than the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple kinds of studies one could do to prove efficacy, each with their own problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One kind of study would be direct inoculation of flu into volunteers who received either the vaccine or placebo.  This is the simplest study to do (if you can find volunteers to get the flu) and lends biologic plausibility to the vaccine, but doesn’t reflect the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study would be to to give vaccine or placebo to populations and see who develops influenza.  These are not easy studies to do well.  Do you diagnose flu as a flu like illness, i.e. on clinical grounds, or do you do cultures or PCR or both to prove the diagnosis?  Outside of prison or the military, it is hard to capture people through an entire flu season to get the appropriate specimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or do you use other endpoints?  Death? Antibiotic use? Hospitalization?  Perhaps the flu will not be prevented but attenuated, so it is less likely to spread, and overall the secondary complications of influenza will decrease in a population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza and pneumonia are both associated with acute myocardial infarction. “Many observational studies in different settings with a range of methods reported consistent associations between influenza and acute myocardial infarction (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=19778762&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;).” Influenza is a risk for developing acute bacterial pneumonia.  Prevent influenza (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=19368772&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;) and you would prevent both primary and secondary myocardial infractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best proof of concept of this effect, where vaccination of one population leads to a decrease in disease in another population, has been with the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine used in children, the Prevnar.  This vaccine covers the 7 most common strains of invasive pneumococcus in children and uptake of this vaccine is high.  Use of the vaccine has resulted in invasive disease plummeting in children, and as an side benefit, invasive disease with the same strains has also plummeted in the elderly (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=16725240&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such an effect may be occurring when children are vaccinated against influenza. “Vaccination of approximately 20-25% of children, 1.5-18 years of age in the intervention communities resulted in an indirect protection of 8-18% against MAARI (medically attended acute respiratory illness in adults &amp;gt; or =35 years of age.” (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=19368772&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;)(&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=15694506&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, almost all clinical studies have limitations.  For a (mostly) good review of the problematic nature of the studies to date, read &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7574/912"&gt;Influenza vaccination: policy versus evidence&lt;/a&gt;.  I say mostly good as the conclusion from this paper is that the data is suboptimal and doesn’t support widespread use of the vaccine.  I conclude, as shall be seen, that while the data may be suboptimal, it does support the use of the influenza vaccine. And, of course, I am the right one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you get unlucky doing clinical trials: plan a big placebo controlled trial with the influenza vaccine and that year you have both a vaccine mismatch and a mild flu season, and you end up with no good data (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=19149900&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have make due with the tools at your disposal. There are 1207 references on pubmed using ‘influenza’ ‘vaccine’ ‘efficacy’ as search criteria.  That’s a lot of papers, that show varying effects.  Like much of medicine, some studies are better and some are worse and they have variable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct Inoculation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of study is the most compelling for proof of concept, but the least “real world”.  Take a population of (one hopes) volunteers and give them either the vaccine or placebo, then squirt them in the nose with influenza. This has advantages and disadvantages, but at least you know exactly when there was an infection, with what strain, and you can measure antibody levels to see if the patients had what should be protective antibodies.  Best of all, you can control the strain of influenza to get a best antigenic match between the vaccine and the pathogen. In the real world none of this is possible. Unless you are fool enough to walk into the room of a known influenza patient without a mask and inhale deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a variety direct infection studies with flu vaccine over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Protection rate against artificial challenge with influenza A was 96% when vaccine and challenge viruses were homotypic. When the vaccine strain and challenges virus were heterotypic, protection ranged from 70-100%. Protection rate from infection during a homotypic epidemic was, retrospectively, 95%; while 50-87% protection from influenza illness was achieved during a heterotypic epidemic. In all instances, vaccinees experienced mild, mostly afebrile upper respiratory symptoms, unlike controls who had moderate to severe symptoms, often with fever. Infecting virus was shed more often by unvaccinated controls (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=342306&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar results are found for the live attenuated virus vaccine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The efficacy of live attenuated cold-adapted (ca) reassortant influenza A H3N2 and H1N1 virus vaccines against experimental challenge with homologous wild-type virus 7 months after vaccination was compared with that of licensed inactivated virus vaccine in 106 seronegative (hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titer less than or equal to 1:8) college students. The live attenuated virus vaccines induced as much resistance against illness as did the inactivated vaccine. Vaccine efficacy, measured by reduction in febrile or systemic illness in vaccines, compared with that in controls was 100% for ca H3N2 vaccine, 84% for inactivated H3N2 vaccine, 79% for ca H1N1 vaccine, and 67% for inactivated H1N1 vaccine. Less protection was conferred against upper respiratory tract illness; there was 50 and 77% protection in ca and inactivated H3N2 vaccines, respectively, but there was no protection in ca or inactivated H1N1 vaccinees. The duration, but not the magnitude, of H1N1 wild-type virus shedding in both ca and inactivated vaccinees was significantly reduced compared with controls. In contrast, a significant reduction in the duration and magnitude of H3N2 virus shedding was observed in ca vaccinees but not in inactivated vaccines. After wild-type virus challenge, live ca virus vaccinees demonstrated resistance at least as great 7 months postvaccination as did inactivated virus vaccinees (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=3700611&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find these types of studies compelling.  They also make me optimistic for the H1N1 vaccine in that the match between the virus and the vaccine is excellent and we should get high levels of protection from the vaccine in those that can mount an antibody response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not real world examples of course.  In the real world the vaccine may not match perfectly, the vaccine may not be handled and administered correctly and the patient, for innumerable co-morbid conditions, may not be able to respond to the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I am still, barely, young and no medical problems yet, and a health care worker who has daily contact with the old and infirm. The data above is enough for me to take the vaccine, if for no other reason that it may prevent me from passing it on to my patients.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Specific Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most most difficult study to do for the reasons mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What group of people are in the study? What are the endpoints and how are they defined? And, for the study period, how good a match is the vaccine for the circulated strains of flu?  All these and more make the studies for flu efficacy at best difficult to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NEJM this month had a nice study on the relative efficacy of killed vrs attenuated vaccine in a healthy adult population that was allowed to get seasonal flu naturally. The end point was culture or positive PCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A total of 1952 subjects were enrolled and received study vaccines in the fall of 2007. Influenza activity occurred from January through April 2008, with the circulation of influenza types A (H3N2) (about 90%) and B (about 9%). Absolute efficacy against both types of influenza, as measured by isolating the virus in culture, identifying it on real-time polymerase-chain-reaction assay, or both, was 68% (95% confidence interval [CI], 46 to 81) for the inactivated vaccine and 36% (95% CI, 0 to 59) for the live attenuated vaccine. In terms of relative efficacy, there was a 50% (95% CI, 20 to 69) reduction in laboratory-confirmed influenza among subjects who received inactivated vaccine as compared with those given live attenuated vaccine. The absolute efficacy against the influenza A virus was 72% (95% CI, 49 to 84) for the inactivated vaccine and 29% (95% CI, -14 to 55) for the live attenuated vaccine, with a relative efficacy of 60% (95% CI, 33 to 77) for the inactivated vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect?  No. 72% protection from the inactivated vaccine. Not bad.  Other studies have demonstrated the the live attenuated vaccine efficacy rates of 50% or better.  In the elderly, for example, a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of LAIV in community-dwelling ambulatory adults &amp;gt;/=60 years of age in South Africa in 2001. Nose and throat swabs were obtained for influenza virus culture based on the symptoms of influenza-like illness. A total of 3242 subjects were enrolled, with a mean age of 69.5 years. The efficacy of LAIV against influenza viruses antigenically similar to the vaccine was 42.3% (95% CI, 21.6-57.8%). Efficacy against A/H3N2 viruses was 52.5% (95% CI, 32.1-67.2%); vaccine efficacy was not observed against antigenically similar B strains (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=19796721&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the weapon of choice in these debates are the meta analysis.  In institutionalized elderly, the vaccine, when given to staff and patients,  did not prevent influenza but did decrease pneumonia and all cause mortality (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=16631547&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;)(&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=16856082&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;). “Staff vaccination had a significant effect on influenza-like illness (vaccine effectiveness [VE] 86%, 95% CI 40-97%) only when patients were vaccinated too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as a health care worker, you could conclude that a) vaccine doesn’t work it doesn’t prevent influenza. I don’t need it. Or b) the vaccine benefits my patients by preventing secondary complications and decreases their risk for death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about the general population?   The most recent Cochrane meta analysis of the vaccine efficacy in 66,248 people (almost Cardiology levels of patient involvement)  from 2004  (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=17443504&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inactivated parenteral vaccines were 30% effective (95% CI 17% to 41%) against influenza-like illness, and 80% (95% CI 56% to 91%) efficacious against influenza when the vaccine matched the circulating strain and circulation was high, but decreased to 50% (95% CI 27% to 65%) when it did not. Excluding the studies of the 1968 to 1969 pandemic, effectiveness was 15% (95% CI 9% to 22%) and efficacy was 73% (95% CI 53% to 84%). Vaccination had a modest effect on time off work, but there was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on hospital admissions or complication rates. Inactivated vaccines caused local tenderness and soreness and erythema. Spray vaccines had more modest performance. Monovalent whole-virion vaccines matching circulating viruses had high efficacy (VE 93%, 95% CI 69% to 98%) and effectiveness (VE 66%, 95% CI 51% to 77%) against the 1968 to 1969 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccines are effective in reducing cases of influenza, especially when the content predicts accurately circulating types and circulation is high. However, they are less effective in reducing cases of influenza-like illness and have a modest impact on working days lost. There is insufficient evidence to assess their impact on complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, those qualifiers. But the overall meta-analysis suggests the vaccine works for prevention of influenza, and the conclusion does bode well for vaccination against H1N1, which has matches the current strain and is in high circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say as an aside that the earlier Cochrane review suggested that influenza cases were decreased by 6% from the vaccine. One commenter over at my Medscate blog, drdan23 suggested that a 6% decrease in disease was not worth it.  30,000 direct and indirect deaths from influenza in the US, maybe 500,000 worldwide. 6% of 30,000 is 1800. 6% of 500,000 is 30,000. Only 6% decrease in deaths? I was always wondering who would be sitting on those death panels that Palin was talking about. It’s the anti flu vaccine docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2004, clinical trials testing the efficacy of the influenza vaccine have been drifting in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A total of 2058 persons were vaccinated in October and November 2005. Studywide influenza activity was prolonged but of low intensity; type A (H3N2) virus was circulating, which was antigenically similar to the vaccine strain. The absolute efficacy of the inactivated vaccine was 16% (95% confidence interval [CI], -171% to 70%) for the virus identification end point (virus isolation in cell culture or identification through polymerase chain reaction) and 54% (95% CI, 4%-77%) for the primary end point (virus isolation or increase in serum antibody titer). The absolute efficacies of the live attenuated vaccine for these end points were 8% (95% CI, -194% to 67%) and 43% (95% CI, -15% to 71%), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONCLUSIONS: With serologic end points included, efficacy was demonstrated for the inactivated vaccine in a year with low influenza attack rates (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=18522501&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of inactivated and live attenuated influenza vaccines in healthy adults during the 2004-2005 influenza season and estimated both absolute and relative efficacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RESULTS: A total of 1247 persons were vaccinated between October and December 2004. Influenza activity in Michigan began in January 2005 with the circulation of an antigenically drifted type A (H3N2) virus, the A/California/07/2004-like strain, and of type B viruses from two lineages. The absolute efficacy of the inactivated vaccine against both types of virus was 77% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37 to 92) as measured by isolating the virus in cell culture, 75% (95% CI, 42 to 90) as measured by either isolating the virus in cell culture or identifying it through real-time polymerase chain reaction, and 67% (95% CI, 16 to 87) as measured by either isolating the virus or observing a rise in the serum antibody titer. The absolute efficacies of the live attenuated vaccine were 57% (95% CI, -3 to 82), 48% (95% CI, -7 to 74), and 30% (95% CI, -57 to 67), respectively. The difference in efficacy between the two vaccines appeared to be related mainly to reduced protection of the live attenuated vaccine against type B viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONCLUSIONS: In the 2004-2005 season, in which most circulating viruses were dissimilar to those included in the vaccine, the inactivated vaccine was efficacious in preventing laboratory-confirmed symptomatic illnesses from influenza in healthy adults. The live attenuated vaccine also prevented influenza illnesses but was less efficacious.  (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=17167134&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“INTRODUCTION: Influenza vaccine has been shown to be highly effective in temperate regions with well-defined seasonal influenza. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are advised to receive regular influenza vaccination to protect themselves and their patients. However, there are limited data on the efficacy of influenza vaccine in HCWs in the tropics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this observational, investigator blinded cohort study, bi-monthly questionnaires recording influenza-like illness (ILI) episodes and medical leave were administered to 541 HCWs at the Singapore National University Hospital and KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital from 2004 to 2005. ILI was defined according to a standard symptom score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were comparable in both the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups. Overall, the relative risk of self-reported ILI in vaccinated HCWs was 1.13 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.98-1.13; P=0.107]; medical leave taken was lower in the vaccinated group [mean 0.26+/-0.6 days per visit, compared with 0.30+/-0.5 days in the non-vaccinated group (P=0.40)]. Because of the reported Northern Hemisphere 2003/04 vaccine mismatch, we stratified the cohort and determined that the group which received a matched vaccine had a relative risk of ILI of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.37-0.66; P&amp;lt;0.001), achieving a vaccine efficacy of 51%. Mean medical leave decreased significantly in HCWs who received the matched vaccine, compared with those who did not receive vaccination (0.13+/-0.3 vs 0.30+/-0.5; P&amp;lt;0.001) and with HCWs vaccinated with mismatched strains (0.13+/-0.3 vs 0.39+/-0.9; P=0.01).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONCLUSIONS: A well-matched influenza vaccine is effective in preventing ILI and reducing sickness absence in healthcare workers in tropical settings. Efforts need to be made to increase influenza vaccination rates and to improve the currently available vaccines (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=18618057&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“BACKGROUND: We assessed the effects of an influenza season on patients with COPD. Data from 2,215 veterans in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind influenza vaccine efficacy study were analyzed for changes in spirometric and functional status, comparing patients with laboratory-documented influenza (LDI)-caused illness, non-LDI-caused respiratory illness, or no illness, and for association with influenza vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;METHODS: Patients received either IM trivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine (TIV) plus intranasal trivalent, live attenuated, cold-adapted influenza virus vaccine (TC) or TIV plus intranasal placebo (TP). We performed spirometry, measured the chronic lung disease severity index (CLDSI) score to assess functional status and well-being, and tested for influenza virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RESULTS: Worsening in FEV(1), percentage of predicted FEV(1), and CLDSI score (p &amp;lt; 0.001) was associated with acute respiratory illness in 585 illnesses including 94 LDI-caused illnesses. LDI-caused illness was more likely to be associated with worsening in FEV(1) and CLDSI score acutely than non-LDI-caused illness (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Logistic regression showed acute respiratory illness (odds ratio [OR], 1.78; 95% confidence limit [CL], 1.40 to 2.26) to be associated with worsening in CLDSI score, and receipt of TC (OR, 1.39; 95% CL, 1.10 to 1.74) and no illness (OR, 0.70; 95% CL, 0.53 to 0.91 for acute respiratory illness) to be associated with better CLDSI score at the end of the study. Hospitalization was more frequent in patients with acute respiratory illness (p &amp;lt; 0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONCLUSIONS: Acute respiratory illness was associated with increased health-care utilization and obstruction to airflow, and worse functional status and well-being. At the end of the study, receipt of TC was associated with improvement and acute respiratory illness was associated with worsening in functional status and well-being (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=17035445&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait. There’s more.  If you call now, not only will you get the above studies, we will add, at no additional cost:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We identified six studies that assessed the incidence of influenza in vaccinated HIV-infected subjects. Four of these studies compared the incidence in vaccinated versus unvaccinated subjects. These involved a total of 646 HIV-infected subjects. In all the 4 studies, the incidence of influenza was lower in the vaccinated compared to unvaccinated subjects with RD ranging from -0.48 (95% CI: -0.63, -0.34) to -0.15 (95% CI: -0.25, 0.05); between 3 and 7 people would need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza. Vaccine effectiveness ranged from 27% to 78%. A random effects model was used to obtain a summary RD of -0.27 (95%CI: -0.42, -0.11). There was no evidence of publication bias. CONCLUSION: Current evidence, though limited, suggests that influenza vaccines are moderately effective in reducing the incidence of influenza in HIV-infected individuals. With the threat of a global influenza pandemic, there is an urgent need to evaluate the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in trials with a larger number of representative HIV-infected persons (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=16965629&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it may be file drawer effect and negative studies are not being published.  The studies show benefits from the vaccine, the benefit is variable depending on the  circulating strain, the vaccine match and the population vaccinated. But a benefit none the less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Population Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most compelling population data comes from Ontario, Canada, where they have had a ongoing attempt to maximize the  vaccination of the whole population against influenza (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=18959473&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;). The other Provinces did not see fit to try and vaccinate everyone, continuing with targeted influenza vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This represents an interesting natural experiment.  If the effects of the influenza vaccine are less in preventing disease but more in decreasing secondary endpoints like death, hospitalizations, or antibiotic usage, it may show up in population studies. There are numerous issues with this kind of study, but are “appropriate for assessing the public health impact of a population-wide intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the period in the reference, Ontario experienced greater uptake of vaccine than any other Province:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Between the pre-UIIP 1996–1997 estimate to the mean post-UIIP vaccination rate, influenza vaccination rates for the household population aged ≥12 y increased 20 percentage points (18%–38%) for Ontario, compared to 11 percentage points (13%–24%) for other provinces (p &amp;lt; 0.001) (&lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/slideshow.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050211&amp;amp;imageURI=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050211.t002"&gt;Table 2&lt;/a&gt;). For those &amp;lt;65 y, the vaccination rate increases were greater in Ontario than in other provinces, while for those ≥75 y, the increase was smaller in Ontario. For all age groups, Ontario always achieved higher vaccination rates than other provinces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the results of all that vaccination:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After UIIP introduction, influenza-associated mortality for the overall population decreased 74% in Ontario (RR = 0.26, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20–0.34) compared to 57% in other provinces (RR = 0.43, 95% CI, 0.37–0.50) (ratio of RRs = 0.61, p = 0.002) (&lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/slideshow.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050211&amp;amp;imageURI=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050211.t003"&gt;Table 3&lt;/a&gt;). In age-specific analyses, larger mortality decreases in Ontario were found to be statistically significant only in those ≥85 y.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, influenza-associated health care use decreased more in Ontario than other provinces for hospitalizations (RR = 0.25 versus 0.44, ratio of RRs = 0.58, p &amp;lt; 0.001), ED use (RR = 0.31 versus 0.70, ratio of RRs = 0.45, p &amp;lt; 0.001), and doctors’ office visits (RR = 0.21 versus 0.53, ratio of RRs = 0.41, p &amp;lt; 0.001). In age-specific analyses, greater decreases were consistently observed in Ontario than other provinces for age groups &amp;lt;65 y. For seniors, greater decreases were observed in Ontario than other provinces for hospitalizations among those aged 65–84 y and for ED use among those 65–74 y.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subsequent paper (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=19624280&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;) demonstrated that “universal influenza immunization is associated with reduced influenza-associated antibiotic prescriptions.” So it may be the secondary effects of the vaccines that are more important than primarily preventing me from getting flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the old rising tide lifts boats effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study that needs to be done would be vaccinate everyone west of the Mississippi and no one to the east. Prevent travel between the two parts of the county.  See who gets influenza.  Now that would be an epidemiological study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is in contrast to the &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7574/912"&gt;Tom Jefferson paper&lt;/a&gt; that several, evidently anti vaccine folks,  have sent me  where is says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A meta analysis of inactivated vaccines in elderly people showed a gradient from no effect against influenza or influenza-like illness to a large effect (up to 60%) in preventing all-cause mortality. These findings are both counterintuitive and implausible, as other causes of death are far more prevalent in elderly people even in the winter months. It is impossible for a vaccine that does not prevent influenza to prevent its complications, including admission to hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again with the binary approach to the vaccine.  A milder case of flu due to the vaccine will lead to fewer complications and deaths. It is only impossible if you do not recognize that the influenza vaccine, unfortunately, is not like the tetanus vaccine, but its effects are more likely a continuum due to partial effects on the person getting the vaccine and the hard to measure benefits of being less likely to spread the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind that is the true benefit of the influenza vaccines: decreasing the morbidity and mortality of populations.  The benefit for populations is derived through vaccinating individuals. That requires a bit of altruism on the part of those receiving the vaccine, as they may be getting vaccinated more for the benefit of others than for themselves. However, at least in the US, a premium is currently placed on being a self centered narcissist; indirectly helping others, even for MD’s and RN’s, is apparently not on the to do list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do flu vaccines work? It depends on what the meaning of is is. If you are simplistic and like binary answers, yes or no, then you can pick yes or pick no, and find studies to support your contention that the vaccine doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you realize that medicine is subtle and nuanced, and often the answers are filled with qualifiers and uncertainty, that the practice of medicine is messy, I think the answer is that the flu vaccine is of benefit. And that the more people who get the vaccine, the greater the benefit for everyone. You do not know how much it pains me to quote Donald Rumsfeld , but he was partly right when he said “You go to war with the army you have, not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true in medicine as well. My army is the vaccine and the data used to support it. You can conclude that neither the vaccine nor the data is perfect, and decide the vaccine is not useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you can look at the preponderance of data, with all the flaws,  nuance, subtleties and qualifiers, and conclude the flu vaccine is of benefit.  The vaccine decreases the probability of morbidity and mortality.  It is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s strange because it is a positive review which strongly agrees with Dawkins&amp;#39; position on the central importance of the theory of evolution in biology in the first half…but the second half is a jaw-droppingly stupid attack on a small point in the book. Wade has a very absolutist &lt;i&gt;and wrong&lt;/i&gt; view of the definitions of some terms, and he goes on and on, whining about a topic that he doesn't understand himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one point on which I believe Dawkins gets tripped up by his zeal. To refute the creationists, who like to dismiss evolution as "just a theory," he keeps insisting that evolution is an undeniable fact. A moment's reflection reveals the problem: we don't speak of Darwin's fact of evolution. So is evolution a fact or a theory? On this question, Dawkins, to use an English expression, gets his knickers in a twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, man. Wade has really waded into it. This is a subject that has been amply discussed and explained and expounded upon, and I'm surprised that Wade is not only unfamiliar with it, but has thrown away half of his review in a misbegotten error of his own devising. &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2007/03/evolution-is-fact.html"&gt;Take it away, Stephen J. Gould&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American vernacular, &amp;quot;theory&amp;quot; often means &amp;quot;imperfect fact&amp;quot;—part of a hierarchy of confidence running downhill from fact to theory to hypothesis to guess. Thus the power of the creationist argument: evolution is &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; a theory and intense debate now rages about many aspects of the theory. If evolution is worse than a fact, and scientists can&amp;#39;t even make up their minds about the theory, then what confidence can we have in it? Indeed, President Reagan echoed this argument before an evangelical group in Dallas when he said (in what I devoutly hope was campaign rhetoric): &amp;quot;Well, it is a theory. It is a scientific theory only, and it has in recent years been challenged in the world of science--that is, not believed in the scientific community to be as infallible as it once was.&amp;quot;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Well evolution is a theory. It is also a fact. And facts and theories are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty. Facts are the world's data. Theories are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts. Facts don't go away when scientists debate rival theories to explain them. Einstein's theory of gravitation replaced Newton's in this century, but apples didn't suspend themselves in midair, pending the outcome. And humans evolved from ape-like ancestors whether they did so by Darwin's proposed mechanism or by some other yet to be discovered.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Moreover, "fact" doesn't mean "absolute certainty"; there ain't no such animal in an exciting and complex world. The final proofs of logic and mathematics flow deductively from stated premises and achieve certainty only because they are not about the empirical world. Evolutionists make no claim for perpetual truth, though creationists often do (and then attack us falsely for a style of argument that they themselves favor). In science "fact" can only mean "confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional consent." I suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow, but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Evolutionists have been very clear about this distinction of fact and theory from the very beginning, if only because we have always acknowledged how far we are from completely understanding the mechanisms (theory) by which evolution (fact) occurred. Darwin continually emphasized the difference between his two great and separate accomplishments: establishing the fact of evolution, and proposing a theory--natural selection--to explain the mechanism of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If he&amp;#39;d just written that one little paragraph, it would have been mildly embarrassing for him…but he just keeps stuffing his foot down his throat. It&amp;#39;s a good thing he keeps his pants on to hide the spectacle of his shoe poking out of his butt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He [Dawkins] seems to have little appreciation for the cognitive structure of science. Philosophers of science, who are the arbiters of such issues, say science consists largely of facts, laws and theories. The facts are the facts, the laws summarize the regularities in the facts, and the theories explain the laws. Evolution can fall into only of of these categories, and it's a theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa. Scientists everywhere are doing a spit-take at those words. Philosophers, sweet as they may be, are most definitely not the "arbiters" of the cognitive structure of science. They are more like interested spectators, running alongside the locomotive of science, playing catch-up in order to figure out what it is doing, and occasionally shouting words of advice to the engineer, who might sometimes nod in interested agreement but is more likely to shrug and ignore the wacky academics with all the longwinded discourses. Personally, I think the philosophy of science is interesting stuff, and can surprise me with insights, but science is a much more pragmatic operation that doesn't do a lot of self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for his definitions…sorry, but these ideas simply do not fit into the tidy pigeonholes Mr Wade wants to make for them. Evolution is both a fact and a theory. Trying to cram it into one category does violence to both evolution and his cognitive roll-top desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Wade goes on with &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt;! Here's where we really need philosophers; they could have much more fun shredding the blithe assumptions Wade flings about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other systems of thought, like religion, are founded on immutable dogma, whereas science changes to accommodate new knowledge. So what part of science is it that changes during intellectual revolutions? Not the facts, one hopes, or the laws. It&amp;#39;s the highest level elements in the cognitive structure—the theories—that are sacrificed when fundamental change is needed. Ptolemaic theory yielded when astronomers found that Copernicus&amp;#39;s better explained the observations; Newton&amp;#39;s theory of gravitation turned out to be a special case of Einstein&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a theory by nature is liable to change, it cannot be considered absolutely true. A theory, however strongly you believe in it, inherently holds a small question mark. The minute you erase the question mark, you've got yourself a dogma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even like his dig at religion. There&amp;#39;s a funny thing about religious dogma: it evolves. It changes slowly, usually, and it&amp;#39;s not on the basis of reason or evidence, but more often to bend to popular expediency — I&amp;#39;d agree that it isn&amp;#39;t knowledge that changes it, but the utility of accommodating a human institution to popular perception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kind of agree with the general statement that facts won't change (but as I'll say below, the facts do shift as they are argued over), but it is possible to change the conceptual framework, the theories, we use to integrate a collection of facts into a useful model in our brains. It is entirely possible for a new model to emerge that does a better job of explaining the history of life on earth someday. After all, it's already happened, and look, Darwin's theory still remained a fact!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darwin&amp;#39;s theory was expanded and replace roughly 70-75 years ago, with the incorporation of the science of genetics into that framework. Darwin was working with a seriously flawed idea of heredity, and all his ideas about the transmission of traits were wrong. Pangenesis was completely scrapped and replaced with Mendelian and population genetics. I can&amp;#39;t imagine a more radical change than that happening any time in the future — we have a solid grip on the rules of heredity now, and what we expect is refinement and the addition of details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But notice that what happened was a reversal of Wade&amp;#39;s claim. A massive bolus of &amp;#39;facts&amp;#39; were inserted into the theory, but the core of the theory itself, the idea that species changed over time driven by forces of selection, remained. Why? BECAUSE THAT IS ALSO A FACT. We have piled evidence high that shows the earth is old, there have been a succession of forms, that the properties of populations change from generation to generation, that all the diverse forms of life on earth are linked by molecular relationships that fit nicely into a tree of descent. A subsidiary assumption that generations changed by the transmission of acquired characters was discarded, but the big picture was unchanged…and was actually made sharper and stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any future hypothetical theory that is a better model &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; incorporate these facts of evolution. It's one of the reasons creationists aren't doing science, because they are compelled by ideology to reject the evidence. There will be no theory that denies that human beings are apes and the children of apes, no matter how objectionable creationists find that, because that is a fact. We'll argue over the mechanisms, whether it was selection-driven or mostly chance divergence, whether group selection played a role, over which fossil fits most closely to the main path of the population that led to us, etc., etc., etc., but the fact of our ape ancestry and nature is established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more quibble: Wade insists that every theory must retain that little question mark of doubt, and that is true. However, it also holds true for the facts of science; we can have a fair amount of confidence in the data, but &lt;i&gt;no one&lt;/i&gt; considers a published result to be unquestionable. It happens all the time that different labs will wrestle over the data, and the interpretation of the data. It's one of the factors that drives science, that we work hard to confirm and disconfirm everything. What you'll actually find when you look at the daily routine of science is that the &lt;i&gt;theories&lt;/i&gt; are generally stable and are not strongly questioned — it takes such a massive amount of contradicting data to overthrow a theory that it&amp;#39;s hardly likely that your average individual or research group can demolish a major theory like evolution, or cell theory — and most of the haggling and conflict is over the day-to-day details. You know, that stuff that Wade would try to stuff in his pigeon hole labeled &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wade concludes his little diversion into fantasy philosophy with a strange dig at Dawkins that suggests he doesn't like his book much after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He [Dawkins] has become the Savonarola of science, condemning the doubters of evolution as "history-deniers" who are "worse than ignorant" and "deluded to the point of perversity. This is not the language of science, or civility. Creationists insist evolution is only a theory, Dawkins that it is only a fact. Neither claim is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, neither is crorrect…but then, I guarantee you that Dawkins does not consider evolution to be &amp;quot;only a fact.&amp;quot; Only someone who had not read his books with comprehension could come away with this freakish idea that Dawkins is unaware of the &amp;quot;cognitive structure of science.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that Dawkins' words are relatively uncivil, but I'd argue that they're too civil, and that we need more incivility. Wade does not seem to agree that creationists deny the depth of human history (I don't understand how he could find fault with the FACT that believing the world is 6000 years old requires blindness to 13 billion years worth of time), or that by promoting false beliefs about our origins they are not merely passively unaware, but are malevolently ignorant, or that using Gould's definition of a fact, they are in denial "to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional consent." Those are the facts that Mr Wade claims to be able to recognize, but ignores in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also will not accept sad tut-tutting over a lack of civility when Wade so obliviously compares Richard Dawkins to Savonarola. Savonarola? Really? You compare a gentlemanly scholar who writes books to oppose the rising tide of lunacy in the world to a book-burning puritanical fanatic who opposed the Renaissance and sought the death of homosexuals??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypocrite.&lt;/p&gt;

Will distract you from research… with research. Beware. It’s taken from the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/"&gt;PubMed database&lt;/a&gt; of scientific abstracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbirofl.com/"&gt;NCBI ROFL &lt;span&gt;Real articles. Funny subjects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbirofl.com/2009/10/exorcism-resistant-ghost-possession.html"&gt;Exorcism-resistant ghost possession treated with clopenthixol.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“BACKGROUND. An Indian man now in Britain explained his criminal behaviour as episodic ghost possession. Traditional exorcisms failed to help. METHOD. A ‘Western’ diagnosis of dissociative state or paranoid schizophrenia was made. Treatment commenced using trifluoperazine and clopenthixol. RESULTS. The patient underwent remission during neuroleptic treatment, despite previous evidence of genuine possession. CONCLUSIONS. Many cultures give rise to apparently genuine cases of ghost possession. Neuroleptics may relieve symptoms of exorcism-resistant possession.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the curse of headache.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Headache disorders are common in children and adolescents. Even young male Wizards are disabled by them. In this article we review Harry Potter’s headaches as described in the biographical series by JK Rowling. Moreover, we attempt to classify them. Regrettably we are not privy to the Wizard system of classifying headache disorders and are therefore limited to the Muggle method, the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition (ICHD-II). Harry’s headaches are recurrent. Although conforming to a basic stereotype, and constant in location, throughout the 6 years of his adolescence so far described they have shown a tendency to progression. Later descriptions include a range of accompanying symptoms. Despite some quite unusual features, they meet all but one of the ICHD-II criteria for migraine, so allowing the diagnosis of 1.6 Probable migraine.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I was on a panel about negotiating faculty jobs, dealing with the two-body problem while on the academic job market, balancing work and life once you have a faculty job, and so forth.  It was a fun panel, and lots of good questions were asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I had to race home through a bunch of really slow traffic so I could play the sprog zone and let my better half out of the house for a Thursday night class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, not surprisingly, the stress of trying to get home in time while traffic was stop and go done wore me out, leaving me with next to no will to plow through the ten to fifteen papers I had hoped to grade tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My eldest offspring expressed skepticism about my fatigue thusly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Come on!  How much energy does it take to work a steering wheel and yell?"&lt;br&gt;

We make this possible by updating the information daily and keeping up to date on recent astrological news. We take pride in being one of the largest websites in the industry and take what our users and affiliates say into account to make this website much more user friendly. We recently ran a poll asking the users that are most familiar with the site what types of informational resources they use to keep up to date or even to simply find great information. Our users primarily are interested in blogs and websites Such as yours. I have reviewed your information and must say, I absolutely love the content you have made available to the public and would like to make your site a link on ours. I would like to offer you our Featured Resource badge that can be posted on your site, which recognizes you as a top resource in the psychic/astrology field or simply a text link within your site (&lt;a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Psychic Reading&lt;/a&gt;). I would also like to post your site in our resources page with a FULL banner to make your site  available to my thousands of users. Thanks again for the great information and I look forward to the great responses your site will receive from my users!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you can imagine I was thrilled, not to say a little proud that I was being recognized as &lt;strong&gt;a top resource in astrology!&lt;/strong&gt;  I figured that all my work in this area had finally paid off.  Excitedly, I replied:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ryan:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad you like my blog.  Please feel free to link my site on yours.  You can use my blog url, or perhaps the url to just my astrology articles would be better:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/astrology/"&gt;http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/astrology/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Please send me your Featured Resource badge, that you described in your email.

I went to five science-related places/events today (and one yesterday).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first three, this morning, were part of an education school trip with my daughter's class and her science teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we visited the OWASA &lt;a href="http://www.owasa.org/Facilities/WaterTreatment.aspx" title=""&gt;Water Treatment Plant&lt;/a&gt; which provides tap water for about 80,000 people in Chapel Hill and Carrboro, NC, followed by a tour of their &lt;a href="http://www.owasa.org/Facilities/WasteTreatment.aspx" title=""&gt;Wastewater Treatment Plant&lt;/a&gt;. Last time I visited a water treatment plant was about 30 years ago, in Belgrade (which has 2 million people using the water), so it was exciting to see how technology has evolved over the years - with greater quality control, much greater energy efficiency and, most importantly, with much more environmentally friendly impact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is recycled - a byproduct of one part of the process (e.g., methane) becomes a fuel for another part, etc. Water gets recycled within the plant, solid particles are sterilized and given away as fertilizer, the cleaned wastewater is sterilized and 'reclaimed water' which does not meet the tap water standards is given away for irrigation, heating and other uses. Even the end-product of wastewater cleaning gets additional stuff done to it - sterilization by UV light and oxygenation before it is dumped into a creek, in order to help the wildlife living in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting stuff sometimes flows down the sewer pipes. The large inorganic objects get caught first and our tour-guide just the other day discovered a rubber duckie! No alligators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we went to &lt;a href="http://www.ncbg.unc.edu/" title=""&gt;The North Carolina Botanical Garden&lt;/a&gt; for a picnic lunch. It's been a long time since I last visited and it was great to see how much they added over the years. Though late fall, there was plenty to see and a number of plants were in full bloom. Will have to come back soon with the whole family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the other two events, afternoon fare, you'll have to wait for my reports tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/field_trip_water_sewage_and_fl.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/VKgCffTRisA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255061577342"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/tweetlinks_10-08-09.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b73f83a31a8b2461</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Tweetlinks"/><title type="html">Tweetlinks, 10-08-09</title><published>2009-10-09T02:38:40Z</published><updated>2009-10-09T02:38:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/lg5gLBR2Nko/tweetlinks_10-08-09.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/tweetlinks_10-08-09.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It's kind of like &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, when the Enterprise is being battered by multiple Klingon warships. After multiple phaser and photon torpedo hits, its shields are down to 10% and in danger of failing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orac is feeling sort of like that right now, except that it was a single massive photon torpedo of stupid that hit his logic circuits, courtesy of someone named Jeffrey, who &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/cries_the_antivaccinationist_why_are_we_1.php#c1986757"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Orac forgot to mention, in his attempt to character assassinate Dawn, to compensate for body weight compensation for, lets say a 6 lb baby.

&lt;p&gt;A baby gets the same vaccine as a 180 lb man which means to compensate for the amount of sodium chloride injected into the baby, that man would need 30 equivalent vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just one vaccine! You make light of "table salt", however it is no laughing matter Orac. How many vaccines does a child get in one day? Play with the numbers all you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utter failure, Orac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeffry, by the way, listed his website as &lt;a href="http://www.vactruth.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;VacTruth&lt;/a&gt;, which, as you may recall, is the same website that published Dawn Crim's &lt;a href="http://vactruth.com/2009/10/02/fda-approved-h1n1-vaccines-contain-ingredients-known-to-cause-cancer-and-death/"&gt;stupendously ignorant anti-vaccine screed&lt;/a&gt; that I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/cries_the_antivaccinationist_why_are_we_1.php"&gt;had so much fun "analyzing" the other day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/dumbest_comment_ever.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/dumbest_comment_ever.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/sfaBi6BaWl8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255060614213"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/180dee590fa18a07</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The Robinson Factor</title><published>2009-10-09T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-09T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/movies/actors/robinson.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Did actor Edward G.

In addition, spermidine administration potently inhibited oxidative stress in ageing mice [and] led to significant upregulation of various autophagy-related transcripts, triggering autophagy in yeast, flies, worms and human cells. Those of you who like your research a little more preprocessed than the original papers will no doubt prefer this article from the science press: It seems that spermidine exerts its influence at the level of the cell's mechanism for dealing with damaged internal components. Throughout a cell's life, proteins and other molecules become damaged by exposure to environmental factors such as UV light or oxidants. This debris is swept up and deposited into a biochemical recycling bin. However, as cells age this clean-up process, called autophagy, becomes less efficient and ultimately the accumulation of this waste causes the cell to trigger its own suicide. Autophagy is ultimately controlled by genes being switched on and off. It......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

It's all over the science news sites. With titles ranging from the conservative "Pill May Change Attraction" to the bolder "Taking the pill for past 40 years 'has put women off masculine men'"and "The pill 'gives women a taste for boyish men like Zac Efron'," this new publication has swept the media outlets by storm. This idea that birth control might have behavioral side effects isn't new, even I've mentioned this before, as a side note on another study's findings. But the strong tone and conclusions in this review paper seem to have caught the media's attention, causing Grizzly Adams impersonators everywhere to fear that they're soon to be cast out of their lovers' bedrooms in favor of DiCaprio-esque alternatives.Calm down, manly men. It's just like how the media always starts raving about how scientists have found a "missing link" every time there's a new fossil species identified - mention sex or relationships in a paper, and it's bound to get noticed. And just like the constant "missing link" hype, the whirlwhind response to this paper is unfounded and ridiculous.Don't get me wrong - I love a good paper about behavior and hormones. But a non-systematic review paper has a lot of holes in it, and this one is no exception.In the paper, the authors state that "there is emerging evidence that the use of the pill by women can disrupt: (i) the variation in mate preferences across their menstrual cycle; (ii) their attractiveness to men; and (iii) their ability to compete with normally cycling women for access to mates" and that there are "consequences of pill-induced choice of otherwise less-preferred partners for relationship satisfaction, durability and, ultimately, reproductive outcomes."Let me start by explaining the paper's premise. It's somewhat established scientifically that certain traits that women find attractive - like "manliness" - can vary over the menstrual cycle. When a woman is most fertile, she's more strongly attracted to more masculine men. There's some suggestion that this is because while she may not be able to marry the sexiest, most genetically spectacular man alive, she can sleep with him behind her mate's back when she's highly fertile and get a genetically fantastic kid while still keeping the loser hubby around to take care of him. In turn, scientists have shown that women are sexiest to men when they're most fertile - the theory being that if men sleep with a woman when she is most likely to get pregnant, then they're most likely to pass on their genes. All of these shifts in attractiveness are completely unconscious, so we don't know that we're changing how we see each other over a monthly cycle.The Culprit?Hormonal birth controls change the hormones in a woman's cycle. They convince her body that she's pregnant, thus preventing her from going through ovulation-induced changes into that 'high fertility' state. Logically following, this change in hormones might shift how she views men and how men view her, because she's never entering that body phase where all this change in attraction occurs. Then, the paper's authors conclude, it's likely that the women taking the pill are shifting society's opinion of men, steering towards less masculinity. They're changing the rules, making feminine men more attractive and thus more likely to mate, which they say could have drastic consequences. Since manly men are supposed to contain the 'better' genes, a shift in mate choice could have reproductive repercussions. As one of the co-authors, Dr Virpi Lumma, is quoted as saying: "The ultimate outstanding evolutionary question concerns whether the use of oral contraceptives when making mating decisions can have long-term consequences on the ability of couples to reproduce." Even on the small scale, they warn that birth control might be dooming relationships, because women are likely to be off birth control before a relationship, then meet someone, and go on it. Beforehand, the women had 'high fertility' attractions, but after, their tastes change. Even if it's not dooming the masses, it could be a major contributing factor to the rising divorce rate and general relationship woes.It sounds very logical, but there are gaping holes that the journalists and even the study authors completely ignore.Firstly, it's important to point out that this is a non-systemic review. A non-systemic review is one that doesn't describe the methods used to choose the papers which are included in it. The authors say that 75% of the studies performed in the past decade support their conclusions. But how did they choose the 72 studies included in their review? How exhaustive was their search? Without explaining these methods, it's entirely possible that the review is biased, focusing on research which supports the writers' preformed conclusion. Small, non-random samples aren't fit mathematically to be expanded to populationsBut even assuming that the choices were comprehensive when it comes to the literature, there are flaws in those, too. Most of these studies have incredibly low, non-random sample sizes (i.e....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

To catch you up, in a case before the Supreme Court, Justice Scalia argued that a cross can actually be a secular symbol used to honor the dead.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I assume it [the cross] is erected in honor of all of the war dead. The cross is the most common symbol of ... of ... of the resting place of the dead." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um, Tony?  My cemetery doesn't have a single cross.  In fact, none of my relatives is buried at a cemetery with crosses in it. What's up with that?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must be some sort of freak.  If these cross things are so common, how come none of my peeps have them on their graves?  I shouldn't feel bad.  According to Scalia, the cross is for Yids, to:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I don't think you can leap from that to the conclusion that the only war dead the cross honors are the Christian war dead," thunders Scalia. "I think that's an outrageous conclusion!" &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, the symbol of the cross, whose only common use is to symbolize the death and rebirth of Jesus Christ in Christian mythology, is secular, and Jew-boys like me should feel honored that generous Christians might adorn my grave with one.  How can I turn down a gift like that?  &lt;br&gt;

While other religions asked people to do things that were laborious and time consuming, only Protestantism (so the theory went) channelled that religious duty into productive work.It&amp;#39;s important to take some time out here to understand what&amp;#39;s meant by &amp;#39;work ethic&amp;#39;. It certainly isn&amp;#39;t simply productivity. The richest, most productive countries actually have the lowest work ethic.And a lack of &amp;#39;work ethic&amp;#39; doesn&amp;#39;t mean you&amp;#39;re lazy or driven only by financial reward. In fact, educated people have a lower &amp;#39;work ethic&amp;#39; than uneducated people. Clearly educated people aren&amp;#39;t lazy - they work hard to get their qualifications and don&amp;#39;t get paid to do it.So &amp;#39;work ethic&amp;#39; is actually about working for no clear purpose - it&amp;#39;s work for work&amp;#39;s sake.Well, in the 100 years since there&amp;#39;s been a lot of debate and no clear conclusion about whether Weber was right. But, in theory, it seems plausible. According to economists, people only do work if they are going to get some kind of reward. If you can convince them them that their reward will be &amp;#39;magical&amp;#39; (some kind of spiritual reward in this life or the next) then you won&amp;#39;t have to pay them as much.In modern economic terms, a Protestant would gain extra &amp;#39;utility&amp;#39; from doing work, and so they would have additional motivation to work harder.But even if the idea did hold in the past, does it still work in the modern world? And if it does, how does it work in practice? A new paper by Hans Geser has taken a look.He scrutinized data from the Christians in the World Values Survey and found that, as far as work ethic goes, Protestantism probably isn&amp;#39;t very much different from Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity.But he did find some interesting relationships with religion in general. Basically, people with stronger religious faith have a stronger work ethic. But other factors of religion - whether people took Church teaching seriously, whether they went to Church, or whether they prayed - seemed to have little or no effect.There was a surprise, however. Belief in an afterlife actually had a negative effect on work ethic.The effect of religion was small. Overall, only around 5% of the variation between people in work ethic is explained by religion. But Geser&amp;#39;s analysis suggests that it&amp;#39;s not due to religious teachings. And the promise of a reward in heaven actually has a negative effect.Which suggests that the reason religious people have a higher work ethic is that they expect to get a reward for it in this life, rather than the next.One last thing. The effect of religion, which is small even in poor countries, disappears in rich countries. That&amp;#39;s not because the effects at an individual level get less. What happens is that the &amp;#39;national average&amp;#39; intensity of religious faith has a cultural effect - increasing the work ethic of believers and non-believers.As countries get richer, their culture shifts from a religious to a secular one. And with that, the idea of working for the sake of work becomes marginalised. In rich countries, people work because they see a reason to do the work._______________________________________________________________________________________Hans Geser (2009).

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.kiva.org/app.php"&gt;Kiva Microfunds&lt;/a&gt; is an organization that allows people to lend money via the Internet to microfinance institutions in developing countries which in turn lend the money to small businesses…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiva allows you to lend money in groups, and the Atheists, Agnostics, Skeptics, Freethinkers, Secular Humanists and the Non-Religious group has been among the &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/09/10/top-of-the-kiva-charts/"&gt;most&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/11/02/the-atheist-team-and-the-kiva-charts/"&gt;generous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/03/11/atheists-atop-microfinancing-leaders-on-kiva/"&gt;teams&lt;/a&gt; for the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am now able to say the following with great pride: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atheist team has &lt;a href="http://www.kiva.org/app.php?page=community&amp;amp;kv_orderBy=n_users&amp;amp;kv_direction=DESC&amp;amp;kv_page=1"&gt;more members than any other group&lt;/a&gt;.  They have 6,002 members as I write this.  (Kiva Christians are in a distant third.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atheist team has given out more loans than any other group.  They have given away 33002 loans.  (Kiva Christians are in a distant second.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atheist team has &lt;a href="http://www.kiva.org/app.php?page=community&amp;amp;kv_orderBy=amt_loaned&amp;amp;kv_direction=DESC&amp;amp;kv_page=1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;given away over a million dollars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in loans as of yesterday.  (Again, Kiva Christians are in a distant second.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a beautiful sight to behold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Kiva_1Ma-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Kiva_1Ma-1.jpg" alt="Kiva_1Ma-1" title="Kiva_1Ma-1" width="550" height="410"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiva is &lt;a href="http://www.kiva.org/about/inside/2009/10/07/first-kiva-team-to-reach-1-million.html"&gt;thrilled about the milestone&lt;/a&gt;, too, posting a congratulatory message on their blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a press release, an &lt;a href="http://atheist-monkey.blogspot.com/2009/10/kiva-atheists-first-to-reach-1-million.html"&gt;atheist team representative writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
AASFSHNR, just over 1 year old, is the first group to reach $1,000,000. Despite the modest goal of $50k in four months, 10 days after creation AASFSHNR hit $10,000. As the loans were paid back, or new money was lent, the group total climbed faster and faster.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head over to the &lt;a href="http://atheist-monkey.blogspot.com/"&gt;team’s blog&lt;/a&gt; to congratulate them.  Or, better yet, &lt;a href="http://www.kiva.org/app.php?page=community&amp;amp;action=viewTeam&amp;amp;team_id=94"&gt;join the team&lt;/a&gt;, make a microloan, and help change lives because it’s the right, Humanistic thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we pretend that we can learn some great truth by studying works of fiction?  In school I was always made to analyze and overanalyze novels.  When their elusive meaning was found, it was handed to us as if we should treat it with reverence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to use &lt;a href="http://unreasonablefaith.com/2009/10/06/what-does-it-all-mean/"&gt;VorJack’s interesting post&lt;/a&gt; at UnreasonableFaith as a jumping-off point.  Starting with one of my favorite fantasy authors, Robert Jordan, he notes that people often find connections and messages in works of fiction that were not necessarily intended by the author:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does it matter that these meanings aren’t original? What does it signify when you find a meaning or an idea in a work, but the creator did not put it there? Is the meaning not “real”? Imagine a connect-the-dots puzzle, where you find a way to make a Celtic knot-work design when the author intended it to be a giraffe. Is each pattern equally valid, or is the creator’s pattern the only accurate solution?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason this question seems difficult is that we have an ambiguous uses of the words ‘valid’ and ‘accurate’.  Only the picture of a giraffe is an “accurate” solution to the question: What message was the author intending to impart?  Either the giraffe or the knot is an accurate solution to the question: What recognizable shapes can be made from these dots?  Defining ‘valid’ and ‘accurate’ toward those purposes will clear up the apparent problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if we infer the particular message intended by the author, we need to be careful not to give it too much weight.  It’s merely one person’s opinion communicated through the medium of a novel.  Just because an author describes relationships, society, or human nature working a certain way doesn’t mean that he’s correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we have a bias to believe that ideas are more likely if we hear them vividly and frequently described.  Dystopias are a prime example, &lt;a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/12/26/huxley-stem-cell-bush/"&gt;often with serious consequences:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new piece in Commentary magazine, Jay Lefkowitz — who advised Bush on stem cells — reveals how the President formulated his 2001 policy. While Bush heard from a variety of groups on both sides of the issue, the turning point appeared to come when Lefkowitz read from Aldous Huxley’s fictional novel, Brave New World, and scared Bush:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days later, &lt;strong&gt;I brought into the Oval Office my copy of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley’s 1932 anti-utopian novel, and as I read passages aloud imagining a future in which humans would be bred in hatcheries, a chill came over the room.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re tinkering with the boundaries of life here,” Bush said when I finished. “We’re on the edge of a cliff. And if we take a step off the cliff, there’s no going back. Perhaps we should only take one step at a time.”  [Emphasis in original]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aldous Huxley had a vision of how society interacts with technological advances.  He thought such a scenario would lead to hatcheries, deception, and nightmarish conditions.  That possibility scared Bush into a position on stem-cell research.  So?  Huxley has no particular authority on the subject.  Someone else could come along and write a story about a world in which technology creates excellent living conditions!  If someone had read that story to Bush, maybe he would have gladly supported research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, authors are usually not even trying to paint an accurate depiction of reality – they’re choosing unrepresentative samples that are more pleasing to read.  How many war novels/movies are there about the brave soldier defying all odds and defeating the enemy?  The very phrase “defying all odds” implies that there are far more soldiers who do the same thing and get summarily killed.  We don’t see movies about them very often, because their stories aren’t as fun, exciting, and inspiring.  That’s why I particularly appreciated Terry Pratchett’s dedication of his book “&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Guards-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0061020648"&gt;Guards! Guards!&lt;/a&gt;“:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They may be called the Palace Guard, the City Guard, or the Patrol. Whatever the name, their purpose in any work of heroic fantasy is identical: it is, round about Chapter Three (or ten minutes into the film) to rush into the room, attack the hero one at a time, and be slaughtered. No-one ever asks them if they wanted to. This book is dedicated to those fine men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is full of brave soldiers who die, true love that does not conquer all, and unpleasant people who go on to enjoy long, happy lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that we might not be understanding the author’s intention, and even if we do it’s only one point of view, and that that point of view does not necessarily reflect reality – indeed is usually chosen to misrepresent reality – what lessons can we and should we learn from fiction?&lt;/p&gt;

Since its launch just over 6 years ago, it has become incredibly popular, with millions of &amp;quot;residents&amp;quot; now using it regularly to meet others, interact with them, and even to have sex. Users have also established  virtual universities, businesses and a virtual economy.

Now, imagine a futuristic version of Second Life, in which avatars can transfer sensations to the bodies of their users. Such a scenario may seem far-fetched, but a team of European researchers has now taken us one step closer it. They demonstrate a perceptual illusion in which a computer-generated virtual body can be made to feel like one&amp;#39;s real body, so that one can feel sensations from it and respond to it as if it were real.

&lt;p&gt;It does not matter what you believe about god, creationism, science, evolution, whatever.  If you were raised in a society in which there is an evil enemy that you are convinced intends to arrive some day on your country’s shores, take over your government, impose a new social order, marry your sister, and so on, then when this evil foreign government sends the first warning shot in this war and it is an unprecedented and amazing feat of &lt;em&gt;science,&lt;/em&gt; then suddenly you love science.  You pay taxes to fund science.  Your idolize science.  You start demanding that science comes to the rescue.  One way to do this is to fund science, fund higher education, build up the universities.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/sputnik_the_greatest_thing_to.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/sputnik_the_greatest_thing_to.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/JHYlllpSHPE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255040504124"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/gettin_it_on_in_space.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/01b0f253ffb15f2e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Gettin' It On in Space</title><published>2009-10-08T22:04:09Z</published><updated>2009-10-08T22:04:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/ROAncXamP8Y/gettin_it_on_in_space.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/gettin_it_on_in_space.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;So after watching what will surely go down as one of the most epic games in Twins, and even all of baseball, history, it seems a little anticlimactic to sit down and write about the 200-mile high club, but what the hey, it's for science.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the past day, I plopped down and read all of Phil Plait's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Skies-Science-Behind-World/dp/0143116045/"&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/a&gt; (and still had time to make dinner, watch some anime, sleep and do various other tasks).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My main impression is that this book belongs on the toilet. Not in that "flush it" kinda way, but the way this book is laid out lends itself to reading in small chunks. It's broken into 9 chapters + an epilogue. At 307 pages, that averages out to just over 30 pages per chapter. Not terribly long, but to make it even more chunk-worthy (and I don't mean that in the "blowing chunks" kinda way), each chapter is broken into sub sections that are generally only 1-3 pages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That in and of itself doesn't mean that it &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be read in small sitting, but there's another feature of this book that I think lends itself to it: It's somewhat redundant. Many topics that appear in multiple chapters are reexplained. Having an astronomy background, the first time was enough. I didn't need the second or third time. Yawn. I can see how this would make the book more approachable to someone without any background, but at the same time, why not just say "as discussed on page XX"? But perhaps that's just the internet generation in me, where you don't repeat information, you just hyperlink to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, certain topics pop up repeatedly with explanations being repeated almost verbatim, even using the same analogies. For example, let's look at 2 instances where "degeneracy" pops up:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;"...&lt;i&gt;degeneracy&lt;/i&gt;, which is similar to electromagnetic repulsion: if you try to squeeze too many of the same kinds of particles together (regardless of charge), they resist it."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"[Degeneracy] is similar to electrostatic repulsion - the idea that like charges repel - but instead it's a property of certain subatomic particles where they resist being squeezed too tightly together. Degeneracy will occur if you try to pack too many electrons together, but it also affects neutral particles like neutrons."&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Another example is trying to figure out distribution of objects around the observer. An example is given on page 111 of being in a field of insects; If you're in the center, you'll see roughly the same number in all directions, but if you're off to one edge, looking towards that edge, you'll see less and looking towards the far edge, you'll see more. This exact same notion appears on page 326 taking a full paragraph to reintroduce. It even includes a footnote saying "Yes, this is the same analogy used for GRBs in chapter 4. Glad you noticed! the principle is the same, so I recycled it."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So again, I think this works fine if it's been a few days between those pages, but seeing them back to back within a few hours just insults ones intelligence. There's more examples of this, especially in the first few chapters, but past chapter 4, it tends to get a &lt;i&gt;bit&lt;/i&gt; better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But enough about these trivial stylistic issues. What of the content?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the book was finished, I felt oddly dissatisfied. Not because it's not well written. Not because the science isn't good. But because the science &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book stars off with a dire proclimation:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;The universe is trying to kill you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's nothing personal. It's trying to kill me too. It's trying to kill &lt;i&gt;everybody&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Holy &lt;a href="http://guidesarchive.ign.com/guides/12045/images/magikarp.gif"&gt;magikarp&lt;/a&gt;! A quick look at the titles of the chapters confirms it: Asteroids, supernovae, black holes, and Gamma Ray Bursts! Oh my!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But because Phil is doing the good science, he puts it all in perspective; There's (almost) nothing to worry about! The only (possibly) imminent threat is that of an asteroid collision. And even then, he pegs the odds of that happening in the average lifetime at 1:700,000! The rest are so ridiculously improbable or so far in the future and unavoidable that it's not even worth making a bad sci-fi movie over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yawn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the science is good. But that doesn't mean that Phil didn't hit one of my major nitpicks: In chapter 9 - The end of everything, he has the shortest sub-section in the entire book with the heading: "A &lt;i&gt;Very&lt;/i&gt; Brief History of the Universe". I'll quote the section in full:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;In the beginning, there was nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there was everything.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;*Twitch*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The whole "nothing" bit irks me. Especially since in the following sections, Phil goes on to explain how we can't really describe the universe before the Planck era. We can't say there was "nothing". There was likely "something", we just can't quite describe it. I expect this section was intended at humor, but what a misconception to feed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That and the Big Bang was an "explosion".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Twitch*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why Phil!? Why?!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, to be fair, in the course of the book, Phil lets us know about one of his pet peeves: Calling the Sun an "average" star. &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2009/08/creationist-journal-review.html"&gt;I'm sorry&lt;/a&gt; (although I'm pretty sure I qualified my terms well enough there that Phil shouldn't gripe too much).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another note: I picked up the paperback version of the book. I like the cover a lot better. And it was cheaper. Cheaper is good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing I did notice is that the pictures were somewhat low contrast. Not to the point you couldn't get the important details, but the full majesty of them was certainly lost. Of course, full color glossy prints barely do justice to entire galaxies when they're squished down to only a few inches on any side, so I hope anyone reading this that picks up the book will take the time to google the images and really appreciate them.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-2504317326711028039?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255038952692"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/10/burnt_mound_near_the_sea.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e67bcbd90fbced00</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">Burnt Mound Near the Sea</title><published>2009-10-08T21:39:18Z</published><updated>2009-10-08T21:39:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/Koe9KP2luRc/burnt_mound_near_the_sea.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/10/burnt_mound_near_the_sea.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/10/burnt_mound_near_the_sea/DSCN9073lores.JPG" width="500" height="375" alt="DSCN9073lores.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small mounds consisting of burnt stone are a signature feature of Bronze Age settlement sites along the coasts of southern Sweden. They were the subject of my first academic publication in 1994, though I'd hardly even seen one, let alone dug one. This I have finally begun remedying today, when I did another day of volunteer digging with my friends Mattias Pettersson and Roger Wikell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/10/burnt_mound_near_the_sea/DSCN9085lores.JPG" width="500" height="375" alt="DSCN9085lores.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mattias and Roger started out as pioneer investigators of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2007/07/a_forest_fire_on_the_outermost.php"&gt;Mesolithic archipelago&lt;/a&gt; that is now a bunch of hill tops in the southern part of inland Stockholm county. Their emphasis has shifted though: it's still the archipelago and shore-bound sites on the edge of the open sea, but last month when I reported on their work they were way downhill in the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/09/a_touch_of_pitted_ware.php"&gt;Middle Neolithic&lt;/a&gt;. (Shore-displacement means that downhill equals later.) And now they're in the Late Bronze Age!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/10/burnt_mound_near_the_sea/DSCN9071lores.JPG" width="500" height="375" alt="DSCN9071lores.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined them on Ornö island today. The fact that the place is still an island means that it was way, way out 2600 years ago. Kjell Linnér found the Bronze Age sites of Ornö in 1978, and he worked with us today. There are two clusters of visible structures on the island, all just above the 20 m a.s.l. curves, and probably in use when the shoreline was at 15 m, c. 600 BC. Both clusters were at the inner ends of long sheltered inlets at the time. Most are little burial cairns, but there are also two burnt mounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/10/burnt_mound_near_the_sea/DSCN9081lores.JPG" width="500" height="375" alt="DSCN9081lores.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M &amp;amp; R had found three grind stones in the mound, just like the one I picked up at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2008/03/back_to_the_bronze_age_again.php"&gt;Älvesta in Botkyrka&lt;/a&gt; in March '08. I found a fourth one today, and some pottery, burnt bone and charcoal. Strangely, there isn't any certainly knapped stone on the site. These people most likely did not have access to enough bronze to use it for all their cutting tools. But they didn't knap quartz or flint on Ornö. The guys have found a Pitted Ware site (pre-metal) a few hundred meters off, and it's full of knapped quartz. I wonder what Late Bronze Age seal harpoons looked like.&lt;/p&gt;

mocking the astonishing stupidity of the Conservapedia folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I'm sure you've heard by now that Andy Schafly and his pals are
working on a "new translation" of the bible. They say that they need to do this
in order to remove liberal bias, which is "the single biggest distortion in modern
Bible translations". You see, "translation bias in converting the original language
to the modern one" is the largest source of what they call translation errors, and it
"requires conservative principles to reduce and eliminate".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Plenty of people have mocked the foolishness of this. So many, in fact, that
I can't decide which one to link to! But what's been left out of all of the mockings
that I've seen so far is one incredibly important point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; What the "Conservative Bible Project" is doing is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; translating 
the bible. It is &lt;em&gt;rewriting&lt;/em&gt; the bible to make it say what they want it to
say, without regard for what it actually says. These people, who insist
that every word of their holy texts must be taken as absolute literal truth
without interpretation -- are &lt;em&gt;rewriting&lt;/em&gt; their bibles to make it say
what they want it to say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/10/the_conservative_rewrite_of_th.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/10/the_conservative_rewrite_of_th.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/fUBZwfJRDNA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255032645871"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/cognitivedaily/~3/OdoHW42VEzU/can_westerners_understand_emot.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a4c7875af9cc1e6f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Can Westerners understand emotions from a remote culture?</title><published>2009-10-08T15:22:27Z</published><updated>2009-10-08T15:22:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/_u9Dcms8d4c/can_westerners_understand_emot.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/cognitivedaily/~3/OdoHW42VEzU/can_westerners_understand_emot.php"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Classical Indian dancing is a tradition that extends back 2,000 years. Unlike much Western dance, it is intended to express specific emotions and tell detailed stories. The Natyasastra, a text from the first or second century A.D., offers instructions for how to depict nine primary emotions, and these rules continue to be followed in Indian Classical dance today. This movie demonstrates one form of Indian Classical dance: 

As you can see, each gesture has a highly-specific meaning, which, to my eyes, at least, isn't obvious. Yet much research has shown that many emotions share "universal" characteristics. Smiles and frowns seem to be recognized as positive and negative expressions nearly everywhere. So what about the traditional emotions of Indian dance? Can people who've never been exposed to the dances still understand the emotions the dancers intend to express?

In 2000, Ahalya Hejmadi, Richard Davidson, and Paul Rozin showed videos of a dancer (Hejmadi himself) depicting 10 emotions using Indian dance to 48 Americans and 47 Indians. (The emotions depicted were Anger, Disgust, Fear, Heroism, Humor, Love, Peace, Sadness, Lajya -- shame/embarrassment/shyness, and Wonder) Half the viewers were given a list of possible emotions and asked to pick which one was being depicted. The other half were asked to simply write a word or words to describe the emotion being depicted. A total of 30 videos were shown, three for each emotion.

But does it work? And will it be useful?The idea of an anti-drug vaccine is not new; as DrugMonkey explains in his post on this paper, monkeys were being given experimental anti-morphine vaccines as long ago as the 1970s. This one has been under development for years, but this is the first randomized controlled trial to investigate whether it helps addicts to use less of the drug.Martell et al, a Yale-based group, recruited 115 patients. They all used both cocaine and opiates, and were given methadone treatment to try to reduce their opiate use. The reason why the authors chose to focus on these patients is that the methadone keeps people coming back for more and makes them less likely to drop out of the study, or as they put it, &amp;quot;retention in methadone maintenance programs is substantially better than in primary cocaine treatment programs. We also offered subjects $15 per week to enhance retention.&amp;quot;The vaccine consists of a bacterial protein (cholera toxin B-subunit) chemically linked to a cocaine-like molecule, succinylnorcocaine. Like all vaccines, it works by provoking an immune response. The bacterial protein triggers the production of antibodies, proteins which recognize and bind to specific targets.In this case, the antibodies bind cocaine (anti-cocaine IgG) because of the succinylnorcocaine in the vaccine. Once a molecule of cocaine is bound to the antibody, it&amp;#39;s effectively out of commission, as it cannot enter the brain. So, the vaccine should reduce or abolish the effects of the drug. The control group were given a dummy placebo vaccine.The results? Biologically speaking, the vaccine worked, but in some people more than others. Out of the 55 subjects who were given the active vaccine, all but one produced anti-cocaine IgG. However, the amount of antibodies produced varied widely. Also, the response was short-lived. The vaccine was given 5 times over the first 12 weeks, but antibody levels did not peak until week 16, after which they fell rapidly.And the key question - did it reduce cocaine use? Well, sort of. The authors measured drug use in terms of the proportion of urine samples which were cocaine-free. In the active vaccine group, the proportion of drug-free urine samples was higher over weeks 9 to 16, when the antibody levels were high, and this was statistically significant (treatment x time interaction: Z=2.4, P=.01). As expected, the benefit was greater in the people who made lots of antibodies (43 μg/mL) (treatment x time interaction: Z=4.8, P less than .001). But the effect was pretty small:The bottom line was about 10% more urine samples testing negative, and even that was only true in the minority (38%) of people who responded well to the vaccine! Not very impressive, but on the other hand, the number of drug-free urine tests is a very crude measure of cocaine use. It doesn&amp;#39;t tell us how much coke the patients used at a time, or how many times they used it per day.Also, bear in mind that if it works, this vaccine might increase cocaine use in some people, at least at first. By binding and inactivating some of the cocaine in the bloodstream, the vaccine would mean you&amp;#39;d need to take more of the drug in order to feel the effects. It&amp;#39;s curious that the authors relied on just one crude outcome measure and didn&amp;#39;t ask the patients to describe the effects in more detail.So, these are some interesting results, but the vaccine clearly needs a lot of work before it becomes clinically useful, as the authors admit - &amp;quot;Attaining high (43 μg/mL) IgG anticocaine antibody levels was associated with significantly reduced cocaine use, but only 38% of the vaccinated subjects attained these IgG levels and they had only 2 months of adequate cocaine blockade. Thus, we need improved vaccines and boosters.&amp;quot; Quite an admission given that this study was partially funded by Celtic Pharmaceuticals, who make the vaccine.It&amp;#39;s also questionable whether any vaccine will be truly beneficial in treating cocaine addiction. Such a vaccine would be a way of reducing the temptation to use cocaine. In this sense, it would be just like naltrexone for heroin addicts, which blocks the effects of the drug. Or disulifram (Antabuse) for alcoholics, which makes drinking alcohol cause horrible side effects. Essentially, these treatments are ways of artificially boosting your &amp;quot;self-control&amp;quot;, and they work.But we&amp;#39;ve had naltrexone and disulifram for many years. They&amp;#39;re cheap and safe. But we still have heroin addicts and alcoholics. This is not to say that they&amp;#39;re never helpful - some people find them very useful. But they haven&amp;#39;t eradicated addiction because addiction is not something that can be cured with a pill or an injection.Addiction is a pattern of behaviour, and medications might help people to break free of it, but the causes of addiction are social, economic and psychological as well as biological.

The article -- and especially the popular writeups -- talked about a problem with dark matter and how MOND (MOdified Newtonian Dynamics) solves those problems.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I'm livid about it.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/catdynamics/"&gt;Another physicist/scienceblogger&lt;/a&gt; thinks my anger is misplaced, and left me the following in my comments section:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ethan - this is not a creationism debate.
&lt;br&gt;Hong Sheng is a top dynamicist and he knows perfectly well what the issues are. 
The whole point of science at this level is to test models and propose falsifiable alternatives.
&lt;br&gt;MOND may be wrong, but it is not evil.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Cold Dark Matter is a likelier hypothesis, by far, but it has some serious problems in detail, and the underlying microphysics is essentially unknown and plagued with poorly motivated speculation.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;MOND has always approached the issue from a different perspective: that you start with What You See Is What You Get, and then look for minimal modifications to account for the discrepancies. 
&lt;br&gt;It is a phenomenological model, and makes little attempt to be a fundamental theory of anything. 
&lt;br&gt;Observers tend to like it because it gives direct comparison with data and is rapidly testable.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;I think Leslie Sage knew what he was doing when he published this paper.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
First off, here's the deal as far as the science goes.  Whatever you choose as your theory of gravity, there are certain things it needs to explain.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/is_it_evil_to_sell_mond_over_d/jp2007-004_t607.jpg" width="500" title="...and you thought everything on Earth was so simple?" alt="jp2007-004_t607.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.) Earth-based phenomena.&lt;/b&gt;  Falling, rolling, acceleration, etc., basically any motion that happens under the influence of gravity must be explicable by our theory of gravity.  This includes the speed at which clocks run at different elevations and at different speeds.  The only theory we've ever found that can do &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of it?  Einstein's General Relativity.  Well, and other people's versions of General Relativity that don't deviate too drastically from Einstein's.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/is_it_evil_to_sell_mond_over_d/relativity_light_bending.jpg" width="500" title="Confirmed in 1919, never doubted since." alt="relativity_light_bending.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.) The bending of starlight by matter and energy.&lt;/b&gt;  From the apparent positions of stars during a solar eclipse to weak and strong gravitational lensing, the fact is that space gets bent by all types of energy, such as &lt;i&gt;mass&lt;/i&gt;.  By how much?  And where?  That's something a theory of gravity will tell us.  Einstein's General Relativity gets this right, too, and it's the only one that does.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/is_it_evil_to_sell_mond_over_d/showImage.aspx.jpeg" width="500" title="Another victory for GR?" alt="showImage.aspx.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.) The orbits of massive bodies.&lt;/b&gt;  From the planet Mercury to binary stars, calculating the orbits of objects in space is a vital test of any theory of gravity.  Not only does Einstein's General Relativity get this right, but even slight modifications to it (such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brans-Dicke_theory"&gt;Brans-Dicke gravity&lt;/a&gt;) fail miserably.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of other experiments and observations that confirm Einstein's General Relativity as the correct theory of gravity.  If we want for cosmology to work, too, we need to add dark matter to the theory.  This one addition -- dark matter -- successfully allows us to explain a whole host of observations, including the large-scale structure in the Universe, the cosmic microwave background, the elemental abundances of hydrogen, helium, lithium and deuterium, the motion of galaxies within clusters, collisions between galaxy clusters, the observed expansion rate of the Universe, and the internal motions of spiral and elliptical galaxies.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Einstein's General Relativity &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; dark matter together explain what we see.  Dark matter is the key addition that provides the extra gravitational force we need to make the Universe do what it does.  Here's what the total matter looks like -- reconstructed -- inside a galaxy cluster:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/is_it_evil_to_sell_mond_over_d/mass_recon0024_500.jpg" width="500" title="This is really an amazing reconstruction!  Thanks to the LSST for the image." alt="mass_recon0024_500.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you'll notice the big spikes where the galaxies are.  But you'll also notice this big, diffuse central blob that goes all the way to the outskirts.  That's what our observations tell us the dark matter looks like.  You can read more about why dark matter works so well &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/dark_matter_part_i_how_much_ma.php"&gt;in parts I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/dark_matter_part_ii_how_much_n.php"&gt;II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/dark_matter_part_iii_dark_matt.php"&gt;III&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/dark_matter_part_35_when_clust.php"&gt;3.5&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/dear_mond_time_for_a_new_song.php"&gt;IV&lt;/a&gt; of my series.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But out of all of these observations, one presents a small amount of difficulty for dark matter.  When we simulate what the dark matter should look like at the center of individual spiral galaxies, we get an answer that's slightly at odds with what we observe.  Dark matter predicts the outer reaches of the rotation curve very well, but the very inner regions -- especially of low-mass galaxies -- look like they need a slight tweak.  It's a detail of dark matter theory that many people are trying to work out.  An apt analogy is that the whole theory of dark matter is a beautiful boat, and these observations of the centers of spiral galaxies are like a broken oar.  The boat's in great shape, but the oar needs to be repaired.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/is_it_evil_to_sell_mond_over_d/1535137764_d39d4b9952.jpg" width="500" title="Yes, I&amp;#39;d say the oar likely has a problem or two with it..." alt="1535137764_d39d4b9952.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, MOND comes along.  MOND starts with Newton's gravity -- &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; Einstein's General Relativity -- and says that if we tweak Newton's gravity, it can explain these rotation curves.  It says it can do it better than General Relativity and Dark Matter together can do.  And it's right.  It is, for reasons we do not fully understand, a fabulous oar.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/is_it_evil_to_sell_mond_over_d/ACHILLES_OAR.JPG.jpeg" width="500" title="It is a good-looking oar, I&amp;#39;ll give them that." alt="ACHILLES_OAR.JPG.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's a fabulous oar that &lt;b&gt;does not fit our boat&lt;/b&gt;.  It not only is incompatible with the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, galaxy cluster observations, colliding cluster observations, the elemental abundances, and the expansion history of the Universe, it's also incompatible with the three basic tests of the theory of gravity outlined above.  MOND is an oar with no boat to attach itself to.  And the attempted modifications to General Relativity do not solve all (or even most of) the problems that dark matter does.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And nobody disputes these facts.  The MOND people don't, the dark matter people don't, the simulators don't, the observers don't, the theorists don't, &lt;i&gt;nobody&lt;/i&gt; does.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I don't have a problem with pointing out a difficulty that dark matter has; I think that's a &lt;b&gt;good&lt;/b&gt; plan.  But what ruffled my feathers was that the authors &lt;b&gt;held up MOND like it was a reasonable alternative to dark matter.&lt;/b&gt;  In fact, quoting from the New Scientist article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Alternatively, they say our understanding of gravity may need modification to eliminate the need for dark matter entirely. Some existing theories, such as MOND (modified Newtonian dynamics) attempt to do just that, suggesting that gravity does not fade away as quickly as current theories predict.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And this is just contrary to fact.  This idea that you can "eliminate the need for dark matter entirely" is not true.  We've been trying.  We continue to try.  We cannot do it.  The attempts &lt;b&gt;all fail&lt;/b&gt;, and they fail spectacularly.  While dark matter is unsettling in a lot of ways, the simple fact is that we cannot explain the things listed above (and there are a lot of them, I know) without dark matter, no matter what we've done to our theory of gravity.  A functional boat with a broken oar is unequivocally better than a good oar with no boat.  But is it &lt;b&gt;evil&lt;/b&gt; to say otherwise?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/is_it_evil_to_sell_mond_over_d/jon_lovitz-devil-snl-04.jpg" width="500" title="No matter how you frame it, Jon Lovitz still isn&amp;#39;t funny." alt="jon_lovitz-devil-snl-04.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me back to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/catdynamics/"&gt;Steinn&lt;/a&gt;'s comment.  Yes, Steinn, &lt;b&gt;it is evil&lt;/b&gt; to present MOND as though it is a viable alternative to dark matter.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is evil to spread information about science based only on some tiny fraction of the available data, especially when the entire data set overwhelmingly favors dark matter and crushes MOND so as to render it untenable.  It isn't evil in the same way that creationism is evil, but it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; evil in the same way that pushing the steady-state-model over the Big Bang is evil.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a lie based on an unfair, incomplete argument.  It's a discredited theory attacking the most valid model we have at -- arguably -- its only weak point.  Or, to use a favorite term of mine, &lt;b&gt;it is willfully ignorant&lt;/b&gt; to claim that MOND is reasonable in any sort of way as an alternative to dark matter.  It's possibly worse than that, because it's &lt;i&gt;selectively&lt;/i&gt; willful ignorance in this case.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then I look at the effect it has.  It undermines public understanding of dark matter, gravity, and the Universe, by presenting an unfeasible alternative as though it's perfectly valid.  And it isn't perfectly valid.  It isn't even close.  It has nothing to do with how good their results as scientists are; it has everything to do with the invalid, untrue, knowledge-undermining conclusions that the public receives.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yes, I find that incredibly evil.  Do you?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

It's not the kind of thing that can be achieved with conventional rockets, but that doesn't mean it's entirely outside the realm of scientific plausibility. In fact, there's a long tradition of physicists writing speculative technical papers suggesting ways in which a warp drive or hyperdrive might come about.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The problem is that Einstein's theory of relativity says that no object with mass can match or exceed the speed of light, since its mass will increase along with its acceleration. Even in giant particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, tiny subatomic particles can reach 99.9% of the speed of light without ever matching or surpassing it. So physicists decided that the trick is moving spacetime itself. The &lt;a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2009/06/11/warp-drive-engine.html"&gt;latest proposal&lt;/a&gt;, just this past June, involved creating a bubble of spacetime using &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Energy"&gt;dark energy&lt;/a&gt; or some other form of unspecified "exotic matter."&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"The idea is that you take a chunk of spacetime and move it," says Marc Millis, who used to head up NASA's Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Project. "The vehicle inside that bubble thinks that it's not moving at all. It's the spacetime that's moving." You can hear more about this from Millis himself in &lt;a href="http://www.space.com/media/video/player.php?videoRef=SP_090505_mark_millis"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://space.com/businesstechnology/090506-tw-warp-drive.html"&gt;Space.com&lt;/a&gt; (embedding disabled), complete with selected clips from the many science fiction films over the years that have depicted faster-than-light travel through space. It's truly a case of Hollywood inspiring science through fiction, and science inspiring Hollywood in turn with a new host of ideas for space travel in the future. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/zlPO1g2e590%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-1422633321657054045?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

And &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/"&gt;NASA’s&lt;/a&gt; Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite is scheduled to crash its Centaur upper-stage rocket into the lunar surface at 7:31 a.m. EST tomorrow morning. Four minutes later, the LCROSS itself will follow, diving through the debris plume caused by the first crash, collecting and relaying data back to Earth before crashing into the Cabeus crater near the moon’s south pole. The idea is to find the presence of water in the moon’s soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hubble Space Telescope and NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter are in position to watch, and photograph, the collisions. And hundreds of telescopes on Earth also will be focused on the two plumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA is encouraging &lt;a href="http://www.astromart.com/news/news.asp?news_id=997"&gt;amateur astronomers&lt;/a&gt; to join the watch party. If you don’t have a telescope, or you live in areas where daylight will obscure the viewing, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/ntv"&gt;NASA TV&lt;/a&gt; will broadcast the crashes live. Coverage begins at 6:15 a.m. EST Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How many amateur astronomers in the house? Will you be watching? Or is that cutting into your beauty sleep?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see that the blog kerfuffle about Dawkins continues, and that the Unholy Trio continue their furious backpedaling, even trying to make blog hay from their mistake.  Here, far from the madding crowd, it seems laughable and a bit pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He writes in an email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I live in a very conservative, religious part of the my state and am very active in Democratic Party politics. I am considering running as a Democrat against our incumbent U.S. Representative (a Republican) who is an ultra-conservative, reactionary, theocratic politician who is an embarrassment to many of us, but unfortunately fits the bill for this very Bible-Belt area.  He had no opponent in the last election and my main goal (being pragmatic) would be to at least provide our voters with a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking it through and one of the problems I’ve mentally come across is my faith (or lack thereof).  In a region where even the liberal Democrats tend to be devout Southern Baptists, I want to be a semi-viable candidate.  I think my issues could resonate, but if the question of personal faith ever came up, I’d find myself torn between being honest about my atheism or coming up with some white lie (I attend the Unitarian Universalist Church would be a decent one since it at least implies that I’m “church-going” despite the fact that it would be criticized.  I have gone occasionally but am not a member and haven’t been in over a year.  Thus, it would simply be untrue).  So, if I were to undertake this venture, would it be better to avoid the issue or be honest and forthcoming if asked?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there are ways of saying you do things that many church-going people tend to do (donate money, volunteer, work with the community, etc.) without necessarily saying you attend a church.  But will anyone listen if you say you don’t belong to their club?  I doubt it.  Will the Republican opponent use it against you?  Probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a tough sell either way.  I imagine you’d have a hard enough time running for office in a blue state as an atheist.  In a red state?  Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, it’s worth trying.  It’s good to let people know other options are out there.  Just ask &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/herb_silverman/2009/06/the_candidate_without_a_prayer.html"&gt;Herb Silverman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who ran for governor of South Carolina as the “candidate without a prayer” — mainly to make the same point this reader is trying to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tamlondon.org"&gt;TAM London&lt;/a&gt; has come and gone, but it’s left quite a wide swath. The Amaz!ng Meetings 1-7 have all been, well, &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;, and so this one, the James Randi Educational Foundation’s first international conference, had a lot to live up to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we did pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3992634480/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3454/3992634480_b3b72c1c4b_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In fact (to use an Americanism), this ball was hit &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; out of the park. The speakers were incredible: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cox_%28physicist%29"&gt;Brian Cox&lt;/a&gt; talking about the Large Hadron Collider and the origin of gravity, &lt;a href="http://www.simonsingh.net/"&gt;Simon Singh&lt;/a&gt; on his well-publicized libel lawsuit involving craven chiropractors, &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/"&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt; and bad medicine, &lt;a href="http://www.arianesherine.com/"&gt;Ariane Sherine&lt;/a&gt; on the atheist bus campaign and her new book, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/10/01/the-atheists-guide-to-christmas/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atheist’s Guide to Christmas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (for which I wrote an essay), and so many more. Professor &lt;a href="http://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/"&gt;Richard Wiseman&lt;/a&gt; emceed the event, and was fantastic at revving the audience up and keeping things moving — it was a tough choice to have him host rather than give a talk, but he did such a tremendous job I may never want to hear him give a talk again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um. Yeah. You know what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3991857143/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3234/3991857143_49240233be_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It was an anglocentric meeting, with mostly UK speakers by design. The exceptions were me, musician and skeptic &lt;a href="http://www.geologicpodcast.com/"&gt;George Hrab&lt;/a&gt;, and of course My Close Personal Friend Adam Savage™. There was a comedy show Saturday night featuring Robin Ince and friends, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight for me was &lt;a href="http://www.timminchin.com/about/"&gt;Tim Minchin&lt;/a&gt;. He is a brilliant musician, and not only skeptical, but &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; funny. He has critical thinking messages relayed with extreme and laser-focused humor in his songs. I laughed my head off, and when I wasn’t bent over double I checked the room to see everyone else in hysterics as well. He did his extraordinary nine minute beat poem &amp;quot;Storm&amp;quot;, about a fictional believer in nonsense he meets at a dinner party. It’s an excrutiatingly funny compendium of woo and how reality stomps it flat. Tim is frakkin’ awesome. He owned that crowd, and deservedly so. He’s a monster of skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3992409025/in/set-72157622413994151/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3418/3992409025_0ccb5be1c5.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3990729753/in/set-72157622413994151/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3271/3990729753_8a6257c4b6_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A real delight for the audience was a live video Q&amp;amp;A with Randi via Skype. They were able to directly ask Randi questions, and he pontificated as only he can in response. Although skeptics by nature tend not to follow authority terribly well, Randi is something of a touchstone in the skeptical movement. It is directly through his work that the modern movement, such as it is, exists at all, so getting to talk to him is a treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk was last. I decided to go with my lecture on asteroid impacts, since it’s timely and does have a lot of skeptical content. I think people enjoyed it — making fun of &amp;quot;Armageddon&amp;quot; is shooting fish in a barrel. When I was reviewing the talk a few days earlier, I realized that I would be giving it in a city hit hard by rocket attacks in World War II. Yet that same technology, just a few decades later, may save the entire human race from destruction by a rock from space. That sort of syzygy was too good not to discuss, so I ended with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We closed the meeting with a wrap-up and thanks, and got a standing ovation that went on and &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;. These folks were applauding the JREF and TAM London, but I get the very strong feeling they were also demonstrating their own emotional support for &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt;, for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of us who are active skeptics. We go out and try to make the world a better place, a more &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; place, and you know what? I think we do deserve a little respect for that. It’s a tough job, but it’s one we love to do, and one we need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew in advance that the UK audience would be a good one; there is so much good critical thinking work being done in England and its neighbors. But even knowing that I was overwhelmed with the generosity, support, good nature, and overall enthusiasm of the audience. You may have been applauding us, but you can be sure we applaud you as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And will there be a TAM London 2? Well, we can’t promise, of course. But given how big this one was, how much fun it was, and how great the audience was, well, I wouldn’t be too surprised to see another British invasion sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Edited to add: I should never post in a hurry; I inevitably leave off something important! In this case, it was to personally thank Tracy King from &lt;a href="http://www.februarymarketing.com/"&gt;February Marketing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.februarymarketing.com/"&gt;Skepchick&lt;/a&gt; for being the JREF's event planner for TAM London! Tracy did a fantastic job getting things put together, especially when -- as they always do for big events -- things didn't go according to plan. Despite a postal strike, a balky printer, and a hundred other speed bumps, Tracy and her crew managed to make the meeting run smoothly and efficiently. My hat's off to Tracy and all the people who were behind the scenes at TAM London!]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ll be back writing later next week – feel free to give feedback as always.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;*****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I saw someone address the issue of feminism being linked to flashing your body, it was a rather unsubtle skit from the ABC comedy program &lt;em&gt;Sideshow&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDcp9S8sS5k"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDcp9S8sS5k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It features two women singing how feminism just didn’t work beyond the 70s, because ultimately, &lt;em&gt;‘those women were ugly’&lt;/em&gt;! They sing about how feminism in the ‘noughties is all about being leashed like a hound in Hugh Hefner’s harem and, most importantly, revealing the true ‘window-to-your-soul’ – &lt;a title="Safe link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/fashion/30trainwreck.html"&gt;Britney-Spears style (BTW – safe link).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what first came to my mind when I was given &lt;a title="amazon link" href="http://www.amazon.com/Full-Frontal-Feminism-Womans-Matters/dp/1580052010"&gt;Full Frontal Feminism: A Young Women’s Guide to Why Feminism Matters&lt;/a&gt;, by Jessica Valenti. Along with the depressing online discussion I once had with a woman about how she was ignoring (her term) ’sophomoric’ pranks like endorsing stripping games at a male-dominated conference – because she thought writing book reviews was all she could comment on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must be the cover of the book – it’s really not the best recommendation to have a bare skinny white torso being linked to a discussion of feminism, honestly… Perhaps it’s just me? But then, I find it a contradiction to support science, post about skepticism, education and try to promote an awareness of differences between the sexes – and yet also endorse flashing your breasts in public or getting smashed via drugs or drink as ‘empowerment’ for that same group of women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a contradiction that &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be addressed. Because that’s what it reads as: from challenging cultural, societal or religious exploitation, the way women are usually the butt of the joke when it comes to &lt;a title="beliefs survey" href="http://www.ipsos-mori.com/polls/2007/schottsalmanac2.shtml"&gt;believing in pseudoscience and the paranormal&lt;/a&gt; – to supporting commercial exploitation, becoming just the  ‘butt’, er, of another type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t think anyone figured their momentary drunk exhibitionism would be forever captured on film to be sold on a mass scale? I’m not going to lie; this bothers the shit out of me. I mean, why in the world would you potentially ruin the rest of your life just so for a minute some guy thinks you’re hot?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ariel Levy argues that a new generation of feminists (ahem) is objectifying ourselves and each other by participating in things like GGW – things like sex work or stripping can be empowering, because it?s subversive or because hey, it’s fun. We’re making the choice to participate; therefore it’s powerful. But Levy says that the joke is on us, and that we’re really just fooling ourselves. Maybe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the assumption that all girls who enjoy the ’show’ are stupid or being fooled bothers me just as much. Not to mention that for a lot of women, developing a sexual identity in the process. … sometimes doing silly, disempowering, sexually vapid things when you’re young is just part of getting to the good stuff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, as Valenti says &lt;em&gt;‘you have to find your own middle ground&lt;/em&gt;‘ but when she says that there &lt;em&gt;‘has to be space for young women to figure out shit on their own [and] I think most times young women do figure it out&lt;/em&gt;‘ – yes, but what is guiding them to figuring out those conclusions? Who, exactly? Especially when she acknowledges from the start the power of &lt;em&gt;Girls Gone Wild&lt;/em&gt;, Paris Hilton, Lindsey Lohan and similar role models who are so prominent in the media?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What constitutes ‘&lt;em&gt;most times&lt;/em&gt;?’ Does she have suggestions as to what constitutes successfully navigating being &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; humiliated, disempowered and dealing with regrets that may occur? &lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;f you’re going to ‘go wild’, think about why you want to. If it’s honestly for your own pleasure and enjoyment, cool beans. If your friends are flashing their tits for no better reason than a free shirt and some attention, talk to them about it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When does pleasure and enjoyment become absurd and unprofessional? Where’s the CONTEXT? Back in 2006, an Australian Climate Change conference was condemned for having &lt;a title="link" href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20373424-2702,00.html"&gt;students perform a burlesque show&lt;/a&gt;; they even &lt;a title="aust article" href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20408225-25090,00.html"&gt; lost key government sponsorship&lt;/a&gt; for their inappropriate choice of entertainment. There is a time and a place – it’s the how to become smart enough to know when and where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, she says that talking it out is important and better than calling each other sluts – but Valenti isn’t really talking about universally helpful strategies. One of her suggested solutions, ‘&lt;em&gt;handing out condoms in schools&lt;/em&gt;‘ is one way to get into serious trouble – what if the school board doesn’t respond well to that? Whilst she promotes non-traditional blue-collar jobs (page 127) and discusses how any job training is preferable to &lt;em&gt;‘pushing tired sexist stereotypes about poverty and marriage&lt;/em&gt;?, there isn’t much on supporting those who tend towards the academic or may be stuck in a culture where everything revolves around the ’sexist stereotype’ and will have an uphill battle getting out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of assumptions about choices that can be made, which is why feminism (no matter what age) takes more than catchphrases and requires a lot more talk than what is provided in Valenti’s slim volume. I was also led to make the comparison of supporting women’s rights when I read of various communities of skeptical bloggers discuss the struggle of &lt;a title="Hirsi Ali page" href="http://ayaanhirsiali.web-log.nl/ayaanhirsiali/english/index.html"&gt;Ayaan Hirsi Ali&lt;/a&gt;, prominent on the site of Richard Dawkins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXGZBs65qMs"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXGZBs65qMs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If what Valenti is proposing is the solution for feminism being seen as ‘uncool’ for young women involves embracing your inner ‘fun stripper’ – is it realistic to write to all young women, which will include those from countries which have experienced limitations to their basic human rights? I don’t know if it makes me much of an authority, but I have taught for several years at an Islamic college, working with young women who often faced, and would probably face for a few generations, massive cultural confusion with her family endorsing one way of life whilst their education, neighborhood and media outlets portrayed another. I worked there because I believe in education and I could not see myself as denying children, no matter what their background, access to an education. It led me to study for my Masters degree in special needs and contribute to the writing of educational programs in my state, across all schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the prime focus on white, middle-class and overwhelmingly mainstream American audience in ‘Full Frontal Feminism’ that misses the mark when addressing those who really could use some real empowerment. No way would blithely handing out condoms solve their issues; more often than not you’d be shown the door by the women themselves. Citizenship of a country doesn’t mean homogeneity, nor can we claim we are without cultural influences – something not fully dealt with by Valenti with her one-pole-fits-all philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what got lost on the way? Is there a such fine line between gormless exploitation masked as ‘drinking, flashing and being a “new, young feminist”‘ and women’s self-reinvention as autonomous beings taking charge of their own lives? Is it that easy? Sometimes Valenti’s work became an exercise in ’spot the straw man’ in regards to abortion and emergency contraception – for some women it isn’t as easy to demand these rights and no solutions were given as to how to navigate the minefield if your societal norms denied them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do, however, applaud her enthusiastically pointing out the issues involved in the  &lt;a title="NY Times abstinence only education" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/21/nyregion/21schools.html"&gt;abstinence-only education&lt;/a&gt; debate (which I also &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2007/11/trick-question/"&gt;blogged about here – a post called ‘Trick Question’&lt;/a&gt;) – but overall, a sympathetic voice is not often being expressed by Valenti – quite a lot of off-putting anger and brashness at times (sometimes towards other femnist bloggers, oddly enough).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the life of me, I will &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; understand why a woman today would change her last name. It makes no sense whatsoever. You want future kids to have the same last name as you and your hubby? Hyphenate, bitch! Or do something, anything, but change your last name. It’s the ultimate buy-in of sexist bullshit. It epitomizes the idea that you are not your own person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh, since Valenti admits that 81 percent of women who get married plan to adopt a different surname, maybe she should rethink her strategy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading online reviews of Ayaan Hirsi Ali’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Caged-Virgin-Ayaan-Hirsi-Ali/dp/0743288335/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1199488075&amp;amp;sr=1-6"&gt;The &lt;/a&gt;Caged Virgin: An Emancipation Proclamation for Women and Islam, I find how Janet Albrechtsen faced the challenge first hand, when presenting on the topic of ‘The Journalist and Islam’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I pointed out that a more open debate depended on Muslim women talking honestly about the problems of radical Islam and the consequent inequality inflicted on women, there was only silence. And that silence is the problem. So again, in that vacuum, a white Christian chick will write on this issue because, in an enlightened world, the inequality of the sexes should transcend race, ethnicity and religion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; What is needed is nothing short of a Martin Luther-style reformation for Islam. That does not mean the West embarking on some kind of missionary path to convert the Arab world to Western-style women’s empowerment. It requires a grassroots agitation within Arab and other Muslim countries for what many regard as an oxymoron: Islamic feminism. It needs heretics willing to challenge the status quo: Muslim women fighting to reclaim basic rights to equality that suit a modern interpretation of Islam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;… The Muslim sisterhood in the West can help them out by ending its silence. That may give Islamic feminism the kick-start it needs. As long as Muslim women in the West are abused in the name of Islam, under the noses of Western governments apparently committed to the equality of men and women, reform in Muslim countries is that much harder to achieve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some have stepped bravely into that breach… In her book &lt;a title="CV" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Caged-Virgin-Ayaan-Hirsi-Ali/dp/0743288335/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1199488075&amp;amp;sr=1-6"&gt;The Caged Virgin&lt;/a&gt;, Hirsi Ali makes the obvious point that educating Muslim women is the best way to forge a modern Islam: allowing them to choose their own husbands, achieve at school, university and in the workplace, and, crucially, raise the next generation of Muslims to embrace modernity. Islam needs more heretics such as Hirsi Ali. Silence will not do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yes. Let’s start talking. Talking about more than just Valenti’s primary target audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Valenti treated the text rather scathingly, I would certainly suggest checking out ‘&lt;a title="FCP" href="http://www.amazon.com/Female-Chauvinist-Pigs-Raunch-Culture/dp/0743249895"&gt;Female Chauvinist Pig – The Rise of Raunch Culture&lt;/a&gt;‘ by NYT journalist Ariel Levy to see what the overt sexualization that has arisen during our generation’s time: her argument on how the trend towards pleasing guys under the name of ‘liberating equality’ has dangerously started to turn ‘beauties’ into ‘Whorish Nerdonnas’ or ‘&lt;em&gt;groupies for scientists&lt;/em&gt;‘ – I point to the game show ‘&lt;a title="wiki article" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Geek"&gt;Beauty and the Geek&lt;/a&gt;‘ as a sad indicator of the popularity of this approach for entertainment purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something has indeed gone wrong if a woman’s love for games has become ‘just another way to cater for the whim of guys’. It’s something that’s raised in essays by another &lt;a title="blog site" href="http://www.shessuchageek.com"&gt;established blogging collective&lt;/a&gt;, in the collection &lt;a title="she&amp;#39;s such a geek" href="http://www.amazon.com/Shes-Such-Geek-Science-Technology/dp/1580051901/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1199460724&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;She’s Such a Geek&lt;/a&gt; (edited by Annalee Newitz and Charlie Anders) – this particular one by Suzanne E. Franks called ‘&lt;em&gt;Suzy the Computer versus Dr Sexy&lt;/em&gt;‘:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The producers of ‘Beauty and the Geek’ say that a future season will reverse the genders, with female geeks and male beauties. Would this help any? In a word, no. The idea of the female geek seems to be a stereotype buster. But in fact, the figure of the female geek reproduces and reinforces all the negative stereotypes about individuals with an affinity for technology. And because she needs a modifier (female geek) while he does not (geek), she also reinforces the primary notion that technologically competent people are male. She’s just a Nerdonna to his nerd, and neither of them is getting laid…. are there any alternatives?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Afsaneh was a physical chemist who had built hardware and developed pulse sequences… she did not have separate selves for the lab and elsewhere. She was not Nerdonna, and she was not a Whore. She wasn’t even a Whorish Nerdonna. She was everything she was, all the time. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it got less-than-praiseworthy reviews, I’d also strongly suggest that anyone posing the ‘flash for feminism’ angle also consider reading the novel &lt;a title="citizen girl interview" href="http://gothamist.com/2004/12/23/nicola_kraus_and_emma_mclaughlin_citizen_girl_and_the_nanny_diaries_authors.php"&gt;Citizen Girl&lt;/a&gt; by Nicola Kraus and Emma McLaughlin, who previously co-wrote ‘The Nanny Diaries’ (also quite an interesting read about societal pressures and stereotypes promoted by women themselves.) The main character faces the problem of raising money for a non-profit organization when the male-dominated company she works for is eagerly exploiting the keen enthusiasm for raunch culture amongst young women – echoing what Ariel Levy writes, in terms of the trend not being essentially progressive, but essentially commercial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“So first we outfit his co-eds in unicorn knickers and rainbow bras and then once we’ve established our brand, we take the revolution to the next generation. Bottom line, I want to walk into any boardroom in America in six months and have to see these forty and fifty year olds want to flash me their tits like a bunch of crazy, carefree teens!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Oh! It’s …,” Jeffrey gushes, “it’s so new and just so … so”–WRONG?! Wrong, wrong, and WRONG?!–”fresh. I think the working women of America have been waiting for just this type of revolution.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a loss, Girl seems to have no one to turn to, unable to call a help-line for male exploitation of this carefree / careless ‘new feminism’ – &lt;em&gt;“To call whom? Hello is this the U.N.? Yes, I’m calling from Sunset Boulevard to report the SETBACK OF CIVILIZATION!”&lt;/em&gt; Her imagined future seems bleaker and bleaker in the face of pressure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Girl meet me out front at noon with cymbals strapped to your knees and a kazoo shoved up your ass. … Girl meet me out front at noon with Gloria Steinem’s still-beating heart in your hands and your integrity on a spit.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Girl faces first-hand the labeling of feminism equaling ‘man hater’. What answers she finds is more indicative of how it’s going to take even more talk, even more generations to fight for equality, with dismal concessions forced upon her final donation to the charity. No, I don’t think she finds simple answers easy to achieve – but it certainly isn’t achieved through &lt;a href="http://www.cakenyc.com/clubcake.html"&gt;‘Club Cake’.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor can we ignore the implications of children being sold items that endorse the pornographic empire of Playboy, &lt;a title="BBC podcast - morals and corrupt marketing" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/02/2006_16_fri.shtml"&gt;as discussed in this BBC podcast&lt;/a&gt;; Valenti also apparently sees uncritical acceptance of magazine porn as a backwards step for those who want to promote feminism for young women. Again, it seems to be a matter of when it is appropriate and studying what impact it has and where – more discussion required that a young woman may not have the luxury of doing in a supportive environment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in a society where the mention of a &lt;a title="The Higher Power of Lucky" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/18/books/18newb.html?ex=1329454800&amp;amp;en=0abee84c6d8ad9f4&amp;amp;ei=5088&amp;amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;amp;emc=rss"&gt; dog’s scrotum on the first page of a Newberry Award Winning&lt;/a&gt; children’s book is apparently enough to get school libraries attempt to ban or censor it… you &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; start to wonder about what sort of people are being lectured to in &lt;em&gt;Full Frontal Feminism&lt;/em&gt;. Overall, this book can’t really be for the young religious multicultural girl (of various denominations and cultural influences) who make up the majority of teens worldwide – or even Bible Belt mainstream America. Certainly not in the face of massive mainstream rallying support of brand importance, status recognition, overwhelming idealization of aesthetics and sexual permissiveness… as well as religious fundamentalism and political pressure groups battling it out daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book does have a hint of ‘be skeptical’, sure. But not really promoting universal goals that are more widely applicable to long-term fulfillment either… Maybe I’m just too old fashioned (or just plain too old) – but I’ve never seen a dictionary use either ‘fundamentalism’ &lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt; ‘raunchy’ as a synonym for ‘liberated’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I expected more from such a little book, since it is only 256 pages in length with very big print and lots of text box quotes. In the end, I’d say it boils down to context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, make an informed choice. Do pole-dancing for fitness; enjoy bellydancing; even be a connoisseur of the artform of erotic dance and erotic fiction. But I strongly suggest you learn things like the history of the burlesque tradition and know that guys are inevitably going to be distracted by girls no matter WHAT your moves are and it takes more than a fine ass no matter WHICH sex you belong do. Some might even have the choice to become a sex-industry worker – but one who had the educational opportunities to &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; that career, rather than be forced into it, abused or browbeaten into thinking it is ‘all you’re good for’. Support graphic art – whilst questioning why so many female superhero characters are drawn without pants on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s more about getting help and support, education towards knowing what it is you &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; as well as want and taking steps to be informed – rather than be an unwitting pawn in fulfilling an image that is, let’s face it, predominantly commercially based and exploited. Because simply, it is just too easy to be taken advantage of when taking that path. After all – isn’t &lt;a title="CHOICE" href="http://www.choice.com.au/defaultView.aspx?id=102314&amp;amp;catId=100165"&gt;skepticism of consumer claims&lt;/a&gt; what we should promote for everyone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shouldn’t we be prompting a flood of young feminists via programs – that more importantly can be tested and critiqued for its effectiveness? Support groups who have strength in numbers, accountability and a serious global approach? Educational goals that are clearly defined and universally applicable? That’s a topic I’ll address in my next series of posts on such matters as well – how do we know what can work in education both in and out of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that regard, I note that  Valenti mentions in the book that she once worked for &lt;a title="NOW on Sourcewatch Encyclopaedia" href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=National_Organization_for_Women"&gt;NOW Legal Defence&lt;/a&gt; and Education Fun, a non-profit civil rights organisation – now ‘&lt;a title="legal momentum" href="http://www.idealist.org/en/org/17095-150"&gt;Legal Momentum&lt;/a&gt;‘. Such an emphasis led me to look at other sites and groups online that would perhaps be sought out by young women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d also suggest &lt;a title="unifem us" href="http://www.unifem.org/"&gt;http://www.unifem.org/&lt;/a&gt;. Or  the&lt;a href="http://www.feminist.org/"&gt; Feminist Majority Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://feminism.eserver.org/activism/links/global_fund.html"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.globalfundforwomen.org/"&gt; Global Fund for Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.now.org/"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; and, of course – &lt;a title="amnesty" href="http://www.amnesty.org/"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;. Because underneath it all, we should be fighting for global equity for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of science education support: &lt;a title="wired woman" href="http://www.wiredwoman.com/mc/page.do"&gt;WIREDWOMAN.com&lt;/a&gt; – has funding raised that goes directly to women and their projects and a mentorship program; &lt;a href="http://www.bust.com/"&gt; http://www.bust.com&lt;/a&gt; – don’t be fooled by the pun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.grrlgamer.com/"&gt;GRRLGAMER – Grrls who got game! Game reviews, strategy guides, demo downloads, forums and more!&lt;/a&gt; – the classic gamer site.There’s plenty more…&lt;a href="http://www.umbc.edu/cwit/"&gt; Center for Women and Information Technology&lt;/a&gt; ; &lt;a href="http://www.girlstart.org/index.asp"&gt;Girlstart – Empowering Girls in Math, Science and Technology &lt;/a&gt; – an actual non-profit organisation, for young women into technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/%7Edougproj/"&gt;Douglass College: The Douglass Project&lt;/a&gt; – scholarships directly to women: “Douglass Project for Rutgers Women in Math, Science &amp;amp; Engineering is an award-winning program dedicated to supporting undergraduate women and students at the secondary level interested in studying math, sciences, engineering and technology.” Not forgetting&lt;a href="http://www.braincake.org/"&gt; BrainCake.org&lt;/a&gt; – interactive site for young women, designed with young women’s input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d also suggest the site by &lt;a title="kaz cooke" href="http://www.kazcooke.com/kazcooke/"&gt;Australian Kaz Cooke&lt;/a&gt;, who (with ‘Hermoine the Modern Girl’) has produced books, website and teaching guides for just the same issue all of these texts try to tackle – just what does fit for the modern girl?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to be sure – do use the site &lt;a title="Sourcewatch.org" href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=SourceWatch"&gt;Sourcewatch.org to check out such groups.&lt;/a&gt; Because there’s a lot of claims that don’t live up to the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather like how ‘feminism’ can become a catchphrase for some rather… er, unladylike notions. That don’t do any girl any favours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tamlondon.org"&gt;TAM London&lt;/a&gt; has come and gone, but it's left quite a wide swath. The Amaz!ng Meetings 1-7 have all been, well, &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;, and so this one, the James Randi Educational Foundation's first international conference, had a lot to live up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we did pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact (to use an Americanism), this ball was hit &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; out of the park. The speakers were incredible: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cox_%28physicist%29"&gt;Brian Cox&lt;/a&gt; talking about the Large Hadron Collider and the origin of gravity, &lt;a href="http://www.simonsingh.net/"&gt;Simon Singh&lt;/a&gt; on his well-publicized libel lawsuit involving craven chiropractors, &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/"&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt; and bad medicine, &lt;a href="http://www.arianesherine.com/"&gt;Ariane Sherine&lt;/a&gt; on the atheist bus campaign and her new book, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/10/01/the-atheists-guide-to-christmas/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atheist's Guide to Christmas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (for which I wrote an essay), and so many more. Professor &lt;a href="http://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/"&gt;Richard Wiseman&lt;/a&gt; emceed the event, and was fantastic at revving the audience up and keeping things moving -- it was a tough choice to have him host rather than give a talk, but he did such a tremendous job I may never want to hear him give a talk again.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>philplait@randi.org (Phil Plait)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255025784416"><id gr:original-id="671 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0fcef4de5f31f9cf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="atheism" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/54"/><category term="Christmas" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/515"/><category term="humour" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/540"/><category term="Religion" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/843"/><category term="Review" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/845"/><category term="Science" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/841"/><category term="Religion" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/852"/><category term="Review" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/853"/><title type="html">The Atheist's Guide to Christmas</title><published>2009-10-08T14:22:22Z</published><updated>2009-10-08T14:22:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/671" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I bloody love Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once, as a plucky undergraduate, took part in a pantomime based on the Nativity story, up in Newcastle-upon-Tyne - the slogan on the t-shirts was the one above. And I think we all agreed on the sentiment. Although I preferred my one: "An eye for a why-aye leaves everyone blind drunk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[As guitarist in the band, I was less enamoured with the mandatory wearing of antlers in the band pit; a sartorial albatross that continues to haunt me.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that's why I followed the career path of the musician, rather than joke writer.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
But being brought up within a religious household, as I was, does lend the Christmas period with a lot of weight (water-retention, sure) and resonance that affords all involved with a sense of community. One of the hardest parts of gradually changing belief systems was reconciling my genuine love of the festive period, the community and the traditions, with my own lack of belief in the begged question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there's never been a satisfactory answer to 'how can you, as a heathen atheist, honestly enjoy the festive period?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Atheists-Guide-Christmas-Ariane-Sherine/dp/0007322615"&gt;Thankfully, here it is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atheist's Guide to Christmas is the logical follow-up to The Atheist Bus Campaign - and is also a completely charitable initiative, with the full book advance and all royalties going to the admirable &lt;a href="http://www.tht.org.uk/"&gt;Terrence Higgins&lt;/a&gt; UK HIV Trust (especially relevant as an atheist charity of choice given the egregious harm regrettably propagated by the infallible papacy recently over condom usage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is split into vignettes from leading writers, thinkers, scientists and psychological illusionists, numbering 42 essays in total (and it doesn't require too much Deep Thought to figure that one out). It's the perfect length of essay, too - the sort of short, sharp and hopefully sweet fusion of erudition, irreverence and (importantly) a platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having just recovered from the TAM London event last weekend, it was a pleasure to see so many familiar names heralding the good cheer in spite of their godlessness. &lt;a href="http://www.arianesherine.com"&gt;Ariane Sherine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net"&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.simonsingh.net"&gt;Simon Singh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com"&gt;Phil Plait&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.skepticsinthepub.org"&gt;Sid Rodrigues&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.robinince.com"&gt;Robin Ince&lt;/a&gt;, Brian Cox, &lt;a href="http://www.littleatoms.com"&gt;Neil Denny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.grahamnunn.net"&gt;Graham Nunn&lt;/a&gt; all made appearances (some brief, some epochal, all welcome) at TAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, like TAM, I had reservations about the book. The idea of uniting under a common banner, parading in the same uniform, and singing from the same hymn sheet - well, it's all a bit of a mutual back-slapping session, isn't it? Thankfully, both book and weekend dispelled my anxieties - the cats continue to refuse to be herded, blessedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to get into every single essay here, but each one is a joy to read - really! I know I'm too much of a wee young whippersnapper to be genuinely curmudgeonly, but it is really heart-warming to read such a differing collection of views, united under a mutual appreciation of social cohesion, togetherness, family reunion, and drink. Mainly drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I apologise if this isn't the most seasonal of posts. I pre-ordered the book the day it was announced on Twitter (in June!); and I'm writing this mostly in a cafe in Wimbledon in the midst of a gloriously autumnal morning in October. Mmmmmmmm, festive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special prize for most idiomatic essay goes to the bally rally of Richard Dawkins as he brings the Wodehouse down, lovingly donning the Woosterian blazer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funniest essay has to go to Nick Doody, for his satire on the scientism of measuring Christmasism throughout the ages. My appreciation of this can be testified by all unfortunate patrons of Le Pain Quotidien, who had to endure my sides-splitting throughout. Readers of this site will appreciate the injokes and satire of media devastation of scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested by the Atheist Bus Campaign, Graham Nunn has a great article on the background of the campaign - having eagerly followed the press exploits of the buses, it was nice for me to read more of the 'inside track' - to get all cutting-edge and pretend that I watch &lt;i&gt;The Wire&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Kirshen really does bring value for money to the book; how many texts can give such deep theological and epistemological musings on the relevance of the Judaistic kestrel tradition? Not many, that's for damn sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and did I mention that &lt;b&gt;Simon Le Bon&lt;/b&gt; has an essay in it? No? Well, he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special mention must go to Phil Plait and Derren Brown, for some of the most thoughtful, and pleasant essays on the subject I've read. And Sid Rodrigues closes the book with one of the most inspiring stories in there; there's so much more to this subject than just refutation, debunking, or cynicism, and it's to the credit of the contributors that this shines unabashedly through. They are thoroughly good role-models for their views and various causes.&lt;br&gt;
There isn't a single case of a thoughtless invective, or pejorative diatribe in this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin Ince paints a great image when mentions his growing "bookshelf of good intentions"; we have a similar taste in furniture. But I recommend that this book doesn't end up there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preconceptions are for shedding, books are for reading, and Christmas is for celebrating. Families, friends, spirits (Holy or solely chemical), traditions, or religion. Doesn't matter: just relax and enjoy your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall endeavour to post once a week here, I’ve already received plenty of questions, thank you to all those who’ve been Tweeting me – keep ‘em coming and I’ll pick the best one each week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week’s post was defiantly brought to you by the illustrious, the elusive, and the pertly-bottomed Abs…&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/06/19/article-1027541-006E61850000044C-503_233x376.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear The Unfriendly Atheist,&lt;br&gt;
What do atheists scream during an orgasm?&lt;br&gt;
Regards,&lt;br&gt;
Abs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dearest Abs,&lt;br&gt;
This is indeed an important subject that must be approached delicately, and with great aplomb (and hopefully a bit of fun). Firstly, I’d like to point out that there are many different kinds of orgasm. I’m sure a delightful fornicator like yourself needs no clarification, but it’s worth knowing just in case you’re more of the “violent screaming” kind – though I wouldn’t presume to assert such things! One must think carefully about the kinds of words used when you fraternise with a lover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you are deflowering a young specimen, you may wish to use more sensitive language to begin with in order to let your lust evolve slowly; whereas if you are experimenting with a seasoned professional, it may be entirely appropriate to lay into the big kahunas like a hefty steamroller with extra juice. Extra love juice, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, when people had ethics, and they thought God was everywhere (even in your bum-hole), people used to shout something along the lines of “God, oh God!”, however, in these enlightened times, religious affirmation just has no place in the bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve put together a selection of alternatives, which I hope you will find useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Milkybars are on me!”&lt;br&gt;
“That’s Numberwang!”&lt;br&gt;
“They think it’s all over…” (And then they reply) “It is now!”&lt;br&gt;
 “What a prick!”&lt;br&gt;
“Thunderbirds are go!” [I actually prefer this during pre-rutting/foreplay but I am told it is effective post-violation as well]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, these are all catchy slogans from British television shows. My own research has shown that these are vastly more effective than the usual, and quite frankly, crass curse-words. If you are not familiar with British slogans, I pity you. There is a wonderful invention that any lay person can access online called “YouTube”, I firmly suggest you utilise it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do hope you find these useful, and perhaps you could come up with some of your own…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With fond regards,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Un-friendly Atheist&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s a snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Especially in contentious debates over science and religion, religious moderates have much to add. When fundamentalists are allowed to stand in for all religious people in discussions with atheists, the conversation falls back into historically naive visions of a war between science and religion (for more on that, see Ron Numbers’ excellent &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674033272?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=thoughtsfromk-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0674033272"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Galileo Goes  to Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). In discussing topics like evolution, it is too easy for both sides to talk past one another. Scientists often inadvertently ignore the theological concerns of religious nonscientists, while religiously conservative creationists obscure the scientific process by denying any finding that might conflict with their preconceptions of how the Bible should be read. You could easily assume it is an accepted fact that belief in God requires rejecting science and that accepting science means abandoning religious faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;This situation effectively disenfranchises those in the middle—theists, atheists, agnostics, and others who see no need to set religion and science in opposition. In &lt;a href="http://people-press.org/report/?pageid=1546"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;a  survey this summer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 68 percent of white mainline Protestants denied that science conflicts with their religious beliefs, as did 62 percent of black Protestants, 52 percent of Catholics, and 79 percent of those with no religious affiliation. Only among evangelicals did a majority see a conflict, and that majority was a narrow 52 percent. This leaves a sizable fraction of the public that holds, or at least is sympathetic to, a moderate view on these questions, but their voices are too rarely heard in public debates.&lt;/p&gt;

It has left an impact far and wide, ranging from asteroids to cosmology. As Sean has &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/10/06/practicality-and-the-universe/trackback/"&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt;, the SDSS would have been impossible without optical fibers and CCDs, and this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics acknowledges the development of these technologies. The SDSS would also have been impossible without Jim Gunn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Obama yesterday conferred &lt;a href="http://www.nationalmedals.org/medals/science.php"&gt;The National Medal of Science&lt;/a&gt; to Jim Gunn, as well as &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Honors-Nations-Top-Scientists-and-Innovators/"&gt;8 other scientists&lt;/a&gt;. This is our nation’s highest scientific honor. It is a clear demonstration that our society values science, and acknowledges its contributions; even though this may not always be apparent in the squabbling on Capitol Hill, or on school boards “debating” evolution. Once a year scientists take pride of place, and are officially thanked by a grateful Nation. As usual, Obama unleashes his eloquence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this nation owes all of you an enormous debt of gratitude far greater than any medal can bestow. And we recognize your contributions, but we also celebrate the incredible contributions of the scientific endeavor itself. We see the promise — not just for our economy but for our health and well-being — in the human capacity for creativity and ingenuity. And we are reminded of the power of free and open inquiry, which is not only at the heart of all of your work, but at the heart of this experiment we call America.&lt;br&gt;
…&lt;br&gt;
there are those who say we can’t afford to invest in science, that it’s a luxury at a moment defined by necessities. I could not disagree more. Science is more essential for our prosperity, our security, and our health, and our way of life than it has ever been. And the winners we are recognizing only underscore that point, with achievements in physics and medicine, computer science and cognitive science, energy technology and biotechnology. We need to ensure that we are encouraging the next generation of discoveries — and the next generation of discoverers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-at-the-National-Medal-of-Science-and-National-Medal-of-Technology-and-Innovation-Ceremony/"&gt;Full transcript here&lt;/a&gt;. Jim Gunn was honored “for his brilliant design of many of the most influential telescopes and instruments in astronomy, and in particular for the crucial role those technological marvels played in the creation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which has cataloged 200 million stars, galaxies, and quasars; discovered the most distant known quasars; and probed the epoch of formation of the first stars and galaxies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting in the audience were members of the administration, including Steve Chu (Secretary of Energy) and John Holdren (Science Advisor), widely respected scientists in their own right. Seeing them gathered with Obama, celebrating science, is a hopeful image. There is a perception that scientists are losing the goodwill amassed in the last Century, and are now thought of as just another interest group. But we need science to address many of the world’s most pressing challenges. We need young people to be inspired, and to want to become scientists. Occasions like this remind us that science, and scientists, will play a crucial role in our future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>daniel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255023747334"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=9856">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/43dbf64cf4cc550d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepchick-ism"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="podcast"/><category term="jon ronson"/><title type="html">Jon Ronson Interview at TAM London</title><published>2009-10-08T17:00:46Z</published><updated>2009-10-08T17:00:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/10/jon-ronson-interview-at-tam-london/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;New day, new interview from TAM London! I’ve been a fan of Jon Ronson’s since I first heard him on This American Life several years ago, after which I immediately bought &lt;em&gt;Them: Adventures with Extremists&lt;/em&gt; and watched every documentary of his I could find and tried to convince all my friends to do the same. It’s so unbelievably cool that I had the chance to hang out with him at TAM London and do a quick interview with my co-host Neil Denny of Little Atoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our interview with Jon will appear on Little Atoms and The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe, but here it is on Skepchick in a slightly less censored format, complete with an aside about a man in the audience who randomly called Jon a cunt during the Q&amp;amp;A with Simon Singh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/06/AR2009100600469.html?hpidsec-religion"&gt;Six months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time we heard of the saga of &lt;strong&gt;Madeline Kara Neumann&lt;/strong&gt; — the 11-year-old who &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/05/18/madeline-neumann-died-because-her-parents-prayed-instead-of-getting-help-heres-the-irony/"&gt;died from untreated diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, after slipping into a coma, because her parents prayed instead of calling a doctor — both her parents were found guilty of “&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8180116.stm"&gt;second-degree reckless homicide&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They faced up to 25 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we learned they would only be sentenced to six months of that.  (Plus 10 years probation… just in case they go all prayer-y against their three other children?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not even six months in a row.  It’s one month a year for six years… with only one parent gone at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge was entirely too lenient with them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In sentencing the couple, Marathon County Circuit Court Judge Vincent Howard said the Neumanns were “very good people, raising their family who made a bad decision, a reckless decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“God probably works through other people,” Howard told the parents, “some of them doctors.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least there’s some hope for their remaining children.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As part of their probation, the parents must allow a public health nurse to examine their two underage children at least once every three months and must immediately take their children to a doctor for any serious injuries.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, it’s too late for Kara.  And the message other ultra-religious parents will get from this is that when you place your trust in a god instead of with people with actual knowledge, the punishment is far from severe and you’ll be seen as victims instead of killers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I predict it won’t be long before it happens again.  Without harsher penalties, these parents won’t learn anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me back up a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know someone who attended nursing school at UMDNJ. It's actually a very good nursing school, but, alas, it has a serious woo streak in it. Yesterday, because of that connection, I was shown a pamphlet that had arrived in the mail. It was a the &lt;a href="http://sn.umdnj.edu/cont_ed/index.htm"&gt;Continuing Education Catalog for the UMDNJ School of Nursing&lt;/a&gt;. At first glance, it looked pretty unremarkable. There were the usual courses in subjects like trauma nursing, clinical skills and health assessment, EKG interpretation, pediatric assessment, and other common nursing topics. So far, nothing unusual; it was pretty standard stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I saw what was so disturbing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 60 million Americans self-prescribed herbs in 1997. Are your patients telling you about any of them? As practitioners, you need to know what herbs your patients are taking, and if they are beneficial, harmful, or just waste money. Understand what herbal medicine is, and the differences between the holistic paradigm and the Western medical approach to healthcare. Review relative safety data on herbs vs. pharmaceuticals, and areas of known and theoretical interaction. Know how herbal medicine can interface safely with patient care. Learn the specifics of the top 10 herbs in America, and where to find useful and accurate resources. This information is presented in an interactive, 5-hour dynamic workshop with one of the few professional nurse-herbalists in clinical practice today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/a_trio_of_woo_at_umdnj_school_of_nursing.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/a_trio_of_woo_at_umdnj_school_of_nursing.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/inFzMo5P-4s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255019372347"><id gr:original-id="http://www.virology.ws/2009/10/08/zinc-and-the-common-cold/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b994a847dc9b15a6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Zinc and the common cold</title><published>2009-10-08T11:04:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-08T11:04:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/D5Mqho7bBCs/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.virology.ws/2009/10/08/zinc-and-the-common-cold/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Shortly after I developed sore throat, cough, and congestion last week, a package of &amp;#39;Cold - Eeze&amp;#39; materialized on my kitchen counter.

Birds are often touted as the monogamists of the animal kingdom, with most bird species mating with the same individual and displaying biparental care, sometimes for many years. Their cousins, the reptiles, are no match for their faithfulness: most reptiles show no mate fidelity, let alone parental care.

Of more interest, this new dust ring explains why the leading side of Iapetus is so much darker than the rest of it - the dark front surface of Iapetus is material from the ring swept up by Iapetus as it orbits at the inner edge of the new ring.In truth a link between the dark front of Iapetus and Phoebe has been suspected before now, as the composition of the dark material is very similar to that of Phoebe based on near IR spectroscopy with Cassini. What the Spitzer observations reveal is the presence of the dust ring and hence the mechanism of material transfer from Phoebe to Iapetus.Although the ring is physically huge, with a volume of ~5e21 km^3 (this is my BOTE calculation. As far as I can tell Verbiscer et al do not quote a volume), it is incredibly tenuous, and if all the material within it were collected back into one place it would possibly only occupy ~ 1 km^3 of rock, i.e. the volume of a crater on Phoebe.The other interesting thing is that the material migrates inwards under the influence of radiation pressure. From Verbiscer et al:On long timescales, collisions and inward transport become important. Collision with Phoebe, the dominant loss mechanism for particles larger than several centimetres in size, takes on the order of 1010 years. Re-radiation of absorbed sunlight exerts an asymmetric force on dust grains, causing them to spiral in towards Saturn with a characteristic timescale of 1.5  105rg years where rg is the particle radius in micrometres. This force brings all centimetre-sized and smaller material to Iapetus and Titan unless mutual particle collisions occur first. The rate of mutual collisions depends on the size distribution of the ring particles and optical depth; if the ring were comprised entirely of 10 m grains, then the collisional timescale would be tens of millions of years, which is comparable to the inward drag timescale. Most material from 10 m to centimetres in size ultimately hits Iapetus, with smaller percentages striking Hyperion and Titan3.References:Verbiscer, A., Skrutskie, M., &amp;amp; Hamilton, D. (2009).

&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;em&gt;gorgeous&lt;/em&gt; images were returned from the spacecraft, but this one is my favorite so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=1&amp;amp;gallery_id=2&amp;amp;image_id=332"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/10/messenger_basin.jpg" alt="messenger_basin" title="messenger_basin" width="610" height="610"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a large impact basin about 260 km (160 miles) across. It’s never been seen before! Only one other spacecraft has visited Mercury before — Mariner 10 in 1974 — and its orbit was such that it never did see many parts of the planet. MESSENGER was in the right place at the right time to snap this picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that it’s a double ringed crater. It’s not quite clear why these features form. It may be due to the forces generated upon impact, when a shock wave travels through the rock and rebounds inside the crater, or it may be from subsequent volcanic flows. Double rings are only seen in large impact events, so that must have something to do with it. You can also see concentric troughs or cracks in the crater middle. Those are due to the stretching of the crater floor after the impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=1&amp;amp;gallery_id=2&amp;amp;image_id=336"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/10/messenger_brightspot.jpg" alt="messenger_brightspot" title="messenger_brightspot" width="250" height="251"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Other images of Mercury from this third pass are just as cool: &lt;a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=1&amp;amp;gallery_id=2&amp;amp;image_id=336"&gt;a bright splash around a double crater&lt;/a&gt; (seen here; most likely lighter material under the surface blasted out on impact), &lt;a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=1&amp;amp;gallery_id=2&amp;amp;image_id=335"&gt;a crater with an elongated pit in its floor&lt;/a&gt; that makes it a pretty good smiley face, and &lt;a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=1&amp;amp;gallery_id=2&amp;amp;image_id=333"&gt;a lovely shot&lt;/a&gt; of the northern limb of the planet spattered with craters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine they’ll release a handful more images over the next few days, but that’ll be it for the most part until March 2011, when MESSENGER meets up with Mercury one last time, settling into orbit… and then we’ll see lots more images. Lots and &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; more… and they’ll be even higher resolution than these. What wonders will we see then?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255018095447"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=19369">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ad81d76349e6a33e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="fred shapiro"/><category term="quote"/><title type="html">Quotes Uncovered: Who First Talked About Skinning Cats?</title><published>2009-10-08T16:07:11Z</published><updated>2009-10-08T16:07:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/WFVkEnY13Po/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/quotes-uncovered-who-first-talked-about-skinning-cats/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">A while back, I invited readers to submit quotations for which they wanted me to try to trace the origins, using The Yale Book of Quotations and more recent research by me.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elisabeth von Wedel, Homöopathen ohne Grenzen e.V.
1514 Stimmen&lt;br&gt;
Raul Krauthausen, SOZIALHELDEN e.V.
1208 Stimmen&lt;br&gt;
Jürgen Dangl, Hofgut Himmelreich gGmbH
634 Stimmen&lt;br&gt;
Dr. Stefanie Christmann, Esel-Initiative e.V.
510 Stimmen&lt;br&gt;
Margit Adamski, Zweites Leben e.V.
344 Stimmen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the leader with 1514 stimmen, or votes? To translate, that's "Homeopathy without borders," a team of quacks that travels the world treating the sick and dying with tiny ampules of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest that everyone get over there and vote for the current second place group, SOZIALHELDEN, or "Social Heroes". Once they've got a solid lead, we should work on bringing up all the other nominees. Just click on the "Stimme abgeben" beneath their name to vote for them.  To see how the voting is going, click on the "Jetzt Ranking Anzeigen" button at the top right of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

Salazar&lt;/i&gt;, a case which is challenging the use of a gigantic cross on federal land, which was initially erected to honor WWI dead but has now become a cause celebre for the wanna-be theocrats who want official endorsement of America as a Christian nation. This &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_10/020327.php"&gt;exchange with Scalia is simply stunning&lt;/a&gt;: the man is an incompetent ideologue who I wouldn't trust to rule on a parking ticket. Can we have him impeached?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how he reacted when told that non-Christians might object a teeny-tiny bit to having their dead memorialized with a gigantic Christian symbol.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The cross doesn't honor non-Christians who fought in the war?"&lt;/span&gt; Scalia asks, stunned.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"A cross is the predominant symbol of Christianity, and it signifies that Jesus is the son of God and died to redeem mankind for our sins," replies Eliasberg, whose father and grandfather are both Jewish war veterans.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;"It's erected as a war memorial!"&lt;/span&gt; replies Scalia. &lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;I assume it is erected in honor of all of the war dead. The cross is the most common symbol of … of … of the resting place of the dead.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Eliasberg dares to correct him: "The cross is the most common symbol of the resting place of Christians. I have been in Jewish cemeteries. There is never a cross on a tombstone of a Jew."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;"I don't think you can leap from &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; to the conclusion that the only war dead the cross honors are the Christian war dead,"&lt;/span&gt; thunders Scalia. &lt;span&gt;"I think that's an &lt;i&gt;outrageous conclusion&lt;/i&gt;!"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Far less outrageous is the conclusion that religious symbols are not religious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Scalia is such an open-minded syncretist, I suggest that when he dies, right after all the partying and celebration, we atheists pass around a hat and get a collection going to erect a huge Muslim crescent over his grave. Not only will it honor the dead man, but it'll let us do double-duty when we all line up to piss on it.

&lt;p&gt;I once, as a plucky undergraduate, took part in a pantomime based on the Nativity story, up in Newcastle-upon-Tyne - the slogan on the t-shirts was the one above. And I think we all agreed on the sentiment. Although I preferred my one: "An eye for a why-aye leaves everyone blind drunk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[as guitarist in the band, I was less enamoured with the mandatory wearing of antlers in the band pit; a sartorial albatross that continues to haunt me.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that's why I followed the career path of the musician, rather than joke writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But being brought up within a religious household, as I was, does lend the Christmas period with a lot of weight (water-retention, sure) and resonance that affords all involved with a sense of community. One of the hardest parts of gradually changing belief systems was reconciling my genuine love of the festive period, the community and the traditions, with my own lack of belief in the begged question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there's never been a satisfactory answer to 'how can you, as a heathen atheist, honestly enjoy the festive period?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Atheists-Guide-Christmas-Ariane-Sherine/dp/0007322615"&gt;Thankfully, here it is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Atheist's Guide to Christmas is the logical follow-up to The Atheist Bus Campaign - and is also a completely charitable initiative, with the full book advance and all royalties going to the admirable &lt;a href="http://www.tht.org.uk/"&gt;Terrence Higgins&lt;/a&gt; UK HIV Trust (especially relevant as an atheist charity of choice given the egregious harm regrettably propagated by the infallible papacy recently over condom usage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is split into vignettes from leading writers, thinkers, scientists and psychological illusionists, numbering 42 essays in total (and it doesn't require too much Deep Thought to figure that one out). It's the perfect length of essay, too - the sort of short, sharp and hopefully sweet fusion of erudition, irreverence and (importantly) a platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having just recovered from the TAM London event last weekend, it was a pleasure to see so many familiar names heralding the good cheer in spite of their godlessness. &lt;a href="http://www.arianesherine.com"&gt;Ariane Sherine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net"&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.simonsingh.net"&gt;Simon Singh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com"&gt;Phil Plait&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.skepticsinthepub.org"&gt;Sid Rodrigues&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.robinince.com"&gt;Robin Ince&lt;/a&gt;, Brian Cox, &lt;a href="http://www.littleatoms.com"&gt;Neil Denny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.grahamnunn.net"&gt;Graham Nunn&lt;/a&gt; all made appearances (some brief, some epochal, all welcome) at TAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, like TAM, I had reservations about the book. The idea of uniting under a common banner, parading in the same uniform, and singing from the same hymn sheet - well, it's all a bit of a mutual back-slapping session, isn't it? Thankfully, both book and weekend dispelled my anxieties - the cats continue to refuse to be herded, blessedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to get into every single essay here, but each one is a joy to read - really! I know I'm too much of a wee young whippersnapper to be genuinely curmudgeonly, but it is really heart-warming to read such a differing collection of views, united under a mutual appreciation of social cohesion, togetherness, family reunion, and drink. Mainly drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I apologise if this isn't the most seasonal of posts. I pre-ordered the book the day it was announced on Twitter (in June!); and I'm writing this mostly in a cafe in Wimbledon in the midst of a gloriously autumnal morning in October. Mmmmmmmm, festive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special prize for most idiomatic essay goes to the bally rally of Richard Dawkins as he brings the Wodehouse down, lovingly donning the Woosterian blazer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funniest essay has to go to Nick Doody, for his satire on the scientism of measuring Christmasism throughout the ages. My appreciation of this can be testified by all unfortunate patrons of Le Pain Quotidien, who had to endure my sides-splitting throughout. Readers of this site will appreciate the injokes and satire of media devastation of scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested by the Atheist Bus Campaign, Graham Nunn has a great article on the background of the campaign - having eagerly followed the press exploits of the buses, it was nice for me to read more of the 'inside track' - to get all cutting-edge and pretend that I watch &lt;i&gt;The Wire&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Kirshen really does bring value for money to the book; how many texts can give such deep theological and epistemological musings on the relevance of the Judaistic kestrel tradition? Not many, that's for damn sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and did I mention that &lt;b&gt;Simon Le Bon&lt;/b&gt; has an essay in it? No? Well, he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special mention must go to Phil Plait and Derren Brown, for some of the most thoughtful, and pleasant essays on the subject I've read. And Sid Rodrigues closes the book with one of the most inspiring stories in there; there's so much more to this subject than just refutation, debunking, or cynicism, and it's to the credit of the contributors that this shines unabashedly through. They are thoroughly good role-models for their views and various causes.&lt;br&gt;
There isn't a single case of a thoughtless invective, or pejorative diatribe in this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin Ince paints a great image when mentions his growing "bookshelf of good intentions"; we have a similar taste in furniture. But I recommend that this book doesn't end up there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preconceptions are for shedding, books are for reading, and Christmas is for celebrating. Families, friends, spirits (Holy or solely chemical), traditions, or religion. Doesn't matter: just relax and enjoy your life.&lt;/p&gt;

Now the fashion mag–which has included many ‘plus-sized’ models over the years–features seven women (including Lizzie) in &lt;a href="http://www.glamour.com/health-fitness/2009/10/these-bodies-are-beautiful-at-every-size"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; about beauty in all shapes and sizes. They take the dialog one step further asking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;OK, let’s envision a world where women of more body types do get glamorous work in magazines and ad campaigns. Would female readers, viewers and buyers &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glamour&lt;/em&gt; goes into detail about what it would take and of course, the answer is ultimately, &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;. But the reason this matters  so much is bigger than determining which fashion models get work. It’s a topic taken on in recent years by &lt;a href="http://www.campaignforrealbeauty.com/"&gt;Dove’s Campaign for Real Beauty&lt;/a&gt; and others, but a message that needs to be repeated. Women and girls across the country–and beyond–face tremendous pressure to conform to an unrealistic, frequently unhealthy vision of what’s ’socially acceptable’, how we should look, and what we should weigh. Put simply, &lt;em&gt;it’s pure nonsense&lt;/em&gt;. And yet, we perpetuate the myth by celebrating these ideals in media and popular culture. So solving the problem begins with changing ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have observed firsthand too many college-aged women and high school girls suffering from bulimia and anorexia in a losing battle to achieve what only airbrush can. My close relationships with women seem to inevitably drift into discussions of weight, calories, and body image, while with men, these subjects come up in the broader context of health and fitness. I have listened to my friends–beautiful new mothers–tell me how much they &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; their new bodies for the very shape they took to bring forth life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, we’ve become &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20713930/"&gt;intolerant of reality&lt;/a&gt;. That’s simply unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glamour’s&lt;/em&gt; article brought me encouragement. There is reason for hope, at least if we can stop &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/05/jessica-simpson-dons-see_n_310318.html"&gt;obsessing over nonsense&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, overcoming the crisis is up to us.&lt;/p&gt;

The question of the origins of biological diversity is a fundamental one, and obtaining as complete an answer as possible is a primary goal of the life sciences. Evolution is to biology what the periodic table is to chemistry: It makes sense of otherwise disconnected pieces of information and provides the framework for further investigation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you mean “students enrolled in science programs,” either undergraduates or grad students (&lt;a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/news/2009/10/science_student.html"&gt;as in our study&lt;/a&gt;), then I would say that a good working knowledge of evolutionary theory, though not a full understanding of all its nuances, should be a major goal. Again, evolution is the unifying principle of biology, and without grasping how it works, one cannot make sense of the history and current diversity of life on this planet. Most science majors will not go on to become professional evolutionary researchers, but many will become teachers, researchers in industry or government, consultants, doctors, politicians, or any of a wide range of careers in which a working knowledge of evolution is important. As I tell the students in my course when I discuss why they should work hard to understand evolution, if the goal is to have a scientifically literate public, who but the future teachers and other educated citizens can make that happen?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you mean “members of the public at large,” then I would say that at least a basic understanding of evolution is still important, if not for academic reasons then for pragmatic ones. Evolutionary knowledge informs decisions in medicine, agriculture, resource management, and many other areas. If, as I am sure most biologists feel, an understanding of evolution is important at all levels, then it is important that it be taught—and taught properly—from elementary school to graduate school. A population that recognizes the standing and relevance of evolutionary principles is one that will support this endeavor, whereas one that misunderstands or fears evolutionary biology will seek to undermine science education. There is an inevitable feedback loop in this regard, and effective education is the way to make it a positive one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How detailed an understanding of evolution do we need? It depends on who “we” are—but “very little” is not the answer in any case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-6277671409266710666?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/BCh8VaOppJ0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255012879317"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/docs_nurses_democratic_leaders.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1c56afda258714c5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Health"/><title type="html">Docs, Nurses, Democratic leadership cracks heads</title><published>2009-10-08T14:55:48Z</published><updated>2009-10-08T14:55:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/v3K76-LG7ms/docs_nurses_democratic_leaders.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/docs_nurses_democratic_leaders.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are the angry left.

&lt;div style="width:476px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/10/alex-ned-cowboys1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/10/alex-ned-cowboys1.jpg" alt="Photo/Jill Cornfield" width="466" height="480"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo/Jill Cornfield&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halloween, but mine don’t. Ned occasionally pipes up with a costume idea in July or wonders in September if it’s almost here, but he doesn’t stay on message for too long. And Alex, of course, ignores the whole thing until it’s time to dress up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a good thing we make our own costumes in this family, because I don’t think Alex (a boy who refuses to wear any trousers but khakis these days, who for about three years would wear any t-shirt as long as it was black) would be willing to put on some strange garment made of unfamiliar fabric. Our most successful costume was the year of the cowboy. Ned had become devoted to “Toy Story,” so a Woody costume was a natural. I liked it, because he looked so cute in jeans and a yellow plaid shirt that we had anyway. I made the vest out of white and black felt. Then we realized Alex could easily be a cowboy, too. (He was willing to wear jeans back then.) We even had a black vest to glue white patches onto — and Alex was willing to wear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few years Alex agreed to wear regular clothes with a bit of fiddling. He was a fireman (yellow raincoat slicker and red fireman hat). He was a skateboard dude (shorts and checkered Vans). He was a doctor (black pants, long white shirt). This year, though, I don’t think it’s going to be that easy. Maybe something like &lt;a href="http://www.zazzle.com/halloween_costume_t_shirt_for_children_with_autism-235174408655245142"&gt;this &lt;/a&gt;would work. My sister thinks it’s funny. I guess I sort of do, too. (Check Zazzle.com for other Halloween/autism-themed t-shirts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generally talk about Halloween for a few days beforehand, and how we’ll dress up and knock on neighbors’ doors (but NOT go into neighbors’ apartments). Alex doesn’t like candy, but he does love chocolate, and Halloween always nets some. So that’s another selling point. We discuss with Alex how we’ll dress up because it’s fun to pretend be something or someone unusual. Something that works with Alex is to put him in front of a full-length mirror so he can see how he looks when he’s in character. He enjoys this a lot, and I should remember to do this when it’s not Halloween, but I’d like him to wear something he doesn’t want to wear. Like a winter coat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Halloween talking points&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discuss in advance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we knock — say “trick-or-treat!” — we don’t go in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chocolate!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s fun to pretend we’re someone or something else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we’ll look in the mirror to see how we look in something unfamiliar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

He is smart, wise, funny, a great doctor, and he cares passionately about not just saving lives, but saving those of little kids: he’s a pediatrician who works at a pediatric intensive care unit in Denver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t use arguments from authority, but Joe walks the walk. He has a tremendous amount of experience dealing with children and their illnesses. And that’s why when he talks about why vaccines are so important, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVE8csrcRw"&gt;everyone should listen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think vaccines are an evil conspiracy, are designed to make us sick, are filled with toxins, are a bad thing, then spend 6 minutes and 53 seconds educating yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, heck, if that's the way it works, let's just get rid of the NIH and NSF altogether, and instead tell people to watch those nifty keen 'science' programs about UFOs and Bigfoot on the History Channel.

Steitz and Ada E. Yonath won the Nobel in chemistry for their work on the structure of the ribosome&lt;/a&gt;, and a well-deserved award it is. They (and many others) put a lot of work into puzzling out how this central feature of the cell works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, wouldn't you know it, there are always &lt;a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/prayerplainandsimple/2009/10/nobel-prize-in-chemistry-2009-deserves-praise-to-god.html"&gt;religious parasites around who want to coopt a scientific discovery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What strikes me today, however is that scientists who receive these honors win such praise for what they discover, not what they create. Through their cleverness, hard work, and remarkable brilliance, they have asked new questions and devised creative methods to unwrap hidden mysteries in the universe. But their success is detective work, not invention. This year's award for the explanation of how ribosomes work is notable and certainly deserved. But these scientists discovered wonder that was already there - put there by the Creator!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Our deeper delight today is the surprising and vivid new window this work has created for those of us who want to give honor and glory to God, our Maker. The work of these Nobel laureates is a profound act of worship to the One who thought up the very possibility of "LIFE" and is slowly but eagerly giving us the right and capacity to uncover His secrets. As we honor those who discovered and explained ribosomes, we also pause to praise and honor God the Creator of ribosomes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, we don&amp;#39;t. Your god did not create ribosomes — they evolved. Not only did your god not have anything to do with it, his priests and unthinking followers, like the wanking cheerleader at beliefnet who wrote that piece, made no contribution to our understanding of how life works, and in some cases either discouraged knowledge-seeking or drew away resources for their pan-handling churches that could have been used, for instance, to educate the poor and bring up a generation of smarter, more productive citizenry who might have helped broaden and deepen our understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice, too, how the fraud who wrote the piece also gives credit for the work of discovery to his god — as if he were &lt;i&gt;giving&lt;/i&gt; us the ability to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That freeloading moocher, that imaginary phantasm, deserves and gets no credit for anything. The bottom feeders of faith just want people to bestow their gratitude on the coffers of their churches, nothing more, and they will lie and steal credit for their personal benefit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/god_doesnt_get_a_nobel_because.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Qm36jWSVkuc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255009814338"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2033">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/953c96ea182af5ad</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><category term="autism"/><category term="Critical Thinking"/><category term="David and Goliath"/><category term="Harriet Hall"/><category term="Jenny McCarthy"/><category term="O-Magazine"/><category term="Oprah"/><category term="Popularity"/><category term="Promotion"/><category term="skepticism"/><category term="Vaccines"/><title type="html">David &amp;amp; Goliath: A Dramatic Role Reversal Spurred On By The Media</title><published>2009-10-08T13:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-08T13:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2033" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Internet is teeming with false health claims and a long line of celebrities willing to throw their media weight behind every new flavor of snake oil. The irony is that alternative medicine proponents see themselves as a persecuted minority – the victims of some nebulous health industry conspiracy. But in reality, they have ingratiated themselves with the media to such an extent that they may in fact have the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pseudoscience has become Goliath, and physicians have never faced a more pernicious foe. With patients’ lives hanging in the balance, some of us are waging the war for hearts and minds with gumption, zeal, and a little help from a brave minority of media who have finally woken up and realized that alternative medicine is not as soft and cuddly as they once thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take for example those who wrongly believe that vaccines cause autism. Many of them subject their children to unproven and harmful therapies, diets, and regimens – some of which are tantamount to child abuse. Consider the cases described most recently by David Gorski &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=510"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. One child underwent repeated IV chelation therapy for years followed by the invasive injection of “stem cells” into her cerebrospinal fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Huffington Post publishes some of the most bizarre and pseudoscientific medical advice on the Internet.  Some recommend &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthew-stein/when-a-super-bug-strikes_b_192543.html"&gt;ozonated water, blood electrification&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-evans/swine-flu-protect-yoursel_b_191550.html"&gt;deep cleansing enemas&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-frank-lipman/swine-flu-what-to-do_b_286245.html"&gt;garlic&lt;/a&gt; instead of vaccines to prevent H1N1 influenza. The challenge with interpreting some of these posts is that they blend unproven and potentially harmful treatments with reasonable diet and exercise advice. The average consumer has a hard time teasing out fact from fiction, all the while being influenced to doubt the safety and efficacy of tried and true medical treatments. I would argue that when a media outlet with an audience as large as the Huffington Post intentionally posts misleading and false health information – they become a public health threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a bit of good news. Some media outlets are beginning to tire of the fantastical claims of the snake oil community, and seem to be hungering for some objective truth.  Or at the very least, they finally seem to be seeking the scientific counter point to the celebrities and pitch men who pose as medical experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/200025"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/the_ap_shoots_and_scores_again.php"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/env/vital_signs/2009/07/30/huffington_post/"&gt;Salon&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/10/07/best-health-blogs-lifestyle-health-blogs-health-information.html"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt; have taken a more critical look at some of the misinformation being spread by Oprah, Jenny McCarthy, and the Huffington Post. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=934"&gt;One comedian commented&lt;/a&gt; on the media’s over-emphasis on alternative perspectives in medicine (supposedly for “balance” purposes) this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You never see the media using the ‘balance’ rule on hard science like physics. You never see them interviewing a guy from NASA about space stations, and then for balance they turn to a guy named Barry who believes that the sky is a carpet painted by God – Gary, what do you think of this space station plan?…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this same comedian hit on an interesting point about human nature. He also said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people would just as soon believe a relative about miraculous disease treatments. Like you’d rather believe your mum when she tells you she rubbed a cat on her face to make her headache go away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday I was explaining how frustrating the Goliath misinformation problem is to a business acquaintance. I told him that I was contributing to a blog called Science-Based Medicine in an effort to combat some of the medical quackery that is being promoted online. He looked at me and said I’d never be a success with that message. He said that people like Oprah and Mehmet Oz were successful because they “went with the flow” and gave people what they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people don’t want to think critically about things – they want to hear about miracle cures, self-help, and vitamins. They already have the media they ‘deserve.’ You’ll never appeal to a mass audience with your skeptical message.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I responded that maybe the critical thinking movement would never have as many followers as Oprah – just as NPR doesn’t have the reach of CNN. But NPR is a brand that appeals to a certain educated segment of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, if you want to be NPR then you better figure out how to aggregate your audience as successfully as possible,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I wonder how we can come together in a more organized way around our common desire to seek truth in medicine, using science to further our understanding of the human body? Can we help mainstream America to develop an appetite for critical thinking, or is that about as likely as getting folks to stop eating fast food? I’m not sure, but I’m proud of the few things we have accomplished by raising our concerned voices through our blogs – and hats off to Harriet Hall for being invited to write a regular column in O-Magazine to provide a 200 word counter point to the rest of the 100’s of pages of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May that little sling shot do some damage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall endeavour to post once a week here, I’ve already received plenty of questions, thank you to all those who’ve been Tweeting me – keep ‘em coming and I’ll pick the best one each week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week’s post was defiantly brought to you by the illustrious, the elusive, and the pertly-bottomed Abs…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/06/19/article-1027541-006E61850000044C-503_233x376.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear The Unfriendly Atheist,&lt;br&gt;
What do atheists scream during an orgasm?&lt;br&gt;
Regards,&lt;br&gt;
Abs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dearest Abs,&lt;br&gt;
This is indeed an important subject that must be approached delicately, and with great aplomb (and hopefully a bit of fun). Firstly, I’d like to point out that there are many different kinds of orgasm. I’m sure a delightful fornicator like yourself needs no clarification, but it’s worth knowing just in case you’re more of the “violent screaming” kind – though I wouldn’t presume to assert such things! One must think carefully about the kinds of words used when you fraternise with a lover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you are deflowering a young specimen, you may wish to use more sensitive language to begin with in order to let your lust evolve slowly; whereas if you are experimenting with a seasoned professional, it may be entirely appropriate to lay into the big kahunas like a hefty steamroller with extra juice. Extra love juice, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, when people had ethics, and they thought God was everywhere (even in your bum-hole), people used to shout something along the lines of “God, oh God!”, however, in these enlightened times, religious affirmation just has no place in the bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve put together a selection of alternatives, which I hope you will find useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Milkybars are on me!”&lt;br&gt;
“That’s Numberwang!”&lt;br&gt;
“They think it’s all over…” (And then they reply) “It is now!”&lt;br&gt;
 “What a prick!”&lt;br&gt;
“Thunderbirds are go!” [I actually prefer this during pre-rutting/foreplay but I am told it is effective post-violation as well]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, these are all catchy slogans from British television shows. My own research has shown that these are vastly more effective than the usual, and quite frankly, crass curse-words. If you are not familiar with British slogans, I pity you. There is a wonderful invention that any lay person can access online called “YouTube”, I firmly suggest you utilise it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do hope you find these useful, and perhaps you could come up with some of your own…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With fond regards,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Un-friendly Atheist&lt;/p&gt;

Is it because liberal ideals conform to my own sense of morals about how a just society should function?  According to some, that idea is laughably wrong.  Let me share with you an exchange from facebook:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt;  The michigan house passed the doctor tax. Time to write and call your state senator to remind them that taxing the person providing the service you need is really freakin' stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conservative friend:&lt;/strong&gt; You've gotta LOVE those Democrats in Lansing...just keep taxing and spending and taxing and spending....If this fucking thing passes the senate and governor, I think I'm getting the hell out of Dodge. In fact, I think all doctors in Michigan should STOP taking Medicaid, just out of protest.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Random dude who thinks he knows me: &lt;/strong&gt;If you voted Democrat, suck it up and pay the taxes. You deserve it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CF:&lt;/strong&gt; I agree! But what about the Republicans? Can we just opt NOT to pay the taxes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RDWTHKM:&lt;/strong&gt; I couldn't agree more. Taxes have become the ruination of our country. Unfortunately, too many people have too little common sense to understand how detrimental taxes are to our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CF: &lt;/strong&gt;And the worst part was last November, on the evening of the election, watching all of those sheep cheering in the streets because they get to pay higher taxes! It's like I could almost hear them shouting, "YEA! Obama won!! Now the government can take MORE of my hard-earned money and spend it frivolously on more useless entitlement programs! ... HOORAY!!!" ...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
RDWTHKM: &lt;/strong&gt;I'll never understand how anyone voted for Obama. He was not Bush; and I think that is all that mattered to those voters. Common sense dicates you don't vote for someone with as many skeletons in his closet as Obama. You can call him a socialist, a big government radical, an anti-war demagogue, either way, he is bad for America, bad for liberty, bad for freedom and most certainly bad for the unalienable right of the pursuit of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; And every time he smiles, Baby Jesus weeps. I also heard that he sacrifices goats in the Roosevelt Room. Prove that its not true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CF:&lt;/strong&gt; And that, my friends, sums up why a liberal is a liberal. They fear that all things conservative equal a vote for baby Jesus and those evil evangelicals. So, they'd rather pay a few extra thousand (or tens of thousands) per year in entitlements to keep that Jesus-y stuff out of the White House...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RDWTHKM:&lt;/strong&gt; I've come to realize that because doctors require so much schooling, their liberal professors have way too much time to indoctrinate them into the false premises of Liberalism. I'm still hopeful that these unbelievably intelligent people will forget that thier professors are kooks, and someday will wise up to the ways of the world. Just because you can heal a broken arm doesn't mean you know how to heal a broken economy. Taxes are for fools. Any by the way, when you resort to Baby Jesus and the Roosevelt room, its usually a strong indication that your rhetoric is more powerful than your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does one even start with this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/liberals_are_stupid_conservati.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/liberals_are_stupid_conservati.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/R-gTksp8IzQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1255006944027"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=3283">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e38dfd6d715bb66e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Eugenie’s Book: Plastic Fantastic</title><published>2009-10-08T12:31:56Z</published><updated>2009-10-08T12:31:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/10/08/eugenies-book-plastic-fantastic/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0230224679?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0230224679"&gt;&lt;img title="PlasticFantastic" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2009/10/PlasticFantastic-198x300.jpg" alt="PlasticFantastic" width="116" height="177"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Following her &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/10/05/cut-that-crane/"&gt;first guest post&lt;/a&gt; about some funny business with government photos, a lot of commenters asked Eugenie Reich to write about the topic in which she specializes, scientific fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

Buono&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; took place in the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some background to the case: In the 1930s, the Veterans of Foreign Wars put up a cross in the Mojave National Preserve in California as a war memorial.  No other religious group is allowed to put up symbols in the area.  Ten years ago, a former employee of the National Park Service, &lt;strong&gt;Frank Buono&lt;/strong&gt;, sued, saying this was a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/us/08scotus.html"&gt;violation of the establishment clause&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In the intervening decade, Congress and the courts have engaged in a legal tug of war. Congress passed measures forbidding removal of the cross, designating it as a national memorial and, finally, ordering the land under the cross to be transferred to private hands. Federal courts in California have insisted that the cross may not be displayed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secular Student Alliance (along with several other members of the Secular Coalition for America) signed onto an &lt;a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/08-472_RespondentAmCu6ReligiousFreedomOrgs.pdf"&gt;Amicus Brief in this case&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).  We support Mr. Buono.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man who wrote that brief is &lt;strong&gt;Bob Ritter&lt;/strong&gt;, Legal Coordinator of the Appignani Humanist Legal Center.  He notes &lt;a href="http://americanhumanist.org/news/details/2009-10-humanists-weigh-in-on-supreme-court-case-salazar-v-bu"&gt;the importance of this case&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“A ruling either way is likely to have profound implications,” said Ritter. “A ruling in Buono’s favor will likely lead to the removal of some religious symbols on public property throughout America, while a ruling against Buono may close the court house doors to others who seek to challenge Establishment Clause violations.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/opinion/07wed1.html?_r=1"&gt;on our side as well&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
On the merits, the appeals court was right that the cross must come down. By allowing a Christian cross, and not symbols of other faiths, on federal land, the government was favoring one religion over others. Also, Congress has designated the cross as a national memorial, which means that it continues to have official government endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also sends a message that state and church are intertwined. A single cross does not, by itself, mean America has an established religion, but if the Supreme Court stops caring that the government is promoting a particular religion, we will be down the path toward having one.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Supreme Court on our side?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise that Justice &lt;strong&gt;Antonin Scalia&lt;/strong&gt; is not.  He doesn’t even believe the cross is a symbol of Christianity.  This was a &lt;a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-472.pdf"&gt;portion of his exchange&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) with ACLU attorney &lt;strong&gt;Peter Eliasberg&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MR. ELIASBERG&lt;/strong&gt;: … I think it would be very odd indeed for the VFW to feel that it was free to take down the cross and put up, for example, a statues of a soldier which would honor all of the people who fought for America in World War I, not just Christians, and say: Well, we were free to do that because even though there’s the sign that says, this cross is designated to honor all the — &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUSTICE SCALIA&lt;/strong&gt;: The cross doesn’t honor non-Christians who fought in the war? Is that — is that — &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MR. ELIASBERG&lt;/strong&gt;: I believe that’s actually correct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUSTICE SCALIA&lt;/strong&gt;: Where does it say that? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MR. ELIASBERG&lt;/strong&gt;: It doesn’t say that, but a cross is the predominant symbol of Christianity and it signifies that Jesus is the son of God and died to redeem mankind for our sins, and I believe that’s why the Jewish war veterans — &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUSTICE SCALIA&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s erected as a war memorial. I assume it is erected in honor of all of the war dead. It’s the — the cross is the — is the most common symbol of — of — of the resting place of the dead, and it doesn’t seem to me — what would you have them erect? A cross — some conglomerate of a cross, a Star of David, and you know, a Moslem half moon and star? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MR. ELIASBERG&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, Justice Scalia, if I may go to your first point. The cross is the most common symbol of the resting place of Christians. I have been in Jewish cemeteries. There is never a cross on a tombstone of a Jew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Laughter&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MR. ELIASBERG&lt;/strong&gt;: So it is the most common symbol to honor Christians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUSTICE SCALIA&lt;/strong&gt;: I don’t think you can leap from that to the conclusion that the only war dead that that cross honors are the Christian war dead. I think that’s an outrageous conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MR. ELIASBERG&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, my — the point of my — point here is to say that there is a reason the Jewish war veterans came in and said we don’t feel honored by this cross. This cross can’t honor us because it is a religious symbol of another religion.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this transcript, the case may not even be decided on religious grounds.  &lt;strong&gt;Rob Boston&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://blog.au.org/2009/10/07/a-cross-the-great-divide-justices-seem-split-on-calif-religious-symbol-case/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… In fact, there was surprisingly little talk about whether the presence of the cross in the middle of a federal preserve amounts to an unconstitutional “establishment” of religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, several of the justices veered off into a discussion over a land swap Congress mandated in an effort to keep the cross up. In an effort to save the cross, Congress passed a special law declaring the cross a national memorial and transferring ownership of the land to a private group, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). There was a lot of talk about how that action affected a court injunction ordering that the cross be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it’s possible the high court could decide this case on narrow technical grounds and perhaps even kick it back to a lower court.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a chance all of this could be moot, too.  Buono could lose the case on standing — similar to Michael Newdow’s “Under God” case — in which case the merits of why the cross should come down (or not) would not be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

As I wrote yesterday, they happily shift around their multiple goalposts as long as they have some working hypothesis about how vaccines are to blame for autism or some human suffering. They have moved from MMR to thimerosal to aluminum to “toxins” to squalene and now the HepB vaccine. They just spin the wheel and choose their next target – although they never really abandon their prior targets, they just back burner them a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have their small dedicated group of researchers, like the father and son team of Geier and Geier, to produce crappy studies to support their anti-vaccine claims. Andrew Wakefield, who has been rightly vilified for starting the MMR scare with his now discredited Lancet study, has also apparently decided to make a career out of feeding bad studies to the anti-vaccinationists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge there is a certain symmetry to the situation now. The scientific community presents studies that show a lack of correlation between some aspect of vaccines and autism or other neurological disorders. They generally accept these studies as supporting vaccine safety, even while being open about their limitations. They also sharply criticize those studies that suggest there may be a connection between vaccines and autism as fatally flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the anti-vaccine community rejects and dismisses all studies that show vaccine safety, while uncritically accepting any study that can be used to argue for vaccine toxicity. To the outside observer this can all seem like a he-said, she-said situation. And of course, that’s the point. To create the public appearance of a legitimate controversy, knowing that much of the public will take the position that they think is erring on the side of caution (really fear). Fear is easier to promote than reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing happened with regard to tobacco and lung cancer (although in the other direction) – while the science was showing a link, the tobacco industry did everything they could to cast doubt on these conclusions, hoping to muddy the waters and confuse the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to sort the situation, the only option is to actually look at each study as objectively as possible – the answer is in the details of the analysis of each study. This is a daunting task for any individual, let alone someone who is not a medical scientist, and so generally the public will simply decide which side is more credible and listen to them. This is precisely why the anti-vaccine movement spends so much time attacking the credibility of anyone who disagrees with their hysteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest round is over a recent monkey study that was designed by none other than Andrew Wakefield and others with an anti-vaccine agenda. For me, that fact alone calls the study into serious questions – Wakefield is still under a cloud of accused fraud over his original Lancet study (which in any case is a discredited study). Fraud in scientific research, in my opinion, is not something you can get past. It disqualifies you for future research. The integrity of the scientific literature is just too important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if we put Wakefield’s involvement aside, the study attempting to link the HepB vaccine to neurological delay in monkeys, is a terrible study. David Gorski has already done a detailed analysis at &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1989"&gt;Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, so I will not repeat it, just read his post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main points is the hypocrisy of the anti-vaccine crowd. Age of Autism wrote a glowing review of the monkey study, dismissing any suggestion that conflict of interest may have affected the outcome of the study. Meanwhile, they use even the slightest appearance of a COI to dismiss any study which does not support a link between vaccines and autism, and yet they ignore the massive actual COIs in this study. Wakefield was paid vast sums of money by trial lawyers to find a link between MMR and autism. That’s OK with AoA, who will dismiss a study simply because it was funded by the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COIs aside, the study has major flaws. They found a delay in the appearance of neurological milestones in monkeys who had been given the HepB vaccine compared to placebo. However, the numbers in the study were very small, and not balanced – there were only 13 monkeys in the vaccine group, four receiving saline injection, and three getting no injection. Further, the authors assume without justification that the milestones they are assessing are a meaningful marker of ultimate neurological development in monkeys, let alone humans.This is exacerbated by the fact that the monkeys were followed for only two weeks. (As far as we know – it is quite possible we are being fed a small subset of the actual data, as David Gorski explains).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David brings up many more dire concerns about this study, such as the fact that monkeys were assigned to groups on a “semi-random” basis. What? Semi-random sounds an awful lot like non-random, which (given the small numbers) could produce just about any result you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, this is a terrible and suspect study that tells us nothing about the association of vaccines and autism. It’s only purpose is to give another round of press coverage to anti-vaccine propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="http://sciencebasedmedicine.org/reference/vaccines-and-autism/"&gt;evidence overwhelmingly supports &lt;/a&gt;the conclusion that vaccines are safe, there is no real increase in autism incidence, and vaccines do not cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;

What else can explain the fact that they publish stuff as news that I know to be false? They even claim that stuff I do on a regular basis as part of my job as a school lab technician never actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/school_league_tables/article6861136.ece"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, the claim that interesting science experiments no longer happen in school laboratories because of misplaced health and safety fears:-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fear of burns, spillages and volatile reactions means that even mundane procedures such as distillation are often viewed online rather than performed in the laboratory. Professor John Holman, the Government’s chief adviser on science in schools, and Professor David Phillips, incoming president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, told The Times that it was vital for pupils to learn how to handle hazardous substances and to experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first sentence in the above paragraph is a fabrication. Distillation is done in the lab not viewed online at the school where I work and I have never heard of any school that does things differently. The Times does not place it in quotes which suggests that no-one other than Joanna Sugden, the writer of the article, has used those exact words but note how it is immediately followed by naming Professor John Holman and Professor David Phillips and so implying it is they who have said it. Note to self. Find contact details for the Professors and ask them what they actually said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Holman, who is also director of the National Science Learning Centre, said trainee teachers spent too little time preparing exciting practicals. “There is much less practical work now because of a huge focus on exams,” he said. “Schools are so aware of health and safety — they will say, ‘That’s too dangerous’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own experience is that there is not less practical work. However I am aware that a sample size of 1 does not tell a great deal about the state of science education in the country as a whole. It is a pity Professor Holman does not supply any evidence at all for his assertion. And this from the Director of the National Science Learning Centre &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the Government Chief Advisor on Science in Schools too. The statement that "schools are so aware of health and safety — they will say, ‘That’s too dangerous.'", is, I am afraid to say, excrement of the mail bovine. First, I do not see the problem with being aware of health and safety issues. Second, schools will rarely, if ever, say "that's too dangerous" - they will say "Have you done a risk assessment and have you provided adequate personal protective equipment?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article then gives us some experiments the writer thinks are going to disappear:-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Experiments at risk &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonium dichromate volcano Make a pile of ammonium dichromate and set the tip alight using a magnesium fuse. The result is a tiny volcano, complete with ash, steam and nitrogen gas &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thermite reaction Mix metal powder with metal-oxide to create thermite and set it alight. The mix will burn at an exceptionally high temperature &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potassium in water The classic school experiment. Drop potassium into water and it reacts violently, making hydrogen, which then ignites in a small fireball"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never set up the first of the above three but the other two are regulars in our department. I have never had any indications from CLEAPSS (the school science safety advisory service) that there is any suggestion that these experiments be banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers still devise their own demonstrations too. Our head of chemistry has come up with an excellent one that presumably does not happen in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;'s parallel universe. A small candle is placed in a copper calorimeter and heated over a bunsen burner. The wax melts and starts burning. You then tape a small beaker to the end of a metre rule, half fill it with water then, holding the other end of the metre rule, tip the water into the burning wax. The result is a jet of flame that reaches the ceiling. An excelent demonstration as to why trying to put out chip-pan fires with water is a really bad idea. Figuring out what has happened is a good excercise for the students, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left a comment on the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article on Tuesday evening saying briefly that school science still includes interesting experiments and perhaps they should talk to people who work in science education before they publish stories such as this. Strangely, it has not yet appeared. They have allowed plenty of comments slagging off Labour/Liberals/bureaucrats/socialists however and saying how terrible excessive regulation is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this excessive regulation of school science is a figment of the Murdoch Empire&amp;#39;s imagination but it fits into the meme of &amp;quot;Health &amp;amp; Safety gone mad&amp;quot; which is so beloved by the Tories. By convincing the electorate that health and safety regulations are far more restrictive than is actually the case and they will be more accepting in cuts in real safety legislation on the grounds of &amp;quot;making a bonfire of red tape&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;allowing Britain to be competitive&amp;quot;. Light touch regulation of the finance sector for competitive reasons used to be a mantra too. Need I remind you how well that turned out?&lt;/p&gt;

These are not fluorescing under a UV lamp - they really do glow in the dark, giving them the most beautiful name in mycology: &lt;em&gt;Mycena luxaeterna&lt;/em&gt;, meaning "eternal light". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/091005-glowing-mushrooms.html"&gt;&lt;img alt="shroom.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/shroom.jpg" width="500" height="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Live Science says:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Three quarters of glowing mushrooms, including the newly identified species, belong to the Mycena genus, a group of mushrooms that feed off and decompose organic matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"What interests us is that within Mycena, the luminescent species come from 16 different lineages, which suggests that luminescence evolved at a single point and some species later lost the ability to glow," Desjardin said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He and other scientists still have many questions about such glow-in-the-dark fungi, including how and why they light up. They know the luminescent process is similar to that of glowing bacteria and other luminescent organisms. For instance, the glowing involves a luciferin-luciferase mediated reaction that emits light in the presence of water and oxygen. But they are not sure of the exact chemical compounds involved in the reaction. &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/10/glow_in_the_dark_mushrooms.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254998566322"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/10/incredible_photos_from_nikons.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/42a5640f8090ce90</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Incredible photos from Nikon’s Small World contest</title><published>2009-10-08T04:37:12Z</published><updated>2009-10-08T04:37:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/10/incredible_photos_from_nikons.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pdnphotooftheday.com/2009/10/2252"&gt;&lt;img alt="smallworld.png" src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/smallworld.png" width="500" height="585"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pdnphotooftheday.com/2009/10/2252"&gt;PDN Photo of the Day&lt;/a&gt; website says:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Here we present ten of the finalists from Nikon's 35th Annual Small World Photomicrography Competition, which recognizes photographs shot through a microscope.

What else can explain the fact that they publish stuff as news that I know to be false? They even claim that stuff I do on a regular basis as part of my job as a school lab technician never actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/school_league_tables/article6861136.ece"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, the claim that interesting science experiments no longer happen in school laboratories because of misplaced health and safety fears:-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fear of burns, spillages and volatile reactions means that even mundane procedures such as distillation are often viewed online rather than performed in the laboratory. Professor John Holman, the Government’s chief adviser on science in schools, and Professor David Phillips, incoming president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, told The Times that it was vital for pupils to learn how to handle hazardous substances and to experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first sentence in the above paragraph is a fabrication. Distillation is done in the lab not viewed online at the school where I work and I have never heard of any school that does things differently. The Times does not place it in quotes which suggests that no-one other than Joanna Sugden, the writer of the article, has used those exact words but note how it is immediately followed by naming Professor John Holman and Professor David Phillips and so implying it is they who have said it. Note to self. Find contact details for the Professors and ask them what they actually said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Holman, who is also director of the National Science Learning Centre, said trainee teachers spent too little time preparing exciting practicals. “There is much less practical work now because of a huge focus on exams,” he said. “Schools are so aware of health and safety — they will say, ‘That’s too dangerous’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own experience is that there is not less practical work. However I am aware that a sample size of 1 does not tell a great deal about the state of science education in the country as a whole. It is a pity Professor Holman does not supply any evidence at all for his assertion. And this from the Director of the National Science Learning Centre &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the Government Chief Advisor on Science in Schools too. The statement that "schools are so aware of health and safety — they will say, ‘That’s too dangerous.'", is, I am afraid to say, excrement of the mail bovine. First, I do not see the problem with being aware of health and safety issues. Second, schools will rarely, if ever, say "that's too dangerous" - they will say "Have you done a risk assessment and have you provided adequate personal protective equipment?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article then gives us some experiments the writer thinks are going to disappear:-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Experiments at risk &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonium dichromate volcano Make a pile of ammonium dichromate and set the tip alight using a magnesium fuse. The result is a tiny volcano, complete with ash, steam and nitrogen gas &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thermite reaction Mix metal powder with metal-oxide to create thermite and set it alight. The mix will burn at an exceptionally high temperature &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potassium in water The classic school experiment. Drop potassium into water and it reacts violently, making hydrogen, which then ignites in a small fireball"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never set up the first of the above three but the other two are regulars in our department. I have never had any indications from CLEAPSS (the school science safety advisory service) that there is any suggestion that these experiments be banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers still devise their own demonstrations too. Our head of chemistry has come up with an excellent one that presumably does not happen in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;'s parallel universe. A small candle is placed in a copper calorimeter and heated over a bunsen burner. The wax melts and starts burning. You then tape a small beaker to the end of a metre rule, half fill it with water then, holding the other end of the metre rule, tip the water into the burning wax. The result is a jet of flame that reaches the ceiling. An excelent demonstration as to why trying to put out chip-pan fires with water is a really bad idea. Figuring out what has happened is a good excercise for the students, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left a comment on the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article on Tuesday evening saying briefly that school science still includes interesting experiments and perhaps they should talk to people who work in science education before they publish stories such as this. Strangely, it has not yet appeared. They have allowed plenty of comments slagging off Labour/Liberals/bureaucrats/socialists however and saying how terrible excessive regulation is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this excessive regulation of school science is a figment of the Murdoch Empire&amp;#39;s imagination but it fits into the meme of &amp;quot;Health &amp;amp; Safety gone mad&amp;quot; which is so beloved by the Tories. By convincing the electorate that health and safety regulations are far more restrictive than is actually the case and they will be more accepting in cuts in real safety legislation on the grounds of &amp;quot;making a bonfire of red tape&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;allowing Britain to be competitive&amp;quot;. Light touch regulation of the finance sector for competitive reasons used to be a mantra too. Need I remind you how well that turned out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From: The Real Food Channel &amp;lt;&lt;a href="mailto:newsletter@therealfoodchannel.com"&gt;newsletter@therealfoodchannel.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
Subject: The shocking truth about dairy&lt;br&gt;
Date: Thursday, October 1, 2009, 11:59 AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John McDougall MD routinely reverses and cures serious diseases like diabetes and heart disease simply by helping his patients change their diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well there’s certainly no news in the fact that poor dietary habits can contribute to obesity, diabetes, and some forms of heart disease. No doctor would dispute basic health information like that. But “routinely reverses and cures serious diseases”? Red flags begin waving.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his experience, the most important thing to remove from your diet is dairy foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really? And is there any correlation between dairy and heart disease? Dairy and diabetes? Sounds like this author paints Dr. McDougall as being a little blinded by his own luminance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I realize that a lot of people are not going to want to hear this, but the science is overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got to love “A lot of people are not going to want to hear this.” He’s being suppressed for bucking the official establishment. Too bad this kind of rhetoric is so effective on unsuspecting readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the science is overwhelming! Well, if this guy says so, it must be true. But I wonder how he has come to this conclusion, since McDougall has not managed to convince any meaningful percentage of the medical community that outrageous claims are anything other than quackery. This total failure constitutes “overwhelming science”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scary thing is that advertising dollars from the milk and cheese industry keeps this simple information from getting to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ahhh,&lt;/em&gt; so it’s all a conspiracy. That puts it into a whole new light of plausibility. I know that my doctor receives his share of Big Milk dollars every month, and he’s always telling my kids and I to drink it. The bastard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want a simple thing you can do to significantly improve your health, take the time to watch this important video.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t post an email like this unless it was obviously bunk. I searched the literature, and found that the preponderance of research supports…ummm… exactly the &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; of what McCartthy is attributing to Dr. McDougall. Here’s from &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15883237?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_RVAbstractPlus"&gt;a 2005 study&lt;/a&gt; published in the Archives of Internal Medicine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each serving-per-day increase in total dairy intake was associated with a 9% lower risk for type 2 diabetes… CONCLUSION: Dietary patterns characterized by higher dairy intake, especially low-fat dairy intake, may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCartthy’s “overwhelming science” – 0; real science – 1. I could go on, but there are useful things to do in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is this “The Real Food Channel” anyway? No, it’s not a food channel, surprisingly enough. It’s a nearly blank web site slathered in advertising links, and its only content is videos promoting quackery with titles such as &lt;em&gt;Make Yourself Heart Attack Proof.&lt;/em&gt; As far as I can tell, these videos appear to all be pirated from other sources, not created by McCartthy himself. Click any of the links, and you’re sent off to some site selling quack health products: Supplements, books, superfruits, you name it; all promising to endow you with some kind of magical super-health. In short, it’s an affiliate marketing site, making money off of tricking you into buying worthless woo.

Will, one more time&lt;/a&gt;", I noted that Will complained about the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;…   egregious cliches sprinkled around by the tin-eared employees in the  White House speechwriting shop. The president told the Olympic  committee that: "&lt;em&gt;At this defining moment&lt;/em&gt;," a moment "&lt;em&gt;when the fate of each nation is inextricably linked to the fate of all nations&lt;/em&gt;" in "&lt;em&gt;this ever-shrinking world&lt;/em&gt;," he aspires to "&lt;em&gt;forge new partnerships with the nations and the peoples of the world&lt;/em&gt;." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While admitting that "I don't have a program ready to hand for measuring cliche-density, much less cliche egregiosity  ", I nevertheless offered the opinion that "in speeches prepared for ceremonial occasions like this one, the cliche density of presidential rhetoric has been fairly constant for decades if not centuries".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still don't have a metric for cliche-density, but we can learn something by exploring the site &lt;a href="http://www.presidentialrhetoric.com/"&gt;http://www.presidentialrhetoric.com/&lt;/a&gt; for certain fixed phrases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, there's no question that "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;q=%22defining+moment%22+site:http://www.presidentialrhetoric.com/&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;defining moment&lt;/a&gt;" is a defining phrase for Barack Obama, who has used it ten  times in texts indexed on that site. The only other president who has ever used it (in texts indexed there, anyhow) is, interestingly, George W. Bush, who used it once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for that "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;q="&gt;ever-shrinking world&lt;/a&gt;", Obama has used this phrase once before the Olympic pitch, and no other president (or presidential speech-writer) has ever done so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no other president has apparently ever aspired in so many words to "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;as_q=&amp;amp;as_epq=forge+new+partnerships&amp;amp;as_oq=&amp;amp;as_eq=&amp;amp;num=10&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;as_filetype=&amp;amp;ft=i&amp;amp;as_sitesearch=www.presidentialrhetoric.com&amp;amp;as_qdr=all&amp;amp;as_rights=&amp;amp;as_occt=any&amp;amp;cr=&amp;amp;as_nlo=&amp;amp;as_nhi=&amp;amp;safe=images"&gt;forge new partnerships&lt;/a&gt;". But George W. Bush ("&lt;a href="http://www.presidentialrhetoric.com/speeches/08.07.08.html"&gt;America and China: Address in Thailand&lt;/a&gt;", 8/7/2008) promised to "&lt;strong&gt;forge new relationships&lt;/strong&gt; with countries that share our values". In fact, that phrase came from a sentence notably dense in the high-sounding abstract phrases that George Will seems to dislike so much in Barack Obama's speech:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;America has pursued four broad goals in the region: reinvigorate our alliances, forge new relationships with countries that share our values, seize new opportunities for prosperity and growth, and confront shared challenges together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, presidents Bush and Obama are the two only presidents to voice the aspiration to "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;q=%22confront+*+challenges%22+site:www.presidentialrhetoric.com&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;confront * challenges&lt;/a&gt;": Obama three times, and Bush four times. Many other presidents have confronted challenges, but only these two have used those words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even more than confronting challenges, George W. Bush was fond of (talking about) &lt;em&gt;confronting problems&lt;/em&gt;: the string "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;q=%22confront+problems%22+site:http://www.presidentialrhetoric.com/&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;confront problems&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; occurs 36 times in his texts, and — amazingly — not once in the texts of any other American president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GW Bush was also fond of (talking about) seizing things: "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;as_q=&amp;amp;as_epq=seize+new+opportunities&amp;amp;as_oq=&amp;amp;as_eq=&amp;amp;num=10&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;as_filetype=&amp;amp;ft=i&amp;amp;as_sitesearch=http://www.presidentialrhetoric.com/&amp;amp;as_qdr=all&amp;amp;as_rights=&amp;amp;as_occt=any&amp;amp;cr=&amp;amp;as_nlo=&amp;amp;as_nhi=&amp;amp;safe=images"&gt;seize new opportunities&lt;/a&gt;" (W 2, no others), "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;q="&gt;seize this|that opportunity&lt;/a&gt;" (W 2, Gore 1, no others), "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;q=%22seize+opportunities%22+site:http://www.presidentialrhetoric.com/&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;seize opportunities&lt;/a&gt;" (W 2, Clinton 2, no others) "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;q="&gt;seize this moment&lt;/a&gt;" (W 3, Kerry 1, no others), "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;q=%22seize+the+moment%22+site:http://www.presidentialrhetoric.com/&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;seize the moment&lt;/a&gt;" (W 4, no others), "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;q=%22seizing+this+moment%22+site:http://www.presidentialrhetoric.com/&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;seizing this moment&lt;/a&gt;" (W 1, no others), "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;q=%22seize+the+initiative%22+site:http://www.presidentialrhetoric.com/&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;seize the initiative&lt;/a&gt;" (W 1, no others), "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;q=%22seize+control%22+site:http://www.presidentialrhetoric.com/&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;seize control&lt;/a&gt;" (W 4, Carter 1, no others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, such phrases often seem to be associated with particular time periods and with particular presidents. Thus James Munroe and Andrew Jackson were each "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;as_q=&amp;amp;as_epq=deeply+impressed&amp;amp;as_oq=&amp;amp;as_eq=&amp;amp;num=10&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;as_filetype=&amp;amp;ft=i&amp;amp;as_sitesearch=www.presidentialrhetoric.com&amp;amp;as_qdr=all&amp;amp;as_rights=&amp;amp;as_occt=any&amp;amp;cr=&amp;amp;as_nlo=&amp;amp;as_nhi=&amp;amp;safe=images"&gt;deeply impressed&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; three times, and James Polk and Martin van Buren once each. The only other presidents to have been &amp;quot;deeply impressed&amp;quot; were — again — that unlikely pair George W. Bush and Barack Obama, once each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to run a collocation-detection algorithm over the whole collection of presidential speeches. This might give something approximating a cliche-density metric (though really there should be some normalization relative to usage patterns in the wider world). But the eigenstructure of the president-by-cliche matrix might tell us whether Barack and W are really rhetorical brothers beneath the skin, and reveal other hidden (or at least amusing) affinities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254992426466"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/clock_quotes_437.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2fd81f27508fe1fc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-10-08T09:12:18Z</published><updated>2009-10-08T09:12:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/_TkKki68TJ0/clock_quotes_437.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/clock_quotes_437.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The great man is the man who does a thing for the first time. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Using Illumina sequencing a group in British Columbia sequenced both the genome and transcriptome of a metastatic lobular (estrogen receptor positive) breast cancer.  Furthermore, they searched a sample of the original tumor for mutations found in the genome+transcriptome screen in order to identify those that may have been present early vs. those which were acquired later.From the combined genome sequence and RNA-Seq data they found 1456 non-synonymous changes which was then trimmed to 1178 after removing pseudogenes and HLA sequences.  1120 of these could be re-assayed by Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons from both normal DNA and the metastatic samples -- 437 of these were confirmed.  Most of these (405) were found in the normal sample.  Of the 32 remaining, 2 were found only in the RNA-Seq data, a point to be addressed later below.  Strikingly, none of the mutated genes were found in the previous whole-exome sequencing (by PCR+Sanger) of breast cancer, though those samples were of a different subtype (estrogen receptor negative).There are a bunch of cool tidbits in the paper, which I&amp;#39;m sure I won&amp;#39;t give full justice to here but I&amp;#39;ll do my best.  For example, several other papers using RNA-Seq on solid cancers have identified fusion proteins, but in this paper none of the fusion genes suggested by the original sequencing came through their validation process.  Most of the coding regions with non-synonymous mutations have not been seen to be mutated before in breast cancer, though ERBB2 (HER2, the target of Herceptin) is in the list along with PALB2, a gene which when mutated predisposes individuals to several cancers (and is also associated with BRCA2).  The algorithm (SNVMix) used for SNP identification &amp;amp; frequency estimation is a good example of an easter egg, a supplementary item that could easily be its own paper.One great little story is HAUS3.  This was found to have a truncating stop codon mutation and the data suggests that the mutation is homozygous (but at normal copy number) in the tumor.  A further screen of 192 additional breast cancers (112 lobular and 80 ductal) for several of the mutations found no copies of the same hits seen in this sample, but two more truncating mutations in HAUS3 were found (along with 3 more variations in ERBB2 within the kinase domain, a hotspot for cancer mutations).  HAUS3 is particularly interesting because until about a year ago it was just C4orf15, an anonymous ORF on chromosome 15.  Several papers have recently described a complex (&amp;quot;augmin&amp;quot;) which plays a role in genome stability, and HAUS3 is a component of this complex.  This starts smelling like a tumor suppressor (truncating mutations seen repeatedly; truncating mutation homozygous in tumor; protein in function often crippled in cancer), and I&amp;#39;ll bet HAUS3 will be showing up in some functional studies in the not too distant future.Resequencing of the primary tumor was performed using amplicons targeting the mutations found in the metastatic tumor.  These amplicons were small enough to be spanned directly by paired-end Illumina reads, obviating the need for library construction (a trick which has shown up in some other papers).  By using Illumina sequencing for this step, the frequency of the mutation in the sample could be estimated.  It is also worth noting that the primary tumor sample was a Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded slide, a way to preserve histology which is notoriously harsh on biomolecules and prone to sequencing artifacts. Appropriate precautions were made, such as sequencing two different PCR amplifications from two different DNA extractions.  The sequencing of the primary tumor suggests that only 10 of the mutations were present there, with only 4 of these showing a frequency consistent with being present in the primary clone and the others probably being minor components.  This is another important filter to suggest which genes are candidates for being involved in early tumorigenesis and which are more likely late players (or simply passengers).One more cool bit I parked above: the 2 variants seen only in the RNA-Seq library.  This suggested RNA editing and also consistent with this an RNA editase (ADAR) was found to be highly represented in the RNA-Seq data.  Two genes (COG3 and SRP9) showed high frequency editing.  RNA editing is beginning to be recognized as a widespread phenomenon in mammals (e.g. the nice work by Jin Billy Li in the Church lab); the possibility that cancers can hijack this for nefarious purposes should be an interesting avenue to explore.  COG3 is a Golgi protein &amp;amp; links of the Golgi to cancer are starting to be teased out.  SRP9 is part of the signal recognition particle involved in protein translocation into the ER -- which of course feeds the Golgi.  Quite possibly this is coincidental, but it certainly rates investigating.One final thought: the next year will probably be filled with a lot of similar papers.  Cancer genomics is gearing up in a huge way, with Wash U alone planning 150 genomes well before a year from now.  It seems unlikely that those 150 genomes will end up as 150 distinct papers and more so it will be a challenge to do the level of follow-up in this paper on such a grand scale.  A real challenge to the experimental community -- and the funding establishment -- is converting the tantalizing observations which will come pouring out of these studies into validated biological findings.  With a little luck, biotech &amp;amp; pharma companies (such as my employer) will be able to convert those findings into new clinical options for doctors and patients.  Sohrab P. Shah, Ryan D.

I don't regard danglers as grammatical mistakes; that is, I think the syntax of English does not block them.  Yet I do think they constitute mistakes, in a broader sense, so in a way I am with the prescriptivists on this one.  A dangler is an error in a domain that I have compared (for want of a better way to put it) to courtesy or manners. I regard danglers as minor offenses against communicational etiquette, but not against grammar.  The argument against danglers being grammar errors is simple: they are too common in even careful published writing, and come too fluently to the keyboards of even excellent writers, and are accepted without remark by too many educated readers.  If you ask what evidence there is that, for example, verbs come before objects in English, the answer is that it is overwhelmingly clear from just about all of everybody's usage just about all the time, and from the blank "What's gone wrong with you?" reactions if you try putting the object before the verb. The evidence on danglers goes entirely the other way.  Here, for example, is an example in the carefully edited prose of &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt; (October 3rd, 2009, p. 79): &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt; A report to the British House of Commons this year highlighted the case of an elderly British citizen called Derek Bond, who was arrested, at gunpoint, in February 2003 while on holiday in South Africa.  After being held for three weeks, it turned out that the American extradition request was based on a fraudster who had stolen Mr Bond's identity. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only relevant thing the syntax says, I believe, is that subjectless non-finite clauses, and preposition phrases having such clauses as complement of the preposition, and predicative constituents such as adjective phrases, may be used as adjuncts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And all the semantics says is that the target of predication in such cases is filled in by reference to a grammatically salient noun phrase (NP) in the immediate vicinity.  That's it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider in this light the task of interpreting the second sentence in the quotation above.  After what?  Somebody being held for three weeks.  Who was held?  We&amp;#39;re guessing thus far, so let&amp;#39;s wait and see what the subject of the matrix clause is…  Hmm, the pronoun &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;.  That's not very promising: what non-human could have been held?  Let's go on.  &lt;i&gt;It turned out that&lt;/i&gt;…  This makes it clear that the &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; was a dummy — a meaningless placeholder in a context where a complement clause is in extraposition (postponed till the end of the clause containing it).  Well, what&amp;#39;s the subject of the clause in extraposition?  &lt;i&gt;The American extradition request&lt;/i&gt;.  But surely that is not what was held.  Let's go on. &lt;i&gt;Was based on a fraudster&lt;/i&gt;…  Could the target of predication be &lt;i&gt;a fraudster&lt;/i&gt;?  No, that makes no sense.  Any other NPs?  Well, there is one more (though we're down to NPs that could hardly be called grammatically salient now): the object of &lt;i&gt;stolen&lt;/i&gt;, namely, &lt;i&gt;Mr Bond's identity&lt;/i&gt;.  But that doesn't make sense either: this isn't about the South Africans holding the man's identity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute, though: if we look &lt;b&gt;inside&lt;/b&gt; that NP we see that its determiner is the genitive NP &lt;i&gt;Mr Bond's&lt;/i&gt;.  Perhaps the thing to do is to ignore the genitive case on that and try &lt;i&gt;Mr Bond&lt;/i&gt; as the target of predication.  After Mr Bond had been held for three weeks. Yes, that would make sense.  We'd better assume that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get there.  But what a struggle.  Floundering around for what could be as much as an extra second, which in language processing is a very long time, there were four different false leads planted in the text for us to pursue — four NPs that were not the right choice for the target of predication we needed to plug together with the &lt;i&gt;being held&lt;/i&gt; clause.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that if we had looked back at the previous sentence instead of plowing on we would have noticed that there was an indefinite NP, &lt;i&gt;an elderly British citizen called Derek Bond&lt;/i&gt;, which was a prime candidate.  If we had happened to be still holding onto that, and we had tried plugging in a definite version of that ("the aforesaid elderly British citizen called Derek Bond"), it would have worked like a charm.  But that NP was embedded in a larger one (&lt;i&gt;the case of an elderly British citizen called Derek Bond&lt;/i&gt;), and following it we had read four other NPs (&lt;i&gt;gunpoint&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;February 2003&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;holiday&lt;/i&gt;; and &lt;i&gt;South Africa&lt;/i&gt;.  Any syntactic salience that NP might have had was lost before we began the next sentence.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearers and readers can't be expected hold onto every NP they run across, keeping all of them live and active in short-term syntactic memory just in case perhaps one of them might be suddenly needed to make a subjectless clause adjunct interpretable.  That's not how we work, or so it seems to me. Mostly we expect the sentences we encounter to be parsable independently: take any one of them on its own and you should be able to understand it down to the level where all that remains is assigning antecedents to pronouns and filling in gaps due to ellipsis.  And that second sentence does not meet the condition.  We had to fumble around and look all over the place to find a target of predication for the subjectless clause in the initial PP.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a shortcoming on the part of the writer.  Not a disastrous blunder or a major display of ignorance; just a minor discourtesy to the reader. That's what I think danglers are.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they are extraordinarily common, and they occur now and then even in what is in general terms excellent writing.  The more sensitive to syntax you are, the more you will be struck by them and incommoded by them. The more you exercise your common sense rather than your syntactic sense when figuring out what a subjectless non-finite clause adjunct must mean, the less you will notice them.  But they will be out there, in everything you read (somewhat less frequently in conversation because of its lower syntactic complexity — we don&amp;#39;t use non-finite clause adjuncts so much when chatting about who&amp;#39;s going to pick up the milk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just for fun (but not out of a lack of courtesy) I embedded a deliberate dangler in the paragraphs above.  Now you will know how careful a reader you are.  If you didn't notice it, that underlines my point that you probably do not  operate by a set of syntactical rules that forbid danglers.  And if you did notice it, and experienced that odd extra second of squirming around looking for a target of predication, then you'll know what I've been talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

It’s starting to become a reoccurring theme. Shortly after &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/08/14/self-magazine-shamelessly-rationalizes-contributing-to-womens-body-image-problems/"&gt;blogging about &lt;em&gt;Self&lt;/em&gt; Magazine’s admission&lt;/a&gt; that they more or less completely reshaped the woman on the cover of their magazine with Photoshop, I had blogged last month about &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/09/08/glamour-magazine-shows-real-women/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glamour&lt;/em&gt; Magazine’s choice to display an un-airbrushed image of plus-sized model Lizzie Miller in their pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now because of the overwhelmingly positive response the Lizzie Miller photo got, &lt;a href="http://www.glamour.com/health-fitness/2009/10/these-bodies-are-beautiful-at-every-size"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glamour&lt;/em&gt; Magazine has brought Miller back for a group photo with numerous other plus-sized models&lt;/a&gt; to prove that beauty doesn’t require being a size zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com"&gt;Watch CBS News Videos Online&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of you sent me this &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=5369949n"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. It's to a video (above) of Sharyl Attkisson, CBS News' resident anti-vaccine propagandist, putting on a nauseating display of sucking up to Andrew Wakefield over his recent monkey study, the one that I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/some_monkey_business_in_autism_research_1.php"&gt;deconstructed yesterday&lt;/a&gt; to show it for the lousy science that it is. Attkisson is a true believer. She's done this sort of thing before, occasionally to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/antivaccination_crankery_on_the_cbs_news_1.php"&gt;unintentionally hilarious effect&lt;/a&gt;; she's especially enamored of writing &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/more_execrable_journalism_about_vaccines.php"&gt;hit pieces on Paul Offit&lt;/a&gt;. Even worse, Attkisson is in bed with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/sharyl_attkisson_of_cbs_and_generation_r.php"&gt;Generation Rescue and Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;, apparently feeding information to AoA when it suits her. Personally, I view her as nothing more than a fellow traveler with Age of Autism; for all intents and purposes, she might as well blog for Generation Rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll leave it to you, my readers, to pick apart the inanities contained in the video above. I'm more interested in countering it. So, please, &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/feedback/fb_news_form.shtml?tag=ftr"&gt;use this page&lt;/a&gt; and complain about this to CBS. I know, I know, if CBS has tolerated Attkisson's anti-vaccine propaganda for this long, it's unlikely that her bosses will fire her now, but it's important to let CBS know just how misguided she is.&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/some_monkey_business_in_autism_research_1.php"&gt; Tell 'em Orac sent you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/complain_to_cbs_cbs_resident_anti-vaccin.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/kXXR5BUyl88" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254979256477"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/?p=2843">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a2ff2c2df2eb6bbd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Academia"/><category term="Science and Society"/><title type="html">The next Hawking</title><published>2009-10-08T05:17:58Z</published><updated>2009-10-08T05:17:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/10/07/the-next-hawking/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This past weekend, without much fanfare, Stephen Hawking stepped down as &lt;a href="http://www.lucasianchair.org/"&gt;Lucasian Professor of Mathematik&lt;/a&gt; at Cambridge. This is probably the most famous “chair” in all academe, and Hawking has sat in it for the past three decades. The position is 346 years old, and has been occupied by such luminaries as Dirac, Stokes, and most impressively, Sir Isaac Newton himself.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary reason for Hawking’s resignation is apparently not his recent &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/04/20/stephen-hawking-hospitalized/trackback/"&gt;health travails&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, it is customary for the Lucasian Professor to retire at the age of 67. And not even Hawking messes with centuries of tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question now: who will follow in Hawking’s footsteps?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>daniel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254976255462"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/how_religion_started.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e840112478e5c88e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">How Religion Started</title><published>2009-10-08T05:12:22Z</published><updated>2009-10-08T05:12:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/bVGMQgvrjGc/how_religion_started.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/how_religion_started.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/WIIknwATn-U%26rel%3D0%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/how_religion_started.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/bVGMQgvrjGc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254976255461"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/happy_blogoversary_laelaps.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c79582ce556de141</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Birthdays"/><title type="html">Happy Blogoversary Laelaps!!!!!</title><published>2009-10-08T05:00:01Z</published><updated>2009-10-08T05:00:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/uq0XBUzOcY0/happy_blogoversary_laelaps.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/happy_blogoversary_laelaps.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yes, Laelaps on Scienceblogs Dot Com is two years old today!

Specifically, I’ve noticed that the mavens of pseudoscience that make up the movement seem to have turned their sights with a vengeance on the Hepatitis B vaccine. The reason for this new tactic, I believe, is fairly obvious. The fact that the Hep B vaccine is administered shortly after birth seems somehow to enrage the anti-vaccine movement more than just about any other vaccine. Moreover, given that, aside from maternal-child transmission when the mother is infected, hepatitis B is usually only contracted through either bloodborne contact (the sharing of needles, the administration of contaminated blood) or sexual activity, it’s very easy for anti-vaccinationists to make a superficially plausible-sounding argument that it’s not a necessary vaccine, even though there are &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=289"&gt;reasonable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=512"&gt;rationales&lt;/a&gt; for giving it to infants. The image of sticking a needle into a newborn infant trumps that, though, at least for the anti-vaccine movement. Another possibility, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2024"&gt;suggested by Steve Novella just yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, is that, with the collapse under a overwhelmingly huge pile of evidence of the idea that the mercury-containing preservative thimerosal that used to be used in childhood vaccines until 2001, caused an “epidemic” of autism and the failure of the “too many too soon” slogan to convince anyone who is not already an anti-vaccinationist, the movement needed a new bogeyman to blame for autism. The hepatitis B vaccine, which was added to the pediatric vaccination schedule in the 1990s, around the right time to confuse correlation with causation when it comes to the increase in autism diagnoses (just like thimerosal) was a perfect next target, given that it’s administered shortly after birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, just the other day, the anti-vaccine crank groups the &lt;a href="http://www.nvic.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.talkaboutcuringautism.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Talk About Curing Autism (TACA)&lt;/a&gt;, and the anti-vaccine crank blog &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/advocacy-groups-ask-president-obama-to-order-suspension-of-hepatitis-b-vaccine-birth-dose.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt; posted a call for the elimination of hepatitis B vaccination for newborns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington, DC – National Vaccine Information Center and Talk About Curing Autism are calling on President Obama to order the immediate suspension of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation of the birth dose of the Hepatitis B vaccine after two recent studies linking the Hepatitis B vaccine to functional brain damage in U.S. male newborns and infant primates.  In a related development today, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, including the Health Resources and Services Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  announced that 1 in every 91 children are now diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder as reported in the November 2009 issue of Pediatrics. Previous data released by the CDC indicated a prevalence of 1 in every 150 children affected by the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how AoA not-so-subtly interposed the latest information about autism prevalence with its call to eliminate the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. Very clever. By doing so, it linked the two in readers’ minds, as if one had something to do with the other. There’s no good scientific evidence that the hepatitis B vaccine has anything to do with the “autism epidemic.” Meanwhile, David Kirby is up to his &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/new-study-hepatitis-b-vac_b_289288.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;usual nonsense&lt;/a&gt;, and the resident anti-vaccine propagandist at CBS News, Sharyl Attkisson, who has been known to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/sharyl_attkisson_of_cbs_and_generation_r.php"&gt;feed Age of Autism information on at least one occasion in the past&lt;/a&gt;, served up this credulous, noncritical interview with Andrew Wakefield:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com"&gt;Watch CBS News Videos Online&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quantity of misinformation in that single six minute video is far beyond the scope of this article. Were I to start dissecting it, I would not have time to do what the purpose of this article was intended to do: To deal with the study Wakefield is hawking. That’s why I leave the dissection of this &lt;em&gt;pièce de résistance&lt;/em&gt; of disingenuousness and misinformation as an exercise for SBM readers–after reading the rest of this post, of course. Trust me, it will help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this latest propaganda onslaught by the anti-vaccine movement are two studies, one a restrospective study in humans and the other a study in monkeys, both of which the anti-vaccine movement is promoting as slam dunk evidence that the hepatitis B vaccine is causing all sorts of horrific problems. Taking both of them on in one post is too much, even for my logorrheic tendencies. So I’ll deal first with Wakefield’s monkey study and then, either later this week or sometime next week, hopefully discuss the human study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I start with the monkey study is because, so confident are the anti-vaccinationists of the study that they’ve placed the accepted &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtfulhouse.org/pr/delayed-acquisition-reflexes-newborn-primates-thimerosal-containing-hep-b-vaccine.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;manuscript on the Thoughtful House website&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.thoughtfulhouse.org/pr/hep-b-study.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). The study has also been posted on the anti-vaccine blog &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/birth-dose-hepatitis-b-vaccine-study.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.rescuepost.com/files/hewitson-et-al-09-primate-hbv-study.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). That means that you can read it for yourself. (Thanks, &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtfulhouse.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Thoughtful House&lt;/a&gt;! You made my work much easier!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield’s study is entitled &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6W81-4XC57CT-1&amp;amp;_user=10&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=10&amp;amp;md5=163a9340a2cb2e9c65b170e058dc21b1"&gt;Delayed Acquisition of Neonatal Reflexes in newborn Primates receiving A Thimerosal-containing Hepatitis B Vaccine: Influence of gestational age and Birth weight&lt;/a&gt;. It was performed and written by a cast of characters that we’ve met before, including the crank who launched thousands of cases of MMR in the U.K. through his shoddy science, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=384"&gt;being in the pocket of trial lawyers&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly even &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=370"&gt;scientific fraud&lt;/a&gt;. Then there’s also Laura Hewitson. We’ve seen her before as the author of a couple of abstracts that I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=100"&gt;dissected in gory detail last year&lt;/a&gt;. Suffice it to say that, not only was the science shoddy, but massive conflicts of interest were not disclosed. The only difference this time around is that the conflicts of interest were disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, let’s look at the conflicts of interest first, using the statement straight from the manuscript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to 2005, CS and AJW acted as paid experts in MMR-related litigation on behalf of the plaintiff.	LH has a child who is a petitioner in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. For this reason, LH was not involved in any data collection or statistical analyses to preclude the possibility of a perceived conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard for me not to retort that LH (Laura Hewitson) is the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;first author of the paper&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;! She &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;designed and coordinated the study&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, as the manuscript itself states here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;LH and AJW designed the study but were not involved in data collection and statistical analysis. LH was also responsible for coordinating all aspects of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One wonders how a researcher can be “responsible for coordinating all aspects of the study” if that researcher is not involved in data collection and analysis, one does. Hewitson is also the corresponding author, which presumably means that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;she wrote the manuscript&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, or most of the manuscript. Contrary to &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/09/blockbuster-primate-study-shows-significant-harm-from-one-birth-dose-of-a-mercurycontaining-vaccine.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Blaxill’s hilariously disingenuous claim&lt;/a&gt;, there is not just the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;appearance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of a conflict of interest; there &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; a conflict of interest, a massive conflict of interest. The same is the case with Andrew Wakefield, who not only was &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr-lancet.htm"&gt;in pocket of trial lawyers&lt;/a&gt; when he did the work that led to his infamous 1998 &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper that started the MMR scare in the U.K. but was recently revealed to have almost certainly &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/solved/solved.htm"&gt;falsified dat&lt;/a&gt;a. Wakefield, of all people, has a lot to gain if there were any work that supported his belief that vaccines cause autism. In fact, if I were to use the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=451"&gt;same criteria that Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt; did when it automatically labeled any study with any pharmaceutical company underwriting whatsoever as hopelessly biased in its &lt;a href="http://www.fourteenstudies.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fourteen Studies&lt;/a&gt; website, I could stop right here and dismiss Wakefield’s current monkey study as so hopelessly the result of a conflict of interest that I don’t even need to analyze it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, unlike the anti-vaccine propagandists responsible for &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.fourteenstudies.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fourteen Studies&lt;/a&gt;, that’s not how I roll. I did, however, have a hearty laugh at &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/09/blockbuster-primate-study-shows-significant-harm-from-one-birth-dose-of-a-mercurycontaining-vaccine.html" rel="nofollow&amp;quot;"&gt;AoA’s attempt&lt;/a&gt; to justify the blatant conflict of interest thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One likely tactic of critics of the study will include attempts to nullify the evidence based on the alleged bias of those involved. For one, the study is privately funded and acknowledges some well known autism advocates as financial contributors. These include the Johnson family (Jane Johnson is co-author of &lt;em&gt;Changing the Course of Autism&lt;/em&gt;, a member of the Board of Directors of &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtfulhouse.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Thoughtful House&lt;/a&gt; and Director of &lt;a href="http://www.defeatautismnow.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Defeat Autism Now!&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://www.safeminds.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;SafeMinds&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.autism.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Autism Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; and Elizabeth Birt. Although all of these groups make clear their research interest is vaccine safety, they are frequently attacked for being “anti-vaccine”, an epithet that will almost certainly be hurled again here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the shoe fits…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, &lt;a href="http://thoughtfulhouse.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Thoughtful House&lt;/a&gt; is the place where Andrew Wakefield &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1222"&gt;plies his pseudoscience on autistic children&lt;/a&gt;; Defeat Autism Now! is a cesspit of autism pseudoscience and quackery largely based on the discredited idea that vaccines cause autism, as are the &lt;a href="http://www.autism.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Autism Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.safeminds.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;SafeMinds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more amusing was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most aggressive attacks, however, will likely be reserved for the study authors. The basis of these attacks is best anticipated by the following conflict of interest disclosure in the published paper. “Prior to 2005, [Carol Stott] and [Andrew Wakefield] acted as paid experts in MMR-related litigation on behalf of the plaintiff. [Laura Hewitson] has a child who is a petitioner in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. For this reason, [Hewitson] was not involved in any data collection or statistical analyses to preclude the possibility of a perceived conflict of interest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t the hypocrisy breathtaking? To me, it’s truly astounding! The anti-vaccine movement in general and AoA in particular go out of their way to attack &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; investigator who does a vaccine study that fails to find a link between vaccines and autism or other neurodevelopmental outcomes. Inevitably, they use any hint of research funding, past or present, by pharmaceutical companies to paint the investigators as hopelessly biased. They relentlessly attack, for example, Paul Offit as the Dark Lord of Vaccination–Satan Incarnate with syringes!–because he invented an effective vaccine and made money selling it to a pharmaceutical company (along with his university, it should be added). In &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=451"&gt;Fourteen Studies&lt;/a&gt;, AoA and Generation Rescue slimed every investigator who received a penny of money from a pharmaceutical company. In fact, Generation Rescue defined conflicts of interest this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We considered a scientist employed by a vaccine maker or a study sponsored by a vaccine maker to have the highest degree of conflict, with a public health organization (like the CDC) to be the second-worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on some of the things that &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1222"&gt;Generation Rescue said&lt;/a&gt; about those “Fourteen Studies,” it also appeared to define the mere fact of being funded through grants from the CDC, NIH, American Academy of Pediatrics, or even the Canadian Institutes for Health Research as being a hopeless conflict of interest. Scientists who have had NIH grants (such as myself) or grants from any of these other organizations know just how ridiculous considering that particular funding source to be a horrific conflict of interest is. The bottom line is obvious. It’s a conflict of interest only if Generation Rescue says it is. Accepting funding from a pharmaceutical company? It’s a conflict of interest. No doubt about it. Real researchers would define it so. But there’s more to a conflict of interest than just where one’s research funding comes from or what companies one might work for. Not to Mark Blaxill. To Mark Blaxill and the Age of Autism, being one of the complainants in the Autism Omnibus and being funded by organizations whose purpose is to demonstrate that vaccines somehow cause autism and other neurodevelopmental problems poses no problems with regards to being a conflict of interest. None at all. Neither is Andrew Wakefield’s history of being in the pocket of trial lawyers at the time he did his “research” (and I do use the term loosely) that led to his infamous 1998 &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s not only a non-issue, it’s a sign of virtue to have accepted funds from anti-vaccine groups like SafeMinds. That’s because anti-vaccine advocates like Blaxill see themselves on the side of angels and think that they could never, &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; have their objectivity affected by the funding source, having an autistic child, or being part of any legal action seeking compensation for “vaccine injury,” which, by the way, would definitely be helped by apparent scientific evidence showing that vaccines can cause autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. One notes that one of the things the previous monkey study published as an abstract by Hewitson and Wakefield &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=100"&gt;got dinged for&lt;/a&gt; in the blogosphere was that no conflicts of interest were reported. Poor Mark seems really peeved at the criticism Hewitson justly received for that little ethical lapse last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the study. The first thing I always try to figure out whenever reading any study is a simple question: What is the hypothesis being tested? A good study explicitly states its hypotheses in no uncertain terms. Not this one. This is the closest I could find to the study hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we examine, in a prospective, controlled, observer-blinded study, the development of neonatal reflexes in infant rhesus macaques after a single dose of Th-containing HB vaccine given within 24 hours of birth, following the US childhood immunization schedule (1991-1999). The rhesus macaque is used in preclinical vaccine neurotoxicity testing and displays complex early	neurobehavioral and developmental processes that are well characterized (reviewed by [7]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, to anyone who’s been involved in dealing with the anti-vaccine movement, one thing that’s very clear is that the subtext behind this is the unsinkable rubber duck of a belief among the anti-vaccine movement that, somehow, someway, either vaccines or mercury in vaccines causes autism. An inconvenient fact is that there has been no thimerosal in early childhood vaccines other than the flu vaccine since late 2001, but that doesn’t stop the anti-vaccine movement. I suspect that the reviewers of this article were probably blissfully ignorant of this context and concentrated solely on the methodology. Had they known, no doubt they would have asked some uncomfortable questions in their reviews. Of course, they would have no way of knowing that this study is in fact more of a propaganda tool than anything else. One thing that needs to be emphasized is that there really is no good primate model of autism, at least not that I’m aware of. That’s why Hewitson and Wakefield resorted to looking at infant reflexes, even though it’s not even clear whether these reflexes are in the least bit relevant to humans. Several readers have informed me that the primitive reflexes studied by Wakefield and Hewitson in this study are present at birth in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another question that needs to be asked. Why did the investigators look at &lt;em&gt;thimerosal&lt;/em&gt;-containing hepatitis B vaccination? There’s no thimerosal in the hepatitis B vaccine anymore and hasn’t been since 2001. In fact, if you read the methods section of the paper, you’ll see that Hewitson &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;added&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; thimerosal to Recombivax HB (Merck) in order to recreate that thimerosal feeling from the 1990s. Why on earth would they do something like that? Especially since the authors state in the conclusion that the study design “was not able to determine whether it was the vaccine per se, the exposure to thimerosal, or a combination of both, that caused these effects”? I will suggest a possible reason before the end of this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get to the effects Wakefield and Hewitson supposedly observed, let’s just consider something else. When I read this study, there was something that set my skeptical antennae twitching fiercely. Remember the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=100"&gt;abstracts I discussed&lt;/a&gt; last year?  Let’s take a trip down memory lane and read what I wrote back then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What first leaps to mind in looking at the study is that there are 13 monkeys in the “vaccine” group and only three in the control group. No explanation is given for why there are such unequal numbers. Similarly, there is no mention of how the monkeys were assigned to one group or the other (randomization, anyone?), whether the experimenters were blinded to experimental group and which shots were vaccine or placebo, whether the monkeys were weight- and age-matched, or any of a number of other controls that careful researchers would do. Right off the bat, from the small numbers (particularly with only three monkeys in the control group), I can say that the study almost certainly doesn’t have the statistical power to find much of anything with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s look at how many monkeys in this study: Thirteen receiving the hepatitis B vaccine plus added thimerosal. Doesn’t that seem rather–shall we say?–&lt;em&gt;coincidental&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;convenient&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, even? There were also three animals receiving no injection and four receiving a saline placebo. Sound familiar? It should. There were three controls receiving no injection and four receiving saline placebo. Why do I bring this up? Remember, the abstract from last year described the monkeys as undergoing the “entire vaccination schedule” (actually, a version of the entire U.S. vaccination schedule, with the vaccination doses moved closer together to try to make the times the monkeys received various vaccines supposedly equivalent to the same physiological and developmental age when humans receive the same vaccines in the vaccination schedule). The inevitable consequence of this, of course, is that the monkeys received a lot of vaccines in a much shorter time period than human babies do. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=100"&gt;Remember&lt;/a&gt; how, as a result, the results of these abstracts were were portrayed as showing that vaccinated monkeys “exhibited autism-like symptoms”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first research project to examine effects of the total vaccine load received by children in the 1990s has found autism-like signs and symptoms in infant monkeys vaccinated the same way. The study’s principal investigator, Laura Hewitson from the University of Pittsburgh, reports developmental delays, behavior problems and brain changes in macaque monkeys that mimic “certain neurological abnormalities of autism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are being reported Friday and Saturday at a major international autism conference in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although couched in scientific language, Hewitson’s findings are explosive. They suggest, for the first time, that our closest animal cousins develop characteristics of autism when subjected to the same immunizations – such as the MMR shot — and vaccine formulations – such as the mercury preservative thimerosal — that American children received when autism diagnoses exploded in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it just me, or does this latest study strike you as being merely a subset of a study that’s already done? Given the similarity of the description of the study described in the manuscript, in which hepatitis B vaccine was even spiked with thimerosal in order to mimick the vaccine schedule of the 1990s (given that hepatitis B vaccine no longer containes thimerosal) and the previously reported abstract, in which the entire vaccine schedule of the 1990s was supposedly mimicked, it does make me wonder. Could it be that the results being reported derived from observations made on the same monkeys used to generate the IMFAR results? In other words, could it be that the investigators gave the monkeys the hepatitis B vaccine after birth, tested their various reflexes early in their lives (only for the first 14 days), and then continued with their “simulated” vaccination schedule in order to produce the rest of the observations reported last year? Inquiring minds want to know! After all, the current study only goes out for two weeks; it would be easy to continue the rest of the simulated vaccination schedule after that and then make measurements on the same monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one wonders if, stung by the criticisms of inadequate controls, the investigators added additional controls and kept the same group of 13 monkeys as the “vaccinated group.” Maybe they didn’t, but the similarity between the numbers of monkeys used in the studies described in the IMFAR abstracts last year and the numbers of monkeys used in this study sure do raise an eyebrow, don’t they? So does this part of the methods section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animals were allocated to either the vaccinated (exposed) or saline/no injection (unexposed) groups 19 on a semi-random basis in order to complete peer groups for later social testing [7] such that each 20 peer group contained animals from either the unexposed or exposed study groups. Once a new peer 21 group was started, new animals were assigned to this group until it consisted of 3 or 4 infants, the 22 ages of which were less than 4 weeks apart from their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was: What’s with this “semi-random basis” stuff? Why not on a &lt;em&gt;random&lt;/em&gt; basis? Being a little bit “not random” is like being a little bit pregnant, if you know what I mean. In other words, when investigators start adding nonrandom selection to a protocol, it’s not random anymore. That much should be obvious. And when the selection of animals is no longer random, then that calls the whole study into question. It sounds to me as though Hewitson and Wakefield designed the experiment (or let the experiment unfold) so that all members of a given peer group received the same treatment; i.e., they all got Th-HepB (HepB vaccine with thimerosal added), they all got saline, or they all got no injection. If so, that’s certainly consistent with my speculation that there were some animals added at the end of the experiment. If my interpretation (i.e., that more animals were added later as controls), it strikes me as odd. Why on earth would Hewitson and Wakefield choose that design? Why not include at least one saline or no-injection animal in each peer group? With the apparent design for this experiment, there’s no way to discriminate between possible vaccine-related effects and uncontrolled time-related confounders, given that some monkeys under this design must have been analyzed in a noncontemporaneous fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions of why there are two control groups and why the randomization scheme was such that each member of a peer group got the same treatment becomes especially suspicious to me because in their analyses, Hewitson and Wakefield pool the four monkeys receiving the saline control with the three receiving no injection for purposes of calculating means. Could it be that the investigators simply added a few monkeys after the experiment had already been started (or even after the original 16 monkeys had already undergone the entire “vaccination schedule”)? Again, inquiring minds want to know! Could it be that, in order to beef up their apparent statistical power to detect differences in these various reflexes, some additional monkeys had to be added? Or was this done in response to reviewers’ concerns? If that’s the case, then when were these additional monkeys studied? How long after the original group? Mark Blaxill brags that the person who measured the monkeys’ reflexes was trained by an expert until her results had a high concordance with those of experts, but if there were a several month delay between when she measured the first group of monkeys and then the additional controls, it’s not too hard to imagine that she got better and thus more able to detect subtle differences in the reflexes. If conditions under which the monkeys were raised change, then the same sort of time-dependent confounders could be at work here. I’d really like to see when each monkey was born and what the time to criterion was for each monkey. In other words, I’d like to see at least some of the raw data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The similarities between the designs of the studies described in the IMFAR abstracts last year and this study sure make me wonder if perhaps Hewitson and Wakefield are perhaps “minimizing” the use of animals. Of course, minimizing the use of animals, particularly primates, in research is normally a good thing, but if that’s what they’re doing, why not report the entire study? After all, in the video above, Wakefield admits that this study is part of an ongoing study of the “vaccine schedule.” However, if you go back to look at the IMFAR abstracts that I discussed last year, you’ll see that it was stated that the monkeys were killed between 12-15 months and tissues examined at necropsy. In other words, Hewitson and Wakefield were done with those animals over a year ago! Given that, why not just report the whole study instead of this little piece of it, which must have been done at least two or three years ago? Are they planning on having data from this study come out in little dribs and drabs. In other words, are they planning on publishing several papers, each consisting of what we call an “MPU” or “minimal publishable unit,” derived from part of the same study?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the case, in this particular MPU, what did Hewitson and Wakefield find? Not much, actually, the triumphant crowing of Mark Blaxill at AoA notwithstanding. Basically, Hewitson and Wakefield reported that three of thirteen infant reflexes were delayed in their appearance. Specifically the root reflex was delayed by one day; the suck reflex by nearly two days, and the snout reflex, also by nearly two days. Because they mixed thimerosal into the hepatitis B vaccine and didn’t have a control group with thimerosal-free hepatitis B vaccine, Hewitson and Wakefield couldn’t even hazard a guess whether the effects observed, even if significant, were due to the vaccine or the thimerosal or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also appeared to be a confounding factor in that monkeys with lower gestational age (GA). For example, the authors state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general,as GA increased animals reached criterion earlier whereas animals of lower GA were relatively delayed. This effect was only significant when exposure was taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really have to wonder whether in a larger group of completely unvaccinated  monkeys the correlation between the delay in appearance of these reflexes with decreased gestational age would reach significance, no hepatitis B vaccination necessary. The authors try to spin their results as suggesting that lower GA monkeys are more susceptible to whatever effect it is they think they’re seeing due to Th-HepB, but their arguments are not very convincing–about as convincing as their data, actually, as in not very. In addition, given such small numbers, I always wonder about the validity of carrying out any sort of multivariate analysis. Another point to consider, in this paper these reflexes are ranked from 0 (absent) to 3 (the highest possible score). The time to criterion was defined as the time to reach the highest possible score. Again, given the small numbers and the correlation between gestational age and reaching these milestones, I really have to question whether the results in this study, despite being apparently statistically significant if you pool the two control groups, are really behaviorally or biologically significant. If there’s one thing my mentors always taught me, it’s that statistically significant doesn’t necessarily mean &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;significant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This is particularly true, since it is not reported whether these delays are prolonged or whether the baby monkeys recover. Finally, there is the question of whether the authors bothered to correct for multiple comparisons. Whenever a large number of comparisons are made, by random chance alone the odds of seeing a “positive” or a correlation between a marker and what is being studied increases. The problem is that, the larger the number of comparisons, the larger the chance that any “hit” observed is a false positive. In the case of multiple comparisons, a statistical adjustment needs to be made to correct for the effect of multiple comparisons. In other words, if the authors didn’t correct for multiple comparisons, it’s quite possible–likely, even–that their observed “positives” are in fact false positives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m not all that impressed. One reason is that, even if the study shows what the authors claim it shows, so what? Wakefield and Hewitson haven’t shown evidence of long-lasting neurological impact, and they certainly haven’t shown any evidence that the hepatitis B vaccine causes autism, even though you know that’s the subtext of what they are arguing. Moreover, the numbers are really small. I look at monkey studies in much the same way that I look at clinical trials. If a study is worth doing prospectively, it’s worth doing with enough subjects at the outset to provide sufficient power to guarantee that there is a high likelihood that the question being asked will be answered. If an investigator can’t provide enough subjects, then he shouldn’t do the study&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Another reason I have a problem with this study is that no statistical justification is given for pooling the no vaccine group with the saline placebo group. Whenever I see pooling of groups like this, I become very suspicious of a &lt;em&gt;post hoc&lt;/em&gt; combining of data, which is always dicey. Indeed, a good rule of thumb is that it’s usually at least a little bit questionable to combine groups like this for purposes of statistical analysis unless this pooling was part of the study design from the beginning, in which case it is still somewhat dicey but not as bad. Presumably the reason why two control groups were used was to determine if simply the pain of giving a saline injection may have had any affects on the time to criterion for these neurodevelopmental parameters. That’s a scientifically legitimate reason to have two control groups (although one certainly does wonder why they didn’t have a control group receiving thimerosal-free hepatitis B vaccine). But, again, it really makes me wonder whether the investigators pooled the data, apparently &lt;em&gt;post hoc&lt;/em&gt;. The only reason to do such a &lt;em&gt;post hoc&lt;/em&gt; pooling is to convert three groups to two groups and to add statistical power to the control group. You can be quite confident that, had there been a statistically significant difference between the “vaccinated” group and the saline placebo group and between the “vaccinated” group and the uninjected group, Hewitson and Wakefield would not have pooled the data. In fact, I almost guarantee it. After all, why do something that will lead to scientists questioning the validity of your study’s statistical analysis if you don’t have to? In the case that there were in fact statistically significant differences between each of the control groups compared to the “vaccinated” group, you can be quite certain that the results would have been reported–shall we say?–unmassaged by the pooling of the two control groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also rather instructive to look at the original &lt;a href="http://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2008/webprogram/Paper3028.html"&gt;IMFAR abstract&lt;/a&gt;, which reported:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan-Meier survival analyses revealed significant differences between exposed and unexposed animals, with delayed acquisition of root, suck, clasp hand, and clasp foot reflexes. Interaction models examined possible relationships between time-to-acquisition of reflexes, exposure, [3C]DPN binding, and volume. Statistically significant interactions between exposure and time-to-acquisition of reflex on overall levels of binding at T1 and T2 were observed for all 18 reflexes. For all but one (snout), this involved a mean increase in time-to-acquisition of the reflex for exposed animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to note that they looked at 18 reflexes then but only reported 13 now. Why did they drop five between then and now? There were more “significant” differences in time to criterion in the “old” study described in the IMFAR abstract, and only two of the reflexes appeared to be consistent between the two studies. Again, I have to ask: Is the experiment reported in this paper a true repeat of the studies in the IMFAR abstracts, or is it simply an “extended” version of the prior study? I think you know which one I suspect. In fact, Wakefield all but admitted it in the interview in the video above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think that this study was a horrible waste of primates, and I can’t believe the University of Pittsburgh’s &lt;a href="http://www.iacuc.org"&gt;IACUC&lt;/a&gt; was thinking when it approved this study. Maybe it’s because, as Mark Blaxill was so happy to inform us, the University of Pittsburgh primate facility is relatively new, and Pitt’s IACUC was not experienced in evaluating primate protocols at the time these experiments were being proposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, on a different note, I wonder about the ostensible justification for this study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Th[imerosal]-containing vaccines, including the neonatal HB vaccine, continue to be used routinely in developing countries [3], continued safety testing is important, particularly for premature and low-birth-weight neonates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the authors are so concerned with vaccine reactions and autism in developing countries, then &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;why on earth did they try to mimic the U.S. vaccination schedule?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Why did they use monovalent hepatitis B vaccine, when few countries other than the U.S. do? Most developing countries use a tetravalent, pentavalent, or &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/immunization/policy/pentavalent_hexavalent.pdf"&gt;hexavalent vaccine containing multiple other antigens&lt;/a&gt;, such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, IPV, Hib, and HepB antigens. The hepatitis B vaccine, if given at all, usually isn’t given until at least six weeks of age as part of existing vaccine programs. So, when you come right down to it, this study isn’t even studying what it claims to be looking at or following the rationale that its authors claim as the reason for the study! If it were, it would not be following the U.S. vaccination schedule. In reality, it looks very much as though this study is custom-designed to sow doubt and fear about the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;in the United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. That, and it’s almost certainly going to be used as ammunition for legal action and lawsuits. Just wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also may be another objective here. I note that anti-vaccine groups like TACA funded this study, which certainly cost &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; $100,000 to do, most likely considerably more than that. Anti-vaccine groups would not have invested so much money if they didn’t expect a payoff. Here’s what I think might be going on. Like all good denialists, anti-vaccine groups and their toady scientists (like Wakefield) want material to sow doubt about the science they deny, in this case, the safety and efficacy of childhood vaccines. Small preliminary studies in general have a fairly high likelihood of producing false “positive” results (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, showing a correlation where a larger, better designed study would find none); so funding such studies is likely to produce at least some apparent “hits,” such as this this study by Hewitson and Wakefield. Because such studies are small and preliminary, they can’t really settle anything, and the anti-vaccine movement knows it. So anti-vaccine groups like TACA and Generation Rescue will use the results of these small studies as justifications for claiming that there is doubt over whether vaccines are safe and, most importantly, that more money is needed to do more and bigger studies. They’ll then get such larger studies funded through the NIH or through the efforts of anti-vaccine sympathizers like Representative Dan Burton. In the meantime, they’ll point to the very existence of such NIH-funded studies as further “evidence” that there is still a scientific controversy over whether vaccines cause autism and milk them for all they’re worth until the larger studies come back negative, as they almost always do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a very hard strategy to counter, and, unfortunately, it just might work.&lt;/p&gt;

For those of you still unfamiliar, here is a &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/10/05/nobel.medicine/index.html?iref=newssearch"&gt;synopsis of the events a la CNN&lt;/a&gt; with some links a la Isis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Elizabeth H. Blackburn, Carol W. Greider and Jack W. Szostak are credited with discovering how chromosomes are protected against degradation -- a field that could shed light on human aging and diseases, including cancer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"The award of &lt;a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/index.html"&gt;the Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; recognizes the discovery of a fundamental mechanism in the cell, a discovery that has stimulated the development of new therapeutic strategies," the committee said in a news release&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;It centers on structures at the end of chromosomes called telomeres and an enzyme that forms them, called &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/news/research_matters/february2009/02092009telomerase.htm"&gt;telomerase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;As &lt;a href="http://www.cellsalive.com/mitosis.htm"&gt;cells divide&lt;/a&gt;, chromosomes need to be replicated perfectly. Work by the researchers determined that telomeres protect DNA from degradation in the process, and that telomerase maintains the telomeres.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of you emailed me to ask if I was thrilled to learn that two women have been awarded the Nobel Prize. I am. I think it's cool. That said, I am not quite ready to put down my sword and stop the fight for equality and parity in science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If you only include data from after 1977, 9% of Nobel Laureates in Medicine have been women.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You might say, &amp;quot;But Isis!  The number of women scientists has been increasing. The equality will come!&amp;quot;  Man, if I had a nut for everyone who said this to me, I&amp;#39;d be a &lt;a href="http://img7.travelblog.org/Photos/36845/398015/f/3805251-Fried-monkey-nuts--woman-seller-0.jpg"&gt;woman covered in nuts&lt;/a&gt;.  If this is true, I would expect that the number of women awarded Nobels to be increasing.  Here are the data:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img height="274" alt="More Nobels.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/10/hey_look_wimenz_youre_equal_no/More%20Nobels.jpg" width="400"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 3: Number of years between Nobel Prize in Medicine won by a woman (blue).  The sixth time the Nobel was awarded, it was awarded to two women.  If anything, the time between awards for women seems to be increasing.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;b&gt;My &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2008/06/academic_science_not_a_care_be.php"&gt;Care Bears fucking tea party&lt;/a&gt; dream world is shown in red.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t seem that the prize is being awarded to a woman any more frequently.  If anything, it seems to be happening less frequently. So, I am very happy for the recipients, but I think it might be premature to officially declare gender discrimination dead.  At least until I have seen a few more years worth of data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a positive note,  Dr. Greider told the editor of the Nobel Prize website:&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;I think actively promoting women in science is very important because the data has certainly shown that there has been an underrepresentation. And I think that the things that contribute to that are very many ... subtle, social kinds of things&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This leaves me feeling optimistic that, perhaps someday, the Nobel data will look different.&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/hey_look_wimenz_youre_equal_no.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/4erS_L18zeE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254975419187"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Insicknessandinhealth/~3/fmOAJKCFJhU/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6226f328752e056e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Sacre bleu!

Here's the sad puppy, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/10/my_regrets_on_your_traumatic_b/sadpuppy.jpeg" width="400" height="299" alt="sadpuppy.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Oh, Internet, you are like a giant greeting card store that is always well-stocked with lovely cliches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What seems to have scrambled their brains is that Richard Dawkins said, in an interview for Newsweek, that "there are many intelligent evolutionary scientists who also believe in God" and accepts that "there is that compatibility". Shock! He must have changed his mind! He's coming around to thinking like an accommodationist!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I suspect the damage must have occurred earlier, caused by all that masturbatory wacking away at a straw man. The real shock to both of them ought to be that they haven&amp;#39;t been paying any attention to what all these New Atheists have been saying all along. Dawkins didn&amp;#39;t say anything at all different from what we&amp;#39;ve all been saying all along — his position is practically the party line among the New Atheists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/11/eugenie-scott-dissembles-about-accommodationism/"&gt;Jerry Coyne was very clear&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, nobody doubts that science and religion are compatible in the trivial sense that someone can be a scientist and be religious at the same time.  That only shows one's ability to hold two dissimilar approaches to the world simultaneously in one's own mind.   As I've said umpteen times before, you could say that being a Christian is compatible with being a murderer because a lot of murderers are Christians.   Yet Mooney, and Scott, make this argument, and Mooney touts it as "powerful."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It isn't. This is not what we mean when we say science and faith are incompatible.  Got it, folks??  Let's not hear the "there-are-religious-scientists" argument any more.  It's trivial, and insulting to anyone who can think. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/christian_faith_is_at_odds_wit.php"&gt;I similarly spelled it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have now discovered that I was trying to make the same points &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124597314928257169.html"&gt;Lawrence Krauss is doing in the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;: religion is wrong. It's a set of answers, and worse, a set of procedures, that don't work. That's the root of our argument that religion is incompatible with science.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;That word, "incompatibility", is a problem, though. The uniform response we always get when we say that is "Hey! I'm a Christian, and I'm a scientist, therefore they can't be incompatible!" Alexander was no exception, and said basically the same thing right away. It's an irrelevant point; it assumes that a person can't possibly hold two incompatible ideas at once. We &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that is not true. We have complicated and imperfect brains, and even the most brilliant person on earth is not going to be perfectly consistent. When we talk about incompatibility, we have to also &lt;b&gt;specify what purposes are in conflict&lt;/b&gt;, and show that the patterns of behavior have different results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a shame. We've been writing this stuff repeatedly for so long, and these critics have failed to pay any attention. It's as if rational discussion doesn't sink into their heads. It makes me sad. We need another sad puppy; maybe they'll notice that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/10/my_regrets_on_your_traumatic_b/sadpuppy2.jpeg" width="400" height="344" alt="sadpuppy2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With some obvious exasperation, &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/04/richard-dawkins-is-not-an-accommodationist/"&gt;Jerry Coyne has also revisited this clueless distortion of our position&lt;/a&gt;, and best of all, since we were all together in Los Angeles this weekend, he got Richard Dawkins to testify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All I was saying is that it is possible for a human mind to accommodate both evolution and religion because F. Collins's mind seems to manage the feat (along with lots of vicars and bishops and rabbis). I also needed to make the point that TGSOE [The Greatest Show on Earth] is not the same book as TGD [The God Delusion] because many interviewers who are supposed to be interviewing me about TGSOE have simply ignored it and gone right back to assuming that it is the same book as TGD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all this clarity from our camp, Mooney still doesn't get it. He now has an article in the Huffington Post (booooo) in which, even though he has read Richard Dawkins' unambiguous statement that he was simply stating the position that he has held all along, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-mooney/how-richard-dawkins-commu_b_312208.html"&gt;Mooney has to continue to fellate his strawman some more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that makes puppies cry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/10/my_regrets_on_your_traumatic_b/sadpuppy3.jpeg" width="400" height="266" alt="sadpuppy3.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;p&gt;And worse, Mooney draws a ridiculously untenable conclusion: that Dawkins is backpeddling and regrets the association of evolution and atheism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Dawkins appears to be grappling with a communication problem. Linking together atheist advocacy and the defense of evolution, as he has done so prominently, poses a pretty big problem when you hit the US media with a new book on the latter. After writing a million-selling atheist "consciousness-raiser" and "come-out-of-the-closet" book, is it at all surprising that Dawkins now finds his evolution book being prominently linked to atheism in the media mind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You may already have read a little about the research behind it (if not, the NobelPrize.org &lt;a title="Nobel Prize.org Medicine 2009 Press Release" href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2009/press.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; is a very good place to start) so I’ll try to keep the background as short as possible. What I would like to do here is to explain the &lt;a title="&amp;quot;Telomere researchers win Nobel&amp;quot;" href="http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/56039/"&gt;assertions&lt;/a&gt; that “cancer research has also benefited from the Nobel-winning trio's work”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telomeres are necessary for several reasons, among them to act as ‘padding’ during cell duplication. Every time a linear DNA molecule is replicated it loses a few base pairs from the ends (the reason why is quite interesting, see this &lt;a title="&amp;quot;Telomere Shortening&amp;quot;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere#Telomere_shortening"&gt;description&lt;/a&gt; of the end replication problem). The telomeric sequence is simply “TTAGGG” (in vertebrates) repeated several thousand times so it doesn’t matter when some sequence is deleted. But, I hear you cry, how is this important for cancer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most cells in the body do not replicate. A typical tissue, such as skin, has a thin layer of stem cells that divide to produce more stem cells, as well as cells that will differentiate into skin cells. These cells divide a few more times until they are ‘terminally differentiated’. In the case of skin that means that they are filled with keratin and die, and when they reach the surface they are sloughed off. In other tissues the non-replicating terminally differentiated cells have different functions, for example as nerve cells or muscle cells. Thus the only cells that need to replicate infinitely are stem cells (and germ line cells, the cells that become sperm and eggs), so they express a protein called telomerase which adds extra copies of the repetitive sequences to the ends of chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you who’ve read my first ‘Understanding Cancer’ &lt;a title="&amp;quot;Understanding Cancer - Part 1&amp;quot;" href="http://www.blue-genes.net/2009/07/understanding-cancer-part-1/"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; – and anyone who knows a little bit about cancer biology – will see why this system is a major inhibitor of carcinogenesis: when a cell starts to over-proliferate it can only divide a certain number of times before the telomeres are fully eroded. In order to continue dividing it has to accumulate further mutations that render it immortal. These mutations have to be very specific, making them rarer: there are thousands of ways to make a cell grow faster, but only very few ways to lengthen its telomeres. Around &lt;a title="Kim et al. &amp;quot;Specific association of human telomerase activity with immortal cells and cancer&amp;quot;" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7605428"&gt;90%&lt;/a&gt; of cancers (remember: a cancer is, by definition, a collection of cells that have jumped this hurdle) have mutations that cause them to produce telomerase. Most of the remaining cases of cancer have recruited a normal DNA repair mechanism to lengthen the chromosomes by a process called ALT (Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a short side note: when telomeres were first elucidated it was thought by some that we’d found the key to aging. Unfortunately upregulating telomerase in an attempt to stay young only leads to more cancer, because you’ve removed one of the hurdles that a nascent tumour has to surmount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone see the further significance here? All cancers have to overcome a certain problem, and most of them do it in exactly the same way. This makes telomerase a very attractive target for new chemotherapeutic drugs or other types of intervention, and the field is bustling with new ideas. A few clinical trials are showing progress, using gene therapy and small molecule inhibitors (a.k.a. drugs): for a fuller account read this nice open-access &lt;a title="Shay and Keith &amp;quot;Targeting telomerase for cancer therapeutics&amp;quot;" href="http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?accid=PMC2259186"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;. The approach that strikes me as the most fascinating – and promising – is the idea of vaccinating against telomerase. Almost all cells in the body constantly chew up a sample of their own proteins and display them to the cells of the immune system as a defence against viruses. If you can tell the immune system to attack cells that express telomerase (not quite as straightforward as one might think) it will specifically attack cancer cells. This should be more specific (read: cause less side effects) than most anti-cancer therapies because most drugs attack all rapidly-replicating cells, whereas this would only target immortal cells, and just like you may have learnt from comic books: immortality is a very rare privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We'll reconvene at noon, Tuesday, Oct. 20, at Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society, with a peek at one of the many ways technology helped our species survive and prosper long ago.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/people?subpage=profile&amp;amp;Gurl=%2Faas%2FBAA&amp;amp;Uil=churchy" title=""&gt;Steven Churchill, an associate professor of evolutionary anthropology&lt;/a&gt; at Duke University, will discuss the origins of projectile weaponry, and how that fit with the emergence of other aspects of modern human behavior. He'll talk about his fascinating forensics work exploring ways our ancestors may have used  weapons against evolutionary cousins who no longer roam this planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American Scientist Pizza Lunch is free and open to science journalists and science communicators of all stripes. Feel free to forward this message to anyone who might want to attend. RSVPs are required (for a reliable slice count) to cclabby@amsci.org&lt;/p&gt;

It's basically a field guide to skin, with hundreds of pictures matched up with brief summaries.  The introduction states, "We have endeavored to include information relevant to gender dermatology and a large number of images showing skin disease in different ethnic populations."   The book devotes a section on each disease to racial differences.   For example, the section on superficial spreading melanoma (p. 312) states that "white-skinned persons overwelmingly predominate.  Only 2% [of cases] in brown-or black-skinned.  Furthermore, brown and black persons have melanomas usually occurring on the extremities; half of brown and black persons [presumably those with melanoma]  have primary melanomas arising on the sole of the foot."  However, the pictures in this section show only fair-skinned patients, limiting its utility if you have any dark-skinned patients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/what_is_ethnic_skin.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/what_is_ethnic_skin.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/2nZF-SHhOTo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254966166983"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/?p=1057">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/77696d07bac6cea0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="medical woo"/><category term="alt-med"/><category term="alternative medicine"/><category term="anti science"/><category term="anti-vaccination"/><category term="anti-vaccination movement"/><category term="anti-vax"/><category term="anti-vaxxers"/><category term="AVM"/><category term="CAM"/><category term="complementary medicine"/><category term="health"/><category term="Huffington Post"/><category term="HuffPo"/><category term="medicine"/><category term="natural"/><category term="natural cures"/><category term="quackery"/><category term="sCAM"/><category term="science-based medicine"/><category term="vaccines"/><category term="Western medicine"/><title type="html">Boycott the Huffington Post: They’ve Tumbled Down the Rabbit Hole of Anti-Science</title><published>2009-10-08T01:24:46Z</published><updated>2009-10-08T01:24:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/10/08/boycott-the-huffington-post-theyve-tumbled-down-the-rabbit-hole-of-anti-science/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many months back, &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/04/26/huffington-post-medical-woo-political-ideology-vs-science-redux/"&gt;I made a post concerning the anti-scientific quackery being dished out over at the Huffington Post website.&lt;/a&gt; At the time, it seems that the HuffPo was receiving a storm of criticism from bloggers for their irresponsible promotion of various forms of alt-med woo &amp;amp; quackery, ranging from &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Reiki"&gt;touchy-feely “energy healing” nonsense&lt;/a&gt; to outright &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/antivaccination.html"&gt;dangerous anti-vaccination rants.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, for a brief period of time, it seemed as if the folks over at HuffPo were backing away from the rabbit hole.  Sadly, the turn towards sanity&amp;amp; rationality didn’t last long, as outlined in a variety of blogs recently…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science-Based Medicine:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1906"&gt;The Huffington Post is at it again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many of our readers know, there are plenty of websites devoted entirely to fake medicine. Sites such as whale.to and NatrualNews are repositories of paranoid, unscientific thinking and promotion of dangerous health practices. Thankfully, they are rather fringe (but not fringe enough). More mainstream outlets print some pretty bad stuff, but it’s usually just lazy reporting and not a concerted, organized effort to promote implausible medical claims. As many of us have written, both hear and at our other blogs, the Huffington Post is the exception. It actively and in an organized way promotes dangerous, implausible pseudo-medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NeuroLogica Blog:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=991"&gt;Science Bloggers Pigpile on HuffPo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a bit late to the latest round of this party, but &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=470"&gt;as I have previously pointed out,&lt;/a&gt; The Huffington Post has been since its inception a bastion of pseudoscience, especially in the medical field. Like distressingly many news outlets, it has decided to abandon all pretense of being “fair and balanced” in its actual content when it comes to its ideological stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arianna Huffington clearly is enamored of anti-scientific pseudomedical nonsense. Earlier in her career she wrote for and frequently appeared on Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher – another &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1868"&gt;quack-friendly&lt;/a&gt; media personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bad Astronomy Blog:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="Permanent Link: HuffPo still pushing antivax nonsense" rel="bookmark" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/28/huffpo-still-pushing-antivax-nonsense/"&gt;HuffPo still pushing antivax nonsense&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to write for the Huffington Post, an online news and blog collective. It was started by Arianna Huffington during the Bush Era as a response to all the far-right online media. I didn’t agree with a lot of what was on there — I am more centrist — but at the time I thought it was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they started to promote far-left New Age nonsense, and when it came to vaccinations, HuffPo started posting all kinds of opinions that amounted to nothing more than out-and-out health threats. While they do sometimes post a counter-argument, it’s still almost all alt-med, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the latest: &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-frank-lipman/swine-flu-what-to-do_b_286245.html"&gt;a doctor named Frank Lipman is telling people not to get vaccinated against Swine Flu&lt;/a&gt;. Instead he says you should wash your hands a lot, eat well, and take homeopathic medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It indeed seems that the misguided &amp;amp; ideologically-driven folks over at HuffPo have tumbled uncontrollably down the rabbit hole, as attested to these scathing reviews.  But perhaps the most interesting, direct, and pithy post I’ve seen on this most recent expression of anti-science from HuffPo is from blogger PZ Myers…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pharyngula:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/die_huffpo_die.php"&gt;Die, HuffPo, DIE!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HuffPo is once again a &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-frank-lipman/swine-flu-what-to-do_b_286245.html"&gt;source of gross misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t worry about swine flu — it’s benign. If you really must protect yourself, take vitamins, eat garlic, get herbal supplements, and trust in homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s patent quackery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, people: boycott the HuffPo. I never read that slurry of watery dog crap anymore unless you cruel readers send me a link — it’s not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t agree with PZ more.  Despite my admittedly left-of-center political leanings, I’ll not be visiting them any longer.  We should all just boycott HuffPo, folks… just don’t go there anymore, for &lt;em&gt;anything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You may already have read a little about the research behind it (if not, the NobelPrize.org &lt;a title="Nobel Prize.org Medicine 2009 Press Release" href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2009/press.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; is a very good place to start) so I’ll try to keep the background as short as possible. What I would like to do here is to explain the &lt;a title="The Scientist: &amp;quot;Telomere researchers win Nobel&amp;quot;" href="http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/56039/"&gt;assertions&lt;/a&gt; that “cancer research has also benefited from the Nobel-winning trio's work”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Telomeres are necessary for several reasons, among them to act as ‘padding’ during cell duplication. Every time a linear DNA molecule is replicated it loses a few base pairs from the ends (the reason why is quite interesting, see this &lt;a title="Wikipedia: &amp;quot;Telomere Shortening&amp;quot;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere#Telomere_shortening"&gt;description&lt;/a&gt; of the end replication problem). The telomeric sequence is simply “TTAGGG” (in vertebrates) repeated several thousand times so it doesn’t matter when some sequence is deleted. But, I hear you cry, how is this important for cancer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Most cells in the body do not replicate. A typical tissue, such as skin, has a thin layer of stem cells that divide to produce more stem cells, as well as cells that will differentiate into skin cells. These cells divide a few more times until they are ‘terminally differentiated’. In the case of skin that means that they are filled with keratin and die, and when they reach the surface they are sloughed off. In other tissues the non-replicating terminally differentiated cells have different functions, for example as nerve cells or muscle cells. Thus the only cells that need to replicate infinitely are stem cells (and germ line cells, the cells that become sperm and eggs), so they express a protein called telomerase which adds extra copies of the repetitive sequences to the ends of chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Those of you who’ve read my first ‘Understanding Cancer’ &lt;a title="Blue-Genes: &amp;quot;Understanding Cancer - Part 1&amp;quot;" href="http://www.blue-genes.net/2009/07/understanding-cancer-part-1/"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; – and anyone who knows a little bit about cancer biology – will see why this system is a major inhibitor of carcinogenesis: when a cell starts to over-proliferate it can only divide a certain number of times before the telomeres are fully eroded. In order to continue dividing it has to accumulate further mutations that render it immortal. These mutations have to be very specific, making them rarer: there are thousands of ways to make a cell grow faster, but only very few ways to lengthen its telomeres. Around &lt;a title="Pubmed: Kim et al. &amp;quot;Specific association of human telomerase activity with immortal cells and cancer&amp;quot;" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7605428"&gt;90%&lt;/a&gt; of cancers (remember: a cancer is, by definition, a collection of cells that have jumped this hurdle) have mutations that cause them to produce telomerase. Most of the remaining cases of cancer have recruited a normal DNA repair mechanism to lengthen the chromosomes by a process called ALT (Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;On a short side note: when telomeres were first elucidated it was thought by some that we’d found the key to aging. Unfortunately upregulating telomerase in an attempt to stay young only leads to more cancer, because you’ve removed one of the hurdles that a nascent tumour has to surmount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Does anyone see the further significance here? All cancers have to overcome a certain problem, and most of them do it in exactly the same way. This makes telomerase a very attractive target for new chemotherapeutic drugs or other types of intervention, and the field is bustling with new ideas. A few clinical trials are showing progress, using gene therapy and small molecule inhibitors (a.k.a. drugs): for a fuller account read this nice open-access &lt;a title="UK Pubmed Central: Shay and Keith &amp;quot;Targeting telomerase for cancer therapeutics&amp;quot;" href="http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?accid=PMC2259186"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;. The approach that strikes me as the most fascinating – and promising – is the idea of vaccinating against telomerase. Almost all cells in the body constantly chew up a sample of their own proteins and display them to the cells of the immune system as a defence against viruses. If you can tell the immune system to attack cells that express telomerase (not quite as straightforward as one might think) it will specifically attack cancer cells. This should be more specific (read: cause less side effects) than most anti-cancer therapies because most drugs attack all rapidly-replicating cells, whereas this would only target immortal cells, and just like you may have learnt from comic books: immortality is a very rare privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

These are my initial thoughts. How would you respond?&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timothy Keller, Pastor of the Redeemer Presbyterian Church in Manhattan, New York, claims: “All doubts, however skeptical and cynical they may seem, are really a set of alternative beliefs. You cannot doubt Belief A except from a position of faith in Belief B.” Writing to skeptics he claims that “The reason you doubt Christianity’s Belief A is because you hold unprovable Belief B. Every doubt, therefore, is based on a leap of faith.” (p. xviii). Faith, according to him, is anything we accept that is unprovable. As such, “All of us have fundamental, unprovable faith commitments that we think are superior to those of others.” (p. 20). Then by defining religion as “a set of beliefs that explain what life is all about, who we are, and the most important things that human beings should spend their time doing,” he goes on to argue that even the most secular pragmatists have an “implicit religion.” Why? Because skeptics, just like religious believers, have “set of faith assumptions about the nature of things.” (p. 15-16). So he argues that skeptics likewise “must doubt your doubts.” [&lt;i&gt;The Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism &lt;/i&gt;(New York: Riverhead Books, 2008), p. xix]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even if I grant for the sake of argument that faith is what we have when we cannot prove something, then what method does Keller propose to distinguish between that which is provable from that which is unprovable? Surely he doesn’t mean to say that if we cannot be absolutely certain of something all we have left is blind faith, or that everything that is unprovable has an equal epistemological merit. Christians like him want to claim that skeptics too have beliefs which cannot be proven, and then try to drive a whole truckload of Christian assumptions and beliefs through that small crevice. If that’s what he’s doing then a Mormon or a Muslim could have written the same things he did, and then driven a whole truckload of Mormon or Muslim assumptions and beliefs through that small crevice too. And we would still be in no better position to judge between faiths, even granting that skeptics also have faith assumptions. What I’m proposing with the &lt;i&gt;Outsider Test For Faith&lt;/i&gt; is a way to distinguish between what we should accept from what we should not. I’m arguing there isn’t a better test when it comes to religious beliefs. So again, what better method is there?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And even if I grant Keller’s definition of religion for the sake of argument such that everyone has one, including skeptics, then once again what better method is there but &lt;i&gt;The Outsider Test&lt;/i&gt; to decide which one of them is correct, if any? When we all apply it to our respective religions we should all be agnostics about all metaphysical claims, all of them. We should all be agnostics. We should all doubt our doubts. Agnostics already do this. This double negative way of expressing things does not lead to faith. It leads to agnosticism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep in mind that the choices in front of us are emphatically NOT between any one particular situated cultural form of Christianity and atheism. The choices are Legion. This fact makes agnosticism the default position. Anyone, and I mean anyone including myself, who leaves the default position and affirms an answer, any answer, has the burden of proof. The denial is the easy part. We deny the beliefs of nearly everyone else, sometimes without even considering them. The hard part is in affirming the correct set of beliefs. I am an atheist because that’s the direction agnosticism pushes me. My atheism is due to the process of elimination. One supernatural entity, being, or force after another was rejected by me leaving the only reasonable answer to be atheism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in fact, I do not accept Keller’s definition of faith or of religion. He’s manipulating the debate by using a language game in his favor here. I refuse to play this game. I know as sure as I can know anything that there is a material world, and that I can trust my senses. Therefore I know the scientific method is our only sure way for assessing truth claims. Words like &lt;i&gt;hope&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;faith&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trust&lt;/i&gt; just don’t do these things justice. The word &lt;i&gt;faith&lt;/i&gt; must be reserved to apply in this context to beliefs about that which cannot be sensed or empirically tested, like ghosts, angels, demons and gods. And likewise the word &lt;i&gt;religion&lt;/i&gt; must be based upon beliefs about those kinds of entities if it’s to have any separate meaning at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Keller is doing is descibing a worldview anyway. Everyone has one but that does not make everyone religious. An atheist worldview is not a religion. That is a language game I refuse to accept. If by denying all religions this makes the atheist worldview a religion then not collecting stamps is a hobby!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-5516409721937715129?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I like them too, especially Data, but there’s another type of artificial creature I find more interesting. Or I should say semi-artificial, because I’m talking about cyborgs – cybernetic organisms: half living organic beings, half cold, dead steel, plastic, and computer chips.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What is intriguing about cyborgs is the tension between the two halves. In the 1987 film &lt;i&gt;RoboCop&lt;/i&gt;, the level of crime in Detroit requires a new kind of policing. Enter RoboCop, a metal body with super physical capabilities that’s given intelligence and personality by an implanted brain from a dead policeman. RoboCop is an outstanding law officer, but inside that casing is a mind that yearns for the warm human connections it once had but can never recover. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even more interesting is how far we’ve come toward making brain-machine interfaces and even a real cyborg. In 2000, to study how the brain controls movement, Sandro Mussa-Ivaldi at Northwestern University installed a fish brain in a nutrient bath aboard a motorized wheeled cart. Electrodes placed in the brain took input from light sensors on the cart and sent output to the motors. Depending on where the electrodes were placed in the brain, the cart would move toward or away from a light source. While less exciting than RoboCop, this truly demonstrated a living brain controlling an artificial body.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other examples of brain–machine interfaces come mostly in the form of neural implants for medical use. The best known is the cochlear implant, which restores hearing to deaf people. The cochlea is a small spiral structure in the inner ear. It houses the auditory nerves that pick up sound vibrations and turns them into nerve impulses that go to the brain. The interface includes an external microphone mounted behind the ear, which converts sounds into electrical impulses that travel along wires implanted in the cochlea. This activates the auditory nerves and creates the sensation of sound in the brain. In the United States, about 37,000 of these implants have been installed in adults and children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fDeqkC0PEtg/Ssz8ql4ASfI/AAAAAAAAAA8/f2eLJB75aUw/s1600-h/_606938_blind_video_man300.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:300px;height:186px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fDeqkC0PEtg/Ssz8ql4ASfI/AAAAAAAAAA8/f2eLJB75aUw/s320/_606938_blind_video_man300.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another application for neural interfaces is in artificial limbs that can be controlled by thought alone. This research began around 2000 and has received a huge boost because of the U.S. military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, where body armor increases the survival rate of soldiers but doesn’t always protect their limbs. The result is about 1,200 amputees among U.S. casualties to date. To deal with this, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the Department of Defense is sponsoring crash programs in prosthetic research. These have produced prototype prosthetic arms with neural interfaces, now being tested. DARPA also sponsors other research in neural interfaces with direct applications to fighting wars. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One area that hasn’t developed as far as people would like is neural interfaces to restore vision to the blind and near-blind – a group that includes millions in the United States. This has lagged because the visual system is so complex. Each eye contains more than 100 million rods and cones, and it takes about 30% of the brain to interpret the incoming visual data whereas auditory data needs only 3%. Still, researchers have shown some success using interfaces to the brain and also to the retina. At least one commercial retinal device is now up for FDA approval. But the device’s low visual resolution and projected $100,000 price tag show that there’s still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fictional artificial creatures can be compelling characters – terrifying, amusing, or thought provoking. Real-life cyborgs are less dramatic but have a different fascination.

&lt;p&gt;Why....I ask.....are science news sites so overwhelming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sites like ScienceDaily, Seed, and even Wired offer a plethora of news stories--wait, plethora is the wrong word--these sites offer a overabundance--no--a gargantuan quantity of news stories on their front pages, as if the reader would be comforted by the sheer number of options offered for greedy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, im here to tell you--cross-eyed, overworked editors of online news rags--too many choices are &lt;a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/jun04/toomany.html"&gt;just as enraging&lt;/a&gt; as having too few. According to APA online (this seems like a no-duh to me: By the way--someone actually said no-duh to me today. Ha!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The presumption is, self-determination is a good thing and choice is essential to self-determination," says Barry Schwartz, PhD, a Swarthmore College psychologist and author of "The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less" (Ecco, 2004). "But there's a point where all of this choice starts to be not only unproductive, but counterproductive--a source of pain, regret, worry about missed opportunities and unrealistically high expectations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where are you on this one--meta science news sites? Don't you read the research news?! Live science kinda gets it--they have a well organized and somewhat curated homepage. But, once you get down to it--SO MUCH NEWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it doesn't matter how many filters or tags or categories you have to whittle your news down to 'what you want to read' (like you always know what THAT is), it is still too much content to handle. Sometimes im lazy and just want to just trust someone to tell me what i want to read or need to read. Other times i want to get really deep into a news site and discover things for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that i want both. Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

For example, various studies have shown that looking at oneself being touched has the opposite effect - it can enhance tactile acuity, so that one can discriminate between two pinpoints which would otherwise feel like a single sensation. And last year, researchers from the University of Oxford showed that making a limb look larger or smaller than it actually using binoculars can respectively enhance and diminish painful sensations.

These phenomena occur because the brain fuses stimuli from different sensory systems to generate a coherent experience of bodily sensations. The precise mechanisms are unknown, and it is also unclear whether these effects depend upon specific visual stimuli. But according to a new study from University College London, the general &amp;quot;context&amp;quot; of vison is enough to modulate pain. In the current issue of the Journal of Neuroscience, they report that  merely looking at one&amp;#39;s hand can affect the perception of laser-induced pain, and how it is processed in the cerebral cortex. Together with earlier work, these findings point to a simple method for managing acute pain.

&lt;p&gt;Over at The Scientist, &lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/2009/10/1/63/1/"&gt;there’s a page&lt;/a&gt; devoted to “tools and techniques for tracking mammalian behavior”. The latest addition relates to the work of Nickolay Hristov, at Winston-Salem State University. Hristov was working as a postdoc with Thomas Kunz at Boston University, and they wanted to study what bats were doing in the Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico. Using military-grade thermal infrared imaging technology, they were able to observe the bats in the dark, and produced this amazing video (not sure about the Bach soundtrack, myself):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/07/holy-infrared-cameras-batman/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/ZT8vpxOxPVI/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hristov and his co-workers published &lt;a href="http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/48/1/50"&gt;an article (open access)&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Integrated and Comparative Biology &lt;/em&gt;at the beginning of 2008 describing their technique, and its advantages for studying the aerosphere. They were able to estimate the size of the bat colony (it seems to fluctuate with time, by as much as 1 million bats), and also get greater insight into how individual bats navigate inside the cavern, and how they chase moths outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that in Venezuela bats have to deal with a giant centipede that snarfs them in mid-air. Maybe – like snakes – the centipede can detect passing bats using infrared? Or maybe there are just so many bats it’s easy to get one…&lt;/p&gt;

She went from complete freedom to getting up at dawn five mornings a week for a seven hour school day.  It is my fortunate task on four of those mornings to help her on her way.  Like many of the Pal clan, she is independent of thought, and rather stubborn; once she's out of sorts, well, to paraphrase Colin Powell, you broke it, you buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I've developed a very careful morning routine, designed to ease us into our day as painlessly as possible.  I'm a morning person, so I get up and take care of my ablutions before I get her up.  Then I walk into her room, turn on a light, and rub her back.  She rolls over and with eyes closed, lifts her arms up toward me.  I pick her up and carry her downstairs, set her on the couch with the lights off, and let her watch some TV while I make breakfast.  When it's ready, we sit at the table together and have breakfast, and by then, she's good to go.  Her mood is bright, and I'm one happy daddy.  After that, getting teeth brushed and clothes on is a breeze, and we're out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless the routine is violated.  The other day I had an early patient and MrsPal had to get her up.  I carefully and in a sufficiently detailed and condescending way described the best approach to the morning and the possible consequences of violating it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She violated it.  While DrPal is a morning person, MrsPal is a night owl, and made use of the Forbidden Snooze Button of Doom.  This led to a whiny, screaming child who shared her misery generously with my lovely but nocturnal spouse.  It. Was. Ugly.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is MrsPal's day again.  I'm thinking about making popcorn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/disrupt_palkids_routine_at_you.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/7j5rIG3oRfQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254946514721"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/spoor_of_south_african_dinos_a.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/abf4152e6f557e35</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Paleontology"/><title type="html">Spoor of South African Dinos Analyzed</title><published>2009-10-07T20:19:46Z</published><updated>2009-10-07T20:19:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/i2NIyjiv0qE/spoor_of_south_african_dinos_a.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/spoor_of_south_african_dinos_a.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;A new investigation of the sedimentology and ichnology of the Early Jurassic Moyeni tracksite in Lesotho, southern Africa has yielded new insights into the behavior and locomotor dynamics of early dinosaurs.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/spoor_of_south_african_dinos_a.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/spoor_of_south_african_dinos_a.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/i2NIyjiv0qE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254944655735"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=5813">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d16be6468e4c0085</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="DeathfromtheSkies!"/><title type="html">Apophis danger downgraded</title><published>2009-10-07T19:00:41Z</published><updated>2009-10-07T19:00:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/10/07/apophis-danger-downgraded/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroidwatch/newsfeatures.cfm?release=2332"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/10/apophis_orbit.jpg" alt="apophis_orbit" title="apophis_orbit" width="250" height="266"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Apophis is a 250-meter-wide rock with a special designation: it’s a near-Earth asteroid, meaning it passes close to our planet. In fact, in April of 2029 it will pass so close to the Earth — just under 30,000 kilometers (18,000 miles) — that it will actually get between us and some of our geosynchronous satellites! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it will come so close, the Earth’s gravity will change its orbit. There is a region of space called a keyhole (it’s actually kidney-bean shaped) and if Apophis passes through it like an arrow through a bulls-eye, the Earth’s gravity will change the asteroid’s orbit enough that in seven more years, in 2036, Apophis will hit the Earth! The odds of it passing through the keyhole are low; up until recently they’ve been quoted as 1 in 45,000. Not a huge concern, but worth keeping an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroidwatch/newsfeatures.cfm?release=2332"&gt;new observations have lowered these odds even more&lt;/a&gt;, to only 1 in 250,000. Pretty much at this point I’m not worried about this particular rock any more. The odds before weren’t great, but they’re so bad now it’s no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this work? The orbit of an asteroid is calculated using measurements of its position in the sky over time. There is a tiny uncertainty in those positions for many reasons: atmospheric distortion blurring the asteroid image being one of if not the biggest. The way to minimize that is to get lots of images so that the errors average out, but even then the orbit calculated has uncertainties. And the longer into the future you project the orbit, the worse it gets. In the case of Apophis, astronomer Dave Tholen used hundreds of new images of Apophis to refine the orbit and get the better statistics for its impact risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens quite frequently: a potentially dangerous asteroid gets better observations made of it, and the risk drops. In this case, that’s definitely a good thing. At 250 meters wide, an Apophis impact could do considerable damage to civilization. It wouldn’t be an extinction level event, but it would put serious hurt on humans. Still, it bears watching. I doubt the odds will go back up, but the more we pay attention to these things, the better!&lt;/p&gt;

It's a good thing that I said "seems", since Minor Myers has gently pointed me to his article "&lt;a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1484731"&gt;Supreme Court Usage and the Making of an 'Is'&lt;/a&gt;", 11 Green Bag 2d 457, August 2008, in which he checks this very point, very carefully, in opinions of the United States Supreme Court from 1790 to 1919.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the answer? In the case of U.S. Supreme Court opinions, we apparently became an 'is' somewhat gradually, between 1840 and 1910. And the effect of the Civil War (or at least its immediate aftermath) was apparently to retard the change, not to accelerate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;After citing the Shelby Foote "It made us an 'is'" quote that I also gave, Myers adds some evidence of the ubiquity of this view. Thus he quotes James McPherson, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-uuEA7xIUHUC"&gt;Battle cry of freedom: The Civil War era&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, 1988:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Before 1861 the two words ‘United States’ were rendered as a plural noun: ‘the United States are a republic.’ The war marked a transition of the United States to a singular noun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also William Michael Treanor, "&lt;a href="http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/106/3/treanor.pdf"&gt;Taking Text Too Serously: Modern Textualism, Original meaning, and the Case of Amar's Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Michigan Law Review&lt;/em&gt;, vol. 106, 487-544 (Dec. 2007):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;‘United States’ was often matched with a plural verb in 1787 and consistently matched with a singular verb after the Civil War.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to evaluate these claims in the case of Supreme Court opinions, Myers used the following method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;For each decade in the survey period, I ran word searches for “United States is” and “United States are” through the Westlaw Supreme Court database. To eliminate false positives, I reviewed the search results to identify opinions where (1) “United States” was a subject and (2) the associated  verb was “is” (or “are,” depending on the search). To isolate  only usage choices made by the author, anything appearing only in a quotation from a statute, a court rule, or another case was ignored, as was anything in West headnotes. Each opinion in a particular case was treated as a separate work, and thus a case could have more than one entry if more than one justice wrote or if a justice used both “is” and “are” in the same opinion. I collected data on usage in the opinions of justices, the arguments of counsel before the court, and supplementary material prepared by the reporter of decisions (e.g., a syllabus). Except where noted, the focus of the presentation here is on usage in opinions of the justices; data on usage in other portions of the case reports appear in the Appendix.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are his basic results in graphical form (click for a larger version):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/MyersFig1.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/MyersFig1.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The Civil War does not appear to have altered the Supreme Court’s usage in a fashion as dramatic as Foote and McPherson have suggested. In the 1860s, the usage pattern shifts away from “are” and toward “is,” and it is during that decade that usage of “is” first predominates. But the change is not wholesale – “are” and “is” were used roughly equally in the 1860s. In the following decade, Court usage reverted back to antebellum patterns. For the remainder of the nineteenth century, plural usage predominated in Supreme Court opinions, though by slowly declining margins. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Usage was quite clearly unsettled in the latter part of the nineteenth century. One of the most striking demonstrations of this is Justice Samuel F. Miller’s majority opinion in &lt;a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/106/196/"&gt;United States v. Lee&lt;/a&gt;. Justice Miller managed to compose a sentence with both usages:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;“[T]he doctrine [of sovereign immunity], if not absolutely limited to cases in which the United States are made defendants by name, is not permitted to interfere with the judicial enforcement of the established rights of plaintiffs when the United States is not a defendant or a necessary party to the suit.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He observes that some of the obvious theories about sources of variation don't pan out, at least in this data set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Geography does not help explain this pattern. Looking at the geographic latitudes of the justices’ residences prior to appointment, there is no meaningful difference between the mean latitude for the exclusive “are” users and the mean for those who dabbled in “is.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politics doesn't seem to help either, at least in the obvious way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;To see whether the Civil War might have influenced usage in a different way, I isolated the usage by justices who were appointed by President Abraham Lincoln. In fact, during the period when at least one justice appointed by Lincoln was on the Court, the five Lincoln-appointed justices used “are” slightly more frequently than did the other justices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's his appendix, giving the counts in different sorts of SCOTUS material:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/MyersTable.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to look at some other features as well — number agreement with verbs other than &lt;em&gt;is/are&lt;/em&gt;; (which would help to increase the rather small counts from this source); the distribution of pronouns co-referential with &lt;em&gt;the United States&lt;/em&gt; (19th-century newspapers give us examples of &lt;em&gt;they, it, she,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;); what fraction of "United States" instances are subjects as opposed to modifiers or PP complements or whatever; how usage is affected by the topic, e.g. relations of the federal government to foreign governments, to the states separately, to individual citizens or companies, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West's materials are definitely not accessible for automatic processing of such questions; but most if not all of the same documents are available on the web, I think, so this might be a good testing ground for the idea of automatic or semi-automatic analysis of this type.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254942488800"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/10/chiros_try_to_close_down_simon.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ecd47d663e55cfef</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Chiros try to close down Simon Singh’s support campaign</title><published>2009-10-07T12:35:59Z</published><updated>2009-10-07T12:35:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/10/chiros_try_to_close_down_simon.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;UK charity Sense About Science have been instrumental in &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/about/406"&gt;organising support for Simon Singh&lt;/a&gt;, the British science writer who is being &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/jun/04/simon-singh-libel-british-chiropractic-association-bca"&gt;sued for libel&lt;/a&gt; by the British Chiropractic Association over a critical article he wrote in the Guardian. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now it seems a BCA supporter has tried to close down this campaign. Julia Wilson reports:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Dear friends&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You alerted us that someone was touting for ideas about reporting SAS to the Charity Commission. We were aware that chiropractors discussing the GCC complaints had mentioned the idea, which perhaps they saw as a way to get back at Simon and the campaign. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, it happened. We had a complaint against us in respect of Simon Singh and the campaign. Our board responded robustly and we received a letter pretty much by return saying that the complainant's case has been closed. We have put this correspondence up on a link from our campaign page (see &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/about/406"&gt;http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/about/406&lt;/a&gt; ) for anyone who is interested and in the hope that it might help others (we are thinking of the Australian skeptics who've had a complaint against them too, albeit in a different way).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best wishes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julia&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The letter from the Charity Commission, outlining the complaint, can be read &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/PDF/Letter%20from%20Charity%20Commission%20Sept%2009.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Among other things, it questions whether the campaign could "impact unfavourably on the charity's supporters". It looks like the BCA supporter is trying to paint Singh as a pariah whom we should be embarrassed to associate with. How wrong-headed can you get?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chairman Lord Taverne's reply is &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/PDF/Sense%20About%20Science%20Letter%20to%20Charity%20Commission%20in%20response%20Sept%2009.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. He hit back:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Our campaign in support of Dr Singh is concerned with the impact of UK libel laws on public discussion about science generally and we considered that a change would be highly unlikely to impact unfavourably on our supporters. Indeed over 17,000 people have signed up in support, many giving time, money and practical assistance. It is supported by other charitable organisations. Donations from existing supporters have increased since May; while this may reflect interest in our other projects it does not suggest the campaign is having an unfavourable impact. We have inspired new volunteers and partnerships with other organisations and have reached other sections of society. All our work and activities have benefited from the publicity roused by this campaign and there has been an increased demand for our older publications.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The complaint was &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/PDF/Letter%20from%20Charity%20Commission%20dismiss%20complaint%20Oct%2009.pdf"&gt;thrown out&lt;/a&gt; by the Charity Commission almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/10/chiros_try_to_close_down_simon.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254942488800"><id gr:original-id="655 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/860ee744ebad5466</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Animal High Society</title><published>2009-10-07T09:00:26Z</published><updated>2009-10-07T09:00:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/655" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.treehugger.com/orangutan-borneo-photo-tree346.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orangutans make music. &lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/animals/090810-orangutan-instrument.html"&gt;It's a fact&lt;/a&gt;, say researchers at the University of Utrect in the Netherlands. Hanging high in a tree, orangutans strip leaves off a nearby twig, cup them in their hand, like using a blade of grass as a reed, and blow to make sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, unlike kids messing around on a sunny day, they don't do it just for fun. Orangutans make noise to ward off predators, as you might expect. Birds, whales, dolphins and other animals also use sound--to signal danger, to identify food, or just to say hi. So, what's with the researchers' surprising claim?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers associated with this study make a surprising proposition--they say the orangutan's musical whistling is the first evidence of "culture" in animals. But, what does culture actually mean? Can it be defined simply as using a tool for communication or does it mean something more? If it means something more, do the orang's activities meet that criteria?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/culture"&gt;Culture &lt;/a&gt; in humans means the capacity for symbolic thought, social learning, and a set of shared goals and behaviors within a group. I see how orangs might be using social learning and shared goals/behaviors, but what about symbolic thought? An example of symbolic thought in humans is, of course, mathematics, but religion and history/tradition can also be examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Without symbolic thought, it seems like orangutan "culture" would be very 2 dimensional, if you can call it that at all. Im not sure this study really fully explores the definition of culture. But, what do i know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why....I ask.....are science news sites so overwhelming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sites like ScienceDaily, Seed, and even Wired offer a plethora of news stories--wait, plethora is the wrong word--these sites offer a overabundance--no--a gargantuan quantity of news stories on their front pages, as if the reader would be comforted by the sheer number of options offered for greedy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, im here to tell you--cross-eyed, overworked editors of online news rags--too many choices are &lt;a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/jun04/toomany.html"&gt;just as enraging&lt;/a&gt; as having too few. According to APA online (this seems like a no-duh to me: By the way--someone actually said no-duh to me today. Ha!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The presumption is, self-determination is a good thing and choice is essential to self-determination," says Barry Schwartz, PhD, a Swarthmore College psychologist and author of "The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less" (Ecco, 2004). "But there's a point where all of this choice starts to be not only unproductive, but counterproductive--a source of pain, regret, worry about missed opportunities and unrealistically high expectations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where are you on this one--meta science news sites? Don't you read the research news?! Live science kinda gets it--they have a well organized and somewhat curated homepage. But, once you get down to it--SO MUCH NEWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it doesn't matter how many filters or tags or categories you have to whittle your news down to 'what you want to read' (like you always know what THAT is), it is still too much content to handle. Sometimes im lazy and just want to just trust someone to tell me what i want to read or need to read. Other times i want to get really deep into a news site and discover things for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that i want both. Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

Whether and how exotic species impact communities is a multifaceted problem that requires understanding the multitude of direct and indirect species interactions that occur. In a paper published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, B, Montserrat Vila and colleagues asked if exotic plants where integrated into plant-pollinator networks, and whether this integration had any observable impacts on these networks. This is an important question, as most ecological theory predicts that plant-pollinator networks are actually quite resilient to perturbations since most associations tend to be between generalists as opposed to the more susceptible specialists.They studied invaded plant communities across Europe, observing pollinator visits to flowers in multiple 50 x 50 m plots. They calculated connectance as the number of interactions standardized by network size. They showed that exotics fully integrated into plant-pollinator networks. Exotic species accounted for 42% of all pollinator visits and 24% of all network connections -a testament to the overall abundance of exotics in many communities. However, these exotics did not affect overall changes in network connectedness, revealing that these networks are quite robust to invasions.That said, researchers must now ask if this is true in networks that do contain high numbers of specialists (e.g., orchids) or if the relative few specialists in generalist-dominated systems are more susceptible to changes from exotics.Vila, M., Bartomeus, I., Dietzsch, A., Petanidou, T., Steffan-Dewenter, I., Stout, J., &amp;amp; Tscheulin, T.

Krugman was brutal; economic “science” failed to anticipate, much less predict, the current economic crisis. Krugman describes how economists had become infatuated with beautiful theories, and became increasingly removed from the real world. A world in which there are indeed real estate bubbles, financial speculators, and complete and catastrophic financial collapse. The current recession hit, demonstrating the failure of economics as a discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/10/down_arrow_crash.jpg" alt="down_arrow_crash" title="down_arrow_crash" width="25%"&gt;Sean was intrigued by the search for an Economic “Theory of Everything”. He points out that this theory may indeed exist, and when found, will be proclaimed beautiful. Of course, the analogies to String Theory are irresistible. But I will resist. As Sean suggests, General Relativity is a beautiful theory. In fact, it’s stupendously gorgeous. (Unlike quantum mechanics, which although it certainly possesses its charms, is not something I would call ravishing.) General Relativity also happens to be right, so far as we can tell. It is a significant improvement over Newtonian gravity, which itself is no ugly duckling. We’ve come a long way from Ptolemy. Indeed, aesthetics plays a major role in science. The Nobel Laureate himself singles out Sean’s post, and &lt;a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/05/a-few-notes-on-my-magazine-article/"&gt;mentions it on his blog&lt;/a&gt;. Beauty and truth are not in opposition. But beauty is not a replacement for truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was reading through Krugman’s essay, however, I confess to a certain amount of envy. His description of the field of economics made it sound awfully familiar. People have different theories. They argue. They write papers. There are influential thinkers. There’s lots of math. It’s just like physics, with one crucial difference:&lt;br&gt;
You’re probably expecting me to say that economics is essentially gobbledygook, while physics is a “pure” science. That may be true, but it’s an argument for another day. What struck me is the fact that what economists do and say really matters, in an immediate and tangible way. They engage in abstruse arguments about the money supply and the subprime market, but at the end of the day, someone somewhere listens to them, and makes a decision about the interest rate, or whether to bailout a troubled bank. Suddenly, millions of people may be out of work. Trillions of dollars may evaporate. A large fraction of the population of the planet may be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s not that physics is irrelevant. It is almost impossible not to look around and see the role of physicists in one’s daily life (starting with the computer in front of you). But if I miss a factor of two, a family in Detroit does not go hungry. Although economics often seems like a “lightweight” discipline, when compared to harder sciences, it has the advantage of immediate relevancy.  And at first blush, this seems highly desirable. On second thought, however, maybe I’d rather not have to worry about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932009_Icelandic_financial_crisis"&gt;destroying Iceland&lt;/a&gt; while looking for a bug in my code.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>daniel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254939049417"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1796">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f0c85b10918a4d6a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and advertising"/><category term="Semantics"/><title type="html">A "semantic" difference</title><published>2009-10-07T17:59:41Z</published><updated>2009-10-07T17:59:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1796" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;From a &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; story (Shaila Dewan, "Pollster's Censure Jolts News Organizations", October 3) on the polling company Strategic Vision, which has been reprimanded by a professional society of pollsters for failing to disclose "essential facts" about its methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the accusation that the company's claim to be based in Atlanta was misleading, Mr. Johnson [David E. Johnson, the founder and chief executive of Strategic Vision] acknowledged that the main Strategic Vision office was in Blairsville, Ga., 115 miles away, but said the difference was "semantic".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, yeah, blame it on the words. "Semantic" here means 'only semantic, not substantive' and locates the problem not in differences of matters of fact but in differences in the meanings of linguistic expressions. The claim is that some people use certain expressions (like &lt;em&gt;based in Atlanta&lt;/em&gt;) one way, while other people use these expressions somewhat differently, so that any dispute about the state of things is "just / merely / only" a dispute about word meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there's plenty of variation in the meanings people assign to words (and other expressions), and lexicographers, dialectologists, sociolinguists, and theoretical linguists examine this variation all the time. The question is whether SV's use of &lt;em&gt;based in Atlanta&lt;/em&gt; is an instance of this sort of variation. As a rule of thumb, you should be suspicious whenever someone who's not professionally involved in the study of semantic variation dismisses some difference as "(just) semantic(s)" or the like; it's likely to be a dodge, or at least a stretching of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case at hand, what's at issue is what counts as &lt;strong&gt;being in&lt;/strong&gt; some location. There's a certain amount of allowable leeway in such things, according to which you can get by saying that your company is located in X when in fact it's in a suburb of X or in a separate jurisdiction within the boundaries of X. So if your company is located in West Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Burbank, it wouldn't be entirely misleading to say (in some contexts) that it's in Los Angeles (though "in the Los Angeles area", or something similar, would be a more scrupulous phrasing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even when places are in the same metropolitan area and are close to one another, sometimes few people would accept as "located/based in [principal city of the whole area]" as an identification for a company. A company based in Oakland, Berkeley, Palo Alto, or Mountain View (not to mention San Jose or Santa Cruz) can't get away with saying it's "based in San Francisco". "Based in the Bay Area", yes, but not "based in San Francisco". Sometimes, close doesn't count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington DC and Baltimore MD are different locations, even though they're only 34 miles apart; similarly, Boston MA and Providence RI, only 41 miles apart. And then on to New York NY and New Haven CT, 67 miles apart; Chicago IL and Milwaukee WI, 83 miles apart; New York NY and Philadelphia PA, 86 miles apart; Cleveland OH and Erie PA, 92 miles apart. (All under the 115-mile mark.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't have to cross state lines: Philadelphia and Harrisburg PA are 90 miles apart; Columbus and Cincinnati OH, 100 miles apart; Los Angeles and San Diego CA, 111 miles apart. Just a tad over the 115-mile mark are Columbus and Cleveland OH, 124 miles apart. (These lists are not intended to be exhaustive, merely representative; the distances are from the Geobytes City Distance Tool.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that it can be seriously misleading to say that your company is based at location X when in fact it's based at location Y, even if Y is not far from X or is in Y's cultural orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: "in its cultural orbit". I imagine that David Johnson would like to claim that he can say that his company is based in Atlanta because Atlanta is the largest city near the tiny town of Blairsville (though Knoxville TN is 122 miles from Blairsville). But thinking this way would allow all sorts of mischievous misrepresentation. For instance, a company with its headquarters in Auburn AL could represent itself as "based in Atlanta" (a mere 106 miles away from Auburn).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might have been useful for Johnson to refer to Atlanta in some way in locating his company. (Who knows about Blairsville, after all?) Or he could have said that the company is located in Union County, at the very northern edge of Georgia. But saying that the company is located in Atlanta just won't do, and trying to deflect criticism of this claim by saying it's all a matter of semantics won't do either.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm quite happy about that, given certain dietary indiscretions.  I'm finding that as my diet improves overall, these indiscretions don't have quite the negative impact I might expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for exercise, well, a wind storm kept me up last night so I got up and rode the stationary bike.  I guess I can keep doing that.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I experimented in the kitchen last night.  I picked up some fresh fish and veggies to experiment with some ideas.  I fried up a couple of chopped up slices of bacon and tossed in the beet greens with some salt, pepper, hot sauce, and a pinch of sugar.  I peeled the beets and cut them into french fry slices, tossed them in salt, pepper, and olive oil, and roasted them.  Then I lightly floured the catfish and sauteed it.   I was basically going for a very rustic but soul-inspired meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greens were great, but a bit too earthy (I tossed in some turnip greens with the beet greens).  A little more hot sauce and sugar helped them along.  The beets were good, but actually too sweet for my taste.  The catfish was my biggest failure.  I made them essentially the same way I would trout or whitefish.  Catfish doesn't do subtle.  I should have breaded it more aggressively, perhaps cut the filets in two, and spiced them up a lot more.  Oh well.  It was still fun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/bmi_tmi---weekly_update.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/e9N3V4lG75c" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254937053944"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/10/5th_century_rune_stone_found.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/09519030294bfc56</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">5th Century Rune Stone Found</title><published>2009-10-07T14:56:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-07T14:56:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/3uHIiXVydkA/5th_century_rune_stone_found.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/10/5th_century_rune_stone_found.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/10/5th_century_rune_stone_found/DSC00792.jpg" width="500" height="435" alt="DSC00792.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most rune stones are written with the late 16-character futhark and date from the 11th century when the Scandies had largely been Christianised. Their inscriptions tend to be formulaic: "Joe erected the stone after Jim his father who was a very good man". But by that time, runic writing was already 900 years old. It's just that inscriptions in the early 24-character futhark are much less common. And when you find them, their messages are usually far less straight-forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My buddy Frans Arne Stylegar reports in a series of blog entries [&lt;a href="http://arkeologi.blogspot.com/2009/09/hogganviksteinen-en-forelpig-melding.html"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://arkeologi.blogspot.com/2009/10/ek-naudigastir-mer-om-hogganviksteinen.html"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://arkeologi.blogspot.com/2009/10/blog-post.html"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://arkeologi.blogspot.com/2009/10/hva-slags-sted-er-hogganvik.html"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://arkeologi.blogspot.com/2009/10/hogganviksteinen-reist-eller-ikke.html"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;] on the discovery, less than two weeks ago, of a 5th century rune stone at Hogganvik in Mandal municipality, Vest-Agder county, Norway. Nothing similar has been found in Norway since WW2. And it's an exceptionally &lt;i&gt;long&lt;/i&gt; inscription -- 63 runes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message hasn't received detailed philological treatment yet, but so much is clear that the stone was erected by one Naudigastir in memory of a man who may have been his proto-feudal lord (or was it the other way around?). It is thus the same genre of memorial text as the 11th century rune stones that are so common in the Stockholm and Uppsala area. And it's going to give the runologists a lot to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, they &lt;a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/2009/09/29/how-races-and-religions-match-in-online-dating/"&gt;released a few more charts&lt;/a&gt; that are revealing both for what they tell us and don’t tell us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a lot of people put their astrological sign on their dating profile.  You would assume that some of them take it seriously enough to &lt;em&gt;actively seek out people&lt;/em&gt; with whom they’re “compatible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens when you take a random sampling of 500,000 users and check out the “match percentages” between users with different signs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just for some background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A match percentage between two people is a condensed, yet statistically valid, expression of how well they might get along. 75% is very high, 45% is very low, and &lt;strong&gt;60.2% is the site-wide average&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So people whose stars are “correctly” aligned should see a &lt;em&gt;higher-than-average&lt;/em&gt; match percentage, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s find out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/races_and_religions/Match-By-Zodiac-Title.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/races_and_religions/Match-By-Zodiac-Title.png" title="OkCupid" width="485" height="508"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what you’re thinking: two Aquarians should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s be clear: there’s &lt;em&gt;no statistical difference&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to compatibility regardless of your zodiac sign! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people ask you for your sign, tell them you’re not interested in breeding and move on.  You’ll be doing us all a favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting chart is the one below, regarding how adamantly you take your belief system.  Are you very serious about whatever you believe?  Or are you laughing about it because you don’t take it that seriously at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/races_and_religions/Match-By-Attitude.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/races_and_religions/Match-By-Attitude.png" title="LaughingAboutIt" width="418" height="410"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary explains it well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As it turns out, people who hold their beliefs lightly are much better liked, &lt;em&gt;even by people who are themselves serious&lt;/em&gt;. Weird huh? While it’s true that the most serious women believers slightly prefer their men to not be “laughing about it”, every other slice of this data indicates that the less serious (or more flexible?) you are about your religious beliefs, the better you get along.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This applies to atheism, too.  The more serious you are about it, the less people are interested in you.  You’re just not as fun to be around as someone who simply brushes religion aside like it’s a whim of the masses.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also amused by the stat that Jewish guys get along with people from &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; religious faiths — in fact, they have higher compatibility with Muslim woman than Muslim men!  (There’s irony for you.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have these trends played out in your personal life at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you prefer dating someone who took their belief system super-seriously?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Swedish Research Council requires free access to research results.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to receive research grants the Research council requires now that researchers publish their material freely accessible to all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general public and other researchers shall have free access to all material financed by public funding,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thought behind the so called  Open Access  is that everybody shall have free and unlimited access to scientifically refereed articles, The Research Council has now decided, that researchers who are granted research funding from the Council shall publish  their refereed texts in journals and at conferences in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are of the opinion that texts presenting research funded by public funds shall be freely available to all," says professor Pär Omling Director General of the Swedish Research Council. "Open Access is an important prerequisite for the dissemination of research results to the benefit of society."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers are required to guarantee that everything published shall be freely available according to to Open Access not later than six months after publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council's decision regarding Open Access has been taken in close cooperation with SUHF, the Association of Swedish Higher Education. To promote free dissemination of research results is not and isolated Swedish occurrence, The so called Berlin Declaration aiming to implement Open Access has been signed by several  large, mainly European  research funders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Open Access-mandate covers so far only refereed journal articles and conference reports, not monographs and book chapters. The mandate will be included in the new grant conditions from 2010..&lt;br&gt;

As people were leaving the venue and heading out to the bar, I asked fellow Skepchick Tracy King if I could have the last caramel KitKat at the concessions stand. You see, we don’t have caramel KitKats in the US and so I was desperate to try this delicious chimera. She said no because she wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So pretty much the whole event was awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pewari/3985094696/in/pool-99835195@N00"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2529/3985094696_6e1415dc72_m.jpg" alt="Tim Minchin at TAM London" width="240" height="188"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Just kidding! It was &lt;strong&gt;fabulous&lt;/strong&gt;—so fabulous that I can’t wait to see what Tracy and the JREF are able to do next year when things get bigger and better. The speakers were wonderful, with standout performances like Tim Minchin playing a few songs on a gorgeous piano and giving a sneak preview of his upcoming short movie &lt;em&gt;Storm&lt;/em&gt;. Brian Cox delivered a smart (but not so smart it left us non-physicists behind) talk on the CERN and the beauty of the universe, and Jon Ronson spoke about his experiences researching his book &lt;em&gt;The Men Who Stare at Goats&lt;/em&gt;, soon to be a giant hit of a movie. Richard Wiseman held the entire show together with his usual level of hilarity and magical awesomeness. Robin Ince delivered a bonus night of music and comedy that knocked my socks off, seeing as he managed to convince nearly the entire audience to hang out from 9am until 11pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had one regret, it was that I didn’t have a lot of time to hang with other delegates. I spent a lot of the weekend helping out behind the scenes, traveling back and forth, and being really exhausted while dealing with a sore throat. Everyone I met was lovely, and I wish I’d had the energy to talk more. Next year, I won’t have just completed a trans-Atlantic move, so I should be a bit more chipper.&lt;/p&gt;

We decided that there were so many cool people there that the best thing to do was to drag them into a tiny closet and spend a few minutes goofing around. You’ll be able to hear the results in three places: Neil’s edited audio will go on Little Atoms, my edited audio will go on The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe, and the bawdier bits that are unfit for mainstream broadcast will be posted here on Skepchick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, what’s that? You demand audio right now? Fine. Just stop yelling.&lt;/p&gt;

This is important because it is really hard to study albatross at open sea, and virtually impossible to follow individuals one might like to track from, say, a nesting grounds out many miles (they fly fast and far).  By attaching cameras, temperature and depth gauges to the birds one gets some VERY interesting results.&lt;/p&gt;

However, I had another month of increased hits on the blog and I'm not prepared to increase my estimate as to how many regular readers I have to &lt;strong&gt;fourteen&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The most popular post of the month was this one:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/franken_talks_down_angry_mob_a.php"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Franken talks down angry mob at State Fair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... which in turn sparked a Fark Event (or some such thing) over at Dusty Trice's blog and put him on the map.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very popular post was this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/help_us_name_our_baby.php"&gt;Help us name our baby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... in which you gave us lots of great suggestions, and I'm sure we'll use every one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very popular as well were &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/caster_semenyas_gender_what_wo.php"&gt;Caster Semenya's Gender: What would the science be?&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/a_word_about_civility_joe_wils.php"&gt;Joe Wilson's outburst is not about civility.

&lt;p&gt;I particularly liked, and so did you (and by "like" I mean in some cases "dislike") &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/what_is_the_placebo_effect_and.php"&gt;What is the Placebo Effect, and it it getting stronger?&lt;/a&gt;  That particular post is extra interesting because it is about a paper on the topic, and the author of the paper joined in the discussion.  If you've not seen it, go check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September was also the month that I produced most of the Falsehoods Posts (and more are coming!).  Here is a list of them so far:&lt;/p&gt;

And as mentioned before, none of these changes are readily apparent when obesity is being measured by BMI or waist circumference alone, which are the most common measures used in the field (and which are pretty accurate in their own right).

But wait - it&amp;#39;s not all bad news.  As part of his PhD thesis, Dr Davidson has previously shown that exercise is able to reduce total fat and visceral fat, as well as dramatically improving metabolic risk and functional health in elderly men and women.  So while normal ageing is associated with detrimental changes in body fat distribution, exercise can dramatically reduce these effects.  For what it&amp;#39;s worth, Dr Davidson&amp;#39;s work has also shown that a combination of aerobic and resistance exercise is the ideal strategy for improving both metabolic and functional health in the elderly.  It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be intense (Peter and I helped oversee the resistance exercise in that study, and it was very low intensity for some individuals), but it can have a large impact on your quality of life.  Remember - no matter what your age, it&amp;#39;s never too late to improve your health with a little exercise....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

For definitional purposes, I consider 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) to be what is considered by the vast majority of consumers to be canonical &amp;quot;Ecstasy&amp;quot;. 

It is reasonably well-established in the peer reviewed literature and the ecstasydata.org harm reduction effort that some fraction of Ecstasy that is distributed contains non-MDMA psychoactive compounds either in addition to, or replacement for, MDMA. There are, however, some nagging questions because the published data are spotty. One topic of interest to me is that of selection bias. Tablet analyses are published either from samples turned in by Ecstasy consumers or those obtained by law enforcement seizures. In the former case there is a reasonable case to be made that perhaps Ecstasy found to result in suspicious subjective effects on the user are submitted to harm reduction sites preferentially. In the case of law enforcement seizure, well, the ones that got caught are by definition not on the street for sale. And you can make up a whole list of other caveats about why the published analyses might not accurately reflect the picture of what is actually being consumed. 

A recent paper doesn&amp;#39;t nail down every complaint but at least it compares samples submitted willingly and unwillingly by the consumer.

&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;*****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" src="http://img246.imageshack.us/img246/5312/photo445rw7.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="171"&gt; It’s been a little while since I’ve gone in depth on this topic, so it’s probably a good opportunity for a recap! Especially after just having read &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9780198568773"&gt;Tall Tales About The Mind And Brain: Separating Fact From Fiction&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; edited by Sergio Della Sala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;I’m pulling together the literature review for my dissertation on beliefs of high school students in pseudoscience and the paranormal. I’d like to point out that I strongly avoid using the word/s ‘woo’ or ‘woo woo’ (even though I know that it’s sometimes popular when talking about belief in superstitions) because I’ve found too often that the judgmental elements inherent in it can detract from objectivism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;For my own part, nothing turns me off more than the ‘&lt;em&gt;they’re just crazy!&lt;/em&gt;‘ attitude, especially calling the beliefs ‘crazy’ - as &lt;a href="http://podblack.wordpress.com/2008/02/22/skepticism-and-scholarship-dr-mark-henn/"&gt;Dr Mark Henn&lt;/a&gt; wrote for my blog:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is, in my opinion, quite possible to be an ardent believer in paranormal phenomena, even in one’s own paranormal abilities, through perfectly normal learning. If your own experience suggests psychic ability (say, you remember several dreams which, in retrospect, seem predictive of future events)… if you ask the best experts you know, and they verify it (say, your trusted school teachers and/or parents and/or members of your church or community)… if you have never been taught about confirmation bias, or about sensation, perception, memory, cognition… then your best explanation is a paranormal one. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;To insist “there must be a mundane explanation” when your experience, your experts, and your learning all argue otherwise, is closed-minded (mind you, it would be correct… but for all the wrong reasons. And skepticism is a process, not an outcome).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;It’s a struggle when particularly irked by some beliefs, but certainly something to keep in mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;Recently a &lt;a href="http://podblack.wordpress.com/2008/04/08/potential-psychic-claims-crackdown-in-uk/"&gt;commentator&lt;/a&gt; on my blog entry about the recent discussion in the UK on legislating psychics, proposed the following theory: they’re a self-professed psychic who appears to claim that she provides a service that the police, psychologists, et al, don’t or cannot fulfill -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reason that psychics use our gifts, is to help those in need who have been failed by other organizations, not to make FAST CASH! …Is it not possible that the services psychics and healers provide are not only helping with health issues, we are also helping people who are worrying themselves sick from having a nervous breakdown?… I hope there comes a day when people realize, that if they don’t want to consult a psychic…they shouldn’t make the call in the first place!!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;So, there’s several elements here that could be broken down as to why this sort of comment would be made, why people will choose to go to a psychic and why a ‘psychic’ would think that they can run a business with impunity. Much of it will take longer than one blog post… so here’s to the book reviews first!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;Firstly my own study on paranormal beliefs isn’t particularly unique, but it will help me to sort out a few questions that have bugged me about particular published papers and books. The age range I’ve chosen is a little different to the majority of papers I’ve found (such as this one for a &lt;a title="pdf link" href="http://stoutinfo.uwstout.edu/lib/thesis/2002/2002lewisc.pdf"&gt;Masters of Science degree by Chad M. Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, using n=101 graduates and undergraduates; 36 males and 65 females between the ages of 18-25 - “&lt;em&gt;There was no significant difference between males and females on whether they thought there was more to life than the physical world. An independent sample t-test indicated that females were significantly more spiritual than males on all other measures.&lt;/em&gt;“)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;Oh, by the way - the picture is of me holding a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkie_(chocolate_bar)"&gt;Yorkie bar&lt;/a&gt; along with the books I’ll discuss. Yes, that is how they advertise that product: ‘&lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; for girls!’ Rather a sexist statement for a humble candy bar… but it does lead me to wonder if it’s as easy to call women ‘more superstitious’. &lt;em&gt;Are&lt;/em&gt; females more superstitious or not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;Here’s a fairly well-known segment from Dr Michael Shermer’s book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/People-Believe-Weird-Things-Pseudoscience/dp/0716733870"&gt;Why People Believe Weird Things,&lt;/a&gt; on gender and belief:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In many ways the orthogonal relationship of intelligence and beliefs is not unlike that of gender and beliefs. With the surge of popularity of psychic mediums… at any given gathering (usually at large hotel conference rooms holding several hundred people, each of whom paid several hundred dollars to be there), that the vast majority (at least 75%) are women.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;Little side note - do you remember Jon Ronson of the Guardian newspaper’s investigation of the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/oct/27/usa.jonronson"&gt;Sylvia Browne ‘psychic sessions’ on a cruise ship tour?&lt;/a&gt; You’ll also see that the predominant accounts he gives are of female attendees too. So, to me that isn’t too much of an unreasonable statement to make initially. I do, however, urge more surveys of such psychic (and certainly skeptic) events for the benefit of further research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understandably, journalists inquire whether women, therefore, are more superstitious or less rational than men, who typically disdain such mediums and scoff at the notion of talking to the dead. Indeed, a number of studies have found that women hold more superstitious beliefs and accept more paranormal phenomena as real than men….&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The problem here is with limited sampling… For a &lt;strong&gt;variety of reasons&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;related to the subject matter&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;style of reasoning&lt;/strong&gt;, creationism, revisionism and UFOlogy &lt;strong&gt;are guy beliefs&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;[my emphasis]&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;I’d like to point out something here that might be overlooked: the publication date of this book. When Shermer was writing this text for the second time (the green-cover version you may know - oh, I discovered today there’s a new black-cover reprint out!) it was revised from its original 1997 publication and published in 2002. I have both copies here. In the first edition, sex differences are not mentioned when he discusses the Gallop poll of 1991 (p.26); in the 2002 edition, he discusses the 1974 study and a 1983 study (p.289).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;Here’s where people might jump to the false conclusion that Shermer is talking about ‘guy beliefs’ on the basis of observations made about&lt;em&gt; the conferences alone. &lt;/em&gt;After all, he did say ‘&lt;em&gt;for a variety of reasons&lt;/em&gt;‘ - &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘because I went to a conference and this is how I conclude about what I saw on that alone’!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;For a start, Shermer’s already referenced two studies in that section (the previously mentioned Blum and Blum, 1974; Tobacyk and Milford, 1983) that do &lt;em&gt;support&lt;/em&gt; that men tend towards one set of beliefs more than women. In addition, in the Bibliography, he references Alcock and Otis (1980); a 1991 Gallup poll; Hay and Morisy (1978 ) in the UK; McGarry and Newberry (1981) and the ever-popular Vyse’s &lt;a href="http://books.google.com.au/books?id=QGysXzdTxo0C&amp;amp;dq=vyse+believing+in+magic&amp;amp;pg=PP1&amp;amp;ots=nrqczLgP4F&amp;amp;sig=Jf4m7TS68Vc2iMQcGUQ_C5MDIvY&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;prev=http://www.google.com.au/search?q=vyse+believing+in+magic&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=print&amp;amp;ct=title&amp;amp;cad=one-book-with-thumbnail"&gt;‘&lt;em&gt;Believing in Magic&lt;/em&gt;‘&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1997).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;So, although Shermer doesn’t expand on his point as to “&lt;em&gt;guy beliefs&lt;strong&gt;” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;in detail, studies that would have been available prior to 2002 when he wrote the book include evidence that indeed indicate that women hold stronger beliefs in superstitions (Blum, 1976; Blum &amp;amp; Blum, 1974; Emme, 1940; Scheidt, 1973), astrology (Clarke, 1991; Emmons &amp;amp; Sobal, 1981; Salter &amp;amp; Routledge, 1971; Za’rour, 1972), hauntings (Haraldsson, 1985) psychic healing (Gray, 1990) and reincarnation (Gray, 1990).&lt;img style="float:right" src="http://www.skeptic.com/Merchant2/graphics/books/b062PB_lg.jpg" alt="" width="176" height="279"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;In addition, research of that time period would also back up the assertion that men have relatively stronger beliefs in UFOs (Clarke, 1991; Gray, 1990) and in extraordinary life forms such as the Loch Ness monster (Tobacyk &amp;amp; Milford, 1983; Tobacyk &amp;amp; Pirttila-Backman, 1992); creationism and pro-centrist views (Harrold &amp;amp; Eve, 1987; Gallup 1991).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;How much research he’s seen on the subject and studies done &lt;em&gt;since&lt;/em&gt; 2002 might influence a possible future edition of this book - such as the 2005 Gallup poll which &lt;a href="http://home.sandiego.edu/~baber/logic/gallup.html"&gt;“shows &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;statistically significant differences among people by age, gender, education, race, and region of the country”&lt;/a&gt;. But certainly at this point I can see how the book would categorise certain beliefs as being more ‘female-friendly’. Certainly more female-friendly than the label on my Yorkie bar!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;He then goes on:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;… so while gender is related to the target of one’s beliefs, [e.g - it appears to be unrelated to the process of believing… There are no differences between men and women in the power of belief, only in what they choose to believe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left" src="http://orlandonest.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/crystal-ball.jpg" alt="" width="151" height="210"&gt;I could easily point out more anecdotal examples (&lt;em&gt;sheesh&lt;/em&gt;!) to match Shermer’s and to join the earlier Ronson experience - because in Mary Roach’s ‘&lt;em&gt;Spook&lt;/em&gt;‘ where her account in Chapter 7 (’Soul in a Dunce Cap - The Author Enrolls in a Medium School’) she primarily writes of the experiences of interacting with other &lt;em&gt;male&lt;/em&gt; participants at the ‘Fundamentals of Mediumship’ course. Yet &lt;a href="http://www.skepbitch.wordpress.com"&gt;Dr Karen Stollznow&lt;/a&gt;, in the most recent &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/journal/2007/2007.htm"&gt;Australian Skeptic Journal&lt;/a&gt;, writes in &lt;em&gt;‘How To Communicate With Murder Victims’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; about attending the course of Nancy Bradley, mentions that there’s just a ’sole male psychic’ at the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;‘The powerful belief/s’ is there regardless of sex - but I still wonder about what creates that belief which is discussed in a great variety of ways and and described quite differently at times in the papers I read. What makes ‘the choices’ happen in the first place?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;As for limited sampling, I’d agree that a greater understanding as to why conferences apparently garner such enthusiasm with men and whether factors like child-rearing, female-orientated lectures, et al, play a part in whether or not women attend. But then better research into conferences held by non-believers in the paranormal is &lt;a href="http://podblack.wordpress.com/2008/03/18/why-dragoncon/"&gt;something I’ve discussed before too!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;So, since I’ve gone into Shermer’s ‘&lt;em&gt;Weird Things&lt;/em&gt;‘, which is clearly a useful reference text with &lt;a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/a_book_list_for_evolutionists/"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.margaretdowney.com/books_tree_of_knowledge"&gt;sites’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/9809/weird.html"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://physics.mercer.edu/curriculum/syllabi/f06/sci105balduz(f06).htm"&gt;college&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/criticalThinking/resources.asp"&gt;book-lists&lt;/a&gt; referring to it, I’d like to mention another older but just as useful reference text recommended to me by a friend - &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=b39Udl6qY30C&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PR9&amp;amp;dq=%22Zusne%22+%22Anomalistic+Psychology:+A+Study+of+Magical+Thinking%22+&amp;amp;ots=BTCWo7pjoR&amp;amp;sig=OHFTSS6gxKe5cwQQfX6Ewbvbso4"&gt;Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Extraordinary Phenomena of Behaviour and Experience&lt;/a&gt; by Leonard Zusne and Warren H. Jones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left" src="http://www.enricobaccarini.com/anom02.jpg" alt="" width="91" height="140"&gt;Apparently (like &lt;a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/olinuris/ref/psych113_01je.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weird Things&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) it has been used as a &lt;a href="http://classes.skepdic.com/phil322.html"&gt;reference text&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a title="pdf link" href="http://www2.truman.edu/~edis/courses/JINS/syllabus.pdf"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; courses that &lt;a href="http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/ap0902/sacrifice.htm"&gt;discuss elements&lt;/a&gt; of pseudoscience and the paranormal and is up to its second edition (I’m holding the first in the photo, but got the second - &lt;em&gt;‘…A Study of Magical Thinking’&lt;/em&gt; - from the library… oddly, it’s much smaller the second time around!).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;It’s got a wide range of topics and a great historical scope (about on par with Katz’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Occult-Tradition-Renaissance-Present-Day/dp/0224061658"&gt;The Occult Tradition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) - yet since I’m also seeking information on more contemporary ideas about beliefs and how newer technologies influence these… well, it was then I was pleased to discover what I think is a great modern addition to the ‘basics’ provided in Zusne and Jones’ work in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9780198568773"&gt;Tall Tales About The Mind And Brain: Separating Fact From Fiction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;I first picked up &lt;em&gt;‘Tall Tales About the Mind and Brain’&lt;/em&gt; because it featured an essay co-authored by Dr Krissie Wilson, who I interviewed for the &lt;a href="http://www.tankvodcast.wordpress.com"&gt;TANK Vodcast at the Australian Skeptics Hobart Convention&lt;/a&gt;, ‘Cognitive factors underlying paranormal beliefs and experiences.’ This particular essay draws upon the elements that have been shown through various studies of beliefs that point towards ‘characteristics in general’ of believers in the paranormal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Tall Tales…’&lt;/em&gt; features a very cohesive and well-structured introduction to the studies on what contributing factors there could be. I was particularly impressed by the references - including Irwin’s research into correlations between paranormal belief and a deficit in syllogistic reasoning; Brugger and Graves’ use of a computer game in showing how believers of the paranormal jump too readily to conclusions; tendency to see patterns and meaning in noisy and random stimulus arrays by Pizzagalli &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;; French on false memory susceptibility in paranormal believers and the correlation between transliminality (&lt;a href="http://www.parapsych.org/members/m_thalbourne.html"&gt;Thalborne, 2003&lt;/a&gt;: ‘a hypothesised tendency for psychological material to cross - &lt;em&gt;trans &lt;/em&gt;- the threshold - &lt;em&gt;limen &lt;/em&gt;- into and out of consciousness’).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;I was particularly interested in how the text mentions that&lt;em&gt; ‘we are guilty of similar sins when we praise in skeptical publications ubsubstantiated claims solely because they come from our friends… cases in point are Susan Blackmore’s memes or Richard Wiseman’s Luck Factor’&lt;/em&gt; - something that I had wondered about since I knew of some questions &lt;a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_5_27/ai_108114822"&gt;about the validity of ‘thinking lucky’ if you’re unable to achieve long-term residence in one location&lt;/a&gt; from the letters page of the &lt;em&gt;Skeptical Inquirer&lt;/em&gt;, so I’ll have to ask more about that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;One of the highlights was the very informative chapter by the late Barry Beyerstein on ‘The neurology of the weird: brain states and anomalous experience’, with its emphasis on how the ‘&lt;em&gt;study of anomalous subjective phenomena that are experienced by ostensibly normal individuals’&lt;/em&gt; (no ‘crazy woo believers’ there!), fantasy prone-individuals, how rarely we consider dreams (’vivid hallucinations’) comprising one-twelfth of our lives and the role of brain composition. I wonder how he might have reacted to the February 2008 paper ‘&lt;a href="http://jocn.mitpress.org/cgi/content/abstract/20/1/182"&gt;Using Neuroimaging to Resolve the Psi Debate’ (Moulton &amp;amp; Kosslyn, 2008):&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the present study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used in an effort ot document the existence of psi. … The researchers concluded: ‘&lt;strong&gt;These findings are the strongest evidence yet obtained against the existence of paranormal mental phenomena.&lt;/strong&gt;‘ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;As you can probably guess, I just really enjoyed the variety in the book as a whole - bilingual minds, foreign accents, gay genes and the Mozart effect! I was particularly amused by the debunking of the &lt;a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/news2006-rst/3367.html"&gt;‘coma scene in Kill Bill’ that lead to Wijdicks’ paper in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; Very reminiscent of the studies that were presented at the 2007 World Science and Technology Education conference by &lt;a href="http://podblack.wordpress.com/2008/02/07/silver-screen-science-slip-ups/"&gt;Biotechnology Australia on the misrepresentation of cloning in movies&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;Not surprisingly with a pedigree that includes articles previously published in the &lt;em&gt;Skeptical Inquirer,&lt;/em&gt; I would suggest this as a very useful reference in terms of a contemporary look at many of the issues that have arisen from the traditional anomalistic beliefs discussed in Zusne and Jones’ book. I hope it reaches a few students doing college courses the same way Shermer’s and Zusne and Jones’ texts have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well - like I said last week about &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/podblack.com/2009/.../hungry-beast-abc-tv-that-could-b-better/"&gt;Hungry Beast’s first episode&lt;/a&gt; - I’m still at a loss with this ABC TV show. Is it because they’re trying to cram too much &lt;a href="http://hungrybeast.abc.net.au/"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2523/3886098804_b3d4dec4c6.jpg" alt="" width="302" height="210"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;content with too many disparate elements? I still can only keep track of one or two of the presenters, mostly because I like one of them in particular. However, now I don’t see &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; difference between:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web-Content-Director-of-Fun-Lollies-and-Origami-Cut-Outs or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reporter-on-Scene-with-Rather-Distracting-Wacky-Hair and/or Hat (plural, I might add) or even&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Head-of-Governance-and-Editing-Bright-Shiny-Graphics-That-Bounce-Appealingly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; reporting. Everyone. Was that the point? I think there were some new people in the mix too. I couldn’t be sure. They might have been swapping hair-styles to distract us like some televisual &lt;a href="http://hungrybeast.abc.net.au/"&gt;Hungry Beast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrw3euF2cIg"&gt;cups-and-balls-trick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the inclusion of serious content, reporter (web-content creator? editor? producer? tinker? tailor?) Elmo Keep spoke about how when ‘we decided to do the story (on the death of a soldier last week) …because we wanted to know more’. Well, I guess that’s a reason. Kind of. Errr…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessicah Mendes then introduces another interview on another case of an Australian lost in military service overseas…  yet I’m more confused than I was last week. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; takes some doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I also love the Beatles - but if I have to follow a scatter-gun story of a non-piano-playing-piano-player grumbling bitterly about them being overexposed in the media (&lt;em&gt;That’s&lt;/em&gt; news? My gran was grumbling that back in the 70s! And not even a funny song to accompany you?) straight after that tragic tale? Speaking of which, it was preceeded with a humourous but rushed science-based tale (graphically well illustrated, mind, um… not in THAT way…) which gave the impression that ‘one study helps demonstrate that the rumours of sperm decline due to tight pants isn’t true’ (yes, studies like ‘&lt;a href="http://www.jurology.com/article/S0022-5347(01)62528-X/abstract"&gt;Are Boxer Shorts Really Better? A Critical Analysis of the Role of Underwear Type in Male Subertility&lt;/a&gt;‘,&lt;em&gt; The Journal of Urology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Volume 160, Issue 4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;October 1998 &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;‘&lt;a href="http://www.urologic.theclinics.com/article/S0094-0143(08)00002-5/abstract"&gt;Declining Worldwide Sperm Counts: Disproving a Myth&lt;/a&gt;‘,&lt;em&gt; Urologic Clinics of North America&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Volume 35, Issue 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;May 2008).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…Honestly, I’m not going to bother watching yet another serious report on the topic of Australians in the military in the future, no matter how emotionally invested the reporters are by the research. Because every time, it’s diluted by &lt;em&gt;teh funny.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe again it’s the mixture of genres that are familar to viewers who do enjoy current affairs and reportage which are being turned into hit-the-ground-running soundbites rather than fully-fleshed items? Are they &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/www.abc.net.au/mediawatch"&gt;Media Watch&lt;/a&gt; - urging us to dob in Nestle for fruit-rollups, question our banks ‘giving’ us money and just how environmentally friendly &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; mining industry advertisement claims?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are they trying to be like the old SBS’s Vox Pop with a street-segment done in some of the most notoriously ‘bogan’ coastal towns in NSW (who then proceed to challenge the racist stereotypes, amusingly enough)? Which is then followed by a ‘what’s up next week’ with one of their reporters doing a Jewish mother-in-law impersonation in shadow-play. WTF?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s too many reporters, too many ideas, not enough time to get them across without them clashing like personalities. Again, I feel like I just spent half an hour on Twitter idly chasing links after someone posts &lt;em&gt;‘I’m bored at work - give me something to entertain me while the boss is in a meeting’. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Previous unfounded scare-mongering about the side effects of vaccines have always resulted in measurable declines in vaccination rates, which have always translated directly into additional deaths or cases of disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mid 1970s, unjustified concerns about whooping cough vaccine resulted in a decline in vaccination coverage in the UK from over 75% to below 40%. As a consequence, there were several outbreaks of pertussis, and in the intervening 12 year period (until vaccination rates increased to over 75% again and there were few recorded deaths from pertussis), there had been nearly &lt;a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&amp;amp;HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1195733837440?p=1191942148402"&gt;a third of a million cases and 62 deaths.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MMR debacle, which was almost entirely media-generated, saw &lt;a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAweb&amp;amp;HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1195733819251"&gt;a drop in vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; in the under twos from over 90% in England and Wales (around the threshold required to provide good herd immunity) to 80% in 2004, and vaccine coverage is still struggling to recover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result there have been significant measles outbreaks (which are still ongoing), measles has once again been declared to be endemic in Britain and our country has been identified as a major exporter of clinical measles, turning the once-achievable goal of eradication of measles in Europe into an impossible pipe dream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been at least 2 deaths in England from acute measles (the last death before that having been over 15 years previously), and dozens of deaths across Europe. Many of the tens of thousands of children who have suffered measles will also go on to develop a fatal form of chronic encephalitis in their later years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the media has turned its focus onto human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine, which prevents infection with oncogenic strains of virus that can cause cancer. &lt;a href="http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/cervix/?a=5441"&gt;Cervical carcinoma&lt;/a&gt; is still a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in women, and one of the tragedies is that it should not occur at all. Cervical screening should pick up suspicious lesions before they turn malignant, allowing women to get curative treatment. But despite a vigorous national screening programme, there are still around 3000 cases of this disease and nearly 1000 deaths each year (nearly 3 every day). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around half of all sexually active women will become infected with HPV in their lifetime. &lt;a href="http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/Vaccines/HPV"&gt;HPV vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, by preventing infection with 2 of the viral strains that cause over 70% of cervical cancers, is widely predicted to reduce the incidence of disease and save the lives of about 400 women each year. The recent uptake of HPV vaccine has been 70% among adolescent girls, the targeted vaccination group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous scurrilous tales about supposed reactions to HPV vaccine have ensured that this would never be 100%, but the main obstacles to vaccination have been from the “conscientious objectors” who have decreed that having their children vaccinated is a recipe for moral fecklessness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But following the most recent fevered exposés of “side effects” from the HPV vaccine (which in reality are merely entirely coincidental or fabricated illnesses), the HPV vaccine coverage will undoubtedly plummet. Certain sections of our media, which are willing to print any story true or not in order to fulfil an agenda will ensure that eventuality, and to hell with the consequences for public health and society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say the vaccine coverage drops by a quarter as a result of the media campaign against the vaccine. This means that an additional 100 women will die sometime in the foreseeable future, and will continue to do so each year until vaccine rates improve again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But will anyone pay attention to the damage? The consequences of his actions are likely to remain completely invisible to journalists such as the “Daily Mail Reporter” (who anonymously fronts up every shock story). He probably will not even realise, that in 15 years time when one of his relatives (perhaps even a daughter) is diagnosed with cancer, that he bears a large portion of that responsibility. Or if not cervical cancer, maybe a nephew with measles encephalitis, or a granddaughter with meningococcal meningitis, for he holds all vaccines in similar contempt, and delights in persuading his readers to do likewise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phoney propaganda war that some tabloids are waging against vaccines is criminally irresponsible, and it can have only one outcome; the destruction of the public’s confidence in what are truly remarkable and life-saving innovations. The end result can only be more disease and death, something I am becoming distressingly familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

(Not to be confused with the National Day of Prayer, which is a yearly political stunt with ties to Focus on the Family.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In honor of it, the Campus Crusade for Christ chapter at Indiana University – Bloomington prayed for 24 straight hours…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secular Alliance of IU &lt;a href="http://saiu.org/2009/10/06/international-day-of-prayer/"&gt;had a response ready to go&lt;/a&gt;.  They put up flyers advertising their upcoming meetings that countered the notion that the prayers would be helpful to others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://saiu.org/2009/10/06/international-day-of-prayer/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/prayer-day-flyer.jpg" alt="prayer-day-flyer" title="prayer-day-flyer" width="550" height="712"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful.  It’s not just talk, either.  SAIU has service projects in the works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
SAIU plans on having multiple events throughout the semester which focus on the idea that “you can be good without God.”  Service events in conjunction with &lt;a href="http://www.pagestoprisoners.org/"&gt;Pages to Prisoners&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.mhcfoodpantry.org/"&gt;Mother Hubbard’s Cupboard&lt;/a&gt; have been planned so that members can reach out to the Bloomington community.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard for me to talk about this without making snarky comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice seems clear: Students who want to help make the community a better place should join the SAIU.  They take action.  Students who want to ask a god to do the work for them can join Campus Crusade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year, I’d love to see SAIU mount a real challenge.  Do a 24-hour service project while the prayers are in session.  Build something.  Fix something.  Raise money for a good cause.  Anything like that.  It would be a perfect, stark contrast to a day-long prayer session.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

(This is opposed to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy"&gt;naturalistic fallacy&lt;/a&gt;, which conversely states that what is natural must inherently be good)  It has been stated most succinctly as:  What ought to be, is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, we think of the moralistic fallacy primarily in two contexts:  One is the fallacious justification of a belief in God because "religion makes people happy" -- a premise whose truth or falsity I am not yet convinced of either way, but in any case, the conclusion does not follow from it anyway.  The other context where you often hear the moralistic fallacy is in regards to human nature, where, for example, it is insisted for political reasons that there is no biological differences in the brains of men and women, a claim which is demonstrably false.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a side note, a danger of the moralistic fallacy in the latter context is that we can lose track of the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; reason why what ought to be ought to be.  In the example I gave above, men and women should still be evaluated on equal terms&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; because a) individual variations are broad enough that judging by generalization rather than case-by-case is woefully inefficient, and b) in any case most of us (including me) would perceive it as grossly unfair to judge an individual based on generalizations.  Hinging our justification for equal treatment of women on the false idea that there are no biological gender differences is dangerous to say the least.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that's not what I want to talk about.  What I want to talk about is the possibility of nontheists and skeptics employing the moralistic fallacy, something we don't usually think about.  The reason I want to talk about this is because two events in the past twenty-four hours reminded me that we can be just as guilty of this fallacy as anyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first was a &lt;a href="http://brucemhood.wordpress.com/2009/10/06/sam-harris-disses-supersense/"&gt;post at Bruce Hood's blog&lt;/a&gt; where he discusses a &lt;a href="http://go2.wordpress.com/?id=725X1342&amp;amp;site=brucemhood.wordpress.com&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.plosone.org%2Farticle%2Finfo%3Adoi%252F10.1371%252Fjournal.pone.0007272"&gt;new paper in PLoS&lt;/a&gt; by Sam Harris, et al., that happens to mention Bruce's &lt;a href="http://brucemhood.wordpress.com/about-supersense/"&gt;SuperSense&lt;/a&gt; theory.  (I &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; have not read &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/SuperSense-Why-We-Believe-Unbelievable/dp/0061452645/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1254925797&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;the book&lt;/a&gt;, and now I'm bogged down in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393061310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1254925817&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Guns, Germs, and Steel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!)  I'll quote Bruce here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;However, Harris and colleagues’s discussion of my hypothesis (never a theory till proven) in the current paper that beliefs are a combination of intuitive reasoning embedded in culture is somewhat misrepresented...I was pleased that Harris and colleagues acknowledge the supersense hypothesis but a bit dismayed when they dismissed it with the straw man statement, “Whatever the evolutionary underpinnings of religion, it seems unlikely that there is a genetic explanation for the why the French, Swedes, and Japanese tend not to believe in the God of Abraham while Americans, Saudis, and Somalis do.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well dah. Come on Sam, I am not like the others. You didn’t read the book-did you? I made it perfectly clear that just as any child is innately endowed to acquire a language, there is no genetic basis for French. What we need to know is why some people believe and some don’t even when they are raised in the same exact environment. That cannot just be culture. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now this may not &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; be the moralistic fallacy in action -- it is possible that Harris et al grossly misinterpreted Bruce's work out of sloppiness or something.  But given some of the nasty responses regarding &lt;i&gt;SuperSense&lt;/i&gt;, I suspect that there is a tendency on the part of nontheists and antireligionists -- yes, even luminaries like Harris -- to think, "Well, religion is bad, therefore it cannot be natural!"  Surely Harris did not articulate it to himself as such, but I wonder if some similar impulse drove him to dismiss the SuperSense hypothesis without due consideration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I admit that I myself engage in a more guarded version of this, not so much in regards to the question of whether religion is "natural", but in regards to whether people "need" comforting illusions.  I take the position that, until I see convincing proof that people need these illusions, I will give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that adults are capable of living with reality.  I may turn out to be wrong, but this is my default position in the absence of highly convincing proof.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second event that got me to think was a guy over in some of the comment threads at Orac's blog -- whom I later suspected to be a troll, but he got me thinking anyway -- who was going on this huge attack about how "new atheists" are irrational, despite proclaiming to be an "old-school" atheist himself.  His central point was rather bizarre: he spent at least half a day arguing that memes are bullshit, that everyone &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; memes are bullshit, that even Dawkins knows memes are bullshit but that he employs them in anti-theistic arguments anyway, and that therefore any atheist who admired Dawkins for anything other than his strict biological work is just as irrational as any theist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's probably true that people of all stripes -- skeptics and atheists included -- are indeed rather irrational a shocking amount of the time... and judging by the reaction of folks who have read &lt;i&gt;SuperSense&lt;/i&gt;, I suspect when I finally get around to reading it, I may be rather disturbed at just how much.  Or maybe I already have an idea...  In any case, I don't dispute that point.  But I think the troll's argument is still a bit whack, and in any case, it is my feeling that the "new atheists" at least put a high value on rationality, and that even if we don't always succeed, that has to count for something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also mentioned to the troll that I thought another important difference was that atheists don't typically go around executing homosexuals, lopping off girls' clitorises, and crashing planes into buildings.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/my_last_entry_on_the_maher_issue_probabl.php#comment-1980881"&gt;His response&lt;/a&gt; had me really scratching my head:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;scientific studies have shown that religion has been shown to be a NEGATIVE predictor of violence and terrorism&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;He didn't bother to back this up with any links or citations, and I have a really, really, really hard time believing that religious belief is a negative predictor of &lt;i&gt;terrorism&lt;/i&gt; (the only secular terrorist I can think of off the top of my head is McVeigh.. and I suppose maybe Che Guevera and his ilk).  I do know some studies have shown religion to be a negative predictor of violence, but my impression has been that the data is mixed on this point (and in any case, as we all know, correlation does not prove causality, and I have heard it speculated that many of the apparent statistical benefits of religious belief only apply if your beliefs are the same as the norm in the society in which you inhabit, i.e. suggesting that the causality is more associated with the benefits of "going with the flow" than they are with religion per se).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the troll's comment got me thinking anyway.  I like to believe that atheism can be a positive and liberating philosophy.  I look around at all the religiously-motivated violence, all of the spiritually-motivated quackery, etc., and I feel like I am right.  But am I engaging in the moralistic fallacy here?  I admit that I have a rather strong distaste not only for religious delusions, but for the trappings of religion themselves.  Am I letting this distaste cloud my judgment?  Is there a part of me saying to myself, "Atheism ought to be a better way to live one's life than theism, therefore it is?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not at all sure.  And I think this is something we all ought to reflect on.  The falsity of religious belief is not in doubt.  But when we talk about the costs and benefits of religious belief, we should be careful not to let ourselves fall victim to the moralistic fallacy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;The one defensible exception is in regards to competitive sports, where biological differences give men such an innate advantage in sports relying on muscle strength, body size, etc., that a gender-neutral league would preclude many talented women from participating.  Even in that case, I generally favor a gender-neutral league running parallel to a women-only league, as opposed to there ever being a men-only league, thus still allowing women on the extremes of the bell curve to be judged as individuals and participate in the gender-neutral league.  In addition, it allows sports with a lot of variation in the physical requirements of each position to invite more women into the gender-neutral league, e.g. while I think even in a society perfectly unbiased about gender we would still rarely if ever see a female offensive guard in the NFL (the men who play this position are already on the very extreme ends of the bell curve for their gender in regards to body mass), I would not be surprised to see a female kicker in the NFL within the next couple of decades, and someday probably even female wide receivers, quarterbacks, defensive backs, maybe even situational tight ends and running backs.  Anyway, this is all a huge digression and not what I wanted to talk about!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-2748485613581461592?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254928466330"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/exploring_mercury_from_my_comp.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/330e9965d30507ae</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Solar System"/><title type="html">Exploring Mercury from my computer</title><published>2009-10-07T15:48:46Z</published><updated>2009-10-07T15:48:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/exploring_mercury_from_my_comp.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, there's a new &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/mercurys_massiveness.php"&gt;super-high resolution mosaic&lt;/a&gt; of the planet Mercury that's available.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/exploring_mercury_from_my_comp/MSGR_M2_Departure4_preview.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/exploring_mercury_from_my_comp/MSGR_M2_Departure4_preview.jpg" width="500" title="The official release photo... a 1024x1024 thumbnail, anyway." alt="MSGR_M2_Departure4_preview.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How high resolution is it?  Perhaps you should join me on my journey as I zoom in to the upper left hand corner.  (Click each image to view it full-size.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/exploring_mercury_from_my_comp/Merc_corner.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/exploring_mercury_from_my_comp/Merc_corner.jpg" width="500" title="Each image is about 20% the original area of the one before it." alt="Merc_corner.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mercury may look unevenly cratered, keep in mind that there's a trick of the light going on here.  When you're close to the limit of where the Sun's rays reach (the &lt;a href="http://astronomy.fm/aapod/2009-05-09_The-Terminator.html"&gt;terminator&lt;/a&gt;), angles are lower and shadows are longer, making craters appear more pronounced.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/exploring_mercury_from_my_comp/Merc_corner2.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/exploring_mercury_from_my_comp/Merc_corner2.jpg" width="500" title="Although the image is monochrome, I still think it does wonders for illuminating this distant world." alt="Merc_corner2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, there are "young" regions all over Mercury, where more recent lava activity has covered up old craters.  In regions that are young, only a few, relatively recent craters cover the surface.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/exploring_mercury_from_my_comp/Merc_corner3.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/exploring_mercury_from_my_comp/Merc_corner3.jpg" width="500" title="Now, *this* is starting to get detailed... but we&amp;#39;re not done yet!" alt="Merc_corner3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I've chosen an "old" area to zoom in on.  An area with craters atop craters atop craters.  And I find it absolutely spectacular.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/exploring_mercury_from_my_comp/Merc_corner4.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/exploring_mercury_from_my_comp/Merc_corner4.jpg" width="500" title="And you can zoom in even farther than this, but it only stretches the pixels." alt="Merc_corner4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

They never read it, though, or they&amp;#39;d notice that Commandment #2 says they shouldn&amp;#39;t worship graven idols…and actually, if they read them at all, they&amp;#39;d know that the only two that even come close to real laws in our nation are the ones that say don&amp;#39;t kill and don&amp;#39;t steal. The rest? Dross and superstition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town is being sued to have the nonsense removed, and of course the newspaper has to run a poll. Do you think that if we run this up to a good strong majority for removal that the city will send out a crew to dynamite the monstrosity?&lt;/p&gt;

The reason is simple. While I was busy going nuts over Bill Maher's receiving the Richard Dawkins Award, the anti-vaccine movement has been busy, and there are some things I need to address that had backed up while I was distracted. There's one more thing I need to address before I move on to other topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of months, I've noticed something about the anti-vaccine movement. Specifically, I've noticed that the mavens of pseudoscience that make up the movement seem to have turned their sights with a vengeance on the Hepatitis B vaccine. The reason for this, I believe, is fairly obvious. The fact that the Hep B vaccine is administered shortly after birth seems somehow to enrage the anti-vaccine movement more than just about any other vaccine. Moreover, given that, aside from maternal-child transmission when the mother is infected, hepatitis B is usually only contracted through either bloodborne contact (the sharing of needles, the administration of contaminated blood) or sexual activity, it's very easy for anti-vaccinationists to make a superficially plausible argument that it's not a necessary vaccine, even though there are &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=289"&gt;reasonable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=512"&gt;rationales&lt;/a&gt; for giving it to infants. The image of sticking a needle into a newborn infant trumps that, though, at least for the anti-vaccine movement. Indeed, just the other day, the anti-vaccine crank groups the &lt;a href="http://www.nvic.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.talkaboutcuringautism.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Talk About Curing Autism (TACA)&lt;/a&gt;, and the anti-vaccine crank blog &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/advocacy-groups-ask-president-obama-to-order-suspension-of-hepatitis-b-vaccine-birth-dose.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt; posted a call for the elimination of hepatitis B vaccination for newborns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Washington, DC - National Vaccine Information Center and Talk About Curing Autism are calling on President Obama to order the immediate suspension of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation of the birth dose of the Hepatitis B vaccine after two recent studies linking the Hepatitis B vaccine to functional brain damage in U.S. male newborns and infant primates.  In a related development today, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, including the Health Resources and Services Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  announced that 1 in every 91 children are now diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder as reported in the November 2009 issue of Pediatrics. Previous data released by the CDC indicated a prevalence of 1 in every 150 children affected by the disorder.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/some_monkey_business_in_autism_research_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/some_monkey_business_in_autism_research_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/_iJx-YEob9U" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254927044781"><id gr:original-id="666 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/437185ada6877049</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Daily Mail" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/79"/><category term="HPV" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/576"/><category term="MMR" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/302"/><category term="vaccination" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/367"/><title type="html">So, Reporter, How Many Women Did You Kill Today?</title><published>2009-10-07T14:21:44Z</published><updated>2009-10-07T14:21:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/666" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had intended to talk about the “incalculable” harm that may have been done by the recent irresponsible media reporting about HPV vaccine, but then I realised that much of the actual damage can be estimated quite accurately. Previous unfounded scare-mongering about the side effects of vaccines have always resulted in measurable declines in vaccination rates, which have always translated directly into additional deaths or cases of disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mid 1970s, unjustified concerns about whooping cough vaccine resulted in a decline in vaccination coverage in the UK from over 75% to below 40%. As a consequence, there were several outbreaks of pertussis, and in the intervening 12 year period (until vaccination rates increased to over 75% again and there were few recorded deaths from pertussis), there had been nearly &lt;a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&amp;amp;HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1195733837440?p=1191942148402"&gt;a third of a million cases and 62 deaths.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MMR debacle, which was almost entirely media-generated, saw &lt;a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAweb&amp;amp;HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1195733819251"&gt;a drop in vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; in the under twos from over 90% in England and Wales (around the threshold required to provide good herd immunity) to 80% in 2004, and vaccine coverage is still struggling to recover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result there have been significant measles outbreaks (which are still ongoing), measles has once again been declared to be endemic in Britain and our country has been identified as a major exporter of clinical measles, turning the once-achievable goal of eradication of measles in Europe into an impossible pipe dream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been at least 2 deaths in England from acute measles (the last death before that having been over 15 years previously), and dozens of deaths across Europe. Many of the tens of thousands of children who have suffered measles will also go on to develop a fatal form of chronic encephalitis in their later years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the media has turned its focus onto human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine, which prevents infection with oncogenic strains of virus that can cause cancer. &lt;a href="http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/cervix/?a=5441"&gt;Cervical carcinoma&lt;/a&gt; is still a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in women, and one of the tragedies is that it should not occur at all. Cervical screening should pick up suspicious lesions before they turn malignant, allowing women to get curative treatment. But despite a vigorous national screening programme, there are still around 3000 cases of this disease and nearly 1000 deaths each year (nearly 3 every day). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around half of all sexually active women will become infected with HPV in their lifetime. &lt;a href="http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/Vaccines/HPV"&gt;HPV vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, by preventing infection with 2 of the viral strains that cause over 70% of cervical cancers, is widely predicted to reduce the incidence of disease and save the lives of about 400 women each year. The recent uptake of HPV vaccine has been 70% among adolescent girls, the targeted vaccination group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous scurrilous tales about supposed reactions to HPV vaccine have ensured that this would never be 100%, but the main obstacles to vaccination have been from the “conscientious objectors” who have decreed that having their children vaccinated is a recipe for moral fecklessness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But following the most recent fevered exposés of “side effects” from the HPV vaccine (which in reality are merely entirely coincidental or fabricated illnesses), the HPV vaccine coverage will undoubtedly plummet. Certain sections of our media, which are willing to print any story true or not in order to fulfil an agenda will ensure that eventuality, and to hell with the consequences for public health and society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say the vaccine coverage drops by a quarter as a result of the media campaign against the vaccine. This means that an additional 100 women will die sometime in the foreseeable future, and will continue to do so each year until vaccine rates improve again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But will anyone pay attention to the damage? The consequences of his actions are likely to remain completely invisible to journalists such as the “Daily Mail Reporter” (who anonymously fronts up every shock story). He probably will not even realise, that in 15 years time when one of his relatives (perhaps even a daughter) is diagnosed with cancer, that he bears a large portion of that responsibility. Or if not cervical cancer, maybe a nephew with measles encephalitis, or a granddaughter with meningococcal meningitis, for he holds all vaccines in similar contempt, and delights in persuading his readers to do likewise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phoney propaganda war that some tabloids are waging against vaccines is criminally irresponsible, and it can have only one outcome; the destruction of the public’s confidence in what are truly remarkable and life-saving innovations. The end result can only be more disease and death, something I am becoming distressingly familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Autism is on the rise — or is it?’ wonders &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/216832"&gt;Newsweek &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;(”The new data has everyone who cares about autism abuzz. But, as with so many issues connected to the disorder, no one can quite agree on what it means … “). The &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-autism5-2009oct05,0,4836058.story"&gt;Los Angeles Times &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;seems have interpreted the new numbers chiefly by averaging the affected ages at 8, and an opinion piece in &lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe &lt;/em&gt;and on &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/community/moms/blogs/child_caring/2009/10/higher_autism_rates_awareness_cant_be_the_only_reason.html"&gt;Boston.com &lt;/a&gt;maintains that awareness can’t be the sole reason for the seemingly overnight doubling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even bigger media names will probably pick up this topic in coming weeks, and perhaps even the talking heads of cable news will join the debate (with probably about four of them all talking at once on the same program, from what I’ve seen of these shows). One does hope that the surge, epidemic, tragedy, or whatever else we parents want to call it when our 11-year-old still watches “Elmo” will be treated with the human respect and attention it deserves, and won’t become just another political, ratings-rich football booted back and forth between Fox News and MSNBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;* * *&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;New York State’s Interagency Task Force on Autism has posted an electronic &lt;a href="https://app.expressemailmarketing.com/takesurvey.aspx?id=16666"&gt;survey &lt;/a&gt;with some on-target questions. Participants are asked to rank services, for instance, from least to most important to them, including: providing services; research into causes; and training for service coordinators, parents and families, and, significantly, clinicians. That last seems especially interesting, as obviously a growing number of doctors and nurses who don’t routinely see autistic children — like Alex’s ped, for example — are called upon more and more these days to treat them. Good on New York amid shrinking budgets to try to focus their autism activities.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.ianproject.org/"&gt;Interactive Autism Network &lt;/a&gt;has launched a &lt;a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=jguCF9DFVAjQleZlrIGDHw_3d_3d"&gt;survey aimed at grandparents &lt;/a&gt;to bring their knowledge of their grandchildren’s autism “into the research mix.” Good idea: Grandparents can offer a lifetime of experience in parenting in general (my parents died before I had kids, and I’ve always felt a little incomplete because of that), and every insight is helpful beyond when a grandparent can hand a kid back and simply say, “He’s just like you!” We’re afraid he isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for now, take a look at &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8291688.stm"&gt;a very nice article about the JREF and TAM London over at the BBC website&lt;/a&gt;. It’s nice to see someone who actually gets it writing for a major media outlet; we in the critical thinking business rarely get a fair shake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone likes the article. A rebuttal, of sorts, &lt;a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/bbc-attack-piece-promotes-cottage-industry-of-debunkers.html"&gt;has been posted on the Alex Jones website&lt;/a&gt; — a well-known haven for, um, some of the more wacky ideas and conspiracy theories out there — which takes a dim view of the BBC write-up. The author, Steve Watson, is unhappy about the idea that 9/11 &amp;quot;truthers&amp;quot; are lumped in with Moon landing deniers and other people whose grasp on reality is tenuous at best, and makes a series of logical fallacy howlers as &amp;quot;evidence&amp;quot;. For example, he cherry picks from the TAM London speakers list and then uses hyperbole to make it sound like we had a bunch of lightweights, but somehow he forgot to mention we had folks like Brian Cox, Simon Singh, Ben Goldacre, Ariane Sherine  — scientists (including me), journalists, and many other talented and intelligent individuals there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s just one of many others. Take a look at the article and see if you can collect ‘em all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that ridiculous article highlights the exact reason we need more skeptics, more critical thinkers, and more people who are able and willing to examine evidence of claims: we need to let others know when those claims fall short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, we need more meetings like TAM Vegas and TAM London. And we’ll have ‘em, because the Alex Joneses and Steve Watsons of the world are out there — sometimes, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; Out There — and their words need to have the light of reason shine down on them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254924948163"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=19293">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/34d11b9c1d40d231</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="NASA"/><category term="women"/><title type="html">Why It Wasn't a Small Step for Women</title><published>2009-10-07T13:39:04Z</published><updated>2009-10-07T13:39:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/r9buEN7kz0k/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/why-it-wasnt-a-small-step-for-women/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Women are lighter and thus cost less than men to transport to space, they're less prone to heart attacks, and they do better in isolation tests, reasoned Randy Lovelace when he founded the Women In Space Earliest program in 1959 to test women for their "qualifications as astronauts," as this Wired article reports.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/r9buEN7kz0k" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By Freakonomics</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254924438937"><id gr:original-id="http://neurodojo.blogspot.com/2009/10/birth-of-dragons.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/986083217f277cee</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">The birth of dragons</title><published>2009-10-07T07:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-07T07:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/xV2mK_tGWTE/birth-of-dragons.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://neurodojo.blogspot.com/2009/10/birth-of-dragons.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">How did Komodo dragons evolve to be the world&amp;#39;s biggest lizards?

The story goes that cartographers would write, “Here be dragons,” on the places of the map where they had no information. This would only be true in a few areas of the world, namely a few islands in the south Pacific, where Komodo dragons live.

As I talked about in an earlier post, weird things happen to the size of species on islands. Big species get small. Small species get big.

And if there’s one thing that people know about Komodo dragons, it’s that they’re big. It wouldn’t surprise me if Komodo dragons feature on a Trivial Pursuit card somewhere: “What is the largest lizard in the world?” They are the biggest, which means they’re the sort of animal that most people know about, so interested are we with extremes, particularly large extremes. Yet despite this, Komodo dragons were featured on the cover of Last Chance to See by Douglas Adams and Mark Carwadine as an endangered species.

Are all these things – living on islands, the large size, the small range the animals occupy – all connected somehow? That is, did Komodo dragons start out as Komodo wyverns (small dragons) and evolve large size because they were on these small islands? Alternately, did Komodo dragons evolve from “Widely distributed South Pacific” dragons, meaning they were just big from the start?...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The bar photo is busy, distracting, and adds nothing but visual noise to the data. However, one thing stands out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The members of the different faiths are sitting around on bar stools. Guess who represents the godless? A hot tattooed chick…and she&amp;#39;s the &lt;i&gt;bartender&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yann Arthus-Bertrand is the French photographer who produced that fantastic book and travelling exhibition, &lt;em&gt;The Earth from the Air&lt;/em&gt;. Earlier this year, he produced a feature film, called simply &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt;, which surveys the history and state of the planet in a poetic, striking and somewhat depressing way, focusing on what we are doing to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commentary is a bit over the top (sounds better in French), but the film is unmissable. You can watch the whole thing, for free, on YouTube. It lasts 90 minutes, so settle back and get the popcorn and beer out…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind you, it’s not a cheery view, and recalls Jim Morrison’s cry on an old Doors track “When The Music’s Over” – “What have we done to the Earth? What have we done to our fair sister? Ravaged and plundered and ripped her and bit her, stuck her with knives in the side of the dawn, and tied her with fences and dragged her down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning: Contains scenes of unbearable beauty, and will probably turn you into a vegetarian and stop you driving a car ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m afraid I can’t embed the Youtube link for some reason, so you’ll have to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/homeproject"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Humanist? Even (gasp!) atheist? Or are you any one of the thousands of other non-Christian religions peppering the planet? And yet, do you celebrate Christmas every year, reveling during the moment, but feeling shamed and guilty on Boxing Day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then do so no longer. It’s OK to be non-Christian and celebrate Christmas. And for proof, you can read the 42 essays comprising the book  &lt;a href="http://www.atheistbus.org.uk/the-atheists-guide-to-christmas-aka-the-atheist-book-campaign/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atheist’s Guide to Christmas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, edited by Ariane Sherine (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Atheists-Guide-Christmas-Ariane-Sherine/dp/0007322615/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1252064471&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Amazon UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Atheists-Guide-Christmas-Ariane-Sherine/dp/0007322615/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1254089648&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;Amazon US&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;a href="http://www.arianesherine.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Ariane Sherine&lt;/a&gt;, the one who created the Atheist Bus Campaign in the UK. Ariane is a humor writer and a journalist, and is also a genuinely wonderful human being who is upset by the way nonbelievers are portrayed in the media, and decided to do something about it. The bus campaign was her first organized effort, and this book is the second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She found 45 comedians, scientists, philosophers, story tellers, and artists — all of whom find the stories associated with Christmas to be, well &lt;em&gt;stories&lt;/em&gt; — and asked them to write a short essay about what the holiday means to them. The result is a collection of funny, warm, and interesting journeys into the mostly secular festivities of the world’s most maligned demographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll note that one essay in the book — &lt;em&gt;Starry Starry Night&lt;/em&gt; — was written by none other than myself. I was flattered and honored that Ariane would ask me to write for the book, where my musings would sit along side those of Richard Dawkins, Derren Brown, Simon Le Bon (yes, from Duran Duran!), my friend Brian Cox, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of us who wrote for the book were paid in any way (well, I got a free copy). All of us who contributed donated all proceeds to the UK HIV charity &lt;a href="http://www.tht.org.uk/"&gt;Terrence Higgins Trust&lt;/a&gt;, a secular group that provides information, advice, and support for HIV positive people in the UK. It’s a very good cause, and one that fits the reason for the season, don’t you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of the book is pretty interesting, too, and Ariane has been blogging about how she got this project started; &lt;a href="http://arianesherine.blogspot.com/2009/09/atheist-book-campaign-part-1.html"&gt;Part 1 is here&lt;/a&gt; and the other parts are linked in her sidebar. She is a funny and warm writer, busting a lot of stereotypes about atheists as the spawn of Satan. After all, just look at this picture of these two notorious examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Ariane_Sherine_and_Richard_Dawkins_at_the_Atheist_Bus_Campaign_launch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/ariane_dawkins_bus.jpg" alt="ariane_dawkins_bus" title="ariane_dawkins_bus" width="550" height="355"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t Ariane just radiate evil?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go buy this book. Give a copy for Christmas, or just get one for yourself. You’ll be helping a good cause, and maybe, just maybe, you’ll find out that Christmas really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

There is no PayPal link just yet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I posted about &lt;strong&gt;Don Harris&lt;/strong&gt;, a member of the Albuquerque City Council in New Mexico, who was being challenged in the local election by a man named &lt;strong&gt;David Barbour&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris had gone after Barbour for &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/06/albuquerque-city-councilor-don-harris-attacks-opponent-for-being-an-atheist/"&gt;having ties to atheist organizations&lt;/a&gt; and donating money for a science scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some updates to that story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly — and not unexpectedly — Harris looks like he’s going to &lt;a href="http://alibi.com/index.php?story=29382&amp;amp;scn=blog"&gt;win the election in a landslide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the process, a lot of you wrote to both candidates expressing your thoughts on Harris’ lowbrow tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are excerpts of some of the emails sent to Harris:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I was &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/06/albuquerque-city-councilor-don-harris-attacks-opponent-for-being-an-atheist/#comment-372816"&gt;appalled and disappointed&lt;/a&gt; to see that instead of relying on your record of accomplishments benefiting your city, you stooped to mail a sleazy, ad-hominem rag full of distortions and lies about your opponent, David Barbour. This is not worthy of you as a City Councilor or as a representative of the people in any capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not appreciate you acting as if atheism or California is something bad. I &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/06/albuquerque-city-councilor-don-harris-attacks-opponent-for-being-an-atheist/#comment-372756"&gt;honorably served my country&lt;/a&gt; in the Navy and was stationed in San Diego. I came from California to Texas after utilizing the GI Bill. I was not an atheist until college got me away from my tunnel vision that I had while growing up in a very small Illinois town where I almost never went to church. Atheists can be good people too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to revealing your own religiously based prejudice against what amounts to upwards of 20 million of your fellow Americans, you have also given the impression that you believe a significant portion of the population of Albuquerque &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/06/albuquerque-city-councilor-don-harris-attacks-opponent-for-being-an-atheist/#comment-372819"&gt;shares your contempt&lt;/a&gt; for those with views different from their own.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To all these people, Harris sent a similar response.  Something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dear [sender],&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was intending to expose his radical politics, and, in retrospect, how I did it was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don Harris
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris doesn’t explain why Barbour’s politics are “radical” nor does he acknowledge what he is “apologizing” for… probably because he doesn’t get why we’re all upset.  That’s disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he’d like to issue a real apology, I’d be glad to post it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Barbour, many of you reached out to him as well.  It sounded like he appreciated the support.  Reader &lt;strong&gt;Vas&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/06/albuquerque-city-councilor-don-harris-attacks-opponent-for-being-an-atheist/#comment-372843"&gt;received this response&lt;/a&gt; from him in regards to what Harris said about him (with permission to reprint):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’m a Unitarian. Its my understanding that Mr. Harris is a fundamentalist Christian, and it appears that to him, anyone outside his particular sect is a Godless radical. I mentioned that I was a board member at my church as a way to indicate that I had some experience in governance. Mr. Harris’ response in email was quoted in a blog as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mr. Barbour, in both the League of Women Voter’s questionnaire and in the Albuquerque Journal questionnaire commented that he was on the Board of a “church,” obviously attempting to make himself look more mainstream than he is on such things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was living in California, I was on the board of the Berkeley Fellowship of Unitarian Universalists for approximately 2 years. We have a part time minister there so the congregation is partly lay led. The “sermon” I gave there was on the rise of religious humanism in the UU faith which took place in the 30s and 40s. I gave it a provocative title, “The Importance of Being Atheist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Harris may actually believe that my beliefs disqualify me from being a city councilor, but I rather suspect that it is a cynical attempt to gain votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;
David Barbour
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbour is right with that last comment and, unfortunately, it’s too late to rectify the situation by voting Harris out of office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not too late to bring more attention to this sad new low in politics and make sure we atheists are prepared to respond in the future.  Just as politicians would be rightfully maligned for criticizing an opponent for being a “Jew” or “Hindu,” they should be punished for using “atheist” in the same vein.  We need to be leading the charge in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who wrote letters.  Hopefully, we can catch the problem earlier next time and have a chance to make a larger difference.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In reading one &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/28/world/middleeast/28iran.html"&gt;update in the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I came upon this quotation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Vice President Ali Akbar Salehi, head of Iran's nuclear program, said in an interview with ISNA news agency on Sunday, said] that Iran had taken defensive measures against possible military threats against the facility into consideration. "We are always faced with threats," he said. "We don't think that those threats would necessarily take place but we have prepared ourselves for the worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shouldn't that be "for the worst"?&lt;/em&gt;, I found myself asking as I read this. But then I remembered the fact that &lt;a href="http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~patrickp/TDintro.htm"&gt;[t] and [d] are highly likely to be deleted&lt;/a&gt; (= unpronounced) in this kind of position (word- and utterance-finally and after another consonant) in many if not most (most if not all?) spoken varieties of English, even when the distinction between e.g. &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; is at stake — a somewhat subtle distinction in most contexts anyway, including this one. This deletion &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kwgQk-Gx68wC&amp;amp;lpg=PA266&amp;amp;ots=ee6VJLkHsE&amp;amp;dq=t%20d%20deletion&amp;amp;pg=PA266#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=t%20d%20deletion&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;has also been found&lt;/a&gt; to be even more likely among (some groups of) second language speakers, which we can reasonably assume the translator (and/or the transcriber) to be. [ I've not been able to find the original quote, but given that the &lt;a href="http://isna.ir/ISNA/Default.aspx"&gt;ISNA&lt;/a&gt; is primarily a Persian-language news agency (with &lt;a href="http://isna.ir/ISNA/Default.aspx?Lang=E"&gt;an available English-language version&lt;/a&gt;), I assume that this English quotation was not original to Salehi but rather that it is a translation of the Persian original. ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick Google searches for {&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22prepare+for+the+worst%22"&gt;"prepare for the worst"&lt;/a&gt;} and {&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22prepare+for+the+worse%22"&gt;"prepare for the worse"&lt;/a&gt;} reveal both that the variant with &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; is almost 10 times more common than the variant with &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; (~25M ghits vs. ~2.6M ghits) and what appears to me to be a subtle but not insignificant class distinction of sorts: the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; variant seems to be found in more formal, "corporate" sites (book publishers, magazines, and the like), while the &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; variant seems to be found in more informal sites (message boards, blogs, and the like). Overall, though, not too shabby a showing for the &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; variant.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Eric Baković</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254916843289"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2024">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c647cfd276d67233</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">Autism Prevalence</title><published>2009-10-07T11:51:27Z</published><updated>2009-10-07T11:51:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2024" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two recent studies concerning the prevalence of autism in the US have been getting a lot of attention, because they indicate that autism prevalence may be higher than previously estimated. This, of course, fuels the debate over whether or not there are environmental triggers of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study was conducted by the CDC but has yet to be published. The results were announced ahead of publication by the US Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to the autism community. She reports that the new prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is now estimated at 1% or 100 in 10,000 children. This is an increase over the last few years. In 2002 the prevalence was estimated to be 66 per 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second study was &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/peds.2009-1522v1"&gt;published in the journal Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; and is a phone survey of 78,037 parents. They asked if they had any children who had ever been diagnosed with an ASD. Here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weighted current ASD point-prevalence was 110 per 10,000.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;We estimate that 673,000 US children have ASD. Odds of having&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;ASD were 4 times as large for boys than girls. Non-Hispanic&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;(NH) black and multiracial children had lower odds of ASD than&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;NH white children. Nearly 40% of those ever diagnosed with ASD&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;did not currently have the condition; NH black children were&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;more likely than NH white children to not have current ASD.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Children in both ASD groups were less likely than children without&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;ASD to receive care within a medical home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are slightly higher numbers than the CDC data. This is to be expected, however, since the Pediatrics study is a phone survey. Diagnoses were not confirmed by a clinician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question that the number of ASD diagnoses has been steadily increasing for the last two decades. The burning question has been – is this a real increase in the disorder or an artifact of increased surveillance and an expanded diagnosis.&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=95"&gt; I have reviewed the evidence in depth previously&lt;/a&gt; – the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the increasing autism prevalence is due to increased efforts to make the diagnosis and a broadening of the definition of autism. The evidence is not sufficient to conclude that there is not also a real increase in ASD incidence, but nor is there data to support this conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, since I wrote my last summary, there has been more data to support the conclusion that autism rates are really flat. The &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=940"&gt;National Health Service also has recently published a survey&lt;/a&gt; of autism prevalence. While the US studies looked at children from 3 to 17, the NHS study looked at all age groups. Their question was this – is the prevalence of ASD the same or different among various age groups? If the incidence of ASD is truly increasing, then younger age groups should have more ASD than older age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found a consistent prevalence of 1% in all age groups they surveyed. This is remarkable for two reasons – first, they found the exact same 1% figure as the CDC US survey (assuming the CDC data is more accurate than the phone survey published in Pediatrics). This supports the conclusion that the 1% figure may be close to the true prevalence of ASD in the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the NHS study found that the prevalence of autism was the same in all age groups, strongly suggesting that true ASD incidence has not been increasing over recent decades and supporting the increased surveillance and definition hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the anti-vaccine community is exploiting these two new studies (the US studies – they have already found excuses and conspiracies to &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/09/uks-nhs-report-suggests-autism-increase-due-to-oversight.html"&gt;dismiss the implications&lt;/a&gt; of the  NHS study). David Kirby, &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/kathleen-sibelius-autism-now-hits-1-in-100-children-we-have-no-idea-why.html"&gt;writing for Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;, a notorious anti-vaccination site, wonders aloud why there is no alarm about these new ASD prevalence numbers. He is still playing his coy “conspiracy of silence” card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also interesting that Kirby and others in the anti-vaccine community were predicting that autism rates should decrease following the near complete removal of thimerosal form the childhood vaccine schedule by 2002 in the US. Autism rates continued to rise at a steady rate, essentially killing the hypothesis that thimerosal is a significant contributor to autism. Now Kirby is citing the same evidence (continued rising autism rates) that punctured his previous hypothesis as support for his new hypothesis – the HepB vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right – the anti-vaccine community has moved from the MMR vaccine to thimerosal to other “toxins” in vaccines and are now focusing their sites on the HepB vaccine. As each claim fails to be supported by scientific evidence, they simply migrate over to another claim – all with the core feature that vaccines are always to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the strong consensus of evidence is that ASD rates are not truly increasing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

This, of course, fuels the debate over whether or not there are environmental triggers of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study was conducted by the CDC but has yet to be published. The results were announced ahead of publication by the US Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to the autism community. She reports that the new prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is now estimated at 1% or 100 in 10,000 children. This is an increase over the last few years. In 2002 the prevalence was estimated to be 66 per 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second study was &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/peds.2009-1522v1"&gt;published in the journal Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; and is a phone survey of 78,037 parents. They asked if they had any children who had ever been diagnosed with an ASD. Here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="More..." src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt=""&gt;The weighted current ASD point-prevalence was 110 per 10,000.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;We estimate that 673,000 US children have ASD. Odds of having&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;ASD were 4 times as large for boys than girls. Non-Hispanic&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;(NH) black and multiracial children had lower odds of ASD than&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;NH white children. Nearly 40% of those ever diagnosed with ASD&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;did not currently have the condition; NH black children were&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;more likely than NH white children to not have current ASD.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Children in both ASD groups were less likely than children without&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;ASD to receive care within a medical home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are slightly higher numbers than the CDC data. This is to be expected, however, since the Pediatrics study is a phone survey. Diagnoses were not confirmed by a clinician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question that the number of ASD diagnoses has been steadily increasing for the last two decades. The burning question has been – is this a real increase in the disorder or an artifact of increased surveillance and an expanded diagnosis.&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=95"&gt; I have reviewed the evidence in depth previously&lt;/a&gt; – the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the increasing autism prevalence is due to increased efforts to make the diagnosis and a broadening of the definition of autism. The evidence is not sufficient to conclude that there is not also a real increase in ASD incidence, but nor is there data to support this conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, since I wrote my last summary, there has been more data to support the conclusion that autism rates are really flat. The &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=940"&gt;National Health Service also has recently published a survey&lt;/a&gt; of autism prevalence. While the US studies looked at children from 3 to 17, the NHS study looked at all age groups. Their question was this – is the prevalence of ASD the same or different among various age groups? If the incidence of ASD is truly increasing, then younger age groups should have more ASD than older age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found a consistent prevalence of 1% in all age groups they surveyed. This is remarkable for two reasons – first, they found the exact same 1% figure as the CDC US survey (assuming the CDC data is more accurate than the phone survey published in Pediatrics). This supports the conclusion that the 1% figure may be close to the true prevalence of ASD in the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the NHS study found that the prevalence of autism was the same in all age groups, strongly suggesting that true ASD incidence has not been increasing over recent decades and supporting the increased surveillance and definition hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the anti-vaccine community is exploiting these two new studies (the US studies – they have already found excuses and conspiracies to &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/09/uks-nhs-report-suggests-autism-increase-due-to-oversight.html"&gt;dismiss the implications&lt;/a&gt; of the  NHS study). David Kirby, &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/kathleen-sibelius-autism-now-hits-1-in-100-children-we-have-no-idea-why.html"&gt;writing for Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;, a notorious anti-vaccination site, wonders aloud why there is no alarm about these new ASD prevalence numbers. He is still playing his coy “conspiracy of silence” card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also interesting that Kirby and others in the anti-vaccine community were predicting that autism rates should decrease following the near complete removal of thimerosal form the childhood vaccine schedule by 2002 in the US. Autism rates continued to rise at a steady rate, essentially killing the hypothesis that thimerosal is a significant contributor to autism. Now Kirby is citing the same evidence (continued rising autism rates) that punctured his previous hypothesis as support for his new hypothesis – the HepB vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right – the anti-vaccine community has moved from the MMR vaccine to thimerosal to other “toxins” in vaccines and are now focusing their sites on the HepB vaccine. As each claim fails to be supported by scientific evidence, they simply migrate over to another claim – all with the core feature that vaccines are always to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the strong consensus of evidence is that ASD rates are not truly increasing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

We had an interesting, if brief, discussion, and I thought it was a topic worth writing about.  When, a few days later, the Guardian ran an &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/sep/18/children-philosophy-childless"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by Julian Baggini on the merits of childlessness, and the increasing number of people not having children, I started doing research and organizing my thoughts on the matter to share with you all.  Well, it all got pushed a bit to the side, due to my crazy work schedule and everything else, and I’m finally getting back to it now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea seems fairly common.  As I processed my thoughts on the matter, I was walking around for an entire week with a line from that Harvey Danger song – you know the one – on repeat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Been around the world and found&lt;br&gt;
that only stupid people are breeding&lt;br&gt;
the cretins cloning and feeding&lt;br&gt;
and I don’t even own a TV&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole argument immediately strikes me as incredibly arrogant.  The assumption underlying the entire thing is that the people making the argument are the right kind of smart, and that any evolutionary tendency, real or perceived, away from that kind of smart is bad for humanity.  A quick google search on the topic yielded all sorts of blog discussions; what I gleaned from a quick scan was a lot of racism veiled in evolutionary language.  Most of the research on the topic appears to be based on IQ scores, and many of the bloggers and commenters seem to be suggesting, in subtle and not so subtle ways, that eugenics is probably a good idea.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, it is difficult to impossible to quantify intelligence.  The IQ scale measures a few narrow areas, but it is biased, and tells us very little beyond a subject’s ability to take tests.  A major problem lies in the conflation of education and intelligence.  Highly educated people are the group most likely to forego reproduction.  Yes, most educated people are intelligent, but people making this argument seem to overlook the many smart and resourceful people who, through various circumstances, have not had the time or opportunity to pursue higher levels of education.  My parents, a construction worker and a farmer’s daughter, fit this category.  There are plenty of smart people out there, living “normal” lives and having kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that strikes me about this is the fact that real genius tends to come at us out of left field.  Oftentimes it takes a person with the ability to think beyond the conventional wisdom on a topic to come up with a true breakthrough.  Specialized education by definition narrows our vision.  This has obvious benefits, but sometimes a person with a broader field of view can pick up on something that may have been staring the experts in the face all along.  Also, it seems there may be something to the idea that &lt;a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-09/afps-mgs092809.php"&gt;genius and craziness can be one and the same.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond all that, there is this idea that a lot of people have that we are “devolving”.  Anyone with an understanding of evolution should know that there really is no such thing.  Evolution has no goal or purpose beyond survival and reproduction.  All life is in a constant state of evolution; it reacts to selective pressures to preserve genes for traits that ensure survival and reproductive success.  It doesn’t necessarily move toward greater complexity or sophistication, and most of the time it is completely imperceptible at the surface level.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We humans have changed our environment in many ways to enable greater survival.  This means that we are subjected to different selective pressures today than we were, say, a few centuries ago.  Some see this as a bad thing; fewer of the “weak” are being weeded out, and our populations are becoming “polluted” by inferior genetic material.  I think it’s a mistake to try to ascribe value to what natural selection may or may not favor.  It’s arrogant to assume that we have any idea what qualities will be necessary and/or beneficial in the future.  As the way we live changes, so does what it takes to survive.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to see the ways humanity is being shaped in the moment, or even over a century, but I think it’s safe to say that evolution will continue to do what it does, and we’ll be just fine without implementing a geek breeding program.  Although, it occurs to me, isn’t that really what the internet is for?  Think about it: the internet is enabling nerds the world over to meet and potentially mate.  That has to make up for some of the supposed lack of smart breeders.  I’d like to see that study.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254909768143"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/fLgR/~3/Y8TL55uen6s/for-poor-in-nyc-costs-count-more-than.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eb52a7be485cbba1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">For the poor in NYC costs count more than calories</title><published>2009-10-07T05:30:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-07T05:30:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/FVToUPn8-Cg/for-poor-in-nyc-costs-count-more-than.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/fLgR/~3/Y8TL55uen6s/for-poor-in-nyc-costs-count-more-than.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">On July 18th, 2009 New York City&amp;#39;s mandatory menu calorie law went into action and restaurants with 15 or more locations were forced to post calories on menu boards and/or menus for their patrons.The hope has always been that armed with this information people would choose fewer calories.Well, so far the results aren&amp;#39;t too promising - at least not for a very specific population.In a paper published online in the journal Health Affairs, Brian Ebel and colleagues explored the purchasing behaviour of 1,156 adults at 4 different fast food locations in New York City.  Researchers tracked purchases 2 weeks prior to the labeling law&amp;#39;s implementation and 4 weeks after its implementation.  Participants were told before purchasing that if they provided researchers with their receipt and answered a brief survey that they would receive $2.  Prior studies using similar methodology for recruitment reported roughly 55% of restaurant goers participate.  Researchers then used the receipts to determine the calories of the menu items ordered.The population studied was quite distinct.  85% were from minorities, and half had only a high school diploma or less education.  The neighbourhoods were poor neighbourhoods and on average respondents reported that they frequented fast food restaurants an average of 5x weekly.What the researchers found was that for this sampling of poor, uneducated, fast-food addicted, minorities unless they specifically stated that they both noticed calories on the menu boards and changed their behaviours accordingly, calories consumed were the same both before and after the labeling law came into effect.Given the sample, these data are clearly not necessarily representative to the rest of the population.  I would also expect that there will be far less change in caloric purchasing in fast food restaurants with fairly limited menus than in fast casual restaurants with more varied fare and patrons with more disposable income.  Looking at McDonald&amp;#39;s menu specifically, there really isn&amp;#39;t much variety in calories in that even salads, when combined with dressings, tend to have calories comparable to their burgers.  Furthermore given the nature of the sample and the recruitment I wonder whether or not they selected for the poorest of these poor patrons who actually would bother taking time out of the middle of their weekday for $2.The authors also admit that because the study took place so soon after the law went into effect perhaps they hadn&amp;#39;t had enough exposure to have the numbers sink in.  Personally I suspect that the exposure that truly would be necessary wouldn&amp;#39;t be the actual calories on the menu boards but rather exposure to education as to just how many calories the body needs per day and in fact there have been studies that suggest menu labeling works far better when combined with that type of information.  At the end of the day what this study tells me is that cost matters to this group far more than calories, and pragmatically I don&amp;#39;t blame them one bit.  It also impresses upon me the real need of finding innovative means to provide affordable, healthy food for the poorly educated and impoverished.So should we shelve these initiatives?Of course not, though it will certainly make the results from the much larger sampling of 12,000 receipts being collected by the public health department of New York that much more interesting.  It&amp;#39;s still a hill I&amp;#39;d be willing to die on. Brian Elbel, Rogan Kersh, Victoria L. Brescoll, &amp;amp; L. Beth Dixon (2009).

&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago, a relative  of mine who embraces all manner of woo emailed me a flyer, a copy of  which can be seen &lt;a href="http://www.disclosureproject.org/EmailUpdateJuly222009.htm"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  It announces one of a series  of seminars presented by Dr. Stephen Greer, a man who claims to be able  to summon extraterrestrials through the use of telepathy.  Over  the years, this relative and I have gone back and forth repeatedly on  the odds of aliens visiting this planet, the need for experimental data,  burden of proof, etc.  Rather than hash that out again, I decided  to approach it from a different angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's suppose for a moment  that Dr. Greer has precisely what he says he has: 100% proof, beyond  a shadow of a doubt, of the existence not only of extraterrestrials and  their technology, but also the telepathic abilities needed to communicate  with them.  This knowledge would be the single most important discovery  in all of history, revolutionizing the world, accelerating us far beyond  what the Scientific Revolution ever did, and bringing about a golden  age of mankind.  So, what are his options?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254899432820"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=4404">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/30f26a8c4c05b5c1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General Science"/><category term="General Skepticism"/><category term="News From Around The Blogosphere"/><category term="Weirdness"/><category term="alchemy"/><category term="diamond"/><category term="Jesus"/><category term="Mexico"/><category term="New York Times"/><category term="tequilla"/><category term="University of Florida"/><category term="zombie"/><title type="html">News From Around The Blogosphere 10.6.09</title><published>2009-10-07T06:21:45Z</published><updated>2009-10-07T06:21:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/10/06/4404/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:udvbENezfILI-M:http://www.redlettermin.com/images/drunk_on_jesus_synr.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:udvbENezfILI-M:http://www.redlettermin.com/images/drunk_on_jesus_synr.gif" alt="" width="166" height="136"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1.&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/nov/13/agriculture-mexico-tequila-diamonds"&gt; Scientists out-miracle Jesus&lt;/a&gt; – Scientists in Mexico have figured out how to turn tequilla into diamonds.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokesman Steve Orlando said late last week that the university removed a link to a disaster recovery exercise, which detailed how the school could respond to an outbreak of the undead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orlando said officials felt the joke “didn’t really belong” on the site, which also included plans for dealing with hurricanes and pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, you may laugh, but &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/08/zombies/"&gt;mathematicians have done a study on the mathematics of a hypothetical zombie attack&lt;/a&gt;, and published it in a book on infectious disease.

As you are likely aware, the DonorsChoose campaign is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/donorschoose_-_classroom_scien.php" title=""&gt;in full swing here on Scienceblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you may not be aware is that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/seed/2009/10/donorschoose_social_media_chal.php" title=""&gt;Seed Media Group is in&lt;/a&gt;, with some nice prizes to the donors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;You can forward the donation receipt to scienceblogs@gmail.com for a chance to win some Swag Bags from ScienceBlogs, complete with Seed moleskin notebooks and tote bags, ScienceBlogs mugs and USB drives, and books from Yale University Press and Oxford University Press - we'll draw a winner or winners every week in October.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/leadershipboard.html?category=111" title=""&gt;all the Sciblings' challenges&lt;/a&gt; and pick some to give - a little bit by many people will go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/social-media-challenge-2009" title=""&gt;you can see&lt;/a&gt;, our challenges are currently in second place overall, behind a large group of "General Blogs", leaving Twitter, Discover Blogs, Fashion Blogs, Gawker Media, Tech Blogs, BlogHer and others behind. Can we get to the #1 spot by the end of the month?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I would love it the best, if you donate to &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=24271&amp;amp;category=111" title=""&gt;one of my challenges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, two donors have given three donations to my challenges, with the total of $204.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=291192&amp;amp;challengeid=24271" title=""&gt;The Joy Of Science!!!!!&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=292583&amp;amp;challengeid=24271" title=""&gt;Headline: Worms Tutor First Graders!&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=305209&amp;amp;challengeid=24271" title=""&gt;Alternative Energy and Conservation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=305260&amp;amp;challengeid=24271" title=""&gt;The Lights In The Sky Are Stars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=305345&amp;amp;challengeid=24271" title=""&gt;No Books Go Notebooks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=308358&amp;amp;challengeid=24271" title=""&gt;Biology Games to Make Level 3's and 4's&lt;/a&gt; have been fully funded - all this week, and thanks to, among other, my donors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you choose where to give?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can take a look at those challenges that have very little time left:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=279819&amp;amp;challengeid=24271" title=""&gt;First Graders Flip Over the Video on Their Blog&lt;/a&gt; has only 5 days left to go.  &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=281183&amp;amp;challengeid=24271" title=""&gt;Kinder-Garden &lt;/a&gt; has 10 and &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=280781&amp;amp;challengeid=24271" title=""&gt;Flip For Learning! &lt;/a&gt; has 18 days to go. If not funded in time, those projects will not happen this year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you can see which challenges require only a little bit of money to get fully funded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=287842&amp;amp;challengeid=24271" title=""&gt;Space and Beyond&lt;/a&gt; is missing only $58 to get fully funded. &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=293418&amp;amp;challengeid=24271" title=""&gt;1,2,3 - Look at Me (Learning Math)&lt;/a&gt; needs only $94 and &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=295692&amp;amp;challengeid=24271" title=""&gt;Tick Tock : Time to Tell Time&lt;/a&gt; needs $102.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or see which challenges work double, i.e., with various corporate sponsors doubling your contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if all of my challenges get funded soon, I'll add some more. We have a whole month to help as many children and teachers as possible. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://press.discovery.com/us/dsc/press-releases/2009/ghostlabpremiere/"&gt;DISCOVERY CHANNEL TACKLES UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA WITH ALL-NEW SERIES GHOST LAB TO PREMIERE OCTOBER 6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Klinge Brothers Use High Tech Mobile Lab and Noted Historical Experts to Test Scientific Theories –&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Silver Spring, Md.) – With the help of the latest technology, two brothers have uncovered some of the most intriguing results in supernatural research to date – including a possible recording of Civil War soldiers talking.  Meet Brad and Barry Klinge, Texas natives who in 2007 founded Everyday Paranormal, an investigation team that has explored more than 70 locations and given a new twist to paranormal research.  The Klinges and their team of investigators are featured in the all-new 13-part series &lt;strong&gt;GHOST LAB&lt;/strong&gt;, to premiere Tuesday, October 6 at 10PM E/P on Discovery Channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Klinge brothers tackle what are thought to be some of America’s most haunted locations with sophisticated equipment housed in a decked-out travelling “ghost lab.”  This 24-foot car hauler is capable of providing 200,000 watts of electricity to power audio, video and photo analysis stations; flat-screen televisions and an interactive touch-screen smartboard.  The lab also houses surveillance video cameras capable of shooting 300 feet away in total darkness with a 180-degree peripheral view; temperature, humidity and dew point data loggers; various digital cameras, including thermal imaging cameras; audio recorders; and more than 8,000 feet of video cable.  This on-site high-tech lab enables investigators to analyze data on the premises in real time, helping them to more narrowly focus their investigations on suspected “hot spots.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow… the stupid is just burning my brain.  I explain in &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/09/14/edmund-pseudoscientific-sells-ghost-detectors-other-woo/"&gt;another recent entry&lt;/a&gt; why these “ghost hunters” – who should really be called &lt;strong&gt;morons-who-stumble-in-the-dark-Blair-Witch-style-saying-”Did you hear THAT?!!”&lt;/strong&gt; – are so far off base in their analysis. Of course, the big mistake here that these idiots are making is that they assume that “high tech = good science”, which isn’t true.  If you have no real understanding of the physical &amp;amp; scientific principles behind what your devices are actually measuring, and if you instead regard the technology as some kind of &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/magicalthinking.html"&gt;magical device&lt;/a&gt;, then all the technology in the world will not fix your broken &amp;amp; illogical thinking.  Or, as any computer expert will tell you, no matter how good your machines &amp;amp; gadgetry: “Garbage in = garbage out”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20091005/sc_nm/us_italy_shroud"&gt;Italian Scientist Reproduces Shroud of Turin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20091005/sc_nm/us_italy_shroud"&gt;&lt;img title="shroud of turin" src="http://d.yimg.com/a/p/rids/20091005/i/r1002045249.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="371"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latest research on the Shroud definitely counters the criticism among the Shroudie-true-believers: that there is no known man-made technique which can accurately replicate the features of the Shroud.  That is because the scientist in question, &lt;a href="http://www.luigigarlaschelli.it/"&gt;Luigi Garlaschelli&lt;/a&gt;, has perfected a method of replicating the Shroud!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have shown that is possible to reproduce something which has the same characteristics as the Shroud,” Luigi Garlaschelli, who is due to illustrate the results at a conference on the para-normal this weekend in northern Italy, said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A professor of &lt;span&gt;organic chemistry&lt;/span&gt; at the &lt;span&gt;University of Pavia&lt;/span&gt;, Garlaschelli made available to Reuters the paper he will deliver and the accompanying comparative photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;The Shroud of Turin&lt;/span&gt; shows the back and front of a &lt;span&gt;bearded man&lt;/span&gt; with long hair, his arms crossed on his chest, while the entire cloth is marked by what appears to be rivulets of blood from wounds in the wrists, feet and side. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… But scientists have thus far been at a loss to explain how the image was left on the cloth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garlaschelli reproduced the full-sized shroud using materials and techniques that were available in the middle ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They placed a linen sheet flat over a volunteer and then rubbed it with a pigment containing traces of acid. A mask was used for the face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pigment was then artificially aged by heating the cloth in an oven and washing it, a process which removed it from the surface but left a fuzzy, half-tone image similar to that on the Shroud. He believes the pigment on the original Shroud faded naturally over the centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then added &lt;span&gt;blood stains&lt;/span&gt;, burn holes, scorches and water stains to achieve the final effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Of course, skeptics have known for quite some time that this supposed “holy relic” was most likely a complete fake.  Scientific investigations have been conducted on the Shroud, and they have yielded embarrassing evidence  which challenges the authenticity of the Shroud.  These lines of evidence include the results of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating"&gt;radiocarbon dating&lt;/a&gt;, done independently by three different labs – Oxford University, the University of Arizona, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology – which all agree &amp;amp; reveal the year of origin of for the Shroud to be somewhere from 1260 to 1390.  This was, incidentally, during the same period of time in European history where many charlatans were pawning off a variety of “holy relics” – from supposed body parts of Saints to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Cross#Dispersal_of_relics_of_the_True_Cross"&gt;splinters of the True Cross&lt;/a&gt; – upon the faithful &amp;amp; gullible for money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, when these results came out, the Shroudies began to come up with some really lame excuses.  One example of these is well outlined at the &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/shroud.html"&gt;Skeptic’s Dictionary entry on the Shroud…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shroud allegedly was in a fire during the early part of the 16th century and, according to believers in the shroud’s authenticity, that is what accounts for the carbon dating of the shroud as being no more than 650 years old. To non-believers, this sounds like an &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/adhoc.html"&gt;ad hoc hypothesis.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to microchemist Dr. Walter McCrone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The suggestion that the 1532 Chambery fire changed the date of the cloth is ludicrous. Samples for C-dating are routinely and completely burned to CO2 as part of a well-tested purification procedure. The suggestions that modern biological contaminants were sufficient to modernize the date are also ridiculous. A weight of 20th century carbon equaling nearly two times the weight of the Shroud carbon itself would be required to change a 1st century date to the 14th century (see &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070902202115/http:/www.mcri.org/Shroud_graph.html"&gt;Carbon 14 graph&lt;/a&gt;). Besides this, the linen cloth samples were very carefully cleaned before analysis at each of the C-dating laboratories.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://mcri.org/home/section/63-64/the-shroud-of-turin"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when presented with these iron-clad scientific findings, the Catholic Church tries to have it both ways.  The &lt;span style="background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/span&gt; does not claim the Shroud is authentic nor that it is a matter of faith, but says it should be a powerful reminder of Christ’s passion.  So, in other words, they don’t want to &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like they’re encouraging people to act in a superstitious manner when they’re encouraging people to act in a superstitious manner.&lt;/p&gt;

It would probably be like the world envisioned by British comic actor Ricky Gervais in &lt;i&gt;The Invention of Lying&lt;/i&gt;, where brutal honesty is the order of the day, until Gervais' hapless character suddenly develops the ability to lie, or in his words, "I said something... that &lt;i&gt;wasn't&lt;/i&gt;!" We are treated to an image of neurons in his brain firing in new ways at that pivotal evolutionary moment.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That image seems appropriate, given that scientists have been looking into using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to achieve a kind of "&lt;a href="http://www.physorg.com/news163156190.html"&gt;brain fingerprinting&lt;/a&gt;" as a means of lie detection. In fMRI, when certain parts of the brain are engaged during a specific cognitive activity, those areas light up in the brain scan -- and if a person happens to be "dissembling," it should be possible to tell that they are lying just by looking at the scan.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Traditional polygraph tests, which measure physical responses such as respiration, heart rate, pulse, and electrical skin conductance to determine if a subject is lying, are notoriously unreliable, and scientists are still looking for the equivalent of Wonder Woman's magical lasso of truth. Brain fingerprinting seems to offer something closer to an objective analysis of whether or not not someone is lying. How can a brain scan lie, after all?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, maybe the scan doesn't lie, but how we interpret those images is prone to human error, particularly since we don't fully understand how this complicated organ called the brain actually works. Chief among the naysayers of this new "mind reading" technology is Melissa Littlefield, who argues that the technique is based on fundamentally wrong assumptions, most notably "truth" is the baseline, the natural state of being, and lying is adding "a story on top of the truth." That might be true in Gervais-Land, but the real world is far more complicated.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;An fMRI scan might reveal a lie if the person knew he or she was lying -- if it were a conscious decision. But "some people don't actually know that they're lying, or have a told a lie for so long that it becomes their subjective interpretation of reality," Littlefield explains. And just as with the polygraph test, it's possible to cheat and &lt;a href="http://io9.com/5277492/how-to-beat-your-futuristic-lie-detector"&gt;beat the machine&lt;/a&gt;: just clench your teeth or move your head slightly. FMRI requires the subject to hold perfectly still to get a useable image. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are defenders of the technique's potential for lie detection as well. The &lt;a href="http://io9.com/5313825/your-brain-will-eventually-be-used-against-you"&gt;most recent fMRI work&lt;/a&gt; on truthfulness comes to us via Joshua Greene of Harvard University, who &lt;a href="http://www.harvardscience.harvard.edu/culture-society/articles/neuroimaging-suggests-truthfulness-requires-no-act-will-honest-people"&gt;published his results&lt;/a&gt; recently in the &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;. He found that honest subjects showed almost no additional brain activity when telling the truth, as might be expected -- you're not inventing a lie, after all. But dishonest subjects &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; show extra brain activity... even when they were telling the truth. Greene's conclusion: "Being honest is not so much a matter of exercising willpower as it is being disposed to behave honestly in a more effortless kind of way."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/yfUZND486Ik%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-7546948940322285325?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The resurgence of marine primary production in the aftermath remains poorly constrained because of the paucity of fossil records tracing primary producers that lack skeletons. Here we present a high-resolution record of geochemical variation in the remarkably thick Fiskeler (also known as the Fish Clay) boundary layer at Kulstirenden, Denmark. Converging evidence from the stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen and abundances of algal steranes and bacterial hopanes indicates that algal primary productivity was strongly reduced for only a brief period of possibly less than a century after the impact, followed by a rapid resurgence of carbon fixation and ecological reorganization.

I get upset when coffee shops in my area only bring out the chocolates in the afternoon. Who says you can't have a chocolate chip cookie for breakfast?

Chocolate, combined with a cup of coffee, helps me work all the way through to the end of the day, when I'd otherwise be tempted to call it quits in the late afternoon. So naturally I was excited when Greta found a research report on the effect of chocolate on mood. Could there be scientific confirmation that chocolate helps you get through the day?

There has been plenty of research suggesting that many people eat in response to negative moods and stress, but there is less evidence that eating actually improves mood. Many of the studies done on emotional response to food have been poorly controlled. Others have shown that mood can improve as a result of nutrient consumption -- but this impact may be delayed for some time. Michael Macht and Jochen Mueller wanted to know if eating chocolate could immediately improve mood.

They recruited 48 volunteers via classified ads, all of whom said they liked chocolate. The volunteers reported their mood (on a scale from 1 [negative] to 25 [positive]), then watched one of three short movie clips: A mourning scene from "The Champ," the Meg Ryan orgasm scene from "When Harry Met Sally," or a clip from a documentary about copper manufacturing. As you'd expect, the first clip had been previously shown to induce negative mood, the second, positive mood, and the third, no mood change. After viewing the clips, the volunteers reported their moods, and their moods had changed as predicted.

Then half the volunteers were given a piece of chocolate, and the unlucky second group got a glass of water. 1 minute later, they reported their mood once again. This was repeated for each clip (the clips were shown in a random order for each participant). So did chocolate have a different effect from water?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007322" title=""&gt;From the Eye of the Albatrosses: A Bird-Borne Camera Shows an Association between Albatrosses and a Killer Whale in the Southern Ocean&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Albatrosses fly many hundreds of kilometers across the open ocean to find and feed upon their prey. Despite the growing number of studies concerning their foraging behaviour, relatively little is known about how albatrosses actually locate their prey. Here, we present our results from the first deployments of a combined animal-borne camera and depth data logger on free-ranging black-browed albatrosses (Thalassarche melanophrys). The still images recorded from these cameras showed that some albatrosses actively followed a killer whale (Orcinus orca), possibly to feed on food scraps left by this diving predator. The camera images together with the depth profiles showed that the birds dived only occasionally, but that they actively dived when other birds or the killer whale were present. This association with diving predators or other birds may partially explain how albatrosses find their prey more efficiently in the apparently 'featureless' ocean, with a minimal requirement for energetically costly diving or landing activities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007301" title=""&gt;Edge Detection in Landing Budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;While considerable scientific effort has been devoted to studying how birds navigate over long distances, relatively little is known about how targets are detected, obstacles are avoided and smooth landings are orchestrated. Here we examine how visual features in the environment, such as contrasting edges, determine where a bird will land. Landing in budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) was investigated by training them to fly from a perch to a feeder, and video-filming their landings. The feeder was placed on a grey disc that produced a contrasting edge against a uniformly blue background. We found that the birds tended to land primarily at the edge of the disc and walk to the feeder, even though the feeder was in the middle of the disc. This suggests that the birds were using the visual contrast at the boundary of the disc to target their landings. When the grey level of the disc was varied systematically, whilst keeping the blue background constant, there was one intermediate grey level at which the budgerigar's preference for the disc boundary disappeared. The budgerigars then landed randomly all over the test surface. Even though this disc is (for humans) clearly distinguishable from the blue background, it offers very little contrast against the background, in the red and green regions of the spectrum. We conclude that budgerigars use visual edges to target and guide landings. Calculations of photoreceptor excitation reveal that edge detection in landing budgerigars is performed by a color-blind luminance channel that sums the signals from the red and green photoreceptors, or, alternatively, receives input from the red double-cones. This finding has close parallels to vision in honeybees and primates, where edge detection and motion perception are also largely color-blind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007367" title=""&gt;The Impact of Nature Experience on Willingness to Support Conservation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We hypothesized that willingness to financially support conservation depends on one's experience with nature. In order to test this hypothesis, we used a novel time-lagged correlation analysis to look at times series data concerning nature participation, and evaluate its relationship with future conservation support (measured as contributions to conservation NGOs). Our results suggest that the type and timing of nature experience may determine future conservation investment. Time spent hiking or backpacking is correlated with increased conservation contributions 11-12 years later. On the other hand, contributions are negatively correlated with past time spent on activities such as public lands visitation or fishing. Our results suggest that each hiker or backpacker translates to $200-$300 annually in future NGO contributions. We project that the recent decline in popularity of hiking and backpacking will negatively impact conservation NGO contributions from approximately 2010-2011 through at least 2018.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007366" title=""&gt;Reassortment Patterns in Swine Influenza Viruses&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Three human influenza pandemics occurred in the twentieth century, in 1918, 1957, and 1968. Influenza pandemic strains are the results of emerging viruses from non-human reservoirs to which humans have little or no immunity. At least two of these pandemic strains, in 1957 and in 1968, were the results of reassortments between human and avian viruses. Also, many cases of swine influenza viruses have reportedly infected humans, in particular, the recent H1N1 influenza virus of swine origin, isolated in Mexico and the United States. Pigs are documented to allow productive replication of human, avian, and swine influenza viruses. Thus it has been conjectured that pigs are the "mixing vessel" that create the avian-human reassortant strains, causing the human pandemics. Hence, studying the process and patterns of viral reassortment, especially in pigs, is a key to better understanding of human influenza pandemics. In the last few years, databases containing sequences of influenza A viruses, including swine viruses, collected since 1918 from diverse geographical locations, have been developed and made publicly available. In this paper, we study an ensemble of swine influenza viruses to analyze the reassortment phenomena through several statistical techniques. The reassortment patterns in swine viruses prove to be similar to the previous results found in human viruses, both in vitro and in vivo, that the surface glycoprotein coding segments reassort most often. Moreover, we find that one of the polymerase segments (PB1), reassorted in the strains responsible for the last two human pandemics, also reassorts frequently.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no idea that Jesus personally delivered the Constitution, or that it was a religious document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go to the site hosting this…thing, you can mouse around and it will spell out the symbology behind all those figures. I rather like the professor; he&amp;#39;s the one on the far right, near the shadowy figure, Satan.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He tightly holds his "Origin of Species" book by Charles Darwin.  This represents the liberal lefts control of our educational system.  His smug expression describes the attitude of many of the educational elite.  There is no room for God in education.  There is contempt for any other viewpoints.  Humanism dominates the educational system of America and I believe that is wrong.  Notice that he is the only one sitting on the top step.  He tries to place himself on an equal footing with God, but he is still nothing next to the intelligence of the Creator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's that smug thing again. It's hard not to be smug when you see this kind of ham-handed kitsch, you know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/the_goggles_they_do_nothing.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/-H6KuiGKWtk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254868517173"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/cycad_sex.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/78412705ef8eab75</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Plants"/><title type="html">Cycad Sex</title><published>2009-10-06T22:48:19Z</published><updated>2009-10-06T22:48:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/983JxWKIEKo/cycad_sex.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/cycad_sex.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've always had a fondness in my heart for cycads.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Encephalartos princeps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago, while working in the Ituri Forest (in what is now the Congo), I kept hearing of a particular place in the forest, where the Efe Pygmies would occasionally but not often go for various reasons.  Over time I asked about this place, and eventually made arrangements to visit.  My first trip to what was known as the Kakba was a very long and difficult walk from a camp that was already about a day into the forest from the villages, where our research base camp was located.  On approaching the Kakba, it was obvious to me that the habitat we were in ... rain forest ... was giving way to something else.  The trees, for one thing, were more sparsely leafed out.  We were in the middle of the "little dry season" and it seemed that as we climbed very subtly in elevation, we encountered areas where there was little or no groundwater, and the underlying granitic basement rock was right on the surface.  The rain forest trees were still present, but more spread out and clearly water stressed.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/cycad_sex.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/cycad_sex.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/983JxWKIEKo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254868308297"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-7685864242443561351">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b2e39a3742acac6c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">A First Look At My New Edited Book: The Christian Delusion</title><published>2009-10-06T20:23:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-06T20:39:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/eA8IFQmdcZc/first-look-at-my-new-edited-book.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/7685864242443561351/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=7685864242443561351" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/10/first-look-at-my-new-edited-book.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">Below you can have your first look at my new edited book. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;text-align:center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_V452Ll6JHAE/SsuqLH313yI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/yrxho6w64P4/s1600-h/The-Christian-Delusion.jpg" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_V452Ll6JHAE/SsuqLH313yI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/yrxho6w64P4/s320/The-Christian-Delusion.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-7685864242443561351?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The resurgence of marine primary production in the aftermath remains poorly constrained because of the paucity of fossil records tracing primary producers that lack skeletons. Here we present a high-resolution record of geochemical variation in the remarkably thick Fiskeler (also known as the Fish Clay) boundary layer at Kulstirenden, Denmark. Converging evidence from the stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen and abundances of algal steranes and bacterial hopanes indicates that algal primary productivity was strongly reduced for only a brief period of possibly less than a century after the impact, followed by a rapid resurgence of carbon fixation and ecological reorganization. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;But like a honey bee stings
&lt;br&gt;You've gone and left my heart in pain
&lt;br&gt;All you left is our favorite song
&lt;br&gt;The one we danced to all night long
&lt;br&gt;It used to bring sweet memories
&lt;br&gt;Of a tender love that used to be
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Now it's the same old song
&lt;br&gt;But with a different meaning
&lt;br&gt;Since you been gone &lt;i&gt;--The Four Tops&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Those of you who've been with me since the start of our current series on Dark Matter, including parts &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/dark_matter_part_i_how_much_ma.php"&gt;I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/dark_matter_part_ii_how_much_n.php"&gt;II&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/dark_matter_part_iii_dark_matt.php"&gt;III&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/dark_matter_part_35_when_clust.php"&gt;3.5&lt;/a&gt;, know that I'm a big proponent of dark matter.  I think, based on everything that we know, that it is the simplest, easiest, and most likely explanation for why -- on galactic scales and larger -- the Universe behaves as it does.
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key observations we have, though, supports another conclusion as well.  You see, when we look out at a spiral galaxy, like this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/dear_mond_time_for_a_new_song/hgast_imax_sombrero_galaxy_0510_1404x1024.jpg" width="500" title="The edge-on galaxies are the easiest to measure rotation speed for; the face on ones are the hardest!" alt="hgast_imax_sombrero_galaxy_0510_1404x1024.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can measure how quickly it rotates.  We can look at the central part of the galaxy, the intermediate parts, and the outskirts.  If there were only stars and gas (i.e., normal matter), we'd expect the outskirts to rotate more slowly than the inner parts, the same way that the outer planets orbit our Sun more slowly than the inner ones.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't do that.  The outskirts move &lt;i&gt;at the same speed&lt;/i&gt; as the inner portion.  The difference between the expected (A) and the observed (B) is easy to see.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/dear_mond_time_for_a_new_song/800px-GalacticRotation2.svg.png" width="500" title="And so we learn that there&amp;#39;s something new out there..." alt="800px-GalacticRotation2.svg.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are two &lt;strike&gt;possible&lt;/strike&gt; reasonable explanations for this.  The first one is &lt;b&gt;dark matter&lt;/b&gt;.  In addition to all of the other things that dark matter explains, a diffuse dark matter halo around a galaxy could very easily explain the rotation of these galaxies, and we have very simple models that can accurately explain them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the other possibility is that Newton's laws of gravity get modified for very small accelerations.  How small?  Below changes in velocity of about one nanometer per second over a time interval of a second.  So if you modify Newton's &lt;b&gt;F = ma&lt;/b&gt; to add this minimum acceleration, you can also fix these rotation curves.  It works for practically every spiral galaxy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then we can take this theory, MOND (&lt;b&gt;MO&lt;/b&gt;dified &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt;ewtonian &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;ynamics), and try to apply it to other things.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/dear_mond_time_for_a_new_song/NGC_2537_I_FUV_g2006.jpg" width="500" title="The low-surface-brightness galaxy NGC 2537." alt="NGC_2537_I_FUV_g2006.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.) &lt;/b&gt;We can try to apply it to low-surface-brightness galaxies, like above, and see if it gives us a reasonable prediction.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/dear_mond_time_for_a_new_song/virgo_dss_big.gif" width="500" title="Well, we&amp;#39;re on the outskirts of Virgo; do we have the right velocity?" alt="virgo_dss_big.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.) &lt;/b&gt;We can try to apply it to galaxies moving around superclusters, and we can see if it gives us a reasonable prediction.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/dear_mond_time_for_a_new_song/lss.jpg" width="500" title="And our simulations using MOND would have to give results that agree with observations." alt="lss.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.) &lt;/b&gt;And we can apply it to the structure that the Universe forms, and we can see if we get a reasonable answer out.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you may have guessed, on counts 1, 2, and 3 above, &lt;i&gt;MOND completely fails!&lt;/i&gt;  It simply makes a prediction that doesn't match up with observations &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you'd think that would be the end of the story, right?  I mean, MOND has been singing the "we predict galaxy rotation curves" song since 1983, and it's been failing to predict these other things for just as long.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why is Nature &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7264/full/nature08437.html"&gt;making a big deal out of a paper like this&lt;/a&gt;?  Why are magazines like &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17892-galaxy-study-hints-at-cracks-in-dark-matter-theories.html"&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt; declaring that there are cracks in dark matter theories?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because someone (my guess is &lt;a href="http://star-www.st-and.ac.uk/~hz4/"&gt;HongSheng Zhao&lt;/a&gt;, one of the authors of this paper who's fond of press releases and modifying gravity) is pimping this piece of evidence like it tells us something.  Guess what?  &lt;b&gt;Galaxy rotation curves are the only thing MOND has ever been good for!&lt;/b&gt;  MOND is lousy for everything else, and dark matter -- which is good for everything else -- is good for this too!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So thanks to a number of people for bringing these to my attention, because the record needs to be set straight.  Dark matter: still fine.  MOND: still horribly insufficient.  Now, maybe we can get the editors and referees of journals like this to not only do quality control on the data, but also on the reasonableness of the conclusions drawn.

&lt;p&gt;I knew immediately which paper he was talking about, because I’d blogged about it &lt;a href="http://blog.f1000.com/2009/08/07/modern-way/"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;. But this conversation was in the context of our &lt;em&gt;hush&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:33%"&gt;rankings&lt;/span&gt;, and we decided that a paper in an obscure journal from a century and a half ago really wasn’t going to affect matters that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got home I checked the f1000 blog to see if there’d been any activity. And there, in the referrer list, was the search term “ber verh königl-sächs ges wiss, lovén c”. The first hit for that phrase on google is the &lt;a href="http://f1000biology.com/article/id/1163259"&gt;f1000 Biology&lt;/a&gt; entry for the paper in question, by Wilfrid Jänig of the Christian Albrechts University in Kiel. The second hit is my blog entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper by Christian Lovén, written in German, is exciting since it formulated for the first time, based on experiments conducted on rabbits, that blood vessels involved in regulation of arterial blood pressure (that is peripheral resistance) and cutaneous arteries are differentially regulated and, therefore, also innervated by different types of efferent neurons. This important conclusion anticipated that the sympathetic nervous system is differentially organized according to the target organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s possible that Phil searched for the journal, which means it’s not coincidence at all. And if I were Ben Goldacre I’d now swear a lot and say how this is an example of something or other that leads to bad reporting or death in baby rats, you bastards, but I’m sure you’re all smart enough to figure it out yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll instead close by saying that my &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/"&gt;flickr account&lt;/a&gt; also gets some strange referrer search strings. My current favourite is &lt;a href="http://google.com/search?q=gee+spot"&gt;Gee spot&lt;/a&gt;, which finds two of my Flickr pictures, here on NN.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Richard Grant</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/posts.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/posts.rss</id><title type="html">Confessions of a (former) Lab Rat</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.nature.com/rpg/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254859481110"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/us_federal_trade_commission_bl.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/feb3d1f84b520b13</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">US Federal Trade Commission: Bloggers disclose paid reviews</title><published>2009-10-06T20:07:31Z</published><updated>2009-10-06T20:07:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/mY_IXbwAKCQ/us_federal_trade_commission_bl.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/us_federal_trade_commission_bl.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you get paid to write a review for your blog, that fact ... that you were paid ... should be disclosed on said blog. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/us_federal_trade_commission_bl.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/us_federal_trade_commission_bl.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/mY_IXbwAKCQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254859142699"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/10/bay_area_darwin_fans_hear_the.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/343dc5a9ff928fd8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biology"/><title type="html">Bay Area Darwin fans: hear The Origin Cycle at Stanford this Thursday evening.</title><published>2009-10-06T19:47:15Z</published><updated>2009-10-06T19:47:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/mRl_ButUb9o/bay_area_darwin_fans_hear_the.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/10/bay_area_darwin_fans_hear_the.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thursday, October 8, at 8 pm, the Firebird Ensemble will be performing &lt;em&gt;The Origin Cycle&lt;/em&gt;, eight selections from Charles Darwin's work &lt;em&gt;Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; set to music.

Will, "&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/05/AR2009100502703.html"&gt;An Olympic Ego Trip&lt;/a&gt;", WaPo, 10/6/2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; In the Niagara of words spoken and written about the Obamas' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/02/AR2009100202779.html"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;trip to Copenhagen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;, too few have been devoted to the words they spoke there. Their separate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-By-the-President-And-the-First-Lady-to-the-International-Olympic-Committee/"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;speeches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; to the International Olympic Committee were so dreadful, and in such a characteristic way, that they might be symptomatic of something that has serious implications for American governance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Both Obamas gave heartfelt speeches about . . . themselves. Although the working of the committee&amp;#39;s mind is murky, it could reasonably have rejected Chicago&amp;#39;s bid for the 2016 Games on aesthetic grounds — unless narcissism has suddenly become an Olympic sport.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In the 41 sentences of her remarks, Michelle Obama used some form of the personal pronouns "I" or "me" 44 times. Her husband was, comparatively, a shrinking violet, using those pronouns only 26 times in 48 sentences. Still, 70 times in 89 sentences conveyed the message that somehow their fascinating selves were what made, or should have made, Chicago's case compelling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The last time George F. Will trotted out his opinion that president Obama is "inordinately fond of the first-person pronoun", I did some counts ("&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1486"&gt;Fact-checking George F. Will&lt;/a&gt;", 6/7/2009). As I explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;…since I&amp;#39;m one of those narrow-minded fundamentalists who believe  that statements can be true or false, and that we should care about the  difference, I decided to check. …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I took the transcript of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100490548"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Obama's first press conference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; (from 2/9/2009), and found that he used  'I' 163 times in 7,775 total  words, for a rate of 2.10%. He also used 'me' 8 times and 'my' 35  times, for a total first-person singular pronoun count of 206 in 7,775  words, or a rate of 2.65%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;For comparison, I took George W. Bush's &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=45948"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=45705"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; solo press conferences as president (from 2/22/2001 and 3/29/2001), and  found that W used 'I' 239 times in 6,681 total words, for a rate of  3.58% — a rate 72% higher than Obama's rate. President Bush also used  'me' 26 times, 'my' 31 times, and 'myself' 4 times, for a total  first-person singular pronoun count of 300 in 6,681 words, or a rate  of  4.49% (59% higher than Obama).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;For a third data point, I took William J. Clinton's &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=46478"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=46478"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; solo press conferences as president (from 1/29/1993 and 3/23/1993), and  found that he used 'I' 218 times, 'me' 34 times, 'my' 22 times, and  'myself' once, in 6,935 total words. That's a total of 275 first-person  singular pronouns, and a rate of 3.14% for 'I' (51% higher than Obama),  and 3.87% for first-person singular pronouns overall (50% higher than  Obama).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this previous experience, I had a first-person-counting script all ready to go, and it took only a few seconds to check the new transcripts. This time around, Barack Obama's Olympic remarks included 26 first-person-singular words out of 1130, for a rate of 2.3%. This is slightly below his typical rate for presidential press conferences, and a bit more than half the rate of the George W. Bush pressers that I measured earlier (2.3/4.49 = 51%, to be precise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Give me some links for presidential remarks at events more comparable to these, and I&amp;#39;ll check them out as well — I don&amp;#39;t have time to look around this afternoon.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true that Michelle&amp;#39;s tally was higher — 45 first-person-singular words out of 781, for a rate of 5.76%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is almost as much as the 6.4% first-person-singulars registered by Nancy Reagan's &lt;a href="http://kennedy.senate.gov/newsroom/press_release.cfm"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on Edward Kennedy's death, or the 7.0%  achieved by her &lt;a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0103/04/se.02.html"&gt;remarks&lt;/a&gt; at the christening of the USS Ronald Reagan in 2001, or the 10.0% notched by her &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/reagan/filmmore/reference/interview/nancyreagan03.html"&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; of the assassination attempt on her husband. [Again, give me pointers to ceremonial remarks by former first ladies on occasions like the Geneva meeting, and I'll tally them as well.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Will also complains about the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;…   egregious cliches sprinkled around by the tin-eared employees in the White House speechwriting shop. The president told the Olympic committee that: &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;At this defining moment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;," a moment "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;when the fate of each nation is inextricably linked to the fate of all nations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;" in "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;this ever-shrinking world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;," he aspires to "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;forge new partnerships with the nations and the peoples of the world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I don't have a program ready to hand for measuring cliche-density, much less cliche egregiosity, but I'll work on it. My prediction: in speeches prepared for ceremonial occasions like this one, the cliche density of presidential rhetoric has been fairly constant for decades if not centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two interesting questions here, it seems to me. The first one is why George F. Will is so struck by rates of first-person usage, on the part of Barack and Michelle Obama, that are significantly lower than has been typical of recent presidents and first ladies on similar occasions. The second question is how many pundits and talking heads will follow his brainless lead this time around.  For some attempts to tally the score from the last go-round, you could check out these LL posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1486"&gt;Fact-checking George F. Will&lt;/a&gt;" (6/7/2009); "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1488"&gt;Obama's Imperial 'I': spreading the meme&lt;/a&gt;" (6/8/2009); "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1489"&gt;Inaugural pronouns&lt;/a&gt;" (6/8/2009); "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1495"&gt;Another pack member heard from&lt;/a&gt;" (6/9/2009); "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1574"&gt;I again&lt;/a&gt;" (7/13/2009); "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1586"&gt;'I' is a camera&lt;/a&gt;" (7/18/2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you're curious about what inferences, if any, can be drawn from someone's rate of first-person-singular usage, see Jamie Pennebaker's guest post "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1651"&gt;What is 'I' saying?&lt;/a&gt;",  8/9/2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Now that I think of it, there's another significant question here as well. How in the world did our culture  award major-pundit status to someone whose writings are as empirically and spiritually empty as those of George F. Will?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — I clearly haven&amp;#39;t been paying attention to the right pundits. The &amp;quot;Obama is a narcissist&amp;quot; meme has seen a surge among Republican beltway insiders in recent weeks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mona Charen, "&lt;a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/09/25/obamas_self-worship_98453.html"&gt;Obama's Self-Worship&lt;/a&gt;", Real Clear Politics, 9/25/2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;President Obama's speech to the United Nations has been called naive and even "post-American." It was something else, as well: the most extravagant excursion into self-worship we have yet seen in an American leader.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Gerson, "&lt;a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2009/09/all_about_obama.html"&gt;All about Obama&lt;/a&gt;", 9/26/2009, Washington Post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I can recall no other major American speech in which the narcissism of a leader has been quite so pronounced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Frum, "&lt;a href="http://www.newmajority.com/obamas-narcissism"&gt;Obama's Narcissism&lt;/a&gt;", newmajority, 9/26/2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Michael Gerson's reading of President Obama's speech to the U.N. is both shrewd and damning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marty Peretz, "&lt;a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-spine/rio-1-chicago-0-the-politics-narcissism-and-general-mcchrystal"&gt;Rio, 1 — Chicago, 0. The Politics of Narcissism and General McChrystal&lt;/a&gt;", TNR, 10/4/2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;What I suspect is that the president is probably a clinical narcissist. This is not necessarily a bad condition if one maintains for oneself what the psychiatrists call an "optimal margin of illusion," that is, the margin of hope that allows you to work. But what if his narcissism blinds him to the issues and problems in the world and the inveterate foes of the nation that are not susceptible to his charms?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=Obama+narcissist&amp;amp;btnG=Search+Blogs"&gt;so on&lt;/a&gt;.  So George Will was just adding his pebble to a pot of stone soup that was already on the boil.  I&amp;#39;m not sure whether this makes his column less stupid — because he&amp;#39;s chiming in to support one of his cohort&amp;#39;s  talking points — or more stupid — because the idea, though apparently vacuous, is not even his.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update #2 — in the comments, Sinfonian points us to his &lt;a href="http://flprogressive.blogspot.com/2009/10/george-will-needs-mirror.html"&gt;tally&lt;/a&gt; of FPS pronouns in three pages of George Will's essay "The Cubs and Conservatism": 29 in 853 words, or 3.4%.  Less than George W. Bush's press conference, but more than Obama's Copenhagen speech.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254858118085"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=9813">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f0f6732830c790f5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">AI: The “A is quite impatient, watching a boiling pot” edition</title><published>2009-10-06T19:00:07Z</published><updated>2009-10-06T19:00:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/10/ai-the-a-is-quite-impatient-watching-a-boiling-pot-edition/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1bf777bb9635655676b4221d9cca69d8&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Thursday, Maria is coming to visit.

The revised Guides specify that while decisions will be reached on a case-by-case basis, the post of a blogger who receives cash or in-kind payment to review a product is considered an endorsement. Thus, bloggers who make an endorsement must disclose the material connections they share with the seller of the product or service. Likewise, if a company refers in an advertisement to the findings of a research organization that conducted research sponsored by the company, the advertisement must disclose the connection between the advertiser and the research organization. And a paid endorsement - like any other advertisement - is deceptive if it makes false or misleading claims.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the FTC is tightening the screws on weight loss products.  It's no longer okay to just say, "results not typical."  Instead they must present information about consumers may generally expect from the product (nothing!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...advertisements that feature a consumer and convey his or her experience with a product or service as typical when that is not the case will be required to clearly disclose the results that consumers can generally expect. In contrast to the 1980 version of the Guides - which allowed advertisers to describe unusual results in a testimonial as long as they included a disclaimer such as "results not typical" - the revised Guides no longer contain this safe harbor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article highlights the fall in popularity of names like Guillermo or Juanita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's specifically this paragraph, though, that I want to point out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;What happens, of course, when an immigrant group heads toward assimilation, is that each successive generation gets more educated (82% of first-generation Latin-American kids ages 15 to 17 attend school, compared with 97% of second-generation kids -- hardly perfect but moving toward parity) and more proficient in the national language (by the third generation, 95% of Latino kids ages 15 to 17 speak English exclusively or very well). Another thing that happens is that parents start moving away from baby names like Guillermo and closer to names like William. "When [immigrant or later-generation] parents name their children, they are combining their own attachments and affinities with their hopes and aspirations for their children," says Guillermina Jasso, a sociology professor at New York University and a second-generation Hispanic American. The emotional complexity of that cultural changeover means that parents don't just switch from Latin names to English ones in a single go. Rather, says Jasso, they may pass through a three-stage process, "with bilingual names becoming popular for a while. Those are names like Hector and Daniel for boys and Sandra and Cecilia for girls."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the author here &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; wants to conflate education and success with the choice of a traditionally Hispanic name...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/education_and_having_a_latin_n.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/imm1EEW-794" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254851070247"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=1616">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/66a972f4f287aaaf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All About Me"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Paranormal"/><category term="Pseudoscience"/><category term="Psychology"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Chinese superstitions"/><category term="consumer"/><category term="consumerism"/><category term="dissertation"/><category term="gender"/><category term="issues"/><category term="Rasch"/><category term="Scientiae"/><category term="sex"/><category term="Skepticblog"/><category term="statistics"/><category term="superstition"/><category term="women"/><title type="html">Retrospectacle - Step To It Science Superstitions (I Don’t Cheerlead In These Shoes)</title><published>2009-10-06T16:53:51Z</published><updated>2009-10-06T16:53:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/cjNEUF4Ysjg/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/2009/10/step-to-it-science-superstitions/"/><content xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Retrospectacle?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re saying you do science in those shoes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science doesn’t require one to dress up pretty to get the job done. I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do a variety of things in these shoes, but they’re best suited and designed for a ballroom dance floor (well, more accurately &lt;a href="http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=HYBLEoKpMLg"&gt;I can dance this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=WDLf4KrxczU"&gt;this in those shoes&lt;/a&gt;. I am not, however, an &lt;a href="http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=507p1QN1TsQ"&gt;Argentinian tango dancer&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But you’re doing an M.Ed. What sort of science do you do in that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want the &lt;em&gt;stats&lt;/em&gt; or you want the &lt;em&gt;psychology of superstitions and paranormal belief&lt;/em&gt;? I have both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s start with the stats.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we’re talking Rasch analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never heard of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry, neither had &lt;a href="http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/about/jsm.shtml"&gt;Dr Karl&lt;/a&gt; when I mentioned my work to him last week after I conducted an interview for the &lt;a href="http://www.skepticzone.tv"&gt;Skeptic Zone podcast&lt;/a&gt; - and he’s got quite a &lt;em&gt;few&lt;/em&gt; qualifications, as you might know…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although compatible with traditional test theory, &lt;a href="http://www.tlc.murdoch.edu.au/eddev/evaluation/mcq/score.html"&gt;Rasch analysis checks on the internal consistency of items and the operation of of the items across different groups&lt;/a&gt;. In educational measurement, they’re often used in the field of psychometrics, when ascertaining the abilities, attitudes, and personality traits of subjects. Using these models can help produce diagnostic information regarding how well the criterion is met, particularly just how good the instrument is measuring the trait (in this case, paranormal beliefs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages of a Rasch model analysis is that it is based on an explicit model requiring invariance, which&lt;img style="float:right" src="http://img179.imageshack.us/img179/3658/photo146pj9.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"&gt; results in integer scoring of the items. Rasch scaling, therefore, provides evidence as to whether there is a single underlying tendency (in the case of my studies, the tendency to believe in the paranormal), or whether there are ‘clusters’ of beliefs that influence each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are you holding a notepad with a picture on it? Is this like ‘&lt;a href="http://thisisindexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/card1924.jpg"&gt;Indexed&lt;/a&gt;‘ or something?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s showing you an example of a Guttman pattern and an example of items demonstrating a relationship between total score on a test and person location estimate. In my studies, it’s the &lt;em&gt;level&lt;/em&gt; of belief and what might be described as a gradient of ’significantly more difficult to believe paranormal beliefs’ or possibly just various paranormal beliefs. It works when a subject’s responses are listed according to item difficulty, from lowest to highest (imagine a good science test, where you have questions that are easy and then get harder and harder on a gradient. I’ve experienced these in tests administered to students when I was a high school teacher and they’re a part of national testing on literacy, numeracy, et al. That was one of the units I did for my first Masters of Education degree, which looked at curriculum and testing. So, I have some understanding-of-stats background, along with a Grad Dip unit in Psychology that I was doing part time.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the responses are listed according to item difficulty - it’s fairly likely going to get one of these patterns on your scale. Note that although it’s &lt;em&gt;most probable&lt;/em&gt; given the structure of the Rasch model, that you’ll get this tendency; it’s not strictly adhered to as there are many possible patterns. It also allows me to figure out how good this scale is in measuring beliefs. It’ll help check the internal consistency of items and the operation of items across different groups. The advantages of Rasch model analysis is that it is based upon an explicit model requiring invariance, which results in integer scoring of the items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what’s that to do with belief and superstitions then?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rasch model allows for subgroups within the newly created paranormal scale that Dr Martin Bridgstock and I created, drawing upon the demographic data we got from 1243 adults in the Queensland Social Service survey (QSS survey). I’m investigating as to whether the instrument measures the same traits, regardless of background variables. Analysis will determine the differential item functioning for specific items related to the background variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous paranormal scales that have used Rasch modelling are limited; I found some studies on the Australian Sheep-Goat scales that demonstrated some biases in semantic distortions and there is a two-factor Rasch version of the Revised Paranormal Scale to investigate the relationship between individually-orientated New Age Philosophy beliefs and socially-orientated paranormal beliefs and their relationship to schizotypal personality factors. You could use a Rasch scalable paranormal survey on a wide variety of people, to ascertain the gradient of belief. Whether &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt; does that is the topic of my M.Ed; the overall results, however, are still useful in several different ways (for example, we tested the &lt;a href="http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;amp;cpsidt=16230573"&gt;scales of Wiseman and Watt on luck&lt;/a&gt; within our survey).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, back to the shoes, you could probably even use Rasch modelling to demonstrate what elements of dance competency and level of confidence dancers have in order to study for a &lt;a href="http://www.dancesport.org.au/"&gt;Gold Star Modern Ballroom medal&lt;/a&gt;; perhaps starting by ascertaining what steps and moves are commonly demonstrated to reach that standard and the views of the dancers on their abilities. There’s been studies into what level of competency teachers have in using computer software and if there’s a correlation between their skills and their perspectives about their skills (very good correlation, from the research I’ve seen). At the moment, I’m helping gather research on engagement in schools and the teacher’s perspective of the students’ abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, where else could you use it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;a href="http://lpcprof.typepad.com/law_and_magic_blog/2008/11/paranormal-expert-newcastle-united-is-cursed.html"&gt;Law and Magic blog&lt;/a&gt; reported this bit of superstition recently - we could find out to what extent the fans adopt the notion of ‘curses’, by assessing different levels of belief in luck, misfortune, superstition and even how convinced they are of a doomed team due to this. What other factors might influence their views?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.premierleague.com/page/newcastle-united"&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt; fans can take heart–there’s a reason their favorite team is having problems. It’s cursed. At least that what paranormal and “curses” expert &lt;a href="http://www.newcastleunited-mad.co.uk/news/loadnews.asp?cid=TMNW&amp;amp;id=410447"&gt;Trevor Brown told the Sun newspaper&lt;/a&gt;. Does that mean that management can cut back on raises?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the ‘&lt;em&gt;psychology of superstitions and paranormal belief’ part?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll have to read my earlier posts - there’s a whole lot of &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?s=women+and+superstitions"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; in my blogposts that you can find and even a &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?page_id=742"&gt;presentation I did at Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; (prior to the results of the survey we did coming in - which was a pity! I’m sure there’ll be more in 2009!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why are you studying an online unit in Parapsychology then? Aren’t they ‘The Enemy’??&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you might not know is that the &lt;a href="http://www.parapsych.org/members/m_thalbourne.html"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/summary_0199-499241_ITM"&gt;the papers&lt;/a&gt; that I cited which use Rasch modelling when measuring paranormal beliefs were written by Parapsychologists. Just because they are researchers in that field, doesn’t mean we can’t work with them (e.g.: Wiseman and Watt) - nor does it prevent us from being inspired by (or discourage us from improving upon) studies which might contribute to both Parapsychology and Psychology in general. Rather like the research I’m doing - there’s a gradient between the ’sheep’ and the ‘goats’ and I want to be in-between. Yes, some things are clearly wrong, as demonstrated in the blog post about &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?p=1048"&gt;Quantum Physics&lt;/a&gt;. I do, however, find elements very useful and think others can find them useful too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why don’t you ‘cheerlead’ in those shoes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;dance&lt;/em&gt; in those shoes, &lt;em&gt;that’s what they’re for&lt;/em&gt;. For &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;, I do the research; I spend time talking to and studying with teachers; I committed myself for several years in order to better understand the theories and do the practical. I don’t think it’s right to put myself up as an authority in superstitions, the relationship they have to gender, skepticism or belief unless I do much, much more than just Google a few facts and stand in some nice shoes for a photograph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It deserves more than that - it’s not about how ‘hawt’ I am; nor should that be an excuse for someone skimping on or misrepresenting research. I hope people know and respect the difference, no matter what shoes I wear. Support and encouragement is a great thing and people having realistic faith in you and expecting high standards is very important - but can’t be the only thing you’re using if you say it’s ‘your job’ or if you’re presenting at a podium. You have to bring something to the table, for yourself and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, there’s some great posts I’ve read on skepticism on &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org"&gt;SkepticBlog&lt;/a&gt;. There’s ones by &lt;span&gt;Yau-Man Chan on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a rel="bookmark" href="http://skepticblog.org/2008/10/24/a-cultural-perspective/"&gt;‘Skepticism — A Cultural Perspective’&lt;/a&gt; that I’ve really enjoyed and although he talks about his rich personal experience with Chinese superstitions, I would rather draw upon examples of such wonderful anecdotes to contribute to the field formally - as I’ve begun to do here in this post, ‘&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?p=1000"&gt;Women and Superstitions - Part Four’.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one by another skeptic, &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2008/11/12/superstitions/"&gt;however, features quite a lot of confusion on his part as to what superstition actually means&lt;/a&gt; - Mark Edward writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘I would like to hear about and investigate those unsubstantiated knee-jerk reflex-based behaviors that reflect what’s going on in today’s mixed up world… like the whole “lather rinse and repeat” instructions on shampoo bottles - Why? What’s the superstition behind that or is there one? Or was it just a maketing decision to sell more shampoo? I expect it was the latter, but you get my drift.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ve written about the &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?p=1000"&gt;difficulty of defining ’superstition’ before&lt;/a&gt;. But in this case, Mark Edward isn’t discriminating between marketing and consumer-related behaviors and superstition. ‘&lt;em&gt;Lather, Rinse, Repeat&lt;/em&gt;‘ encourages you to &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; more shampoo, thus making you have to &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; more shampoo, as well presenting you with ‘how to wash’. We follow instructions on the bottle due to the authority we ascribe to the advertising, perhaps. If he was really talking about &lt;em&gt;superstition&lt;/em&gt;, rather than &lt;em&gt;the way science is communicated and understood regarding popular products we use&lt;/em&gt;… then perhaps he might have had a different sort of radio show proposal? I would suggest they read ‘&lt;a href="http://de.scientificcommons.org/21510231"&gt;Exploring the Antecedents and Consumer Behavior Consequences of the Trait of Superstion&lt;/a&gt;‘ by Mowen and Carlson (2003) instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What shoes are you wearing now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socks, actually - I’m on the couch. I’m about comfort first. You wear what you like, but when it comes to the crunch, it’s about getting the job done. Like this blog post, is now done. That’s kind of hot, I guess…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Writing in The Philosophers' Magazine, Brooke Lewis &lt;a href="http://www.philosophypress.co.uk/?p=615"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; tallies of full-time faculty at top American and British colleges show women make up less than a fifth of philosophy departments in Britain and little more than that in the United States. This suggests "that gender representation is far less balanced in philosophy than it is in many other humanities subjects."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, on quick examination, the gender balance among faculty in philosophy departments looks an awful lot like the gender balance among faculty in some typical science departments.  This is not a new finding, and it's certainly something those of us in academic philosophy have known about for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The piece floats an idea for where this gender disparity might be coming from:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/10/science_isnt_the_only_academic.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/10/science_isnt_the_only_academic.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/cr4Rarl2vKM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254849431528"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=19187">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9546252e7d6d866f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="bookplates"/><category term="Freakonomics"/><title type="html">Whiffenpoof</title><published>2009-10-06T16:23:50Z</published><updated>2009-10-06T16:23:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/whiffenpoof/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">I sang this past weekend at the Whiffenpoof Centennial Reunion Concert (you can hear examples of recent groups singing, here).

When the International Astronomical Union voted in 2006 to evict Pluto from the roster of planets in our solar system, little did they expect the public outcry that would arise. Boyle, an award-winning science writer and the science editor at MSNBC.com, presents the issues regarding Pluto’s status, both popular and scientific, in a winning fashion. After its discovery in 1930, the icy rock formerly known as Planet X was embraced by the public imagination, partly due to its status as “the oddball of the solar system”; no doubt having Walt Disney name a cartoon dog after it also helped. But as astronomers learned more about the solar system and the distant Kuiper Belt at its fringes, they realized that Pluto, with its lopsided spin and strangely tilted orbit was very special indeed. Now astronomers have identified at least five dwarf planets, or “mini-worlds,” orbiting our Sun. When the &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; spacecraft reaches Pluto in 2015, we’ll know more about this “underdog of the solar system.” Even then, the furor is bound to continue.

Some of the growth is likely spurred by a change in terminology: children who once would have been diagnosed as “emotionally disturbed” or “mentally retarded” are now notches on the autism spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On The Atlantic’s website, there’s an &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200910u/autism-diagnoses"&gt;eye-opening piece&lt;/a&gt; that looks behind the statistics and points out that along with the surge in diagnosis comes a wave of potential clients for services and supports that may not be available for anything less than a determination of full-on autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:490px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/10/hopscotch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/10/hopscotch.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of D Sharon Pruitt (flickr.com)" width="480" height="480"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo courtesy of D Sharon Pruitt (flickr.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget fuzzy terms like “processing disorder” or nonspecific developmental delay. The word “autism” is what gets funded services for a family desperate to get their child help without going bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The child gets help, but the numbers shoot up — and now, an eye-opening documentary, &lt;a href="http://www.autisticlike.com/"&gt;“Autistic-Like: Graham’s Story”&lt;/a&gt; tells the tale of Jennie and Erik Linthorst and their son Graham. At age 17 months, Jennie and Erik noticed something not quite right about their son. He was diagnosed as autistic. Possibly. Kind of. Some described him as autistic-like; others said he didn’t fit the criteria. The parents flung themselves into full-on therapeutic mode, getting services and therapies for him. But something about the therapies didn’t seem right either, and so Jennie and Erik researched until they found a developmental pediatrician who diagnosed Graham with sensory-processing issues. “Keep the label anyway,” she advised, “so you can get services.” But she prescribed other treatment for Graham that the Linthorsts would have to pay for out of pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentary is being shown at some 90 venues Oct. 10 and 11. Check for &lt;a href="http://www.autisticlike.com/screenings.html"&gt;showtimes &lt;/a&gt;near you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I think: kids who receive the diagnosis of autism because of much milder issues are the ones who later turn up as “cured.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s fine with me if people stand under an ever-expanding autism umbrella in order to get the help they need. But I don’t like them to leave the umbrella and stand under clear skies, and proclaim that any child can be cured if the parents want it enough, or work hard enough, or do enough research. We have done all of that, including dream of a cured Alex in our sleep, an Alex who can communicate with us and the world. What I’d like is for those parents to acknowledge that what they were experiencing was a cloudy day. But it’s still raining for us, and likely always will be.&lt;/p&gt;

I cover some of the same ground that Ben does in his pitch-perfect &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; magazine &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/11/magazine/11FOB-onlanguage-t.html"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;, mentioning his generosity to his critics and his willingness to acknowledge his mistakes. A very different tenor from his weekday columns — I think his Sunday readers got the best of him. I also pay tribute to his disinclination to engage in the rhetorical high jinks of other popular grammarians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was no snob. You can't imagine him comparing a poet who confused &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and&lt;span&gt; &lt;em&gt;among&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with someone picking his nose at a party, the way John Simon once did. And he wasn&amp;#39;t susceptible to the grammatical vapors that affect writers like Lynne Truss — the people who like to describe lapses of grammar as setting their teeth on edge, making their skin crawl, or leaving them gasping for breath, as if they&amp;#39;d spent all their lives up till now closeted with Elizabeth and Darcy in the morning room at Pemberley. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, there was his ability to convey his pleasure in ruminating on language: &amp;quot;It wasn&amp;#39;t just that he loved words — who doesn&amp;#39;t? But he really, really liked them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other things on Safire worth looking at include Jan Freeman's &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/10/04/safires_secret/?page=2"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Boston&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Globe&lt;/em&gt; (if I had read this before I wrote mine I probably wouldn't have bothered) and &lt;a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/pungent-pundit-pugnacity"&gt;Todd Gitlin&lt;/a&gt;'s in the &lt;em&gt;New Republic&lt;/em&gt;, as well as a &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/216476"&gt;reminiscence&lt;/a&gt; by Aaron Britt, who served as Safire's assistant for a while. (The &lt;em&gt;New Republic&lt;/em&gt; also posted part of a 1987 &lt;a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/books/excerpt-%E2%80%9Ctalk-talk%E2%80%9D"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of one of Safire's language books by Louis Menand.) For a more unforgiving take, see David Bromwich's "&lt;a href="http://original.antiwar.com/david-bromwich/2009/09/30/william-safire-wars-made-out-of-words/"&gt;Wars Made Out Of Words&lt;/a&gt;."

Very worthy selections, which are being &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2009/10/nobel_for_high-speed_internet.php"&gt;justly celebrated&lt;/a&gt; in certain quarters as a triumph of practicality.  Can’t argue with that — as Chad says, things like the internet (brought to you in part by fiber-optic cables) and digital cameras (often based on CCD’s) affect everyone’s lives in tangible ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they are also important for lovely impractical uses!  When I hear “fiber optics” and “CCD’s” in the same breath, I am immediately going to think of the &lt;a href="http://www.sdss.org/"&gt;Sloan Digital Sky Survey&lt;/a&gt; (SDSS), which has provided us with the most detailed map we have of our neighborhood of the universe.  Almost a million galaxies, and over 100,000 quasars, baby!  How impractical is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/10/sloan-telescope.jpg" alt="Sloan telescope" title="Sloan telescope" width="498" height="550"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SDSS is a redshift survey, which means it’s not sufficient to just snap a picture of all those galaxies; you also want to measure their spectra (i.e., break down their light into individual frequencies) to see how much they have been shifted to the red by the cosmological expansion.  And you just want the spectra of the galaxies, not the blank parts of the sky in between them.  The Sloan technique was to drill giant plates for each patch of sky, with one hole corresponding to the position of every galaxy to be surveyed.  (There were a lot of plates.)  This image from the &lt;a href="http://www.galaxyzooblog.org/2009/04/01/a-visit-to-apache-point/"&gt;Galaxy Zoo blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you want to bring that light down to the camera.  You guessed it — fiber-optic cables.  Thanks, Dr. Kao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/10/sloan-fibers.jpg" alt="Sloan fibers" title="Sloan fibers" width="600" height="405"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera in question was possibly the most complex camera ever built — thirty separate CCD’s, combining for 120 megapixels in total, all cooled to -80 degrees Celsius.  Thanks, Drs. Boyle and Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/10/sloan-camera.jpg" alt="Sloan Camera" title="Sloan Camera" width="432" height="324"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the result is — well, it’s pretty, but it doesn’t materially affect your standard of living.  It’s a map of our local neighborhood in the universe.  Extremely useful if you’d like to understand something about the evolution of large-scale structure, for example to pin down the properties of dark matter and dark energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sdss.org/includes/sideimages/sdss_pie2.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/10/sdss_pie2.jpg" alt="Sloan map of the universe" title="Sloan map of the universe" width="600" height="597"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also useful for providing a bit of perspective.  It’s technological advances like those honored in this year’s Prize that make it possible for we insignificant sacs of organic matter to stretch our senses out into the universe and understand the much bigger picture of which we are a part.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254843262120"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=9716">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8819e60a2988158a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Chat"/><category term="Guest Bloggers"/><category term="Religion &amp; Spirituality"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Stuff You'll Like"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">Skepchick Presents: A Conversation with Dr. Eugenie Scott (Parts 3 &amp;amp; 4)</title><published>2009-10-06T15:00:16Z</published><updated>2009-10-06T15:00:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/10/skepchick-presents-a-conversation-with-dr-eugenie-scott-parts-iii-and-iv/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3221da5ab8e24207312429cc1db6787a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eugenie Scott has been a prominent figure in the fight to keep creationism out of public school for many years, and she has seen the ever-changing tactics religious fundamentalists use to worm creation myths into science classes. The following two videos deal mainly with the evolution of those creationist tactics.

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this fellow is cute and funny, but more importantly, the video provides reason to tell the rest of his story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/142526/0/full"&gt;Kakapo&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Strigops habroptila&lt;/em&gt;) is the fattest, largest, and &lt;em&gt;rarest&lt;/em&gt; species of parrot on earth. It is a flightless, nocturnal bird that lives on four offshore islands near New Zealand.

Dear Richard,    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a senior in high school and I am preparing to start the college   admissions process. A few of the colleges that I am planning on   applying to use the Common Application. The essay for the Common App is open-ended and can be written on any topic of choice.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am contemplating writing about my experiences as a teenage atheist for the subject of this essay. I am not planning on explaining the reasons why I’m an atheist or even talk about atheism itself. I simply want to share how being a minority has affected my life by sharing my experiences. I think that it would be a very personal and sincere essay and it would allow the schools to see who I really am.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, however, I am worried about the potential for   discrimination. I feel that it is risky to even mention the fact that   I don’t believe in God to the people who are paid to judge my   character and who also have influence over my future. Surely they have received plenty of similar essays from racial minorities sharing their experiences, but I’m not sure how they would react to an atheist doing the same.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, the Common App colleges that I am applying to are also   my “reach” schools, so I am willing to take more of a risk with their essays. I have also done some research, and each one of these schools has a student group that is affiliated the Secular Student Alliance. Still, I am hesitant about risking my chances for admission due to my essay topic selection.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I have only found very limited advice on the internet and most   of it recommends avoiding the subject of religion, especially atheism.   Any additional advice would be greatly appreciated.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;
College-Bound Student
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear College-Bound,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, the eternal struggle between principles and pragmatism, what ought to be vs. what works.  In principle, you should be able to write about “any topic of choice,” just as it says on the application. But pragmatically, with that particular topic, you’re taking a chance that you’ll be denied an acceptance regardless of how well it is written. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In principle, with an open-ended topic the admissions staff reviewer should be evaluating mainly for your ability to express yourself clearly and skillfully, with a style that shows promise that you will be able to write appropriately for academic works.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, the admissions reviewer is a human being, subject to emotions, biases and even prejudice.  The loathsome intolerance against atheists and atheism is very widespread and very strong.  At this point in time, discrimination against racial minorities and religious minorities such as Jews is socially taboo enough to get people who discriminate fired, as it should.  Discrimination against gays and lesbians is steadily becoming more taboo, but is still accepted by a large portion of the population. However, discrimination against atheists seems to be almost universally accepted, rarely resulting in social embarrassment or penalty at all. We have a long way to go.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When broaching subjects that society is still learning to accept, timing is important.  Today, someone writing an application essay about socialism would probably risk little if any negative reaction to the topic, but in the 1950’s they could kiss their chances goodbye, and perhaps even be blacklisted at colleges across the nation.  Timing makes a huge difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colleges seem to vary widely in their admissions policies.  Is it a picky college looking to exclude applicants for any hint of controversy, or is it more open and only looking at essays to screen out people who can’t write coherent sentences?  Is there a clear and practiced criteria for judging an essay, or is it subjective to the sensibilities of whoever happens to read it?  You probably have no way of finding out ahead of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The admissions staff may have no problem with you being an atheist, or they may disapprove but try to disregard it, or they may be negatively influenced subconsciously, or they may even see themselves as protecting the college from influences that they think are objectionable and they will reject you any way they can.  Their set of “principles” may not include giving an atheist a fair chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your “reach” schools may have SSA affiliates on campus, but that does not necessarily indicate an atmosphere of acceptance that permeates all the way into the Admissions department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found an interesting website called &lt;a href="http://www.educationplanner.com/education_planner/applying_article.asp?sponsor=2859&amp;amp;articleName=How_Admission_Decisions_are_Made"&gt;Education Planner&lt;/a&gt; that seems to have some good advice on several aspects of successful college admission, including this statement about essays:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, a great essay can really make an admission official sit up and take notice. However, subjectivity prevails here. Some readers are biased toward content; some toward writing style and mechanics. One applicant submitted an ambitious essay that compared the works of three Eastern European writers. Two of her evaluators were impressed by her literary sophistication and the insight of her analysis; a third couldn’t get beyond the errors in spelling and sentence structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College-Bound, whether or not this topic for your essay is a good idea depends on many factors that are not within your control.  You have control over some of the materials you send to them, and other materials, such as your transcripts, you do not.   By sending them your proposed essay, you will be relinquishing even more control to them, and to the perhaps slim odds that they will follow principles that you hope they share with you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that in this horse race, the odds don’t pay any better if you bet on the long shot instead of on the favorite.  You are accepted or rejected. That’s all you get.  For taking a greater risk, you do not get a greater return.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to make it very clear that by starting out my response by contrasting principles vs. pragmatics, I was not implying that you would be compromising your &lt;em&gt;personal principles&lt;/em&gt; by choosing a less risky topic.  That would be a false dichotomy that does not apply at all.  You have made no promises regarding your choice of topic; you owe no one anything about it.  This is your bid to get into one of the colleges of your choice. You’re free to write about whatever you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many atheists stress the importance of  “coming out” publicly because it helps to dispel the myths and negative stereotypes and to normalize our image as legitimate members of society. In general, I agree with this, but it has to be each person’s decision, made with their own interest in mind, carefully considering the pros and cons of taking that step at any particular point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You said, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that it would be a very personal and sincere essay and it would allow the schools to see who I really am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m sure that it would be sincere and candid.  I just wonder if your sincerity and candor will be honored by the people who have the choice to give you or deny you what you want.  Whatever you write about, have it be something that you can express clearly, with a balance of both passion and intelligence.  That could probably be several subjects.  Your atheism is only one aspect of you.  In your writing, demonstrate the traits that have led to your atheism: your ability to think freely, to go beyond the popular assumptions, to question, investigate and reason. Those traits apply to many more things in your life than just a question about the existence of gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, as a beginning student you have very little power, clout or authority. If I were in your position, I’d wait until my completed education had given me enough power, clout and authority to defend myself against the inevitable backlash before declaring my atheism in an essay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if I were in your position I’d be 40 years younger, and back then “the principle of the thing,” the idea that I ought to be able to write about whatever I damn well please would have been more important to me.  Over the decades, I’ve become more pragmatic. I’ve charged up several hills with my comrades only to find myself at the top facing the enemy alone, so I’ve learned to pick my battles and most importantly to &lt;em&gt;pick the right time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should eventually write this essay, and I hope that many people read your story.  I just would hate to see one more paragraph in it relating how your education was hampered because of another incidence of the bigotry that so many of us have experienced, simply because you made your move too soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish you the very best of experiences in your education and career. This is the beginning of a wonderful and challenging time in your life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Before the war, it was said "the United States are." Grammatically, it was spoken that way and thought of as a collection of independent states. And after the war, it was always "the United States is," as we say today without being self-conscious at all. And that sums up what the war accomplished. It made us an "is."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innumerable history lectures have featured similar rhetoric, but as a biologist friend of mine once said about a popular but flamboyantly inventive documentary in his area of specialization, "this is, well, poetically true". In real life, that is, it's false. The civil war may have "made us an 'is'", but it doesn't seem to have brought about any  abrupt change in the grammar of "the United States".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write &amp;quot;doesn&amp;#39;t seem to&amp;quot; because no one seems ever to have checked, at least not very thoroughly. So after a few years of intending to get to it, I&amp;#39;ve done a bit of poking around. And I&amp;#39;ve discovered two things. First, we need a change in how historical text archives are managed. (At least, I do.) And second, number-agreement — on whatever time scale it happened — is not at all, in my opinion, the most interesting historical change in the grammatical treatment of &amp;quot;the United States&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executive summary of these two points: First, web-based search of digital text archives is well and good, but it's also critical for scholars to be able to run arbitrary computer programs over entire historical text corpora. In most cases, there's no provision for distribution of the texts that would make that possible; in some cases, the "business model" for the digitization process may actually prevent it.  Second, and more substantively, there's a striking increase during the 19th century in the propensity of the phrase "the United States" to occur in subject position, reflecting an increase in perceived agency and perhaps even in animacy (i.e. personification). In the early decades of the 19th century, "the United States" hardly ever occurs as a grammatical subject; today, about half of all textual occurrences are in subject position. Much more research will be needed to determine the  time course of this change, but in newspaper text, it may have been associated with reporting and editorializing about military and diplomatic activities in the 1840s such as the struggle over Oregon and the Mexican-American War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/WedgwoodMedallion.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/WedgwoodMedallion.png" alt="" width="150" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Let me start by tracing Shelby Foote's pontification to its historical roots. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Lanneau_Gildersleeve"&gt;Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve&lt;/a&gt; wrote in &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-vsQAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=Hellas+and+Hesperia#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hellas and Hesperia; or, The vitality of Greek studies in America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1909) that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Not that I am ashamed of being a grammarian, and if I chose I might enlarge on the historical importance of grammar in general, and Greek grammar in particular. It was a point of grammatical concord which was at the bottom of the Civil War — &amp;quot;United States are,&amp;quot; said one, &amp;quot;United States is,&amp;quot; said another; and a whimsical scholar of my acquaintance used to maintain that the ignorance of Greek idiom that brought about the mistranslation &amp;quot;Men and brethren&amp;quot; (Acts ii, 29) is responsible for the humanitarian cry, &amp;quot;Am I not a man and a brother?&amp;quot; which made countless thousands mourn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gildersleeve, who fought for the Confederacy, is referring to a popular anti-slavery medallion by Josiah Wedgwood showing a kneeling slave in chains with the inscription &amp;quot;Am I not a man and a brother?&amp;quot;. His little joke about United States number agreement was not apparently founded on any textual scholarship, but neither was it original — a similar thought can be found in G H Emerson, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=R4sUAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;lpg=PA3&amp;amp;ots=Ju8McNqrhp&amp;amp;dq=Emerson%20%22the%20making%20of%20a%20nation%22%20Universalist%20quarterly&amp;amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=under%20the%20technical%20name&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;The Making of a Nation&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;The Universalist Quarterly and General Review&lt;/em&gt;, January 1891:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;For about a decade the states, under the technical name, "The United States of America," &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; a Confederacy; but when the Constitution was adopted the United States &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;.  "They" gave place to "it."  And as Mr. Fiske in his latest book, "Civil Government in the United States," has noted, the change from the plural to the singular was vital, though it has taken a War of Rebellion to make the difference unmistakable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Fiske in turn expressed the thought this way, in his 1891 work &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EDnOsVKyipsC&amp;amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;Civil Government in the United States Considered with some Reference to its Origins&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;From 1776 to 1789 the United States &lt;em&gt;were &lt;/em&gt;a confederation; after 1789 it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a federal nation. The passage from plural to singular was accomplished, although it took some people a good while to realize the fact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these pre-Foote versions of the meme assume that the grammatical consequence of this political change was a gradual one, starting with the Constitutional Convention and proceeding through the 19th century. In this picture, the  Civil War was one episode in a long argument over interpretation, starting earlier and continuing later; it was not the cause of any abrupt change in grammatical behavior.  Foote's contribution to this area of  meta-linguistic ideology was to invent (or at least popularize) the whole abrupt behavior-change story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've taken these citations from Ben Zimmer's discussions in alt.usage.english ("&lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.usage.english/msg/ffaa9399391376cf"&gt;These United States&lt;/a&gt;", 10/5/2004), Language Log ("&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002663.html"&gt;Life in these, uh, this United States&lt;/a&gt;", 11/24/2005) and in his Word Routes column at the Visual Thesaurus ("&lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/1907/"&gt;The United States Is… Or Are?&lt;/a&gt;", 7/3/2009). As Ben observes, there is at least one limited attempt at genuine textual scholarship on this point, in the form of a newspaper article by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Foster"&gt;John W. Foster&lt;/a&gt;, "&lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D03E3DB103DEE32A25757C0A9639C946097D6CF"&gt;ARE OR IS?; Whether a Plural or a Singular Verb Goes With the Words United States&lt;/a&gt;", NYT, May 4, 1901:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The reason which has largely controlled the use of the plural verb with "United States" is one of euphony. It seems more natural and euphonistic to couple with this phrase "have" or "were," rather than "has" or "was." In public documents, such as the Presidents' messages, I find a number of examples where both the singular and plural forms are used in the same paper, and sometimes in the same sentence. For instance, Secretary Bayard: "The United States have no reason to believe that any discrimination against its citizens is intended." As the writer gets away from the phrase in the plural form, he escapes the euphonistic influence, and recurs to the the true significance of the words.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The result of a somewhat cursory examination of the treatment of "United States" by our public men and official bodies may be found curious, if not decisive of the proper or permissive use of the verb and pronoun in connection with that phrase. It is found that in the earlier days of the Republic the prevailing practice was the use of the plural, but even then many of our pulbic men at times employed the singular. Among statesmen who have used the the singular form may be cited Hamilton, Webster, Silas Wright, Benton, Schurz, Edmunds, Depew. Of our Secretaries of State Jefferson, Marcy, Sweard, Fish, Evarts, Baline, Frelinghuysen, Bayard, Gresham, and Olney. Among diplomats Motley, C. F. Adams, E.J. Phelps, and Reid. Of living professors of international law and lawyers Woolsey of Yale, Moore of Columbia, Huffcut of Cornell, and James C. Carter of New York. In the earlier message of the Presidents the use of the singular verb is seldom found, Jackson's being the only one noted; but in later years Lincoln, Grant, Cleveland, Harrison, and McKinley. Messages of the last three are found in which the singular verb alone is used throughout the message in connection with "'United States."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The decision of the Supreme Court in the earlier years rarely show the use of the singular, but several cases have been found, and in later years its use has been growing much more frequent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The result of my examination is that, while the earlier practice in referring to the "United States" usually followed the formula of the Constitution, our public men of the highest authority gave their countenance, by occasional use, to the singular verb and pronoun: that since the civil war the tendency has been toward such use; and that to-day among public and professional men it has become the prevailing practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For today, I'll close with a few counts and examples from the &lt;a href="http://digitalnewspapers.libraries.psu.edu/Default/Skins/civilwar/Client.asp?skin=civilwar"&gt;Pennsylvania Civil War Newspapers&lt;/a&gt; archive at Penn State, "A collection of newspapers from the civil war era dated from February 23,1831 to February 14,1877."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked the first 50 articles containing the phrase "the United States" in the year 1836, published between January 1 and April 25. These involved roughly 150 tokens of the phrase (I didn't try to count them, but there are typically several in an article where there is one). Of all of these, there was only one in subject position (with plural verb agreement), in a story about the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Revolution"&gt;Texas War of Independence&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Volunteers arrive daily; and our marine is in a state to blockade the Mexican ports. The result of the delay in the actual strife with the central government will be a radical separation; and if we may credit rumors, the United States propel to this; we shall see hereafter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one other where "the United States" refers to the frigate rather than to the nation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The United States, we believe, was built in Philadelphia. [refers to the ship "which has recently undergone a thorough repair at New York"]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other examples are all attributives (the United States Mint, the United States Senate, the United States Infirmary, the United States Bank, the United States ports), or heads of prepositional phrases (the government of the United States, the president of the United States, the Bank of the United States, trade with the United States, the northern coasts of the United States), or verbal objects, or etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching similarly in the year 1846, I looked at the first 50 articles containing the phrase "the United States", published between January 1 and June 27. These contained 18 cases where the phrase occurs in subject position. (And singular agreement is almost as common and plural agreement.) FWIW, here the examples are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;It is contended, on the part of Great Britain, that the United States acquired and hold the Spanish title subject to the terms and conditions of the Nootka Sound convention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In the mean time, the United States were proceeding with the discoveries which served to complete and confirm the Spanish American title to the whole of the disputed territory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Will the United States allow 20,000 of these bitter and irreconcilable foes [the Mormons] to take possession of any portion of the Pacific coast that is now or may hereafter by purchase become ours?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In the discussion on the address in the Chamber of deputies, the United States and Texas have likewise come in for a good deal of observation. […] He observed that it was appeared to him, from the remarks in the President&amp;#39;s message, that the U. States were dissatisfied in the Texas affair, …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The United States in annexing Texas had assumed the responsibility that devolved upon Texas antecedent to that event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The unprejudiced of all parties, we doubt not, will freely admit that the United States have a clear right to the territory on which Gen. Taylor is stationed with his troops, and if so, the charge of the Gazetter, that the President has invaded Mexico, is utterly untrue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Certain it is, that if Texas had not that right, then the United States had not; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;He attempted to show that President Polk had trampled upon the constitution of his country — that Gen. Taylor, by his orders, had invaded Mexico — that his army was posted upon soil which did not belong to Texas, and over which neither the Republic or the United States had even exercised civil jurisdiction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;This newspaper has always maintained that neither England nor the United States is entitled to Oregon, and it seizes this occasion to recommend the French government to insist on the whole territory being declared neutral.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;…it is now entirely proper to remind our readers that the United States has for a long series of years in terms mild and conciliatory, been endeavoring to obtain from Mexico a fair and just rumuneration for the &amp;quot;injuries and wrongs&amp;quot;; sustained by our citizens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Against Mexico the United States had a black catalogue of robbery, insult and perfidy, anterior to the Texan controversy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;As we said before, we have those in our midst who declare that the United States is in the wrong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Is he really willing to vote for resolutions recommending a vigorous prosecution of the war, and in the same breath to declare that it is an unjust war, and that the United States is in the wrong?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;From what I can collect, I am of opinion that if the United States, at present, were to attempt to conquer Mexico, or even to annex any considerable portion of its territory, they would cause great dissatisfaction in France; …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;This calculation is based somewhat upon the idea that the United States will order an expedition from the Missouri river upon the northern provinces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The United States of America will never recede in the face of Monarchy; they must greet a kindred Republic across the Rio Grande, or advance and entrench themselves upon the ragged steeps and defiles of the Sierra Madre.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In other words, while the treaty of peace and commerce between Mexico and the United States is in full force, the United States, presuming on her strength and prosperity, and on our supposed imbecility and cowardice, attempts to make you the blind instrumnets of her unholy and mad ambition, and force you to appear as the hateful robbers of our dear homes, and the unprovoked violators of our dearest feelings as men and patriots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two swallows don't make much of a summer, but that's all for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've done a bit more research, which I'll cover in a later post, along with an account of the ideas about animacy, agency and subjecthood pioneered by Michael Silverstein ( "&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=AGtOKft0c8UC&amp;amp;lpg=PA163&amp;amp;ots=3VIPbD1ZK-&amp;amp;dq=SIlverstein"&gt;Hierarchy of Features and Ergativity&lt;/a&gt;", in R.M.W. Dixon (ed.), &lt;em&gt;Grammatical Categories in Australian Languages&lt;/em&gt;, 1976), and widely discussed since by linguists (e.g. Judith Aissen, "&lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/n85627w830816428/"&gt;Markedness and Subject Choice in Optimality Theory&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Natural Language and Linguistic Theory&lt;/em&gt;, 1999) and psycholinguists (e.g. F. Ferreira, "&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2005.02.010"&gt;Choice of Passive Voice is Affected by Verb Type and Animacy&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Journal of Memory and Language&lt;/em&gt;, 1994; Willem Mak et al. "&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2006.01.001"&gt;Animacy in processing relative clauses: The hikers that rocks crush&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Journal of Memory and Language&lt;/em&gt;, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could get hold of the underlying texts, then rather than painfully reading all this stuff by hand, I could classify examples automatically on a large scale, and make more serious progress much more rapidly on a picture of this phrase&amp;#39;s changes in number agreement and subjecthood — and their relationship — over time and space. That&amp;#39;s just what I hope to do, if the archivists are kind.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254841490205"><id gr:original-id="http://ecographica.blogspot.com/2009/10/field-photos-caster-canadensis-does.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b6ec6b2ca0338853</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Field Photos: Caster canadensis does some landscaping</title><published>2009-10-06T10:41:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-06T10:41:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/3v1kyoYFXIQ/field-photos-caster-canadensis-does.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://ecographica.blogspot.com/2009/10/field-photos-caster-canadensis-does.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">...at any rate, beavers (Caster canadenis) don’t have quite the impact on the landscape down here in the southeastern United States as they do in more northern regions of the Americas.

Jesus existed because there&amp;#39;s an old scrap of cloth with a face on it!&amp;quot; It doesn&amp;#39;t matter that I point out that it&amp;#39;s been dated to the 13th century, and was nothing more than a profit-making &amp;#39;relic&amp;#39; for churches that would also hawk Jesus&amp;#39;s foreskin and John the Baptist&amp;#39;s pinky bone. They&amp;#39;d usually retort that it was not humanly possible to make the shroud, so it had to be a religious miracle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I've got more ammo. &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSTRE5943HL20091005"&gt;The Shroud of Turin has been recreated&lt;/a&gt;, using simple medieval technologies. No magic, just acidic pigments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, it won't stop the kooks, but it's still useful to know. Next up, we need more evidence against the &lt;a href="http://www.concernedcatholics.org/miracles.htm"&gt;patently goofy Miracle of Luciano&lt;/a&gt;, which is the other 'proof' of god that gets flung around a lot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/shroud_of_turin_is_not_a_mirac.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/yyqX3JZlve8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254841257940"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/some_polls_arent_meant_to_be_a.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/41d9c46e0dcc9409</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Some polls aren't meant to be answered, apparently</title><published>2009-10-06T14:32:53Z</published><updated>2009-10-06T14:32:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/-HEcrgtPcNk/some_polls_arent_meant_to_be_a.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/some_polls_arent_meant_to_be_a.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is an utterly ludicrous evangelical 'course' which has been advertising in England by slapping big ol' polls on the wall. Like this one:

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/10/some_polls_arent_meant_to_be_a/alpha.jpeg" width="375" height="500" alt="alpha.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is, those boxes are blank…but man, they&amp;#39;re just begging to be filled in, and a lot of people can&amp;#39;t resist walking up to them and marking the right answer. Unfortunately, the &lt;a href="http://badscience.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;amp;t=12245&amp;amp;start=0&amp;amp;sid=0e2e2785179c233527c042ffe99b0654"&gt;transit police are then arresting them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a metaphor there. Looking at this &lt;a href="http://alpha.org/"&gt;Alpha Course&lt;/a&gt;, what I see is a narrow evangelical game that &lt;i&gt;pretends&lt;/i&gt; to be an open arena for skeptical inquiry, but is actually nothing of the kind.  Their ads are full of questions that by their very nature reveal that they expect certain kinds of answers, answers that only verify the dogma of Christianity. Look what they go on about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is Jesus?&lt;br&gt;
Why did Jesus die?&lt;br&gt;
How can we have faith?&lt;br&gt;
Why and how do I pray?&lt;br&gt;
Why and how should I read the Bible?&lt;br&gt;
How does God guide us?&lt;br&gt;
How can I resist evil?&lt;br&gt;
Why &amp;amp; how should we tell others?&lt;br&gt;
Does God heal today?&lt;br&gt;
What about the Church?&lt;br&gt;
Who is the Holy Spirit? &lt;br&gt;
What does the Holy Spirit do?&lt;br&gt;
How can I be filled with the Holy Spirit?&lt;br&gt;
How can I make the most of the rest of my life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it seems to me that if your answer to the basic question of whether there is a god is "no", it's silly to go on to make assumptions about the divinity of Jesus, or babble about prayer, or talk about mysterious magical entities like the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what they're doing. Answer any question with reason, or an expectation of evidence, anything but blind affirmation, and they will lock you up. It's how religion works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/some_polls_arent_meant_to_be_a.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/-HEcrgtPcNk" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254840857772"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/donorschoose---guess_what_mich.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/073dd29a43dcbbe1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Donors Choose"/><title type="html">DonorsChoose---guess what?

You've helped fully fund several programs now.  Donations have reflected my readership---individual donations have ranged from a few dollars to a few hundreds of dollars.  Every single dollar helps, and no contribution is too small (but homeopathic giving is discouraged).  So why don't you &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=24230"&gt;click over &lt;/a&gt;and consider sending a couple of bucks to a cool project?  I'm especially fond of &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=307196&amp;amp;challengeid=24230"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;; only $291.00 left to fully fund language aids for deaf kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How 'bout a challenge?  Let's try to fund &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/donorschoose---touching_sounds.php"&gt;this one project &lt;/a&gt;today.  We have the rest of the month to finish the others, but closing out this one today would be a huge victory.

Don't get me wrong. I am all about healthy pregnancy and baby and what-not, but I am not sure I can handle the idea of placenta pizza without losing my faith in the fact that we may have evolved beyond this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucky for us all, a creative pioneer and entrepreneur has come up with an alternative use for our wasted placentas....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designer Alex Green has &lt;a href="http://www.inhabitots.com/2009/10/01/doing-it-for-the-kids-design-exhibition-placenta-teddy-bear/"&gt;created a kit&lt;/a&gt; for the mother who "celebrates the unity of the infant, the mother and the placenta [that] enables preparation of the placenta so it may be transformed into a teddy bear."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A teddy bear.  A freaking teddy bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/10/more_things_to_do_with_your_pl/placentateddy.jpg" alt="placentateddy.jpg" height="320" width="437"&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: Perhaps not as snuggly as that Downy fabric softener bear...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing I am disturbed by is, where the hell are this bear's eyes and mouth?  Must this poor, unfortunate Frankenstein of children's toys be left to ponder the horror of its existence without even the ability to cry out in agony?&lt;/p&gt;

True, given the highly &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_crazies_are_out_in_force_after_richa.php#comment-1980615"&gt;annoying reaction of one reader&lt;/a&gt;, I was half-tempted to write yet another post on the whole fiasco just out of spite, but I decided that spite in and of itself was not a good reason to write a blog post. Well, in this case it isn't, anyway, but if it were someone like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/if_you_hand_me_some_stupid_yes_in_fact_i.php"&gt;Vox Day&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/05/some_monkey_business_in_autism_research.php"&gt;J.B. Handley&lt;/a&gt;, or a hapless &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/you_knew_it_had_to_happen_a_quack_likens.php"&gt;quack&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/03/train_wreck_thy_name_is_egnor.php"&gt;creationist&lt;/a&gt;, well, a wee bit of spite can make for some mighty fine blogging that's really fun to write. True, spite should never be the be-all and end-all of a blog, but certainly it's part of the mix, along with ridicule, which some targets of Orac's Insolence, both the Respectful and not-so-Respectful varieties, deserve in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of spite, though, does anyone remember a regular commenter here by the name of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/dr_jay_gordon_pediatrician_to_the_stars.php#comment-1013445"&gt;Dawn&lt;/a&gt;? No, not "Dawn from MI," who had to start signing her posts that way in order to distinguish herself from what we started calling "evil Dawn," a situation that sometimes caused confusion and made me feel sorry for "good Dawn's" having to put up with the occasional confusion. Ultimately, evil Dawn went too far, pissing me off to the point where I banned her, making her only the second person (out of three) ever banned in the five years of this blog, the first being John Best. (The third one banned was Happeh.) Given the august company that evil Dawn finds herself in, there is no doubt that the crazy was strong in this one. So was the spite, which was what finally got her kicked off as a commenter on this blog. Fortunately, unlike Happeh, Dawn has stayed gone, and the blog is much better off for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it looks as though Dawn found herself a "better" blogging gig than annoying my readers any time I blogged about vaccines. In fact, she's managed to get a bit of work of hers published on a fairly high profile anti-vaccine website, as some of my readers and one of my blog buds &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/hab_rachmones_anti-vax_inanity.php"&gt;PalMD&lt;/a&gt;, pointed out to me. The article is &lt;a href="http://vactruth.com/2009/10/02/fda-approved-h1n1-vaccines-contain-ingredients-known-to-cause-cancer-and-death/" rel="nofollow"&gt;FDA Approved H1N1 Vaccines Contain Ingredients Known to Cause Cancer and Death&lt;/a&gt;. Here's a hint. It's so bad that it's posted on &lt;a href="http://www.ktradionetwork.com/2009/10/05/h1n1-vaccines-contain-cancer-causing-ingredients/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kevin Trudeau's website as well&lt;/a&gt;.  Here's another hint: Even the anti-vaccine crank blog Age of Autism did not link to Dawn's post. (Maybe the "editors" there learned something from the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/cries_the_antivaccinationist_why_are_we.php"&gt;Heckenlively debacle&lt;/a&gt;. Naaaaaaahhh!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, in Dawn's article, the stupid is everlastingly burning. In fact, if a such a thing as hell exists, the fire burning there eternally would be Dawn's burning stupid, and the punishment for anyone with a modicum of knowledge of science would be to have Dawn read her article to you over and over again for all eternity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geez, I just scared even myself. Maybe I should start going to Mass again. And Confession. Maybe I could become an usher at the local church and join the Knights of Columbus. If there's even a homeopathic chance that this version of hell is waiting for me at the end of my life, it's enough to shake even my doubt. You'll soon see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/cries_the_antivaccinationist_why_are_we_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/cries_the_antivaccinationist_why_are_we_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/ueXsSU9kYVo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254839556219"><id gr:original-id="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/?p=1813">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a49770dbc3ff9a8c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="1"/><title type="html">Rock Star Scientists</title><published>2009-10-06T14:03:43Z</published><updated>2009-10-06T14:03:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/2009/10/06/rock-star-scientists/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/" type="html">The Canadian Stem Cell Foundation has posted a video on their site in support of the Stem Cell Charter – a document designed to promote stem cell research into various human diseases.

&lt;p&gt;This is part of a mailer Harris sent out last week regarding opponent &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://davidvbarbour.com/"&gt;David Barbour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://newmexicoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/harris-barbour.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/harris-barbour1.jpg" alt="harris-barbour" title="harris-barbour" width="550" height="646"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That box at the top reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
David Barbour, recently moved here from San Francisco.  He is a donor to &lt;em&gt;Atheist&lt;/em&gt; organizations and speaker at &lt;em&gt;Atheist&lt;/em&gt; events and attends radical political protests even in foreign countries.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the emphasis and capitalization of the word “atheist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see a &lt;a href="http://www.democracyfornewmexico.com/files/harrisflyer2sides.pdf"&gt;PDF of the mailing here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is offensive beyond belief.  (I mean, &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; at that poor grammar.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, Barbour never spoke at any major atheist convention or anything even close.  What has he done?  &lt;a href="http://newmexicoindependent.com/38444/abq-city-councilor-harris-responds-to-nmi-on-atheist-attack-on-challenger"&gt;Harris explains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Harris responded to our post with information indicating that Barbour was a member of a Unitarian Universalist congregation, who gave a talk on atheism and donated money to a scholarship in honor of Charles Darwin.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the money he gave was in support of science education, not atheism alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s a description of that terrible, horrible, no good, why-would-you-ever-want-to-vote-for-him? talk that he gave:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
On July 2nd, 2003 Katherine Hepburn passed away. The world lost a fine person, an excellent actress and a confirmed atheist. This service explores Ms. Hepburnís life, the positive aspects of atheism and the reasons why a Unitarian congregation is better off with some atheists and humanists. Along the way we find out about some atheist resources and what is happening locally in the atheist community.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbour, you monster…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of all this is to paint Barbour as some revolutionary radical liberal… notice the &lt;a href="http://static.open.salon.com/files/che-guevara1232976553.jpg"&gt;Che Guevara&lt;/a&gt;-like image in the mailing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know either man’s politics, but this is just very poor strategy.  It’s not like Barbour was a major threat to begin with.  Even the &lt;a href="http://alibi.com/index.php?story=29108&amp;amp;scn=feature"&gt;local alternative newspaper supported Harris&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local election is today.  It may be too late to mount any significant defense.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not too late to &lt;a href="http://keepdonharris.com/city-councilor-don-harris-contact.shtml"&gt;let Harris know you disapprove of his derogatory mailing and offensive methods of campaigning&lt;/a&gt;.  I’m sure he’ll enjoy getting your emails on election day.&lt;/p&gt;

But public controversies tend to live long past the scientific controversies on which they are based (creationism, vaccines and autism, HIV denial, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italian scientist Luigi Garlaschelli claims to have done what shroud proponents claim was impossible.  “We have shown that is possible to reproduce something which has the same characteristics as the Shroud,” &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20091005/sc_nm/us_italy_shroud"&gt;he is quoted&lt;/a&gt; as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garlaschelli laid his linen across a volunteer (whose face was covered with a mask) then essentially did a rubbing of their face, and then did some aging on the cloth, adding some blood stains and burn marks. The result is a good copy of the original shroud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years proponents claimed there was no way an artist could have created the shroud and that its characteristics result from a sudden burst of energy – a speculative hypothesis without confirming evidence. It was also an argument from ignorance – “we don’t know exactly how the shroud was made, therefore it was a miracle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definitive skeptical treatment of the Shroud of Turin was done by Joe Nickell, who wrote Inquest on the Shroud of Turin. He has also reproduced shroud-like images using a rubbing technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science of the shroud is a classic example of the difference between objective science and ideological pseudoscience. Scientists and historians who have examined the Shroud have discovered the following things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shroud first surfaced in the middle ages, in the 14 century, during a time when many fake relics were surfacing (a veritable cottage industry of fake relics) often used for fund raising. Investigations at the time found the shroud to be a fake. Bishop D’Arcis investigated the shroud &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud_of_Turin"&gt;and concluded&lt;/a&gt;:  “Eventually, after diligent inquiry and examination, he discovered how the said cloth had been cunningly painted, the truth being attested by the artist who had painted it, to wit, that it was a work of human skill and not miraculously wrought or bestowed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mcri.org/home/section/63-64/the-shroud-of-turin"&gt;Chemist Walter McCrone  found&lt;/a&gt; not human tissue or blood on the shroud, but red ochre and vermilion paint, consistent with what would have been available a the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depiction of Christ is consistent with the artistic traditions of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “rivulets of blood” apparently falling down Christ’s hair is implausible – blood would have soaked in, not run in rivulets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v337/n6208/abs/337611a0.html"&gt;Radiocarbon dating of the shroud&lt;/a&gt; by three independent labs resulted in dates from 1260-1390.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have, then, is multiple independent lines of evidence all pointing to a 14th century forgery. Specifically, the carbon dating points to the same period of time as when the shroud first appears, a period of time rife with fake shrouds and other relics, and consistent with the materials and artistic traditions evident in the shroud. This is a remarkable consilience of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, evidence will not end a public controversy where there are strongly held emotional beliefs. So-called “shroud scientists” have tried to dispute this evidence. Working backward from their desired result (that the shroud is the genuine burial shroud of Christ) they have tried to dispute every claim in a series of special pleading. For example, they claim that the carbon dating is inaccurate because of contamination. Contamination may alter carbon dating, but the shroud would have to be dripping with it in order for the date to be as far off as they claim it was. And it would have been a terrible coincidence if the contamination put off the date the exact amount to align with the date of the confessed forgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garlaschelli’s efforts are interesting, if they hold up, and his claims are highly plausible and consistent with the efforts of others. He recognizes, however, that it won’t end the controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they don’t want to believe carbon dating done by some of the world’s best laboratories they certainly won’t believe me,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although we have &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/12/2008-temperature-summaries-and-spin/"&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/11/mind-the-gap/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/04/model-data-comparison-lesson-2/"&gt;topic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/01/uncertainty-noise-and-the-art-of-model-data-comparison/"&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt;, it is perhaps worthwhile reiterating two key points about the alleged pause here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) This discussion focuses on just a short time period – starting 1998 or later – covering at most 11 years. Even under conditions of anthropogenic global warming (which would contribute a temperature rise of about 0.2 ºC over this period) a flat period or even cooling trend over such a short time span is nothing special and has happened repeatedly before (see 1987-1996). That simply is due to the fact that short-term natural variability has a similar magnitude (i.e. ~0.2 ºC) and can thus compensate for the anthropogenic effects. Of course, the warming trend keeps going up whilst natural variability just oscillates irregularly up and down, so over longer periods the warming trend wins and natural variability cancels out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) It is highly questionable whether this “pause” is even real. It does show up to some extent (no cooling, but reduced 10-year warming trend) in the Hadley Center data, but it does not show in the GISS data, see Figure 1. There, the past ten 10-year trends (i.e. 1990-1999, 1991-2000 and so on) have all been between 0.17 and 0.34 ºC per decade, close to or above the expected anthropogenic trend, with the most recent one (1999-2008) equal to 0.19 ºC per decade – just as predicted by IPCC as response to anthropogenic forcing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/GISStrends.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/GISStrends.jpg" alt="GISS temperature trends"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. &lt;/strong&gt;Global temperature according to NASA GISS data since 1980. The red line shows annual data, the larger red square a preliminary value for 2009, based on January-August. The green line shows the 25-year linear trend (0.19 ºC per decade). The blue lines show the two most recent ten-year trends (0.18 ºC per decade for 1998-2007, 0.19 ºC per decade for 1999-2008) and illustrate that these recent decadal trends are entirely consistent with the long-term trend and IPCC predictions. Even the highly “cherry-picked” 11-year period starting with the warm 1998 and ending with the cold 2008 still shows a warming trend of 0.11 ºC per decade (which may surprise some lay people who tend to connect the end points, rather than include all ten data points into a proper trend calculation).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Why do these two surface temperature data sets differ over recent years? We &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/11/mind-the-gap/"&gt;analysed this&lt;/a&gt; a while ago here, and the reason is the “hole in the Arctic” in the Hadley data, just where recent warming has been greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/ncepawrming.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/rcanim.gif" alt="Mean temperature difference between the periods  2004-2008 and 1999-2003" width="450" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/strong&gt; The animated graph shows the temperature difference between the two 5-year periods 1999-2003 and 2004-2008. The largest warming has occurred over the Arctic in the past decade and is missing in the Hadley data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to relate global temperature to global forcings like greenhouse gases, we’d better not have a “hole” in our data set. That’s because global temperature follows a simple planetary heat budget, determined by the balance of what comes in and what goes out. But if data coverage is not really global, the heat budget is not closed. One would have to account for the heat flow across the boundary of the “hole”, i.e. in and out of the Arctic, and the whole thing becomes ill-determined (because we don’t know how much that is). Hence the GISS data are clearly more useful in this respect, and the supposed pause in warming turns out to be just an artifact of the “Arctic hole” in the Hadley data – we don’t even need to refer to natural variability to explain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to check whether the balance in your accounts is consistent with your income and spendings – and you find your bank accounts contain less money than you expected, so there is a puzzling shortfall. But then you realise you forgot one of your bank accounts when doing the sums – and voila, that is where the missing money is, so there is no shortfall after all. That missing bank account in the Hadley data is the Arctic – and we’ve &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/11/mind-the-gap/"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; that this is where the “missing warming” actually is, which is why there is no shortfall in the GISS data, and it is pointless to look for explanations for a warming pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy in this context that despite the &lt;a href="http://www.pmodwrc.ch/pmod.php?topic=tsi/composite/SolarConstant"&gt;record low&lt;/a&gt; in the brightness of the sun over the past three years (it’s been at its faintest since beginning of satellite measurements in the 1970s), a number of &lt;a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/"&gt;warming records&lt;/a&gt; have been broken during this time. March 2008 saw the warmest global land temperature of any March ever recorded in the past 130 years. June and August 2009 saw the warmest land and ocean temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere ever recorded for those months. The global ocean surface temperatures in 2009 broke all previous records for three consecutive months: June, July and August. The years 2007, 2008 and 2009 had the lowest summer Arctic sea ice cover ever recorded, and in 2008 for the first time in living memory the Northwest Passage and the Northeast Passage were simultaneously ice-free. This feat was repeated in 2009. Every single year of this century (2001-2008) has been warmer than all years of the 20th Century except 1998 (which sticks out well above the trend line due to a strong El Niño event).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is: the observed warming over the last decade is 100% consistent with the &lt;a href="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/update_science2007.html"&gt;expected anthropogenic warming trend&lt;/a&gt; of 0.2 ºC per decade, superimposed with short-term natural variability. It is no different in this respect from the two decades before. And with an &lt;a href="http://www.elnino.noaa.gov/"&gt;El Niño developing&lt;/a&gt; in the Pacific right now, we wouldn’t be surprised if more temperature records were to be broken over the coming year or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; We were told there is a &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/journals/pip/jd/2009JD012442-pip.pdf"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; by Simmons et al. in press with JGR that supports our analysis about the Hadley vs GISS trends (sorry, access to subscribers only).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; AP has just published an interesting story titled &lt;a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/ap-impact-statisticians-reject-174088.html"&gt;Statisticians reject global cooling&lt;/a&gt;, for which they “gave temperature data to four independent statisticians and asked them to look for trends, without telling them what the numbers represented”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>stefan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254832462574"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticblog.org/?p=4668">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4ed11cbe748f2305</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Bastiat's Principle"/><category term="consumer-trading"/><category term="eBay"/><category term="economics"/><category term="free markets"/><category term="freedom"/><category term="Google"/><category term="internet"/><category term="markets"/><category term="MySpace"/><category term="Shermer"/><category term="trade"/><category term="twitter"/><category term="Wikipedia"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">The Revolution Will Be Tweeted</title><published>2009-10-06T12:00:51Z</published><updated>2009-10-06T12:00:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/10/06/the-revolution-will-be-tweeted/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.skepticblog.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the Atheist Alliance International conference this past weekend in Burbank, California, the Skeptics Society had a booth in the vendor’s section of book sellers and the like, the latter of which included a table full of bumper stickers. One struck me as a poignant proxy for what I predicted will happen at the end of my book, &lt;a href="http://www.michaelshermer.com/the-mind-of-the-market/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mind of the Market&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: the Internet as a form of trade will enable freedom to find a way. The bumper sticker reads: &lt;strong&gt;The Revolution Will be Tweeted&lt;/strong&gt;. I presume the reference is to the Iranian elections, the suppression of the protests of the corruption of which were tweeted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/revolution-tweeted.jpg" alt="The Revolution will be Tweeted." title="The Revolution will be Tweeted." width="560" height="194"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept allows me to expand to my blog readers here what I mean by “free trade.” Most of you have pounced on me for using terms like “libertarian” or “capitalism.” But what I mean by free trade is much broader and encompassing: &lt;em&gt;the free exchange of products, services, and ideas between people anywhere in the world anytime they want&lt;/em&gt;. To show how broadly I go with this concept, when Chimp A grooms Chimp B, and subsequently when Chimp A is attacked by an alpha male, Chimp B is more likely to come to his aid because they have formed a bond, an attachment, a trading relationship. Grooming in this example is a form of free trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this happen? In &lt;em&gt;The Mind of the Market&lt;/em&gt; I introduced &lt;em&gt;Bastiat’s Principle&lt;/em&gt;, based on an observation by the 19th-century French economist Frédéric Bastiat: “Where goods do not cross frontiers, armies will.” Its corollary elucidates one of the principle steps toward conflict reduction: &lt;em&gt;where goods do cross frontiers, armies will not&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a principle, not a law, since there are exceptions both historically and today. Trade — &lt;em&gt;the free exchange of products, services, and ideas between people&lt;/em&gt; — will not prevent war, but it attenuates its likelihood. Thinking in terms of probabilities instead of absolutes, trade between groups increases the probability that peaceful and stable relations will continue and decreases the probability that instabilities and conflicts will erupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, Yanomamö hunter-gatherers are not only the “fierce people,” as Napoleon Chagnon characterized them, they are also willing traders. Following the political dictum “the enemy of my enemy is my friend,” Yanomamö inter-village trade and reciprocal food exchanges serves as a powerful social glue in the creation of political alliances. As in my Chimp example above, Yanomamö Village A cannot go to Village B and announce that they are worried about being conquered by the more powerful Village C, since this would reveal their own weakness. Instead, Village A forms an alliance with Village B through trade and reciprocal feasting, and as a result they not only gain military protection but also encourage inter-village peace. As a by-product of this politically-motivated economic exchange, even though each Yanomamö band could produce all the products it needs for survival, they often set up a division of labor and a system of trade. The unintended consequence is an increase in both wealth and products. The Yanomamö trade not because they are innate altruists or nascent capitalists, but because they want to form political alliances. “Without these frequent contacts with neighbors,” Chagnon explains, “alliances would be much slower in formation and would be even more unstable once formed. A prerequisite to stable alliance is repetitive visiting and feasting, and the trading mechanism serves to bring about these visits.” &lt;em&gt;Where goods cross Yanomamö frontiers, Yanomamö armies do not&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bastiat’s Principle holds not only for hunter-gatherers but for consumer-traders as well. Note, for example, that in the modern world of consumer-trading nation states, economic sanctions are among the first steps taken by a nation against another when diplomatic conflict resolution attempts break down. Often such sanctions are imposed for purely economic reasons in a mercantilist mode, as when the United States imposed import tariffs on steel purchased from China and Russia in 2002, which the World Trade Organization declared to be illegal. Economic sanctions are also imposed for political reasons, as when the United States enforced them on Japan after its invasion of China in the 1930s, and these became a prelude (among other factors) to Japan’s retaliatory bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941 and our involvement in the greatest war in history. Or more recently, economic sanctions were imposed by the U.S. and Japan on India following its 1998 nuclear tests, by the U.S. on Iran because of the latter’s state sponsorship of terrorism, and by the United Nations on Iraq as a tool to force the Iraqi government to comply with U.N. weapons inspectors’ search for weapons of mass destruction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic sanctions send this message:&lt;em&gt; if you do not change your behavior we will no longer trade with you&lt;/em&gt;. And by Bastiat’s Principle, &lt;em&gt;where our goods do not cross your frontiers, our armies will&lt;/em&gt;. Not inevitably, of course, but often enough in history that the principle retains its veracity. Economic sanctions are not a necessary or even sufficient cause of war, but they are almost always a prelude to war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Mind of the Market&lt;/em&gt; I also introduce the Starbucks’ corollary to Bastiat’s Principle: &lt;em&gt;Where Starbucks cross frontiers, armies will not&lt;/em&gt;. That is, the free trade of products between peoples, and open access to services across geographic borders, obsoletes the necessity of political borders and thereby decreases the probability that armies will cross them. To the Starbucks corollary I add the Google theory of peace:&lt;em&gt; Where information and knowledge cross frontiers, armies will not&lt;/em&gt;. That is, the free trade of information between peoples, and open access to knowledge across geographic borders, obsoletes the necessity of political borders and thereby decreases the probability that armies will cross them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stirring example can be seen in Europe. Since the formation of the Treaty of Rome and the European Union — which integrated disparate and historically divided European nations under one economic umbrella — where once invasions and wars were commonplace throughout a thousand years of European history, they are now unthinkable. Try it. Imagine Germany invading France and waging war upon her, or picture France motoring its armies through the Chunnel and then marching them into London to declare the country French. What once made for dramatic literature now sounds like pulp fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wikification of the economy adds to the Google theory of peace the entire world economy as practiced by and participated in by billions of people. Wikipedia is the right analogue for this emerging economic phenomenon. It is an open-sourced, peer-produced, mass-collaborated, bottom-up, self-organized, emergent property of millions of people choosing to build the modern equivalent of the Alexandrian library whose purpose it was to make the sum of the world’s knowledge available to everyone in one location. Granted, the ancient Alexandrian Greeks had far less knowledge to store than we do today — by many orders of magnitude — but we have the World Wide Web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, no dictator, demagogue, priest, president, or any other pretender to power will be able to control the Googlefication, Wikification, eBayification, MapQuestification, YouTubeification, MySpaceification of information, knowledge, geography, personal relationships, markets, and the economy. Chinese bureaucrats can attempt to put all the firewalls and controls they want on a billion potential Chinese web surfers, but in the long run they will never be able to prevent knowledge, products, and people from finding their way to those who seek them. And to this list we can now add the Twitterfication of information. The revolution will be tweeted. And…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Freedom finds a way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

See below...&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The heart of my critique of Christianity isn't with the philosophical arguments for the existence of God. Even most believers think those type of arguments are inconclusive. No, I have a more fundamental critique of Christianity. I aim at the cultural source of why people believe in the first place, as well as the source of these beliefs found in the Bible. I claim the sources of the Christian faith are unreliable. Philosophers down through the centuries have shown that they can defend these beliefs with reason (at least partially and in their own minds). But they still must show that these beliefs come from reliable sources. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian, just ask yourself why you believed initially, that's what I mean. One guy sent me what he considered a new cosmological argument, which was stated really well. I asked him if this argument is why he initially believed. It can't be. Why? Because he believed before he read that argument. That argument only confirmed what he believed. Believers of all walks of life can confirm what they believe quite easily to themselves. We all have this strong tendency to confirm what we believe. I want to ask why people choose to believe what they do in the first place. My claim is that the reason it is so hard to argue Christians out of their beliefs is because they were never argued into them in the first place. We literally swim in a Christian culture. And I can look at the origins of our Christian culture stemming back to the Bible and show that the Bible is unreliable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-211253373075352161?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I was being ever so slightly disingenuous because the current state of progress is not such that we need to consider such questions as:

Would you recommend it broad-spectrum for all children much like MMR?

Would you recommend parents be permitted to subject their drug abusing teen against his or her will?

Allow the courts to mandate inoculation?

Suppose it were made a condition of employment?

A recent paper by Martell and colleagues provides a nice opportunity to review the promise and limitations of immunopharmacotherapy for drugs of abuse. The rationale for such studies is pretty easy to grasp, although at present the result fall short of the lasting immunity you associate with childhood vaccines and even the seasonal flu shot. Drugs of abuse are molecules that do not generate any immune response because they are too small. The starting rationale is that if you create a drug mimic and attach it to something that will attract the attention of the immune system you might be able to generate antibodies that recognize the target drug.

Apparently the reporter can’t read. That’s not at all what the study showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the Study Really Said&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122539667/abstract"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; was entitled “Brain structure and obesity.”It was published in &lt;em&gt;Human Brain Mapping.&lt;/em&gt; There were 10 authors listed, with the two interviewed for the news report being the lead author (CA Raji) and the last listed author (PM Thompson). The study evaluated MRI scans of 94 elderly subjects &lt;strong&gt;who were cognitively normal and remained cognitively normal for at least 5 years after their scan&lt;/strong&gt;. It found that obese people had 8 percent less brain tissue than people with normal weight, while overweight people had 4 percent less tissue. The deficits were in areas of the brain that have been associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The story reports that this put the subjects at high risk for Alzheimer’s disease. But &lt;strong&gt;the subjects remained cognitively normal for at least 5 years after the scan.&lt;/strong&gt; They were not rendered stupid. They did not develop Alzheimer’s. They remained cognitively normal. You might also interpret the study as showing that obese patients with those findings on brain scan could be predicted not to develop Alzheimer’s or develop any other cognitive deficits for at least five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show that obesity is linked to stupidity you would have to show that more obese people were less intelligent. To show that it is linked to Alzheimer’s, you would have to show that obese people were more likely to have Alzheimer’s. To show an association between the deficits detected by MRI and stupidity or Alzheimer’s, you would have to show that subjects with those deficits were more stupid or more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. This study did not even attempt to do any of those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the concern is Alzheimer’s, the headline about “stupidity” is inaccurate. Alzheimer’s is a form of dementia, not of “stupidity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Study Raises Questions&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRI scanning is a blunt instrument that can detect some abnormalities of structure but that can’t detect details about how areas of the brain are functioning and whether there are any cognitive deficits. It’s a bit like determining that there are fewer telephones in a community but not knowing what that means in terms of things like the total number of phone calls made, how efficiently calls are routed, the number of busy signals, or the sound quality of the transmissions. Fewer telephones might or might not have any impact on the ability of community residents to communicate by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific findings raise a number of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An “obese” BMI of &amp;gt;30 was associated with atrophy in the frontal lobes, anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and thalamus. An “overweight” BMI of 25-30 was associated with atrophy in the basal ganglia and corona radiata of the white matter. The lists of affected areas are different. What could explain that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they found volume deficits of 4% and 8% in certain brain areas, the overall brain volume did not differ between overweight and obese persons. That seems to indicate that obese patients must have had some areas of hypertrophy to compensate for the areas of atrophy. What areas were they, and what does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The listed areas of atrophy did not correspond to the listed areas of atrophy in previous studies of younger obese patients. What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of other published studies showing areas of brain atrophy in obese subjects, as well as studies showing areas of atrophy in Alzheimer’s patients, but &lt;strong&gt;the list of areas is different in every study&lt;/strong&gt; with only some overlap. A Japanese study showed that BMI was correlated with cerebral volume loss in Japanese men but not in women. It is not yet possible to diagnose Alzheimer’s on MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other factors have been associated with Alzheimer’s disease, including metabolic syndrome, HBP, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and the APOE4 genotype. They attempted to control for some of these potential confounders but not all. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17707846?ordinalpos=49&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A previous study &lt;/a&gt;found that Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 genotype status appears to have a greater deleterious effect on gross hippocampal pathology and memory performance in women compared with men. Interestingly, in this study the APOE4 genotype was not related to any detectable alterations in brain structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all these variable findings, is it possible that some or all of them are due to “noise?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Authors Speculated Beyond the Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reporter quotes two of the authors of the study. They confused the reporter even more by going beyond the data, offering unsupported speculations, and offering clinical advice for preventing Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; ”That’s a big loss of tissue and it depletes your cognitive reserves, putting you at much greater risk of Alzheimer’s and other diseases that attack the brain,” noted Thompson. “But you can greatly reduce your risk for Alzheimer’s, if you can eat healthily and keep your weight under control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Along with increased risk for health problems such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease, obesity is bad for your brain: we have linked it to shrinkage of brain areas that are also targeted by Alzheimer’s,” added co-researcher Cyrus A. Raji. “But that could mean exercising, eating right and keeping weight under control can maintain brain health with aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news article quoted one researcher as saying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brains of obese people looked 16 years older than the brains of those who were lean, and in overweight people looked eight years older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an irresponsible and misleading statement. It is not possible to estimate someone’s age from a brain scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is There Evidence Associating Obesity with Cognitive Impairment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16223549?ordinalpos=4&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;This study&lt;/a&gt; that did cognitive testing on Framingham subjects  found adverse effects of obesity on cognitive performance for men only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17430232?ordinalpos=16&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;In this study &lt;/a&gt; “Midlife measures of central obesity (WHR in the uppermost quartile- Q4) and of hypertension (BP &amp;gt; or = 140 / &amp;gt; or = 90 or use of anti-hypertensive medication) were each significantly related to poorer performance on executive function &amp;amp; visuomotor skills. Neither HTN nor obesity was individually or synergistically related to verbal memory (immediate or delayed recall).” This does not fit the pattern of deficits in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19766958?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;Another study &lt;/a&gt;found that obese adolescents had evidence of attention deficits and executive dysfunction. Again a different pattern, which might be either cause or result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19168781?ordinalpos=19&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;Another study &lt;/a&gt;found that abdominal fat in late life appears to confer an increased risk for dementia/CIND [cognitive impairment not demented], whereas overall obesity appears to be protective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19216219?ordinalpos=16&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; found cognitive deficits in older but not younger obese subjects. It commented that these changes might be attributable to comorbid conditions such as congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, or metabolic lipid abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17761359?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;This study &lt;/a&gt;found that elevated BMI is not associated with cognitive function in healthy children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17145283?ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;Another study &lt;/a&gt;concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A statistically significant link was found between subjects’ performances on all of the cognitive tests and their body mass index—in other words, body mass index was inversely related to performance on all cognitive tests. Yet, after taking age, gender, IQ, years of education, and other possibly confounding factors into consideration, only impaired executive function significantly differentiated overweight or obese subjects from those of normal weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It pointed out that if there is a causal link it could be in either direction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;it is also possible that persons with a defective executive function are more likely to become overweight or obese since many aspects of executive function—for instance, impulse control, self-monitoring, goal-directed behavior—seem to bear directly on the ability to maintain weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18853335?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;This study &lt;/a&gt;found a decreased whole brain volume in obese individuals compared to normal weight and overweight individuals, which is inconsistent with the results of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the inconsistency between studies, it is hard to determine whether this study means anything or whether it amounts to another instance of “the new phrenology” where too much is read into brain scans. The study showed a correlation, and correlation is not causation. No clinical lessons can be drawn from this data. At any rate, we already recommend weight control to reduce the risk of a number of other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reporter did a terrible job of reporting, and the researchers only muddied the waters. The way they reported the meaning of their findings was not exactly a model of scientific objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report is an insult to overweight and obese people and perpetuates the “fat dumb and happy” stereotype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana,Ariel,Helvetica,Sans-Serif;font-size:x-small"&gt;Here’s How it Works…&lt;br&gt;
Pick one or more of the liberals from the list we have posted online at www.LC.org, or choose your own liberal(s) to adopt. If you are led to choose one or more of the liberals we have selected for consideration, please read their brief biographical statement, including the reasons they stand in need of prayer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pray earnestly and intensely for them! Pray that the Lord would move upon them and cause them to be the kind of leaders who will encourage others to lead “a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence.” We encourage you to seek the Lord’s guidance on how to pray for your liberal(s), always allowing Him to temper your prayer with His love and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana,Ariel,Helvetica,Sans-Serif;font-size:x-small"&gt;&lt;a href="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nCKUZeOlzB0m_M:http://steynian.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/shroud-of-turin.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AnCKUZeOlzB0m_M%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fsteynian.files.wordpress.com%2F2009%2F03%2Fshroud-of-turin.jpg&amp;amp;w=112&amp;amp;h=140" alt="" width="112" height="140"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSTRE5943HL20091005"&gt;Shroud of Turin debunked. . .again&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Italian scientist says he has reproduced the Shroud of Turin, a feat that he says proves definitively that the linen some Christians revere as Jesus Christ’s burial cloth is a medieval fake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana,Ariel,Helvetica,Sans-Serif;font-size:x-small"&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://io9.com/5371327/the-grand-unified-theory-of-supermans-powers"&gt;Grand Unified Theory of Superman&lt;/a&gt; – Most superheroes have only one power and you might have thought they all had to be jealous of Superman because he seemed to have so many. I mean, just to duplicate Superman’s powers you’d need: Captain Marvel, The Flash, Cyclops, Colossus, Dare Devil, Ice Man, and Miss Marvel. I think that about covers it. But a scientist has now determined that Superman might only have one superpower:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is our opinion that all of Superman’s recognized powers can be unified if His power is the ability to manipulate, from atomic to kilometer length scales, the inertia of His own and any matter with which He is in contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana,Ariel,Helvetica,Sans-Serif;font-size:x-small"&gt;See &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;True Believers&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana,Ariel,Helvetica,Sans-Serif;font-size:x-small"&gt;, science can have practical applications! Excelsior! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In a recent study by Cantlon and colleagues published in the latest Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, they decided to measure the brain activity of 6-7 year-old children during numerical comparison tasks using fMRI.An example of a numerical comparsion task:...participants were required to compare a single digit Arabic number presented on the center square with the standard, 5. Participants were asked to reach and touch one of three squares on the screen with their index finger while their hand movement trajectories were recorded: the left square for 1–4, the center for 5, and the right for 6–9 (Song &amp;amp; Nakayama, 2007).The authors found that 6- and 7-year-old children recruit the occipito-temporal and parietal cortex in order to solve numerical comparisons across different notation systems, similar to that of adults. However, (here&amp;#39;s the kicker) the fMRI showed that children also activate the inferior frontal cortex to a much greater degree than adults during these numerical comparison tasks.This particular area of the brain involves Brodmann area 44 and 45, used for retrieving semantic information when strong stimulus-stimulus associations are absent. Interestingly enough, the inferior frontal cortex has also been shown to play a role in music cognition (Levitin, 2009). Could kindergarten be the optimal time to learn how to play an instrument?The current study provides further evidence that &amp;quot;a core neural system integrates notation-independent numerical representations throughout development but, early in development, higher-order brain mechanisms mediate this process&amp;quot;.Song JH, &amp;amp; Nakayama K (2008).

  &lt;li&gt;The one who helps the addict get drugs, lends him money to get drugs, who tells him drug addiction is not that bad, tells him you can do drugs and live a normal life, would never tell him to give up, or &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The one who tells the addict to stop doing drugs, says doing drugs is stupid, hides his drugs, hides his drug money, points to studies saying drugs are bad, gets angry at the addict when he’s high.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Clearly the enabler is #1. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, question for the class, which one (# 1 or # 2 above), by analogy, is the accommodationist, and which the new atheist?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I wrote &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2009/09/on_vampires_and_ways_of_knowin.php#comment-1952519"&gt;in a comment on Josh’s blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You (the accomodationists) tell the addict (religious believer) that their religious delusions are OK and totally not inconsistent with science at all.  You (the accomodationists) are the ones who actually do enable the addicts (religious believers) by providing them with their drugs (reasons why religion and science are compatible).  I realize you are acting out of love for the religious people you come into contact with, but in reality, you’re making the problem worse.  That’s up to you, but you really should stop this dishonest labeling of the non-accomodationists with what you are actually doing yourself. It’s called projection.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, Josh is under no obligation to respond to what I wrote, to justify his use of the word.  But, if he’s not going to respond, then he should at least have the intellectual honesty to stop parroting this nonsense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254808144758"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/365eecf4405c4725</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Where Are the Believers?</title><published>2009-10-05T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-05T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/728-where-are-the-believers.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the first two years that Skeptics spoke at Dragon*Con, there was a panel known as the "Skeptics vs. Believers Smackdown," which featured prominent skeptics and non-skeptics in a debate about the paranormal. I noticed that in both years, the believers were quick to apply the label "skeptic" to themselves, while calling the skeptics "cynics" instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then an interesting thing happened. In year three of the debate, it was canceled due to the lack of people willing to sit on the believers' side. There were no lack of skeptics, in fact as many as ten volunteered, but there was only one person who would sit on the believers side. Why is this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, Alison Smith and I sat on a debate panel for the radio show &lt;a href="http://theparanormalview.com/"&gt;The Paranormal View&lt;/a&gt;. This show discusses the paranormal like many shows of its kind, but they also have the occasional show where skeptics are invited to debate believers.

You have to sign up soon or you won't be in the uprising, and you'll find yourself trampled beneath the iron treads of our all-conquering robot army. Register now! The &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/highpriest-of-atheism-is-on-his-way-20091005-gjgg.html"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt; commands it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also notice that, in the list of presenters — Richard Dawkins, Catherine Deveny, Phillip Adams, Taslima Nasrin, Peter Singer, PZ Myers, Dan Barker, Stuart Bechman, Sue-Ann Post, Kylie Sturgess, John Perkins, Tamas Pataki, Max Wallace, Russell Blackford, Ian Robinson, AC Grayling, Robyn Williams, Jamie Kilstein and Simon Taylor — Bill Maher is noticeably absent! And there is much rejoicing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and non-Aussies are also welcome to attend. It's probably recommended, even, since otherwise you'll miss the Rise of Atheism and will have to take a subsidiary role as minions and/or lackeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(By the way, I'm getting a lot of requests to stop by this place and that place in Australia, and everyone is offering me beer if I show up. I have to figure out my schedule, but I do plan to do some jitterbugging about the country, since I can't very well go all that way and miss out on a little tourism! I'll probably have to demur on many of the beer offers, however, since the quantity suggested will be enough to fix my soft tissues, making me only suitable for touring the country as a pickled exhibit in a freak show.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/aussies_start_your_engines.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/YGOSywRjtio" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254807751625"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/i_guess_i_havent_made_it_to_th.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6862f7228a4e4310</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">I guess I haven't made it to the big time yet</title><published>2009-10-06T04:41:05Z</published><updated>2009-10-06T04:41:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/PoQvnuN-g0k/i_guess_i_havent_made_it_to_th.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/i_guess_i_havent_made_it_to_th.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Liberty University has this new program to &lt;a href="http://amygdalagf.blogspot.com/2009/10/are-you-unknown-liberal.html"&gt;adopt a liberal&lt;/a&gt;…and then pray really hard for them. It&amp;#39;s a good idea, since if nothing else, it keeps the rapscallions off the street doing something entirely unproductive. Unfortunately, looking at their list of liberals, most of &amp;#39;em ain&amp;#39;t. Olympia Snowe? Arnold Schwarzenegger? Hilary Clinton? Barack Obama? They&amp;#39;re moderate to conservative. I&amp;#39;ll give them Barney Frank and Barry Lynn, but even there, they aren&amp;#39;t exactly bomb-throwing radicals out to overthrow the government and replace it with communism, free love, and LSD in the water supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Barry Lynn is a &lt;i&gt;minister&lt;/i&gt;. I think that means that hostile prayers are repelled with +5 on his saving throw, so it's a wasted effort already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think they should pray for me. I'm much more deserving, and in their theology, actually need prayer much more. I'm so awful, they're going to have to gang together a team of a thousand devout Christians, arms locked in prayer, 24 hours a day. I sure hope they get on it soon, because I'm feeling a total absence of the Lord right now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/i_guess_i_havent_made_it_to_th.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/PoQvnuN-g0k" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254806042180"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1793">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/39494fa3344f1113</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and the media"/><category term="Obituaries"/><title type="html">Further thoughts on the Language Maven</title><published>2009-10-06T04:48:37Z</published><updated>2009-10-06T04:48:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1793" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this Sunday's "On Language" column in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times Magazine&lt;/i&gt; (already available online &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/11/magazine/11FOB-onlanguage-t.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), I take a look back at the legacy of the column's founder, William Safire. As I write there, "Safire's acute awareness of the limits of his own expertise was often lost on fans and critics alike." Indeed, the "language maven" title that he liked to use was intended to be self-deprecating. (Some might say "self-depreciating," but let's not open that can of worms.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of that self-awareness was a willingness to acknowledge his errors in judgment. In that spirit, I follow up the "On Language" tribute with my latest &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/2009/"&gt;Word Routes column&lt;/a&gt; on the Visual Thesaurus, taking a look at one of Safire's early miscues: declaring, in &lt;a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00E10FE345413718DDDA90B94D1405B898BF1D3"&gt;1979&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;em&gt;could care less&lt;/em&gt; was a "vogue phrase" on its way to extinction. Thirty years later, the verdict is: not so much. Fortunately, Safire didn't often confuse his language mavenry with futurology.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benjamin Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254804496617"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3227d647b5c69be0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The Going Concern</title><published>2009-10-06T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-06T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/college/admin/laxative.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">College rumor claims cafeteria food is laced with laxatives.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254803330523"><id gr:original-id="http://actionforautism.co.uk/?p=333">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/356c799169f85cbf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Four years later on biomedical interventions</title><published>2009-10-05T23:06:01Z</published><updated>2009-10-05T23:06:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionforautism.co.uk/2009/10/05/four-years-later-on-biomedical-interventions/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Next month marks the fourth anniversary of this blog which began life on Blogger on 13th November 2005.

I got a few variants of &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re uncivil, so I think you&amp;#39;re wrong&amp;quot; (tough — peddle bullshit arguments, I&amp;#39;ll call you a bullshitter), the &amp;quot;you just have different presuppositions than I do&amp;quot; argument (which works wonderfully in arguments for the existence of Santa Claus), and the claim that &amp;quot;creationists and scientists look at the same facts and just interpret them differently&amp;quot; (not true, creationists selectively ignore most of the facts). I also got a few specific questions outside my field, like the &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CE/CE310.html"&gt;one about the shrinking sun&lt;/a&gt;. Too bad I didn't have my counter-creationism handbook with me, because this is a stunt they always pull: I talk about genetics and molecular biology, so they pepper me with misconceptions about physics and geology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I did show one amusing video at the end of my talk to illustrate creationist theology. Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime, I have to get some sleep, though. And sometime, I have to drive all the way back to Morris. Oy, this has been a long week. What day is it?&lt;/p&gt;

As it turns out...:&lt;blockquote&gt;The thesis of the article “Forty years of abortion have passed and no solution, Why?” (by J. Bissonnette) is that Christians, and especially Catholics, have not been radical enough. &lt;b&gt;They have not surrendered their lives to martyrdom&lt;/b&gt;. “Abortion will end and it will end sooner and more suddenly than we expect, &lt;b&gt;if we are willing to be bold,&lt;/b&gt;” he states.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Anyone else scared shitless reading that?  Anyone?  Just me, then?  Ok, don't say I didn't warn you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've slapped Alphonse de Valk down &lt;a href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2009/06/alphonse-de-valk-delusional-old-man.html"&gt;in the past&lt;/a&gt;, but that was for being stupid.  This endorsement of actual violence is concerning.  Nowhere in the summary does de Valk condemn the use of "martyrs" or the use of violence to kill people, which, if I'm not mistaken, is against the law in Canada.  Right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr. de Valk (again, I will not refer to clergy as "Father") &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; want to check out the Criminal Code of Canada, &lt;a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_VIII::bo-ga:l_IX//en?page=6&amp;amp;isPrinting=false"&gt;sections 222 and 223&lt;/a&gt;.  Just a thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alphonse says that there is a "net" closing around Christian professionals and how they're compromising their values.  The pertinent quote is:&lt;blockquote&gt;How Christians respond to this closing net as individuals and how the Church reacts as an institution will determine whether the Church degenerates to the vanishing point, or whether it will be revitalized. &lt;/blockquote&gt;I can only hope for the former.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

After school let out for the summer, the numbers declined, but not to the usual low summer rate. Now, as fall begins, flu is picking up again---fast.  Pandemic swine flu is hitting our naive population fiercely.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph clearly illustrates the high baseline during what would normally not be flu season, and the early peak which we are (hopefully) approaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This correlates with my own clinical experience.  It's gonna be a busy season.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007331" title=""&gt;Dynamic Locomotor Capabilities Revealed by Early Dinosaur Trackmakers from Southern Africa&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A new investigation of the sedimentology and ichnology of the Early Jurassic Moyeni tracksite in Lesotho, southern Africa has yielded new insights into the behavior and locomotor dynamics of early dinosaurs. The tracksite is an ancient point bar preserving a heterogeneous substrate of varied consistency and inclination that includes a ripple-marked riverbed, a bar slope, and a stable algal-matted bar top surface. Several basal ornithischian dinosaurs and a single theropod dinosaur crossed its surface within days or perhaps weeks of one another, but responded to substrate heterogeneity differently. Whereas the theropod trackmaker accommodated sloping and slippery surfaces by gripping the substrate with its pedal claws, the basal ornithischian trackmakers adjusted to the terrain by changing between quadrupedal and bipedal stance, wide and narrow gauge limb support (abduction range = 31°), and plantigrade and digitigrade foot posture. The locomotor adjustments coincide with changes in substrate consistency along the trackway and appear to reflect 'real time' responses to a complex terrain. It is proposed that these responses foreshadow important locomotor transformations characterizing the later evolution of the two main dinosaur lineages. Ornithischians, which shifted from bipedal to quadrupedal posture at least three times in their evolutionary history, are shown to have been capable of adopting both postures early in their evolutionary history. The substrate-gripping behavior demonstrated by the early theropod, in turn, is consistent with the hypothesized function of pedal claws in bird ancestors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007355" title=""&gt;High Resolution MEMS Accelerometers to Estimate VO2 and Compare Running Mechanics between Highly Trained Inter-Collegiate and Untrained Runners&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The purposes of this study were to determine the validity and reliability of high resolution accelerometers (HRA) relative to VO2 and speed, and compare putative differences in HRA signal between trained (T) and untrained (UT) runners during treadmill locomotion. Runners performed 2 incremental VO2max trials while wearing HRA. RMS of high frequency signal from three axes (VT, ML, AP) and the Euclidean resultant (RES) were compared to VO2 to determine validity and reliability. Additionally, axial rms relative to speed, and ratio of axial accelerations to RES were compared between T and UT to determine if differences in running mechanics could be identified between the two groups. Regression of RES was strongly related to VO2, but T was different than UT (r = 0.96 vs 0.92; p&amp;lt;.001) for walking and running. During walking, only the ratio of ML and AP to RES were different between groups. For running, nearly all acceleration parameters were lower for T than UT, the exception being ratio of VT to RES, which was higher in T than UT. All of these differences during running were despite higher VO2, O2 cost, and lower RER in T vs UT, which resulted in no significant difference in energy expenditure between groups. These results indicate that HRA can accurately and reliably estimate VO2 during treadmill locomotion, but differences exist between T and UT that should be considered when estimating energy expenditure. Differences in running mechanics between T and UT were identified, yet the importance of these differences remains to be determined.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007298" title=""&gt;Coral Fluorescent Proteins as Antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A wide array of fluorescent proteins (FP) is present in anthozoans, although their biochemical characteristics and function in host tissue remain to be determined. Upregulation of FP's frequently occurs in injured or compromised coral tissue, suggesting a potential role of coral FPs in host stress responses. The presence of FPs was determined and quantified for a subsample of seven healthy Caribbean coral species using spectral emission analysis of tissue extracts. FP concentration was correlated with the in vivo antioxidant potential of the tissue extracts by quantifying the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenging rates. FPs of the seven species varied in both type and abundance and demonstrated a positive correlation between H2O2 scavenging rate and FP concentration. To validate this data, the H2O2 scavenging rates of four pure scleractinian FPs, cyan (CFP), green (GFP), red (RFP) and chromoprotein (CP), and their mutant counterparts (without chromophores), were investigated. In vitro, each FP scavenged H2O2 with the most efficient being CP followed by equivalent activity of CFP and RFP. Scavenging was significantly higher in all mutant counterparts. Both naturally occurring and pure coral FPs have significant H2O2 scavenging activity. The higher scavenging rate of RFP and the CP in vitro is consistent with observed increases of these specific FPs in areas of compromised coral tissue. However, the greater scavenging ability of the mutant counterparts suggests additional roles of scleractinian FPs, potentially pertaining to their color. This study documents H2O2 scavenging of scleractinian FPs, a novel biochemical characteristic, both in vivo across multiple species and in vitro with purified proteins. These data support a role for FPs in coral stress and immune responses and highlights the multi-functionality of these conspicuous proteins.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007319" title=""&gt;Resilience of Coral-Associated Bacterial Communities Exposed to Fish Farm Effluent&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The coral holobiont includes the coral animal, algal symbionts, and associated microbial community. These microbes help maintain the holobiont homeostasis; thus, sustaining robust mutualistic microbial communities is a fundamental part of long-term coral reef survival. Coastal pollution is one major threat to reefs, and intensive fish farming is a rapidly growing source of this pollution. We investigated the susceptibility and resilience of the bacterial communities associated with a common reef-building coral, Porites cylindrica, to coastal pollution by performing a clonally replicated transplantation experiment in Bolinao, Philippines adjacent to intensive fish farming. Ten fragments from each of four colonies (total of 40 fragments) were followed for 22 days across five sites: a well-flushed reference site (the original fragment source); two sites with low exposure to milkfish (Chanos chanos) aquaculture effluent; and two sites with high exposure. Elevated levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chlorophyll a, total heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria abundance, virus like particle (VLP) abundances, and culturable Vibrio abundance characterized the high effluent sites. Based on 16S rRNA clone libraries and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis, we observed rapid, dramatic changes in the coral-associated bacterial communities within five days of high effluent exposure. The community composition on fragments at these high effluent sites shifted towards known human and coral pathogens (i.e. Arcobacter, Fusobacterium, and Desulfovibrio) without the host corals showing signs of disease. The communities shifted back towards their original composition by day 22 without reduction in effluent levels. This study reveals fish farms as a likely source of pathogens with the potential to proliferate on corals and an unexpected short-term resilience of coral-associated bacterial communities to eutrophication pressure. These data highlight a need for improved aquaculture practices that can achieve both sustainable industry goals and long-term coral reef survival.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007343" title=""&gt;Adenotonsillectomy and Neurocognitive Deficits in Children with Sleep Disordered Breathing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) is a common childhood disorder that encompasses a range of sleep-related upper airway obstruction. Children with SDB demonstrate significant neurocognitive deficits. Adenotonsillectomy is the first line of treatment for SDB and whilst this improves respiratory disturbance, it remains to be established whether neurocognitive gains also result. A total of 44 healthy snoring children aged 3-12 years awaiting adenotonsillectomy (SDB group), and 48 age and gender matched non-snoring controls from the general community, completed the study. All children underwent polysomnography and neurocognitive assessment at baseline and after a 6-month follow-up (after surgery in the snoring group). Our primary aim was to determine whether neurocognitive deficits in snoring children were significantly improved following adenotonsillectomy. Wide ranging neurocognitive deficits were found at baseline in SDB children compared to controls, most notably a 10 point IQ difference (P&amp;lt;.001) and similar deficits in language and executive function. Whilst adenotonsillectomy improved respiratory parameters and snoring frequency at 6 months post surgery, neurocognitive performance did not improve relative to controls. Adenotonsillectomy successfully treated the respiratory effects of SDB in children. However, neurocognitive deficits did not improve 6-months post-operatively.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007353" title=""&gt;Phylogenetic Analysis of Seven WRKY Genes across the Palm Subtribe Attaleinae (Areceaceae) Identifies Syagrus as Sister Group of the Coconut&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Cocoseae is one of 13 tribes of Arecaceae subfam. Arecoideae, and contains a number of palms with significant economic importance, including the monotypic and pantropical Cocos nucifera L., the coconut, the origins of which have been one of the "abominable mysteries" of palm systematics for decades. Previous studies with predominantly plastid genes weakly supported American ancestry for the coconut but ambiguous sister relationships. In this paper, we use multiple single copy nuclear loci to address the phylogeny of the Cocoseae subtribe Attaleinae, and resolve the closest extant relative of the coconut. We present the results of combined analysis of DNA sequences of seven WRKY transcription factor loci across 72 samples of Arecaceae tribe Cocoseae subtribe Attaleinae, representing all genera classified within the subtribe, and three outgroup taxa with maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian approaches, producing highly congruent and well-resolved trees that robustly identify the genus Syagrus as sister to Cocos and resolve novel and well-supported relationships among the other genera of the Attaleinae. We also address incongruence among the gene trees with gene tree reconciliation analysis, and assign estimated ages to the nodes of our tree. This study represents the as yet most extensive phylogenetic analyses of Cocoseae subtribe Attaleinae. We present a well-resolved and supported phylogeny of the subtribe that robustly indicates a sister relationship between Cocos and Syagrus. This is not only of biogeographic interest, but will also open fruitful avenues of inquiry regarding evolution of functional genes useful for crop improvement. Establishment of two major clades of American Attaleinae occurred in the Oligocene (ca. 37 MYBP) in Eastern Brazil. The divergence of Cocos from Syagrus is estimated at 35 MYBP. The biogeographic and morphological congruence that we see for clades resolved in the Attaleinae suggests that WRKY loci are informative markers for investigating the phylogenetic relationships of the palm family.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_200.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/v_aqnZaw15w" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254793506248"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/10/strange_new_art_game.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/36c7d757897f356f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Wasting your time"/><title type="html">Strange New Art Game</title><published>2009-10-06T02:31:07Z</published><updated>2009-10-06T02:31:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/JxjtLtaa6S4/strange_new_art_game.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/10/strange_new_art_game.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm a fan of Jason Nelson's &lt;a href="http://www.secrettechnology.com/madethis/enemy6.html"&gt;I made this.

Firstly, how does the brain process ideas of &amp;#39;belief&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;disbelief&amp;#39; - and does it differ when you are talking about religious beliefs or other kinds of beliefs.Secondly, which bits of the brain evaluate religious beliefs, and do they differ from the evaluation of non-religious beliefs.It was the usual neuroimaging deal: take some committed believers, and some committed non-believers, and fire some questions at them while scanning them. Broadly speaking, you put the subjects in two different mental states, and then subtract one from the other.The difference between the two is what shows up in the orange in the picture on the right. Those are the bits of the brain that are more active in one mental state relative to the other.What they found was that different bits of the brain light up when you evaluate a statement that you believe to be true compared with one that you believe to be false. And it really doesn&amp;#39;t matter whether you are a believer or a non-believer, or whether the statement is a religious one or a non-religious one.What matters is whether you, personally, believe it to be true or false. In other words, there does seem to be anything special about religion here. A believer will evaluate a religious claim that &amp;quot;The God of the Bible is literally true&amp;quot; in the same way that non-believer will evaluate the statement &amp;quot;The biblical god is a myth&amp;quot;. And they will both evaluate these in the same way as the statement &amp;quot;Santa Claus does not exist&amp;quot;.But where the study did find a difference was for religious claims in general (whether or not they were believed to be true). That&amp;#39;s what the image at the top of this post shows. It&amp;#39;s the parts of the brains that light up when processing a religious claim, compared with a non-religious claim.So what does this prove? Well, part of the problem with these kinds of studies is that it doesn&amp;#39;t show much. The brain&amp;#39;s a complex, poorly understood organ, and each bit of the brain has been linked to several different functions.With that caveat, Harris reckons that evaluation of religious statements seem to be linked to emotions of disgust and pain:The contrast of religious stimuli minus nonreligious stimuli (see Fig. 2A, Table 3.) revealed greater signal in many regions, including the anterior insula and the ventral striatum. The anterior insula has been regularly linked to pain perception [34] and even to the perception of pain in others [35]. This region is also widely believed to mediate negatively valenced feelings like disgust [36], [37].On the other hand, non-religious statements are linked to regions of the brain connected with memory and semantic evaluation:The opposite contrast, nonreligious minus religious statements, produced greater signal in left hemisphere networks, including the hippocampus, the parahippocampal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, temporal pole, and retrosplenial cortex (see Fig. 2B, Table 4). It is well known that the hippocampus and the parahippocampal gyrus are involved in memory retrieval [42]. The anterior temporal lobe is also engaged by semantic memory tasks [43]If that&amp;#39;s the case, then it would seem to support the idea that non-religious claims are decided by a logical evaluation, whereas religious claims are decided according to whether they disgust you or not.And a last little titbit. There was also a difference in how quickly the subjects evaluated the statements. The quickest response times were for the non-believers when evaluating religious claims they agreed with (i.e. &amp;quot;The biblical god is a myth&amp;quot;). In general, it&amp;#39;s quicker to evaluate a &amp;#39;true&amp;#39; statement than a false one. Could it be that &amp;#39;Religion is false&amp;#39; is more true for nonbelievers that &amp;#39;Religion is true&amp;#39; is for believers?_______________________________________________________________________________________Harris S, Kaplan JT, Curiel A, Bookheimer SY, Iacoboni M, &amp;amp; Cohen MS (2009).

While a &lt;img src="http://img209.imageshack.us/img209/6334/nogod1.jpg" alt="No God Surly-Ramics" width="224" height="224"&gt;majority of critical thinkers do seem to end up along the path of the godless, after this weekend I can now say without a doubt that the equation clearly need not work the other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just returned from the Atheist Alliance International Convention (AAIC) in Burbank California. I had a vendor table and sold my  atheist, skeptical and science inspired Surly-Ramics and luckily got a chance to hear some fantastic speakers. I particularly enjoyed the physics and planetary science talks by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_M._Krauss"&gt;Lawrence Krauss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolyn_Porco"&gt;Carolyn Porco&lt;/a&gt; and I got to go all fangirl over &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenie_Scott"&gt;Eugenie Scott &lt;/a&gt; (I heart them both).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, I spent a large majority of my time passing out Skepchick stickers and explaining what a skeptic &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. It seems the majority of atheists aren’t much familiar with skepticism or the skeptical movement at all. I gotta say I was a bit surprised, but this in a way may explain the choice of Bill Maher as an RDA award recipient at this years event. I briefly discussed this award in &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/10/strange-bedfellows-at-aai/"&gt;an earlier post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had always assumed that atheists arrived at their views by way of a critical thought path. &lt;img src="http://img524.imageshack.us/img524/2842/method1.jpg" alt="Surly-Ramics The Scientific Method" width="224" height="224"&gt;Utilization of logic and reason had concluded that this type of magical thinking was absurd and that science and more specifically, the scientific method could be and &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be used to explain the world around us and used to make decisions to the best of our ability. What I realized at this event is that a large portion of atheists have become so in a reactionary sense. They have realized for a multitude of different, sometimes logical, sometimes emotional reasons that religion is not for them, and that is where they have stopped along the critical thought path. Bill Maher seems to fit that exact mold. He realizes that religion is illogical and irrational and anti-science and he concludes this is a bad habit that the world needs to break free of, but then he simply refuses to apply rational thought to any of his alternative medicine or conspiracy claims. He has (sorta) followed the path of logic and reason to atheism (kinda) but that is where he set up his lawn chair and put on his dark sunglasses and refused to look further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a lot of similar mind sets with the crowd at AAIC. There were a lot of wonderful, kind folks who had come to celebrate the loss of their religion for a multitude of worthy &lt;img src="http://img376.imageshack.us/img376/4870/think1.jpg" alt="Surly-Ramics Think" width="224" height="224"&gt;reasons. They had also come to be part of a lovely social circle of other kind, like-minded people. The majority it seemed, were pleased to have Richard Dawkins present the RDA Award to Bill Maher. They justified this simply because he is one of the few voices raised in defense of the atheist movement, a movement that has many more critics than it does champions and these champions deserve celebration. The skeptics in the room were from a different, rationalist perspective and were disappointed in the award choice as we all know that scientific thought and especially scientific awards should be held to a higher standard. We were a polite minority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past weekend was a learning experience for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. I realized that there are many road blocks on the path to rational thinking and there are many people with a somewhat subdued desire to learn. I am hopeful that we as skeptics can find ways to encourage those who have thought just a little, to be critical a little bit more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Amy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254787686871"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-6940845086579791421">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a03e05ef10a8efcb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biochemistry" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Nobel Prize" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">IDiots and Telomeres</title><published>2009-10-05T19:49:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-06T20:30:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/10/idiots-and-telomeres.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/6940845086579791421/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=6940845086579791421" title="12 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Today&amp;#39;s Nobel Prize announcement has prompted the usual stupidity from the creationist crowd.

This is, I think a truly novel approach to communicating the central ideas of the new field of emergent phenomena and complexity, combining the underlying physical basis of a wide array of examples with art and music.  The site itself presents an animated, non-directed interface to branching sets of topics and what I guess one would call exhibits (since it’s a museum after all).  A lot of these are quite fun, and instructive.  A visitor is left with the feeling that there is lots more to explore.   The interface itself, I have to say, is very cool and a glimpse of what is to come on the internet.  Today’s text- and photo-heavy web pages are bound to give way to sleek sophisticated designs like this one…&lt;/p&gt;

It turns out that this cellular cannibalism is crucial for our well-being in many ways. Scientists are now trying to improve our ability to destroy ourselves as a potential treatment for diseases like cancer and Huntington disease, and perhaps even to slow the process of aging itself. &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/science/06cell.html"&gt;Check it out.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Then later, I happened to stumble on &lt;a href="http://blog.adw.org/2009/10/altering-anthropocentric-attitudes/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; at the Archdiocese of Washington, written by a chap with the amusing name of &lt;a href="http://blog.adw.org/blog-authors/monsignor-charles-pope/"&gt;Monsignor Pope&lt;/a&gt;.  It's funny, because Msgr. Pope's post is pretty much engaging in &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; the kind of power play that Condell is lambasting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you don't want to watch it (even though you should) Condell's rant is about clergy, and one of his major points is that religions promise all of their rewards in the future, while in the present they ask for piety and subservience.  This is obviously a transparent ploy to exercise power over people, while deferring delivery on your promises to a time when nobody will be able to complain.  And boy howdy, I guess the Archdiocese of Washington was listening and decided Condell had a really good idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Msgr. Pope seems to have discovered a new vocabulary word: "Anthropocentric."  Now, when I think of the relationship between religion and anthropocentrism, I always think of the incredible vanity of believing that an entire universe was created with the sole purpose of executing some ham-handed morality play centered around a blood sacrifice.  But I guess that shows how much I know about theology, eh?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What the esteemed Monsignor thinks of when he hears "anthropocentrism", though, is not the childish assumption that the universe was created exclusively for us, but that we spend too much time thinking about our own lives and not on &lt;strike&gt;fellating Jesus&lt;/strike&gt; glorifying God.  Msgr. Pope also seems to view this as a bad thing...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Monsignor's post is rather long, so I have severely condensed his three major talking points:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1. I often hear people say they don’t go to Church because they don’t “get anything out of it.” Perhaps they are looking for improved preaching, better choirs, or more fellowship....How about agreeing that the we go to Mass because God is worthy not simply because we get something out of it. An old Gospel hymn says, “Just forget about yourself and concentrate on Him (God) and worship him!”...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uh huh...  so the next time someone says, "But religion offers people comfort!",  remember what Msgr. Pope has said here:  If you aren't getting comfort and fulfillment from our Mass, well tough fucking luck, because it's not about you.  It's about kissing God's ass.  Or else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2. Weddings are often another time where God seems quite forgotten...We can surely be joyful for the happy couple but how about a few accolades for God who pulled the whole thing off?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yep, yet again, Invisible Sky Daddy gets all the credit.  Have I mentioned before that I find that kind of thing highly offensive and deeply insulting to the people who &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; did all the work?  Oh, &lt;a href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/09/doctors-have-it-rough.html"&gt;yes I have&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;3. Funerals too can become too anthropocentric.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, Monsignor, don't got there.  Please, for the love of all that is good and decent, &lt;i&gt;please&lt;/i&gt; do not go &lt;i&gt;there&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mean, he can't possibly be readying himself to say that the big problem with funerals is that they spend too much time honoring the deceased?  Can he?!?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yup:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Here too many funeral Masses and funeral tributes focus too much on what a great guy Joe was and how he loved the Redskins and loved to tell jokes etc. Some remarks about Joe’s faith and how God worked in his life may be appropriate but the fundamental purpose of the funeral Mass is to worship God and beseech his mercy...We ought to worship God and thank him for his mercy and grace at every funeral and recommit ourselves to Jesus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh. My. Dog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Listen, God-Pushers, if you're going to prey on the weak and insist that they spend all their time doing your bidding in exchange for some mythical reward that never comes, that's despicable enough.  Please, have the basic common decency to let people &lt;i&gt;grieve&lt;/i&gt; in peace, without having to exploit that too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How ghoulish.  I just don't even know what to say.  Of course, I guess Msgr. Pope has already said everything that needs to be said, hasn't he?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, hopefully I’ve made my point.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes you have, Monsignor, yes you have...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-6029121535257291334?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254783728225"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/interesting_long_term_study_of.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0e298ed5edbfcdf5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Interesting Long Term Study of "Killer Bee" Role in South American Ecology</title><published>2009-10-05T22:25:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-05T22:25:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/gGjVcpgG9Y8/interesting_long_term_study_of.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/interesting_long_term_study_of.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;Aggressive African bees were accidentally released in Brazil in 1957.

But during one play date, his mother notices that her son is slightly different from the other children. In the alternately heartwarming and bittersweet tale, a young mother tries to cope with both the overwhelming discovery of her child’s autism and the trials of raising him while keeping her family together. This is a story that resonates not only for those whose families have been affected by autism, but also for all past, present, and future parents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The series is favorably reviewed by &lt;a href="http://autistscorner.blogspot.com/2009/09/autism-manga.html"&gt;Lindsay at Autist's Corner&lt;/a&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254780833147"><id gr:original-id="http://yrif.org/?p=1113">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/836dea8194230513</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="afghanistan"/><category term="barack obama"/><category term="bible"/><category term="bill ayers"/><category term="bill clinton"/><category term="bruce feiler"/><category term="burning bush"/><category term="david axelrod"/><category term="milk and honey"/><category term="moses"/><category term="nile river"/><category term="old testament"/><category term="politics"/><title type="html">Move Over David Axelrod, Here Comes Something More Biblical</title><published>2009-10-05T21:45:05Z</published><updated>2009-10-05T21:45:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org/2009/10/05/move-over-david-axelrod-here-comes-something-more-biblical/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://yrif.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Writing in &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1927303-1,00.html"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;, author Bruce Feiler argues that President Obama should be taking political lessons from Old Testament hero Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He calls attention to the following three teachings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) “Sell the milk and honey”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, no matter how bleak things look, remind everyone that you were promised by a disembodied voice speaking to you from a burning-but-not-being-consumed bush that things will eventually (say, in 40 years) be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I’m pretty sure that Obama is already doing this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) “Remember the Nile”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ll recall, as part of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagues_of_Egypt#Blood_.28Ex._7:14.E2.80.937:25.29_.D7.93.D6.B8.D7.9D"&gt;first plague&lt;/a&gt; Moses told his brother to raise his staff and turn the water in the Nile River into blood.  However, the Pharaoh’s sorcerers were also able to turn the river into blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the river of blood is some sort of reference to Afghanistan.  However, this teaching is probably too oblique to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) “The one on Sinai takes the heat”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, Moses also had to deal with accusations of being a secret Muslim, of lacking a birth certificate, of being a protege of Bill Ayers, of attending a racist church, and of having a [holy-]ghostwritten autobiography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he react by getting angry, breaking his stone tablets, forcing people to drink gold-ash water, demanding that people take swords and kill their brothers and friends and neighbors, and calling down a plague on the survivors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I suppose &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2032:19-35&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;he did&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(But I’m pretty sure that Obama is already doing this, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure why Feiler stopped at three, though.  I can think of lots more relevant Moses-lessons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; if you kill somebody, make sure to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses#Shepherd_in_Midian"&gt;bury the body in the sand&lt;/a&gt; and hope no one squeals
&lt;li&gt; before diving into politics, practice &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses#Egypt:_the_Plagues_and_the_Exodus"&gt;turning your rod into a serpent&lt;/a&gt; (I think this might be a Bill Clinton reference) and inflicting and curing leprosy.  You know, just in case.
&lt;li&gt; promise everyone &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manna#Biblical_description"&gt;a free lunch&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt; if people ever doubt the wisdom of one of your military adventures, make them wander in the desert for 40 years as punishment
&lt;li&gt; if anyone questions your authority, get the earth to &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2016&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;swallow them&lt;/a&gt; and their families and all their possessions
&lt;li&gt; make a bronze snake on a pole, so that people who get bitten by poisonous snakes can &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehushtan#Origin"&gt;look at it and be cured&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt; whatever you do, &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2020:1-13;&amp;amp;version=KJV;"&gt;don’t hit a rock with a stick&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

There are a number of reasons for this, such as:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It never gets more than 28 degrees away from the Sun, meaning we get two hours after sunset -- &lt;i&gt;max&lt;/i&gt; -- to look at it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because the sky is still light, it's very hard to get a good resolution image from the ground.
&lt;li&gt;Because of its proximity to the Sun, operators refuse to point space telescopes (like Hubble) towards Mercury, for fear of frying the telescope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mercury is &lt;b&gt;far away&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;tiny&lt;/b&gt;, making for a disastrous photographic combination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
From Earth, &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; is the best picture we've ever taken of Mercury, courtesy of &lt;a href="http://sirius.bu.edu/planetary/mercury/"&gt;Boston University&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;p&gt;No joke.  That's not impressive at all, is it?  Nevertheless, we sent a spacecraft, &lt;a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1973-085A"&gt;Mariner 10&lt;/a&gt;, to it in 1974/5.  Mariner 10 took some great images, which we then processed, cleaned up, and stitched together into a giant mosaic, giving us a glimpse of our Sun's closest companion:

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/"&gt;Messenger&lt;/a&gt; up and running, it was only a matter of time before we got a new, superior look.  Thanks to &lt;a href="http://gishbar.blogspot.com/2009/10/global-mosaic-from-messengers-2nd-flyby.html"&gt;Jason Perry&lt;/a&gt;, we now have a new image of Mercury, illuminating nearly a full disc of the planet and made from 66 separate high-resolution images.

You can even get &lt;a href="http://www.lcrossapparel.com/"&gt;party clothes&lt;/a&gt; to emulate what all the scientifically-inclined glitterati are wearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be in the UK on October 9, and it’ll be broad daylight, so it looks like I’ll miss seeing this event with my own eyes.

&lt;p&gt;Is it legal?  According to the law experts cited in the piece, yes, with certain precautions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Corporate chaplains are an increasing presence in American workplaces — about 4,000 of them minister to workers nationwide, mostly in Southern states. But the ministers typically work for an outside agency and visit their assigned companies just a few days a month, said Mark Cress, president of Corporate Chaplains of America, an agency based in Wake Forest, outside Raleigh, with 115 chaplains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chaplains provide a benefit for those employees who feel more comfortable discussing personal issues with a minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t do Bible studies or prayer meetings in workplaces,” Cress said. “It’s not our job to turn a business into a church. We don’t want employees to think we’re there to beat them over the head with a Bible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Arizona company was vindicated two decades ago in a federal appeals court ruling that set ground rules for workplace ministry, said UNC Chapel Hill law professor Glenn George. The federal court ruled that the private company could require its workers to attend devotional services as long as it paid the workers for the time spent in worship, and as long as an atheist employee was exempted from having to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that you’re just uncomfortable with a chaplain on-site comes nowhere close to actionable harassment, as long as it’s truly voluntary and there’s no benefit or coercion,” George said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume for the moment everything is legal, and there’s no penalty (stated or not) for refusing the services provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would you handle the situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you actively speak out against it?  Do you just accept that the Chaplain is there and go on with your workday?  Do you raise any concerns with your colleagues or bosses?  Would you be upset/angry there’s no Humanist Chaplain provided to you?&lt;/p&gt;

Millions of people died (by some estimates 4% of the world’s population), and the medical establishment worked feverishly to find a cause and a treatment.   There were many dead-ends in the search for the cause of the flu. One of the most enduring errors was the attribution of the pandemic to a bacterium called &lt;em&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/em&gt; (H flu).  It turned out that the flu was actually caused by a virus rather than a bacterium, but &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=309"&gt;H. flu is still an important discovery&lt;/a&gt;.  The fight against influenza was in many ways successful (although too late for the 1918 pandemic)—it led to the discovery of influenza and many other viruses, and the development of effective influenza vaccines. It is analogous to the discovery of HIV and the advances in science and medicine pioneered by HIV researchers.  Influenza birthed the field of virology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if we had stopped at one of our dead ends?  What if we had held to the belief that H flu caused influenza, or that HTLV-1 caused AIDS?  In science, dead-ends usually reveal themselves—eventually.  As new discoveries fail to appear, scientists re-examine their underlying assumptions.  H flu was found in many flu victims, but not all.   Other researchers found that fluids that were run through filters that stopped bacteria were still infectious (in human volunteers!), leading them to conclude that there must be an infectious particle smaller than a bacterium. A quarter of a century after the Great Influenza pandemic, effective vaccines against influenza were in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the world was torn by the first “modern” war, and influenza destroyed military and civilian populations, doctors were trying everything that might help.  In the U.S., sera and vaccines against various agents such as pneumococcus were produced and used with some efficacy, but many other immunologic treatments were dead-ends.  One of these dead-ends was named &lt;em&gt;Oscillococcinum&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A French doctor, Joseph Roy, was one of the witnesses to the 1918 pandemic who worked to find a cause.  Unfortunately, his thinking was rooted in a mix of modern ideas and ancient—the knowledge that there were bacteria that caused disease, and the ancient &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/death_of_vitalism.php"&gt;vitalist&lt;/a&gt; ideas of the previous centuries.  He believed that he observed in flu victims, and the victims of many other diseases, an unusual bacterium which was round (”coccus”) and appeared to vibrate (”oscillate”).  Anyone who has spent significant time on a light microscope knows that there’s plenty of oscillation—it’s called “Brownian motion” and is not a characteristic of any particular object under the lens but of the medium itself.  Roy, using the modern terms and equipment but not modern knowledge, felt that this “new bacterium”, which he observed in microscopic samples from nearly every infectious and non-infectious disease, was the cause of everything.  While modern scientists were searching for the agent of influenza and other diseases and trying to fulfill Koch’s postulates (not a requirement, but handy) Roy was bringing to life one of the most enduring errors in modern medicine. Unlike the discovery of H. flu, the “discovery” of Oscillococcinum (which I’m hesitant to dignify with italics) led not to the control of important diseases but to the world’s most popular quack remedy for influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roy and others ran with this “discovery”.  It’s not clear exactly who decided to use Oscillococcinum to fabricate a homeopathic potion, but according to at least one source, Roy approached the French Homeopathic Laboratories in&lt;br&gt;
1925 with a plan to produce his panacea from duck livers (and, of course, lots of water).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three quarters of a century later, Oscillococcinum is still one of the world’s most popular flu remedies.   This, despite the fact that it is based on an erroneous discovery of a non-existent bacterium which is “derived” from duck livers and diluted down infinitesimally.  This is the &lt;em&gt;ne plus ultra&lt;/em&gt; of quackery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m in a board meeting. Having a miscarriage. Thank goodness, because there’s a fucked-up 3-week hoop-jump to have an abortion in Wisconsin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penelope has taken a lot of heat for this tweet. She was flippant and callously discussing miscarriage and abortion. People were angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most of you know, I suffered a miscarriage around Memorial Day. The reason most of you know this is because I announced here on Skepchick that I was pregnant just 3 weeks earlier (after our ultrasound showed a healthy fetus with a beating heart). That was my second miscarriage, and it was awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, Trunk’s statement really upset me, probably because I’ve lost two pregnancies that I very much wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But her explanation, and her defenders, points out something very important: most women suffer miscarriages – whether they want the pregnancy or not. And we should probably be talking about it more – it’s just part of being a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed that when I’ve discussed my miscarriages casually in conversation, people tend to get uncomfortable… they don’t know what to say. It’s one of those things you only discuss in third person, and only in a hushed tone. (”Oh, you didn’t hear? Elyse had a miscarriage.”) But to me, it’s a part of what’s been going on with me lately. I still think about it, and sometimes I mention it when it’s relevant to the conversation… kind of the same way I discuss my sister who passed away in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think of Trunk’s statement? What do you think of her explanation? Should we be talking about miscarriages more? Is the 12-week-wait rule of announcing your pregnancy prudent or a part of the “we don’t talk about miscarriages” problem? Is it even a problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I heard she was going to be in town, I thought it would be fun if I could somehow swing an interview with her to post here on &lt;em&gt;Skepchick&lt;/em&gt;. I was sure a print interview would be the best I could do, and in the back of my mind, I knew there was a good chance she wouldn’t even have time for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we don’t get these chances often, so I decided to go for broke, and I asked her if she wouldn’t mind sitting down with me for a &lt;em&gt;video&lt;/em&gt; conversation. I figured if she agreed, we could talk about her work, the NCSE, and basically what it’s like to be Dr. Eugenie Scott.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to my amazement and great delight, she said she would love to do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was psyched, but at the same time I was nervous, because now I had to find a way to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, my friend and fellow &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/HoustonSkeptics/"&gt;Greater Houston Skeptic Society&lt;/a&gt; member, Chris Moyer, has his own audio/video production business, and without hesitating a second, he agreed to produce the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things were coming together nicely, but now the question was, where to shoot the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, since Dr. Scott was lecturing at the Houston Museum of Natural Science, and since it is the epitome of cool places in Houston for science enthusiasts and skeptics, it just made sense to ask them first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again to my amazement and great delight, the museum staff said they would love to have us use their facility! In fact, they said they could set us up in one of their classrooms, which I found appropriate, considering a good portion of Dr. Scott’s work is geared toward keeping good science in public schools. And they agreed to provide us anything we needed within reason. Hey, sometimes being polite and asking in a friendly manner works wonders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, we were set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the day finally came, and when Dr. Scott and I got to chatting, we covered topics that ranged from the Texas State Board of Education to the evolution of creationism to women in science and skepticism. And before we knew it, time had gotten away from us. So what follows is the first two segments in a series of nine videos chronicling our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/RZkksYdgtr8%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/8lVtumBUi_Q%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now by way of brief commentary, I will just say what you all no doubt know. Eugenie Scott is an amazing person. I am proud to have spent even a short amount of time with her. In &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2008/09/tyson-talks-of-space-exploration/"&gt;a post last year&lt;/a&gt;, I said of Neil deGrasse Tyson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“. . . he is the type of person, the kind of mind, this world needs. He sees things clearly, but he does not arrive at conclusions and opinions without deep consideration. He is passionate, personable, and bright. I thoroughly enjoyed his company, brief as it was.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I can say no less of Dr. Scott. I am not easily impressed, but I found her very impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Chris Moyer deserves to be sainted or knighted or both for producing this interview with very little compensation. His company is called &lt;strong&gt;Dropframe Video&lt;/strong&gt;. You can contact him at &lt;a href="mailto:cmalachi@hotmail.com"&gt;Malachi Constant&lt;/a&gt; (even if you’re not a Vonnegut fan), and if you ever need audio or video work done, show him some love and hire him. You will definitely be pleased with the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skepchick&lt;/em&gt; reader, Naomi (Geek Goddess), also donated her time freely to help out. Big thanks to her as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, hat’s off to Steven Cowan, Erin Flis, and Melodie Wade of the Houston Museum of Natural Science for accommodating us, and allowing us to disrupt their normal day for a little while. Next time you’re in the Houston area, take the whole family down to the museum for a day, and help them celebrate their 100th birthday. You won’t regret it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for Parts 3 and 4 of my conversation with Dr. Scott to be posted tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254769739280"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/resources_for_establishing_a_m.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/567a79d00476a5a5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Careers"/><title type="html">Resources for Establishing a Meaningful Mentoring Relationship</title><published>2009-10-05T14:47:34Z</published><updated>2009-10-05T14:47:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/e2qweANKS2Y/resources_for_establishing_a_m.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/resources_for_establishing_a_m.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think that many of us go into mentoring relationships assuming the conversations will be easy and natural, that both will have a mutual understanding and trust and that the mentor and mentee relationship will occur seamlessly and each party will provide open feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes this happens, but frequently these relationships can be strained.  I am of the belief that the usual source of discomfort is a lack of understanding of both parties' goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt; 

&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/10/resources_for_establishing_a_m/new%20awkward.jpg" alt="new awkward.jpg" height="253" width="250"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: How many discussions begin, "What do you want to talk about?" "No, what do you want to talk about?"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clear establishment of goals by at least one party can aid communication between mentors and mentees.  I would argue that, while it is certainly helpful for a mentor to lay out goals for a mentee, it is more important that the mentee engage in regular self-reflection and also establish goals. Of tremendous value to me has been the establishment of a three year plan, outlining specific immediate and long term goals,  that I can revisit and revise every 6 months or so.  I continue to maintain this plan and share it with with those more senior in my field who can offer me guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.faseb.org/"&gt;Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology&lt;/a&gt; has a new(ish) resource that trainees can utilize to start the conversation -- their Individual Development Plan for Postdoctoral Fellows (available &lt;a href="http://opa.faseb.org/pdf/idp.pdf"&gt;here as a pdf&lt;/a&gt;).  While the title advertises it for postdoctoral fellows, I think it is an incredibly valuable resource for someone at any level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan outlines four steps for the person seeking mentoring:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conduct a Self-Assessment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Survey Opportunities with a Mentor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Write and Individual Development Plan, Share with Mentor, and Revise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Implement the Plan and Revise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the hardest parts of this have been the first two steps - conducting the self-assessment and survey opportunities with a mentor.  It has been very challenging for me to figure out at time what I really want - a career in research?  Industry?  Do I want to say fuck it all and stay home with my offspring?  A really good self-assessment may not be easy and, frequently, can be painful.  Then, who is the person I have chosen as a mentor and are they really able to provide me with the resources I need to succeed? What are the next career paths I might be able and qualified to follow? What path would fulfill me? These questions can be equally as painful to ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, at the end of the day you&amp;#39;ll have concrete goals that you can share with a mentor and concrete benchmarks that you can evaluate yourself.  Not to say that at particular parts in my life I haven&amp;#39;t been more anxious than I care to admit (although I was still incredibly hot, even anxious), I have at least had the stability of a plan that, like a gorgeous pair of Naughty Monkeys, I could comfort and reassure myself with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Knuckle cracking does not lead to arthritis. So why would I bother to blog about this today? For one simple reason. After a 50 year, single participant study, results have demonstrated that habitual knuckle cracking does not lead to arthritis. This research has advanced the field so much that it was given a 2009 Ig Nobel award. The original research (see citation below) was published in 1998. A link directly to the Letter to the Editor of the journal Arthritis and Rheumatism can be found here (PDF, 2 pages).Donald Unger, an allergist in Thousand Oaks, California, earned the medicine prize for addressing another timeless question: does cracking knuckles really cause arthritis, as his mother warned him it would? As a child, he naturally thought his mother omniscient, but as a teenager he learned about science and started questioning received wisdom of this kind.To resolve the issue Unger embarked on a long-term controlled experiment, and began cracking the knuckles on his left hand twice a day, but not those on his right (Arthritis and Rheumatism, vol 41, p 949). He has done so for more than 60 years, and never suffered arthritis in either hand. "Mother, you were wrong," he says, looking heavenwards. What he now wants to know is: "Was it really necessary for me to eat my broccoli?"In the reported "study" the following was observed:For 50 years, the author cracked the knuckles of his left hand at least twice a day, leaving those on the right as a control. Thus, the knuckles on the left were cracked at least 36,500 times, while those on the right cracked rarely and spontaneously. At the end of the 50 years, the hands were compared for the presence of arthritis.There was no arthritis in either hand, and no apparent differences between the two hands.Therefore, rest assured knuckle crackers (of whom I am one), your habit is not detrimental.ReferenceUnger DL (1998).

&lt;p&gt;The audio quality is a little rocky due to it being a big echoey room, but you can hear most of what I’m saying. That was a fun talk, and one I expect I’ll be giving again as time goes on. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/03/skeptical-passion/"&gt;I’m really gung-ho about talking to people about skepticism and critical thinking&lt;/a&gt;, and I think it’s something that needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254767788947"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/hab_rachmones_anti-vax_inanity.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bddd77ec129da631</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Absurd medical claims"/><title type="html">Hab rachmones!

The usual email list is the one that goes out to moms of young kids living in our ethnic/geographic community.  Usually I shrug it off, but every once in a while, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/03/how_listening_to_you_wife_can.php"&gt;my wife and I get fed up and try to spread the truth.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest was sent by a friend and colleague who took one look at it and thought, "I bet this'll piss off Pal."  She was right.  The email contained a link to a notorious anti-vaccination site, and to &lt;a href="http://vactruth.com/2009/10/02/fda-approved-h1n1-vaccines-contain-ingredients-known-to-cause-cancer-and-death/" rel="nofollow"&gt;one post in particular&lt;/a&gt; that repeats every inane vaccine myth as if it were fact.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not that there don't exist legitimate questions about some vaccines---it's that this author, well-known to me from many internet discussions, spews out the most ridiculous assertions as if they were facts.  I beg of you---really, I'm begging---if you're on this email list, read a little further here, and spread the word, before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/hab_rachmones_anti-vax_inanity.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/hab_rachmones_anti-vax_inanity.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/aPg_KniWmz4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254767788946"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/donorschoose--you_did_it_again.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/442c2c829f8d04e4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Donors Choose"/><title type="html">DonorsChoose--you did it again!</title><published>2009-10-05T17:07:19Z</published><updated>2009-10-05T17:07:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/9D0tz2Jcl8c/donorschoose--you_did_it_again.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/donorschoose--you_did_it_again.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You guys are fantastic. &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=305339&amp;amp;challengeid=24230"&gt;You've fully funded another project&lt;/a&gt;.  This one gets kids in a tough neighborhood focused on the outdoors in a positive way, exploring their environment.  What a great project.  I feel proud to have you as readers, and I'm even more proud I married a teacher.  Teachers are working their butts off to get the basic needs of their students funded, and even little donations from others help them get there.  These students are lucky to have teachers who care enough to go the extra million miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Addendum&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow! You guys just finished funding another project, &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=305581&amp;amp;challengeid=24230"&gt;this one for visually impaired kids&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;br&gt;It will rise in perfect light,
&lt;br&gt;I have loved the stars too fondly
&lt;br&gt;To be fearful of the night. --&lt;i&gt;Sarah Williams&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Everyone knows how you see things during the day: &lt;i&gt;sunlight&lt;/i&gt; makes it possible.  Delivering huge amounts of visible light to the entire "day" side of the planet, everything becomes illuminated to human eyes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_where_does_light_come_from/dyrholaey-landscape.jpg" width="500" height="375" title="Nice landscape; no complaining here!" alt="dyrholaey-landscape.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But things change rapidly once the Sun goes down.  Even with a full Moon in the sky (like last night), the amount of light reaching the Earth at night is over &lt;b&gt;100 trillion&lt;/b&gt; times less than during the day.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, we have a great pair of eyes, and instead of narrow pupils with our cones (which see color) forward in our eyes, our pupils dilate, letting more light in, our cones retract, and our rods (which see monochrome in low light) &lt;a href="http://kids-educational-activities.suite101.com/article.cfm/night_vision_activities"&gt;become more prominent&lt;/a&gt;.  As a result, we &lt;i&gt;can see&lt;/i&gt; at night, just not as well as during the day.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_where_does_light_come_from/nightscape.jpeg" width="500" title="Nice shot of the Moon!" alt="nightscape.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: &lt;a href="http://renovatus.com/rybee/2009/04/15/my-movie/"&gt;renovatus.com&lt;/a&gt;.)  But what about when the Moon isn't out?  Somehow, even in the absence of the Moon &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; Sun, when the amount of light reaching us from the sky is over &lt;i&gt;a billion times dimmer&lt;/i&gt; than when the full Moon is out, humans can still see (at least a little bit), and many animals can actually see very well!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_where_does_light_come_from/1806-Nightscape_Near_Mojave.jpg" width="500" title="With no lights, is this even possible?" alt="1806-Nightscape_Near_Mojave.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: &lt;a href="http://klaudiamarrgallery.com/Contemporary_Realism/David_Hines/Archives/index.html"&gt;David Hines&lt;/a&gt;.)  So how is this possible?  How can we see anything at all, given that the amount of light out there is so mind-bogglingly small?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a two part answer.  The first part you'll guess, and the second one you won't.  First, &lt;a href="http://www.visualexpert.com/Resources/nightvision.html"&gt;your eyes simply adapt&lt;/a&gt;.  Something like grass in starlight, even though you would be completely blind to that signal in weak daylight, becomes prominent to your eyes at night.  Over a trillion times dimmer than the brightest things you can see, it still appears clearly to the dark-adapted human eye.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_where_does_light_come_from/vismode.gif" width="462" height="517" title="Image from visualexpert.com!" alt="vismode.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is great for humans, who see right in the middle of the visible spectrum at night.  Guess what?  Not all animals do.  In fact, many night-adapted animals can see infrared light.  The greatest amount of infrared light reaching the ground on the night side of the Earth -- at least far away from cities -- comes from &lt;b&gt;the Sun&lt;/b&gt;, not from the stars!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_where_does_light_come_from/EarthLimb_Nightside_composite.jpg" width="500" title="Dark Earth at night, umm... sailor&amp;#39;s delight?" alt="EarthLimb_Nightside_composite.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could this really be true?  Could the Sun really be affecting us at the darkest part of the night, impeding our ability to see the stars but allowing us to see the land around us?  Here's how: imagine floating in space on the far side of the Earth, away from the Sun.  What would you see as the Earth appeared to move between you and the Sun?  (Pay close attention to the &lt;i&gt;atmosphere&lt;/i&gt;, courtesy of &lt;a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/13feb_lunareclipse.htm"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_where_does_light_come_from/koehn1.gif" width="500" title="The atmosphere turns red!" alt="koehn1.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, our atmosphere reflects, refracts, and scatters light.  The blue light scatters more easily, which means that the reddest light (and infrared light) makes it the farthest.  In addition, the Earth absorbs visible light during the day, but re-radiates it as infrared light.  This means that any animal that can see these longer wavelengths of light is better adapted to being a nocturnal or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular"&gt;crepuscular&lt;/a&gt; creature.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, those "night vision" goggles you can get are extra-sensitive to this infrared light, and can produce images like this, thanks in part to thermal heat signals and red light left over from the Sun!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_where_does_light_come_from/AN_PVS-7_NVG_GEN_3_with_Infrared_Laser_illuminator_aimer.gif" width="500" title="A good pair of night-vision goggles can see single photons, whereas our eyes need tens of photons to really see anything." alt="AN_PVS-7_NVG_GEN_3_with_Infrared_Laser_illuminator_aimer.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's not only why we can see as well as we can in incredibly low-light conditions, it's why many animals can do it &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; than we can!  Blame the stars, the Earth, and the Sun for the light that us and the other animals see at night, but the one that deserves the most blame depends on what &lt;b&gt;your eyes&lt;/b&gt; can see!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/q_a_where_does_light_come_from.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254765838229"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/if_humans_walked_on_the_moon_t.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4cfcaf30744a550f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">If humans walked on the moon today, how would it be covered?</title><published>2009-10-05T18:35:31Z</published><updated>2009-10-05T18:35:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/-3PGQF8AyMI/if_humans_walked_on_the_moon_t.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/if_humans_walked_on_the_moon_t.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/dClpox7qinI%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/if_humans_walked_on_the_moon_t.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/-3PGQF8AyMI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254765838229"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/darwins_darkest_hour_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bc003e7468b7d3ca</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Charles Darwin"/><title type="html">Darwin's Darkest Hour</title><published>2009-10-05T18:26:31Z</published><updated>2009-10-05T18:26:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/U82M3gu915g/darwins_darkest_hour_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/darwins_darkest_hour_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Don't miss it!

&lt;p&gt;While paging through government science talks some time ago, I came across an amusing use of photo editing by science officials. The picture on the left appears in an April 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 2006 &lt;a href="http://www.sc.doe.gov/bes/presentations/recent.html"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science Deputy Director, Patricia Dehmer. The picture on the right was used to illustrate a December 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 2005 article on &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7069/full/438730a.html"&gt;Nature.com&lt;/a&gt;. Both show the $1.4 billion &lt;a href="http://neutrons.ornl.gov/aboutsns/aboutsns.shtml"&gt;Spallation Neutron Source &lt;/a&gt; (SNS) experiment at Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL) in Tennessee. (Before going any further, I ought to disclose that I’m currently suing the DOE under the Freedom of Information Act for an investigation report into inappropriate data manipulation by ORNL scientists – &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/health_science/articles/2006/11/27/oak_ridge_researchers_admit_errors/"&gt;a story I covered for &lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe &lt;/em&gt;in 2006&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-3118" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/10/05/cut-that-crane/800px-spallation_neutron_source_arial02-4/"&gt;&lt;img title="800px-Spallation_Neutron_Source_arial02" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2009/10/800px-Spallation_Neutron_Source_arial023-300x199.jpg" alt="800px-Spallation_Neutron_Source_arial02" width="247" height="196"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-3119" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/10/05/cut-that-crane/naturepicture-4/"&gt;&lt;img title="NaturePicture" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2009/10/NaturePicture3.jpg" alt="NaturePicture" width="200" height="198"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud formations in the sky look very similar, as if the two pictures were taken within minutes of each other from a slightly different angle by a circling helicopter. So how is it that the orange construction crane has vanished from the government’s version?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOE’s press office had the answer: “Dr. Dehmer used a retouched photo provided by ORNL that showed a clearer view of the actual SNS buildings … a topic of the presentation.” DOE added that it was proud construction of the site had finished ahead of schedule, and under budget. Of course, faking the absence of a construction crane does make that message clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped the story at the time, but decided to blog about it after I noticed that the retouched photo was uploaded to illustrate the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spallation_Neutron_Source"&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; about the SNS experiment. Dehmer also continues to host the presentation on the government site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I the only one who feels slightly unsettled by the thought of government officials advertising science projects with photoshopped pictures? Or is it all in a day’s work in Washington D.C.?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254762163546"><id gr:original-id="http://neuronarrative.wordpress.com/2009/10/05/once-you-start-trusting-a-source-beware-the-trust-trap/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7579cb2c0bc34397</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Once You Start Trusting a Source, Beware the Trust Trap</title><published>2009-10-05T12:30:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-05T12:30:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/-1ES09kuubY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://neuronarrative.wordpress.com/2009/10/05/once-you-start-trusting-a-source-beware-the-trust-trap/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">If you follow a news commentator closely, reading everything he or she writes in whatever venue it appears, you may unknowingly be in a trust trap.  Studies have shown that once we invest trust in a particular source of knowledge, we’re less likely to scrutinize information from that source in the future. 

Now a new study in the journal Applied Psychological Science has taken this investigation a step further, showing that the trust trap can also result in the creation of false memories — and not only in the short term.

Facebook tells all your friends, and they send along cheerful greetings.  And then you feel all happy until you find that Neil deGrasse Tyson has the same birthday as you, and many more Facebook friends.  But he’s older, so there.  I like to think my best years are still ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what you’re thinking:  “Gee, Sean, here it is your birthday, and me with no way to send you a present.”  But that’s not true!  Because I would consider it a wonderful present if you could send $10 to, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=303661&amp;amp;challengeid=23711"&gt;Ms. V’s classroom in Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, where junior-high students in a high-poverty area need some calculators to help in their science classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=317016&amp;amp;challengeid=23711"&gt;Ms. H’s classroom in Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, whose kindergarten students need some white boards to fit group lessons into their crowded room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=300994&amp;amp;challengeid=23711"&gt;Ms. W’s classroom in New York City&lt;/a&gt;, where young children with autism need basic learning aids to help them tackle math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or any one of &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?page=1&amp;amp;id=23711&amp;amp;category=127&amp;amp;max=50"&gt;various other worthy classrooms&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked &lt;a href="http://arikia.com" title=""&gt;Arikia Millikan&lt;/a&gt;, the former Overlord here at Scienceblogs.com, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="twitter_arikia1.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/twitter_arikia1.jpg" width="300" height="300" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;First and foremost, I consider myself a scientist, though perhaps not in the traditional sense. I studied the "hard sciences" throughout my education and scientific principles govern my outlook on the world. But my lab bench is my laptop and I mostly conduct observational studies on the way people use the Web to communicate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do experiments, too. I spent about eight months "Cat Herding" at ScienceBlogs, and that was a pretty major experiment. The variables were ideas as well as "physical" changes to the appearance and functionality of the network. Tweak this, upgrade that, measure the changes with analytics and user responses, update methods accordingly. Way better than the lab-coat variety, IMO, because while conducting my experiments, I got to play with awesome scientists online. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also a communicator. I began my undergraduate studies in the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan. The first week of classes, we were instructed to forget everything we ever learned about writing, because we were only going to perform "technical writing" from there on out. I didn't like that. I remember thinking, "Science is hard enough for most people to understand, why would anyone purposely create a whole new language to further obfuscate the concepts, making it more abstract to the people who will eventually use products created by science?" So I got what I could from the program, which mostly was an ass-kicking in calc-based physics (but also a solid foundation in the fundamentals of computer programming), and my junior year I changed my major to psychology and joined the student newspaper. There I started the science beat and reported on scientific accomplishments and their societal implications. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be someone who, in the future when people look back at the evolution of the Internet, they'll say, "Arikia Millikan played an important part in how awesome this is today." I'd also like - and this is my total pipe dream goal -- to write a tech column for Wired. It's the one publication I subscribe to in print and I read it cover-to-cover every month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, I want to be someone who never stops learning about and benefiting from technology. I am not going to be the old curmudgeon musing about what new technologies the young whippersnappers are in a frenzy about at any given moment. I think that, in the process of learning, some people acquire mental blocks where they think they can't learn new things, and this can be a very damaging state of mind. I'm 22 right now and I think I'm pretty quick to use and adapt to new gadgets, computer programs, and Web features as they emerge. But I want to be just as adept when I'm 72, Moore's Law be damned. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm funemployed! I have an assortment of freelance jobs and gigs that keep me mentally occupied and sustain my existence in New York City. The project I'm the most excited about right now is that I'm working with Nate Silver, founder of &lt;a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com" title=""&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/a&gt;, as his research assistant. He's in the process of writing a book about statistical predictions and there's a large focus on science. So basically, I get to travel around the country accompanying him on interviews with the most awesome scientists I can find. Besides that, I build websites, I have a handful of top-secret projects I work on sporadically with some really talented people in Brooklyn, and I write things occasionally. Working with Nate, I've realized that I'd like to write a lot more. I've always been someone who has a lot to say, but sometimes it's hard to say it when you're constantly in the presence of scientific greatness. It's like, who am I to write on a topic when there are tons of people already doing it way better than I ever could? I guess it's kind of a lame excuse. I'll try to try more and see what happens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="internets.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/internets.jpg" width="388" height="323" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Oh, and I pick up shifts here and there at &lt;a href="http://internet-garage.com/" title=""&gt;The Internet Garage&lt;/a&gt;, a grungy public computer lab in Williamsburg, the hipster sector of Brooklyn. I provide Internet and technical support for customers and help them use the equipment here, all of which is either crappy or broken. It's a pretty hilarious place. Most people think it's a drug front. I assure you that it's not, though the owners don't seem to be remotely concerned with turning a profit. I kind of want to write a screenplay about the IG someday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it's the field of communication via the use of the Web &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; a science that interests me the most. The fact that the topic of conversation in the networks I study is science is just a bonus, really. On a recent trip to MIT with Nate, we met Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. He talked to us about the emergent field of Web Science and drew us a circular flow chart that I'm going to frame and mount on my wall. Web Science is different than Computer Science in that it takes human behavior online into account and examines the way our behavior shapes the development of the Web itself. That's the stuff that really gets me going. I want to know everything there is to know about this field. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging and social networking tools are the subject of my work. They enable the individual to simultaneously be consumers of content and providers, and that's a really powerful concept. I don't blog too much myself, though I do use all of the above social networking tools on a daily basis. My primary use of them is personal, but it blurs with the professional. I don't think the two necessarily have to be separate, and I think with the way voluntary information sharing is heading, it will soon be impossible to keep them separate. I think a lot of people are adamant about using sites like Twitter to enhance their professional careers and propagate their viewpoints, and that's awesome. But I'm 22 and living in the craziest city in the world. Sometimes a girl just needs to Tweet about a guy she just saw with full-face tattoos or a gambling adventure in a speakeasy bar. The question Twitter begs to know is "What are you doing?" after all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="cat herder.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/cat%20herder.jpg" width="258" height="398" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;To be honest, I discovered them when the magazine intern position I applied for with Seed Media Group was filled, but they had an opening with this thing called "ScienceBlogs". The first time I looked at the ScienceBlogs homepage, I had no idea what it was all about, and this turned out to be a large source of motivation in my work there. I figured that if I couldn't tell what the deal with the site was or intuitively access the best and most relevant content, most other people couldn't either. So I accepted the internship and set out to try to make ScienceBlogs better. In that process, I discovered that there was a more effective way for me to further scientific communication than by directly doing the communicating. And now I hope to make that my career. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending ScienceOnline 2009 showed me that, though the Internet is a big, mysterious place where there are tons of opportunities for deception, people are generally who you would expect them to be. To "know" someone online, and then meet them in real life, you get insight into layers of one's personality that, in the past, you may not have had access to. It makes just as much sense sometimes that a person has the exact opposite temperament online that they do IRL, than if their online and offline personalities are one and the same. Attending ScienceOnline last year reinforced the human component of what I do. Because, though it is about traffic and numbers and economics, the best part is knowing that you're helping someone achieve his or her goals of science communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thank you so much. See you again in January at ScienceOnline2010!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ll be back writing later next week - feel free to give feedback as always.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;*****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, a &lt;a title="troll troll troll troll" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/01/the_petites_sauvages_of_pharyn.php#comment-710755"&gt;troll commentator&lt;/a&gt; banned from the blog of &lt;a title="PZ Myers" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt; decided to criticize a little verse posted by &lt;a title="dc" href="http://www.digitalcuttlefish.blogspot.com"&gt;Digital Cuttlefish. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DC is, as you may have read before, a Scienceblog Molly award winner and extraordinary poet, who is prominently featured in the &lt;span&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1869828"&gt;‘The Open Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;: The Best Science Writing on Blogs 2007′. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The disdainful commentator tried expressing his horror at DC’s verse being appreciated on a science blog, by quoting &lt;a title="dirac" href="http://www.quoteworld.org/category/poetry/author/paul-dirac"&gt;Paul Dirac&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In science one tries to tell people, in such a way as to be understood by everyone, something that no one ever knew before. But in poetry, it’s the exact opposite. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this is a complete and utter load of &lt;a title="aka crap" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crap"&gt;iambic rot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a great many poetically-inclined scientists; some might immediately spring to mind and some of whom you may not be familiar with. In fact, just a short investigation that I did over the past few days brought to me a whole expanding universe of science/poetry interaction!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More familiar to many would be the works of Edward Lear and Charles ‘Lewis Carroll’ Dodgson; writers who combined their interest and / or expertise in science into their work. &lt;a title="goethe" href="http://www.thenewatlantis.com/archive/4/cantor.htm"&gt;Goethe was also a scientist&lt;/a&gt; - known for works like &lt;em&gt;Faust&lt;/em&gt;, his life also featured a keen interest in botany, investigations that prompted the beginnings of comparative anatomy and coined the term &lt;em&gt;‘morphology’.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my classroom, I used to feature a sequence of posters that ‘married’ science and poetry together, which were a part of a general collection of poems - &lt;a title="Hoffmann" href="http://almaz.com/nobel/chemistry/1981b.html"&gt;Roald Hoffman,&lt;/a&gt; the Nobel Prize winner in 1981 in Chemistry, composed ‘&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="pdf of poem" href="http://www.roaldhoffmann.com/pn/modules/Downloads/docs/Modes_of_Representation.pdf"&gt;Modes of Representation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;‘. May Kendall with ‘&lt;a title="dream" href="http://www.bartleby.com/246/1080.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Pure Hypothesis - A Lover, In Four Dimensional Space, Describes a Dream&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘. Students quite liked George Bradley’s &lt;strong&gt;‘&lt;em&gt;About Planck Time&lt;/em&gt;‘:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;… In Planck time, everything that is was spread so thin&lt;br&gt;
That all distance is enormous, between each star,&lt;br&gt;
Between subatomic particles, so that we are composed&lt;br&gt;
Almost entirely of emptiness, so that what separates&lt;br&gt;
This world, bright ball floating in its midnight blue,&lt;br&gt;
From the irrefutable logic of no world at all&lt;br&gt;
Has no more substance than the traveller’s dream,&lt;br&gt;
So that nothing can be said for certain except&lt;br&gt;
That sometime, call it Planck time, it will all just&lt;br&gt;
Disappear, a parlor trick, a rabbit back in its hat,&lt;br&gt;
Will all go up in a flash of light, abracadabra,&lt;br&gt;
An idea that isn’t being had anymore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wonderfully charming ‘&lt;em&gt;Valentine, By A Palaeontologist&lt;/em&gt;‘ by &lt;a title="Forbes article" href="http://www.nndb.com/people/021/000100718/"&gt;Edward Forbes&lt;/a&gt;, who so defended his right to be a songwriter and versifier, that he is cited in ‘Memoir of Edward Forbes’ as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘…s&lt;em&gt;eeing no reason why a President of the Geological Society should cease… and so he chanted his songs and cracked his jokes as merrily as he had done in the little Birmingham tavern when he was only beginning to be known&lt;/em&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Valentine By A Palaeontologist’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borne upon Pterodactyle’s wing,&lt;br&gt;
This heart, which you once deemed of stone,&lt;br&gt;
Model of maids, to thee I bring,&lt;br&gt;
And offer it to thee alone!&lt;br&gt;
Not Owen, pondering o’er bone&lt;br&gt;
Of great Dinornis, fonder grew&lt;br&gt;
Of mighty wingless birds unknown,&lt;br&gt;
Than I, sweet maid, of you.&lt;br&gt;
…&lt;br&gt;
Like some fantastic Trilobite&lt;br&gt;
That perished in Silurian sea.&lt;br&gt;
And long lay hid from mortal sight&lt;br&gt;
So was the heart I yield to thee.&lt;br&gt;
Now from its stony matrix free,&lt;br&gt;
Thy palaeontologic skill&lt;br&gt;
Once more hath call’d it forth to be&lt;br&gt;
The servant of thy will.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot out there that challenges this supposed separation of camps beyond mere poetic evidence. &lt;a title="conference" href="http://www.poetrysociety.org.uk/content/aboutus/npd/npd05/northeast/"&gt;Workshop / Conferences have even been held&lt;/a&gt; to see how educating students via both mediums could heighten an appreciation of both science and literature. The marriage of scientific and poetic metaphor has even been &lt;a title="science musings.com" href="http://www.sciencemusings.com/2005/05/science-and-metaphor.html"&gt;written up in columns before.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over collections and contributions by the likes of &lt;a title="space being(don&amp;#39;t forget to remember)Curved" href="http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/a_f/cummings/curved.htm"&gt;ee cummings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="wcw" href="http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Poetry/Williams/St._Francis_Einstein_of_the_Daffodils"&gt;William Carlos Williams&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a title="poe" href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/1528.html"&gt;Edgar Allen Poe&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that the most popular topics involve stars, astronomy and those who contribute to the field (not always in a complimentary fashion, as you can see from the links). The book &lt;a title="book" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=G-RKoq28M-QC"&gt;Contemporary Poetry and Contemporary Science&lt;/a&gt;, edited by Robert Crawford, contains the essay ‘Astronomy and Poetry’ by Jocelyn Bell Burnell, who recommended the following poem as ‘&lt;em&gt;capturing beautifully, and with scientific accuracy how star death and the chemical elements produced thereby become new stars and human life&lt;/em&gt;‘:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="little cosmic dust poem" href="http://imaginenature.amnh.org/cosmic/cosmic.html"&gt;‘Little Cosmic Dust Poem&lt;/a&gt;‘&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;- by John Haines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Out of the debris of dying stars,&lt;br&gt;
This rain of particles&lt;br&gt;
that waters the waste with brightness…&lt;br&gt;
the sea-wave of atoms hurrying home,&lt;br&gt;
collapse of the giant, unstable guest who cannot stay…&lt;br&gt;
out of the cold and fleeing dust&lt;br&gt;
that is never and always,&lt;br&gt;
the silence and waste to come…&lt;br&gt;
this arm, this hand,&lt;br&gt;
my voice, your face, this love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every poem is brought to us from classic authors found only in books; the Internet and self-publishing has allowed us to extend the scope for poets who are pro-science. It would be extremely remiss of me to overlook the book of one of the finest online poets who brings science, religious critique and social commentary together in brilliantly crafted verse - ‘&lt;a title="Strange News" href="http://www.lulu.com/content/482923"&gt;Strange News from the Monkey House’ by ‘Dr Adequate’.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Dr Adequate’s more recent works online is &lt;a title="geller" href="http://podblack.wordpress.com/2008/01/14/randi-asks-a-question/"&gt;quite relevant to certain questions&lt;/a&gt; that James Randi raises about Uri Geller:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="online link" href="http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?p=3334013"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Magus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; or&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; How I Supped With The Devil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Dr Adequate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I sought and seized me mastery&lt;br&gt;
beyond what mortal men should dare,&lt;br&gt;
and spake a spell that drew to me&lt;br&gt;
the spirits of the earth and air,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;and bade the hidden world attend&lt;br&gt;
obedient to my secret runes;&lt;br&gt;
and, lusting in my heart to bend&lt;br&gt;
or otherwise deform some spoons,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;my voice was with the thunders blent;&lt;br&gt;
I cried: “Ye ancient spirits, rise!&lt;br&gt;
Ride forth, and leave no spoon unbent,&lt;br&gt;
for such is hateful in mine eyes.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sensual succubi, in swarms&lt;br&gt;
brought forth ten thousand spoons of gold,&lt;br&gt;
and drew them into monstrous forms&lt;br&gt;
entwined in hideous fold on fold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I sometimes wish that they would ask&lt;br&gt;
politely, if I have a view&lt;br&gt;
to any other little task&lt;br&gt;
or thing I’d rather have them do …)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I called the very hosts of Hell:&lt;br&gt;
methought my soul was little price,&lt;br&gt;
‘cos demons &lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;do bend spoons so well,&lt;br&gt;
and twisted cutlery is nice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Though Satan come to claim me soon&lt;br&gt;
and feast upon my wizard’s heart,&lt;br&gt;
ere then he’ll warp me many a spoon&lt;br&gt;
and mock with curves the cutler’s art.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His legions pour from out Hell’s gate&lt;br&gt;
to crinkle spoons at my command,&lt;br&gt;
‘cos else I’d have to leave ‘em straight,&lt;br&gt;
or bend the wretched things by hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr A regularly contributes to the &lt;a title="Skeptic Wiki" href="http://www.skepticwiki.org"&gt;SkepticWiki&lt;/a&gt; and JREF forums (twenty copies of his book were donated to the JREF and put on sale at The Amaz!ng Meeting 5 - all were snapped up within the first two days) has made this book available online through the same publishers as the Open Laboratory anthology. &lt;a title="James Randi site" href="http://www.randi.org"&gt;James Randi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="minchin" href="http://www.timminchin.com/"&gt;Tim Minchin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="Penn and Teller" href="http://www.pennandteller.com"&gt;Penn Jillette&lt;/a&gt; hold their own copies of this volume; hopefully another edition will be made available for either &lt;a title="TAM6" href="http://www.randi.org"&gt;TAM6&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a title="Dragon Con" href="http://www.dragoncon.org/"&gt;Dragon*Con.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would point out two of my favorites scientific poems (those which are not written by either Dr A or DC, mind!) are distinctly romantically-inclined in their construct. Firstly, a short segment from ‘&lt;em&gt;The Kiss Precise’&lt;/em&gt; by Frederick Soddy - famous for &lt;a title="Soddy&amp;#39;s formulae" href="http://www.pballew.net/soddy.html"&gt;Soddy’s formula,&lt;/a&gt; which he &lt;strong&gt;presented entirely in poetic form:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pballew.net/soddy1.gif" alt="illustration of soddy&amp;#39;s formula" width="135" height="143"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For pairs of lips to kiss maybe&lt;br&gt;
Involves no trigonometry.&lt;br&gt;
‘Tis not so when four circles kiss&lt;br&gt;
Each one the other three.&lt;br&gt;
To bring this off the four must be&lt;br&gt;
As three in one or one in three.&lt;br&gt;
If one in three, beyond a doubt&lt;br&gt;
Each gets three kisses from without.&lt;br&gt;
If three in one, then is that one&lt;br&gt;
Thrice kissed internally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;…Four circles to the kissing come.&lt;br&gt;
The smaller are the benter.&lt;br&gt;
The bend is just the inverse of&lt;br&gt;
The distance form the center.&lt;br&gt;
Though their intrigue left Euclid dumb&lt;br&gt;
There’s now no need for rule of thumb.&lt;br&gt;
Since zero bend’s a dead straight line&lt;br&gt;
And concave bends have minus sign,&lt;br&gt;
The sum of the squares of all four bends&lt;br&gt;
Is half the square of their sum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then finally - &lt;a title="well, clean enough" href="http://img297.imageshack.us/img297/3522/aprilkc2.jpg"&gt;being a girl who likes to keep it clean&lt;/a&gt;… the poet &lt;a title="scapcott" href="http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth152"&gt;Jo Shapcott&lt;/a&gt;, who expresses an interest in “&lt;em&gt;the scientific, the shocking, and the humorous” &lt;/em&gt;in her work -&lt;em&gt; ‘In the Bath’: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
… She lay in the bath with the water touching&lt;br&gt;
her all over, and remembered that not even&lt;br&gt;
the most tender lover could do that.  She wondered&lt;br&gt;
if every molecule on the surface of her skin&lt;br&gt;
was wet and what wet meant to such very&lt;br&gt;
tiny matter.&lt;br&gt;
… She loved the water trails over her body curves,&lt;br&gt;
the classical lines between wet and dry&lt;br&gt;
making graph patterns which she thought might follow&lt;br&gt;
the activity of her brain ? all she wanted&lt;br&gt;
was to be a good atlas, a bright school map&lt;br&gt;
to shine up the world for everyone to see. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Today, I would like to discuss a new paper in the same issue of the International Journal of Pediatric Obesity which examines psychosocial changes in overweight youth following attendance at a weight loss camp.

The study was performed by Dr Nicole Quinlan and colleagues at Duke University, and followed 130 overweight and obese youth who spent their summer at a weight loss camp in the United States.  The treatment program included a balanced diet, nutrition classes, extensive physical activity (5 hours/day, which seems excessive, but that&amp;#39;s a topic for another post) and weekly group counseling sessions.  Before and after their stay, campers completed questionnaires on their attitudes towards body weight and dieting, self-esteem and quality of life, as well as having their height and weight measured by camp staff....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, don't worry, this post is most definitely not about Bill Maher. Rather, it's how, while doing searches for that craziness, I found even more disturbing craziness. Even though I was disappointed in him on this one issue and even though I often don't agree with him on religion, never let it be said that I don't still have considerable admiration for Richard Dawkins. That's why, when I came across some truly over-the-top attacks on Dawkins, I thought it would be worthwhile to mention them, as a little wafer to cleanse the palate before moving on to other topics this week. And, yes, be assured that I am moving on to other topics, particularly one that several readers have been begging me to take on. The only reason I haven't done so is because I simply haven't had the time to do it justice. Tomorrow or Wednesday, though, I promise to try to get to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on to some true ridiculousness, specifically a post called &lt;a href="http://babbazeesbrain.blogspot.com/2009/09/dick-dawkins-before-he-dicks-you.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dick Dawkins Before He Dicks You&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stupid, it's the one thing that doesn't evolve, isn't it? In fact, it just keeps burning and burning and burning and burning. Let's put it this way. Any post in which there is a picture of Richard Dawkins festooned with Swastikas all around him, as though they're emanating from his heart, is indeed a black hole of stupid, so dense that anything resembling light or intelligence is hard pressed to escape. You have to be very careful not to have your intelligence sucked into the maw of this stupid. Tinfoil hats might help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_crazies_are_out_in_force_after_richa.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_crazies_are_out_in_force_after_richa.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/ymkWJZlcQC8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254758976595"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-7645988707030759523">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f2ad27f76382ae60</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Canada" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Politics" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">He Gets by with a Little Help from His Friends</title><published>2009-10-05T15:59:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-05T16:05:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/10/he-gets-by-with-little-help-from-his.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/7645988707030759523/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=7645988707030759523" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> I&amp;#39;m not a big fan of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper but you gotta admire someone who sings a Beatles song with Yo-Yo Ma.</summary><author><name>Larry Moran</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254758976593"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-1003135501652924310">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4cc0abe20d88ff8f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Nobel Prize" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</title><published>2009-10-05T15:41:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-05T15:56:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/10/2009-nobel-prize-in-physiology-or.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/1003135501652924310/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=1003135501652924310" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine goes to Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider, and Jack Szostak &amp;quot;for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase.&amp;quot;These scientists were on everyone&amp;#39;s short list so there&amp;#39;s no great surprise here.

&lt;p&gt;He became an atheist at a young age when, while attending Quran school (to become an imam), he discovered he no longer had faith in the religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The more I learned, the more paradoxes I saw,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Husibi said his rejection of Islam was cemented during mandatory military service in the Lebanon civil war in which more than a million people died, a war he says was religiously motivated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After becoming an atheist, Husibi felt a sense of relief “that these silly stories cannot control me anymore,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he loves the freedom of American society and the respect and understanding of the people.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Husibi also realized that the Quran was written by men, not God.  Just like the Bible.  And every other “sacred” text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a kind, rational, decent man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which must explain why he’s &lt;a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&amp;amp;articleid=20091001_18_A11_SbiHsb59831&amp;amp;allcom=1"&gt;now getting death threats&lt;/a&gt; from the Muslim community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s serious and it’s frightening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Husibi, who has an unlisted telephone number, said he received about 30 calls Saturday from people who were cursing him, calling him a traitor and threatening him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most were foreign-born, Tulsa-area Muslims whom he knows, he said. He also received angry calls from friends and relatives in Syria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One caller, whom Husibi would not identify, said that if he spoke at the meeting and said anything against Shariah (Islamic law), he would be killed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another caller offered Husibi’s young Muslim wife $10,000 to leave him and return to her native Syria, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Someone from Tulsa called my 76-year-old mother in Syria and said, ‘You’re not going to see your son anymore,’ ” he said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original article came out on Saturday, in anticipation for the Sunday talk.  The organizer of the Tulsa Coalition of Reason offered to cancel the talk in the wake of threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The courageous Husibi &lt;a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&amp;amp;articleid=20091001_18_A11_SbiHsb59831&amp;amp;allcom=1"&gt;refused the cancellation&lt;/a&gt;.  He still refuses to silence himself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
On Tuesday, a clearly shaken Husibi asked that any future articles emphasize that he is not attacking Islam alone but all religions, including “fundamentalist Christians like Timothy McVeigh and fundamentalist Jews who kill Muslim children in the Gaza Strip.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said Tulsa Muslims are awaiting an apology from him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I won’t apologize,” he said. “I’m not going to be a chicken. This is my right, to give my point of view.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Husibi via email.  His English isn’t perfect but it’s very clear what he’s saying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He verified those threats mentioned in the article and added that his brothers are now denying they know him (whether out of fear or shame, I don’t know).  He’s lost his friends and relatives in a very short amount of time.  He’s still getting threats.  He worries someone is going to shoot him.  It doesn’t help that he recently had open heart surgery…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urged him to go to the police.  He told me he would do so today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, they can investigate the people making the threats and offer some protection for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
