&lt;p&gt;I lied. I’ll admit it. I like to say that I’m adventurous. I tell people that I &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/topic/live/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=live&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt; everyday like it’s my last. But the truth is, I live everyday like I have to be at work at 8 a.m. the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I leave my office each afternoon, I make stacks of things to do, an order in which to do things, and what time to have things done. I (try to) watch what I &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/topic/eat/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=eat&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;eat&lt;/a&gt;, because in five years I don’t want to struggle with my weight. I thoughtfully pack my lunch as I cook dinner. Each evening is replete with routine (which may speak more to my OCD than anything else), so that I’m not surprised come tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I came across Stephanie Goldberg’s “Living as if they had only one day left,” a recent &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/wayoflife/04/06/bucket.list.buried.life/index.html?iref=allsearch"&gt;CNN.com article&lt;/a&gt; about MTV’s &lt;em&gt;The Buried Life&lt;/em&gt;, I suffered a tinge of irritation. It brought me face to face with my lies – and my fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Buried Life&lt;/em&gt; is a show about four male friends who are followed around while they check off their joint list of things to do before they die. The list is expansive and encompasses the classic kiss-the-person-of-your-dreams goal to playing basketball with President Obama. And for each thing they cross of their list, they vow to help someone else cross something off their own “bucket lists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’ve resolved to get moving on my own bucket list. I want to get my nose pierced and party til dawn on the Las Vegas Strip by the end of 2010. After that, I’m thinking skydiving, writing a book, and running a marathon. I know those aren’t necessarily extreme, but they work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know some of my secrets, now we want to hear from you. What are some items you’d like to cross off your bucket list? Sound off in the comments section, below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember when, inspired by &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right.html"&gt;Sam Harris’s TED talk&lt;/a&gt;, we debated whether you could derive “ought” (morality) from “is” (science)?  That was fun.  But both my &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/03/24/the-moral-equivalent-of-the-parallel-postulate/"&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/03/29/sam-harris-responds/"&gt;the followup&lt;/a&gt; were more or less dashed off, and I never did give a careful explanation of why I didn’t think it was possible.  So once more into the breach, what do you say?  (See also &lt;a href="http://www.project-reason.org/newsfeed/item/moral_confusion_in_the_name_of_science3/"&gt;Harris’s response&lt;/a&gt;, and his &lt;a href="http://www.samharris.org/faq/full_text/how-can-you-derive-an-ought-from-an-is/P220/"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.  On the other side, see &lt;a href="http://www.project-reason.org/newsfeed/item/moral_confusion_in_the_name_of_science3/#c4631"&gt;Fionn’s comment at Project Reason&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://theappleeaters.wordpress.com/2010/03/31/sam-harris-science-and-morality/"&gt;Jim at Apple Eaters&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2010/04/values_and_facts.php"&gt;Joshua Rosenau&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to give the basic argument first, then litter the bottom of the post with various disclaimers and elaborations.  And I want to start with a hopefully non-controversial statement about what science is.  Namely:  science deals with empirical reality — with what happens in the world.  (I.e. what “is.”)  Two scientific theories may disagree in some way — “the observable universe began in a hot, dense state about 14 billion years ago” vs. “the universe has always existed at more or less the present temperature and density.”  Whenever that happens, we can always imagine some sort of experiment or observation that would let us decide which one is right.  The observation might be difficult or even impossible to carry out, but we can always imagine what it would entail.  (Statements about the contents of the Great Library of Alexandria are perfectly empirical, even if we can’t actually go back in time to look at them.) &lt;em&gt;If you have a dispute that cannot in principle be decided by recourse to observable facts about the world, your dispute is not one of science.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, let’s think about morality.  What would it mean to have a science of morality?  I think it would look have to look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human beings seek to maximize something we choose to call “well-being” (although it might be called “utility” or “happiness” or “flourishing” or something else).  The amount of well-being in a single person is a function of what is happening in that person’s brain, or at least in their body as a whole.  That function can in principle be empirically measured.  The total amount of well-being is a function of what happens in all of the human brains in the world, which again can in principle be measured.  The job of morality is to specify what that function is, measure it, and derive conditions in the world under which it is maximized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this talk of maximizing functions isn’t meant to lampoon the project of grounding morality on science; it’s simply taking it seriously.  Casting morality as a maximization problem might seem overly restrictive at first glance, but the procedure can potentially account for a wide variety of approaches.  A libertarian might want to maximize a feeling of personal freedom, while a traditional utilitarian might want to maximize some version of happiness.  The point is simply that the goal of morality should be to create certain conditions that are, in principle, directly measurable by empirical means.  (If that’s not the point, it’s not science.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I want to argue that this program is simply not possible.  I’m not saying it would be difficult — I’m saying it’s impossible in principle.  Morality is not part of science, however much we would like it to be.  There are a large number of arguments one could advance for in support of this claim, but I’ll stick to three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.  There’s no single definition of well-being.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People disagree about what really constitutes “well-being” (or whatever it is you think they should be maximizing).  This is so perfectly obvious, it’s hard to know what to defend.  Anyone who wants to argue that we can ground morality on a scientific basis has to jump through some hoops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there are people who aren’t that interested in universal well-being at all.  There are serial killers, and sociopaths, and racial supremacists.  We don’t need to go to extremes, but the extremes certainly exist.  The natural response is to simply separate out such people; “we need not worry about them,” in Harris’s formulation.  Surely all right-thinking people agree on the primacy of well-being.  But how do we draw the line between right-thinkers and the rest?  Where &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; do we draw the line, in terms of measurable quantities? And why there?  On which side of the line do we place people who believe that it’s right to torture prisoners for the greater good, or who cherish the rituals of fraternity hazing?  Most particularly, what experiment can we imagine doing that tells us where to draw the line?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, it’s equally obvious that even right-thinking people don’t really agree about well-being, or how to maximize it.  Here, the response is apparently that most people are simply confused (which is on the face of it perfectly plausible).  Deep down they all want the same thing, but they misunderstand how to get there; hippies who believe in giving peace a chance and stern parents who believe in corporal punishment for their kids all want to maximize human flourishing, they simply haven’t been given the proper scientific resources for attaining that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’m happy to admit that people are morally confused, I see no evidence whatsoever that they all ultimately want the same thing.  The position doesn’t even seem coherent.  Is it &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; necessary that people ultimately have the same idea about human well-being, or is it a contingent truth about actual human beings?  Can we not even imagine people with fundamentally incompatible views of the good?  (I think I can.)  And if we can, what is the reason for the cosmic accident that we all happen to agree?  And if that happy cosmic accident exists, it’s still merely an empirical fact; by itself, the existence of universal agreement on what is good doesn’t necessarily imply that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; good.  We could all be mistaken, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real world, right-thinking people have a lot of overlap in how they think of well-being.  But the overlap isn’t exact, nor is the lack of agreement wholly a matter of misunderstanding.  When two people have different views about what constitutes real well-being, there is no experiment we can imagine doing that would prove one of them to be wrong.  It doesn’t mean that moral conversation is impossible, just that it’s not science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.  It’s not self-evident that maximizing well-being, however defined, is the proper goal of morality.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maximizing a hypothetical well-being function is an effective way of thinking about many possible approaches to morality.  But not every possible approach.  In particular, it’s a manifestly &lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/"&gt;consequentialist&lt;/a&gt; idea — what matters is the outcome, in terms of particular mental states of conscious beings.  There are certainly non-consequentialist ways of approaching morality; in &lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/"&gt;deontological&lt;/a&gt; theories, the moral good inheres in actions themselves, not in their ultimate consequences.  Now, you may think that you have good arguments in favor of consequentialism.  But are those truly &lt;em&gt;empirical&lt;/em&gt; arguments?  You’re going to get bored of me asking this, but:  what is the experiment I could do that would distinguish which was true, consequentialism or deontological ethics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on the mental states of conscious beings, while seemingly natural, opens up many cans of worms that moral philosophers have tussled with for centuries.  Imagine that we are able to quantify precisely some particular mental state that corresponds to a high level of well-being; the exact configuration of neuronal activity in which someone is healthy, in love, and enjoying a hot-fudge sundae.  Clearly achieving such a state is a moral good.  Now imagine that we achieve it by drugging a person so that they are unconscious, and then manipulating their central nervous system at a neuron-by-neuron level, until they share exactly the mental state of the conscious person in those conditions.  Is that an equal moral good to the conditions in which they actually are healthy and in love etc.?  If we make everyone happy by means of drugs or hypnosis or direct electronic stimulation of their pleasure centers, have we achieved moral perfection?  If not, then clearly our definition of “well-being” is not simply a function of conscious mental states.  And if not, what is it?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.  There’s no simple way to aggregate well-being over different individuals.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big problems of morality, to state the obvious, come about because the interests of different individuals come into conflict.  Even if we somehow agreed perfectly on what constituted the well-being of a single individual — or, more properly, even if we somehow “objectively measured” well-being, whatever that is supposed to mean — it would generically be the case that no achievable configuration of the world provided perfect happiness for everyone.  People will typically have to sacrifice for the good of others; by paying taxes, if nothing else.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how are we to decide how to balance one person’s well-being against another’s?  To do this scientifically, we need to be able to make sense of statements like “this person’s well-being is precisely 0.762 times the well-being of that person.”  What is that supposed to mean?  Do we measure well-being on a linear scale, or is it logarithmic?  Do we simply add up the well-beings of every individual person, or do we take the average?  And would that be the arithmetic mean, or the geometric mean?  Do more individuals with equal well-being each mean greater well-being overall?  Who counts as an individual?  Do embryos?  What about dolphins?  Artificially intelligent robots?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These may sound like silly questions, but they’re necessary ones if we’re supposed to take morality-as-science seriously.  The easy questions of morality are easy, at least among groups of people who start from similar moral grounds; but it’s the hard ones that matter.  This isn’t a matter of principle vs. practice; these questions don’t have single correct answers, even in principle.  If there is no way in principle to calculate precisely how much well-being one person should be expected to sacrifice for the greater well-being of the community, then what you’re doing isn’t science.  And if you do come up with an algorithm, and I come up with a slightly different one, what’s the experiment we’re going to do to decide which of our aggregate well-being functions correctly describes the world?  That’s the real question for attempts to found morality on science, but it’s an utterly rhetorical one; there are no such experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are my personal reasons for thinking that you can’t derive ought from is.  The perceptive reader will notice that it’s really just one reason over and over again — there is no way to answer moral questions by doing experiments, even in principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to the disclaimers.  They’re especially necessary because I suspect there’s no &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; difference between the way that people on either side of this debate actually think about morality.  The disagreement is all about deep philosophical foundations.  Indeed, as I said in my first post, the whole debate is somewhat distressing, as we could be engaged in an interesting and fruitful discussion about how scientific methods could help us with our moral judgments, if we hadn’t been distracted by the misguided attempt to &lt;em&gt;found&lt;/em&gt; moral judgments on science.  It’s a subtle distinction, but this is a subtle game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First:  it would be wonderful if it were true.  I’m not opposed to founding morality on science as a matter of personal preference; I mean, how awesome would that be?  Opening up an entirely new area of scientific endeavor in the cause of making the world a better place.  I’d be all for that.  Of course, that’s one reason to be especially skeptical of the idea; we should always subject those claims that we want to be true to the highest standards of scrutiny.  In this case, I think it falls far short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second: science will play a crucial role in understanding morality.  The reality is that many of us &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; share some broad-brush ideas about what constitutes the good, and how to go about achieving it.  The idea that we need to think hard about what that means, and in particular how it relates to the extraordinarily promising field of neuroscience, is absolutely correct.  But it’s a role, not a foundation.  Those of us who deny that you can derive “ought” from “is” aren’t anti-science; we just want to take science seriously, and not bend its definition beyond all recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third: morality is still possible.  Some of the motivation for trying to ground morality on science seems to be the old canard about moral relativism:  “If moral judgments aren’t objective, you can’t condemn Hitler or the Taliban!”  Ironically, this is something of a holdover from a pre-scientific worldview, when religion was typically used as a basis for morality.  The idea is that a moral judgment simply doesn’t exist unless it’s somehow grounded in something &lt;em&gt;out there&lt;/em&gt;, either in the natural world or a supernatural world.  But that’s simply not right.  In the real world, we have moral feelings, and we try to make sense of them.  They might not be “true” or “false” in the sense that scientific theories are true or false, but we have them.  If there’s someone who doesn’t share them (and there is!), we can’t convince them that they are wrong by doing an experiment.  But we can talk to them and try to find points of agreement and consensus, and act accordingly.  Moral relativism doesn’t imply moral quietism.  And even if it did (it doesn’t), that wouldn’t affect whether or not it was true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally: pointing out that people disagree about morality is not analogous to the fact that some people are radical epistemic skeptics who don’t agree with ordinary science.  That’s mixing levels of description.  It is true that the tools of science cannot be used to change the mind of a committed solipsist who believes they are a brain in a vat, manipulated by an evil demon; yet, those of us who accept the presuppositions of empirical science are able to make progress.  But here we are concerned only with people who have agreed to buy into all the epistemic assumptions of reality-based science — they &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; disagree about morality.  That’s the problem.  If the project of deriving ought from is were realistic, disagreements about morality would be precisely analogous to disagreements about the state of the universe fourteen billion years ago.  There would be things we could imagine observing about the universe that would enable us to decide which position was right.  But as far as morality is concerned, there aren’t.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this debate is going to seem enormously boring to many people, especially as the ultimate pragmatic difference seems to be found entirely in people’s internal justifications for the moral stances they end up defending, rather than what those stances actually are.  Hopefully those people haven’t read nearly this far.  To the rest of us, it’s a crucially important issue; justifications matter!  But at least we can agree that the discussion is well worth having.  And it’s sure to continue.  &lt;/p&gt;

I'm talking in generalities, and I'm trying to do it quickly, but I hope my points will be clear regardless. Just consider this a rant, and if you need to dismiss it as such, go right ahead. I've long since stopped caring. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a lot of infighting among skeptics right now, with lots of cries that some people or events are "hurting the cause" or "not helping." It seems that every skeptical blogger and personality has been drafted into the "skeptical movement," where they are constantly assumed to be speaking for a larger group, and where every action must apparently be scrutinized for its possible effects on how the general public perceives us and how our actions contribute to or against "the cause."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kYu2r3RVPhY/S991HwPTjXI/AAAAAAAABWs/uekDXLCQo8Q/s1600/internet-serious-business-cat.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:400px;height:300px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kYu2r3RVPhY/S991HwPTjXI/AAAAAAAABWs/uekDXLCQo8Q/s400/internet-serious-business-cat.jpg" border="0" title="Ur hurtin teh cause!" alt="Ur hurtin teh cause!" hspace="5" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It's not quite that bad all over, but the extreme milquetoasts and mollycoddlers have caused folks like me to see even reasonable attempts at discussing tone and tactics as authoritative calls to shut up. It may sound petty to level this complaint, but it's taken a lot of the fun out of skepticism and blogging. I will shout from the rooftops that science is of primary importance and that we should educate the public and fight against dangerous pseudoscience on every conceivable front, and that passion hasn't died down. What &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; died quite a bit is my enjoyment of this whole process. Part of it is that the landscape has changed; we've roasted the trolls to extinction, and those who do show up are either looney toons like Dennis Markuze and Graeme Bird, or drive-by commenters who don't stick around. But part of it, too, is that I have no real interest in speaking for a movement, nor in being told that my methods are "hurting the cause" by people who don't have a fucking clue what my "causes" are. I'm passionate about skepticism, but blogging isn't my job. I don't get paid for this, I do it because I enjoy it. And the more I have to worry about how Internets is Srs Bzns, the less I want to participate.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/2010/03/just-quick-rant.html"&gt;As I said before&lt;/a&gt;, I'm open to the idea that I may be doin' it wrong, but if you think we should eliminate tactics from our repertoire, if you're going to claim that someone or some method is "not helping," then you'd better damn well back it up with evidence. Otherwise, you're not promoting skepticism, you're not speaking from any kind of authority, you're just talking out of your ass. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But to the hardcore tone trolls and the more reasonable group of people who are just concerned with how skeptics represent themselves to the general public and what tactics we use in discussions, I have a few pertinent questions. I don't expect to get any real answers, certainly not from the people I'm actually frustrated by, but I'd rather post this and get it out of my system for a few days than let it simmer. But if you'd like to answer them, please feel free. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kYu2r3RVPhY/S9-Ej1Pr-sI/AAAAAAAABW0/blQzGqoNYGQ/s1600/serious-cat.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:300px;height:400px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kYu2r3RVPhY/S9-Ej1Pr-sI/AAAAAAAABW0/blQzGqoNYGQ/s400/serious-cat.jpg" border="0" title="What is ur concernz?" alt="What is ur concernz?" align="left" hspace="5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The first, and most important question, is this: &lt;b&gt;What are you adding to the conversation?&lt;/b&gt; I think it's trivially obvious, even to those frequently cited as the worst offenders, that one's content and tactics need to be tailored to the situation and the audience. PZ Myers doesn't berate the religious students in his Biology classes for being deluded nitwits, Richard Dawkins admitted that he would have been the wrong person to testify in the Dover trial, since he'd have to say that (at least in his case) science leads to atheism. Much like the talk of framing some months and years ago, what I'm seeing from the reasonable tone-talkers is repetition of that basic rule of persuasive writing, and I don't think anyone disagrees. From my end, it's as though you're telling a room of veteran writers "show, don't tell," and then repeating it louder when they don't treat it like a revolutionary concept.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, I can understand &lt;i&gt;disagreeing&lt;/i&gt; with a person regarding what the appropriate tactics for a given discussion or argument or action are, and what might represent an appropriate tone or effective method. Here's the problem: in order to say what's effective or appropriate, you have to measure it against some goal, and &lt;i&gt;different people may have wildly different goals&lt;/i&gt;. Yes, as skeptics we generally think that promoting critical thinking and science are major concerns. But that's pretty much where the assumed similarities end (and depending on how broadly you want to define "skeptic," there are some folks &lt;font size="1"&gt;Bill Maher&lt;/font&gt; who might not even fit that latter criterion). We're individuals, and we all have different interests that often get folded in with skepticism (frequently because we see those interests as outgrowths of skepticism). Michael Shermer puts a priority on promoting his libertarian economic and political philosophies; PZ Myers is generally more concerned with religious woo than cryptozoology; Orac focuses mostly on medical woo and doesn't care much about promoting atheism; and so forth. In order to talk about what represents an effective tactic, you have to know what kind of effect the person is trying to achieve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To go back to the Framing debate, there were those (and still are) who claimed that outspoken atheist scientists would hurt the promotion of science by suggesting that science leads to atheism. Well, that might be true. Those who are inclined to reject something because it leads some people to become atheists would certainly be inclined to reject science for that reason (though I can't imagine how &lt;i&gt;hiding it&lt;/i&gt; would help said promotion among said people in the long run), but it seemed that the critics never considered that promoting science wasn't the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; goal at play. Some people, believe it or not, were promoting &lt;i&gt;atheism&lt;/i&gt;, or at least promoting the idea that it's okay to be an atheist, that it's okay to criticize religion, that religion shouldn't be beyond critique, and so forth. That goal may sometimes contradict the goal of promoting science to the people who reject it on religious grounds. And &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; goal may conflict with the goal of maintaining science's neutral position with regard to religion, as evidenced by the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2010/04/is_id_blasphemous.php"&gt;NCSE's Faith Project Director declaring ID to be "blasphemous"&lt;/a&gt; (which explicitly endorses a particular religious viewpoint). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is why talk of what "helps" and "hurts," what's "effective" and "appropriate," is so frustrating: it relies on the assumption that the critic and the subject of critique share the same goals and priorities, which is unlikely. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd be less infuriated by these lines of questioning if it was phrased less "ur doin it wrong" and more "if you're trying to accomplish [GOAL], then I think [METHOD] is unproductive." See, this is part of that whole "tone" and "framing" thing: sometimes effective criticism requires you to express some degree of humility, rather than put forth an air of authority (which can seem arrogant and presumptuous). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even that, though, falls back to my original complaint: saying "If your goal is X, Y is ineffective/counterproductive" is a &lt;i&gt;factual claim&lt;/i&gt;. If you're going to make a factual claim that a person should eliminate some method from their repertoire because it's harmful (or unhelpful), then &lt;i&gt;you have to show that it's harmful (or unhelpful)&lt;/i&gt;. In order to do that, you need evidence. Otherwise, it's &lt;i&gt;just your opinion&lt;/i&gt;, and while you're entitled to express it, you need to realize what it is and what value it has to anyone else (i.e., none). Without evidential support, your opinion is no more or less valid than your opponent's. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My final question to those who are concerned about tone and tactics: &lt;b&gt;What is your ultimate goal?&lt;/b&gt; What do you want the skeptical movement to be/do? What would your ideal skeptical activist or activism look like? Is there anyone right now who you think is doin' it right? What do you want this conversation about tone and tactics and effectiveness and appropriateness to accomplish?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rant over. Feel free to answer, I'd honestly love to hear what people have to say.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20494433-21179857172693613?l=dubitoergo.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Foss</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Dubito Ergo Sum</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272939494810"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/now_thats_a_font.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5459a372b07f5d6a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cephalopods"/><title type="html">Now that's a font</title><published>2010-05-04T02:06:33Z</published><updated>2010-05-04T02:06:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/nfDHhCDiFl8/now_thats_a_font.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/now_thats_a_font.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If only it were TrueType or Postscript, I'd be using this &lt;a href="http://mattus.web-log.nl/vibe_visual_brand_experie/2010/05/octopus-alfabet.html"&gt;octopus alphabet&lt;/a&gt; all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

Every now and again, people with all sorts of backgrounds -- from some graduate school all the way to having not finished high school -- ask me about getting involved in Astronomy and Astrophysics.  Often, people's interest simply come from looking up at night.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/4233-night-sky-at-25-degree.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/4233-night-sky-at-25-degree-thumb-500x332-48268.jpeg" width="500" height="332" alt="4233-night-sky-at-25-degree.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to lie, this is a &lt;i&gt;huge&lt;/i&gt; question, with many different answers.  First off, let's start off assuming that you have no background in math, no background in physics, and that you're interested in exploring the Universe, and possibly contributing to what we scientifically know.  Where's the first place to go?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/astronomy.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/astronomy-thumb-500x505-48270.jpeg" width="500" height="505" alt="astronomy.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with your local amateur astronomy club.  Many people have this negative idea associated with amateur astronomy; that it's somehow &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;professional.  I've got news for you: the &lt;b&gt;average&lt;/b&gt; amateur astronomer knows more about night sky observing, than your &lt;b&gt;above average&lt;/b&gt; physics &amp;amp; astronomy professor.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes me; those of you who are amateur astronomers have probably looked through more telescopes, resolved more objects, and found -- firsthand -- more interesting things in the night sky than I ever have.  (Yes, there are other things that I know, but we'll get to that.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty much every major area in the United States (and many others in most parts of the world) have an amateur astronomy club, where enthusiasts get together and share knowledge, telescopes, and the skies together.  In my current city, &lt;a href="http://www.rca-omsi.org/"&gt;Rose City Astronomers&lt;/a&gt; has telescope workshops, a lecture series, special interest/information groups, and perhaps the best place to start: &lt;b&gt;star parties&lt;/b&gt;.  After all, perhaps my favorite time-lapse video was taken by an amateur at a star party.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id%3D4505537%26server%3Dvimeo.com%26show_title%3D1%26show_byline%3D1%26show_portrait%3D0%26color%3D%26fullscreen%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=281" width="500" height="281"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to learn your sky is to get a telescope or even a good pair of binoculars, some good, clear, dark skies, and to get out there and explore it!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But maybe that's not up your alley.  Maybe you aren't into observing the skies through an eyepiece yourself.  Maybe you're more interested in looking at the spectacular images taken by the greatest telescopes we've ever developed, and seeing what can be done with them.  Well, I suggest you check out &lt;a href="http://www.galaxyzoo.org/"&gt;Galaxy Zoo&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/hannysvoorwerp_wht.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/hannysvoorwerp_wht-thumb-500x375-48329.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="hannysvoorwerp_wht.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the galaxy zoo project started, over &lt;a href="http://blogs.zooniverse.org/galaxyzoo/2010/04/12/60-million-classifications/"&gt;60 million&lt;/a&gt; galaxies have been classified thanks to interested "amateurs."  In fact, an amateur named Hanny van Arkle found this object in the image above, which even mystified the professionals for some number of months!  The object is known as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanny&amp;#39;s_Voorwerp"&gt;Hanny's Voorwerp&lt;/a&gt;, and although it's thought to be related to a quasar, no quasar has yet been found.  In fact, the greenish appearance led to the creation of a whole new &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peas_(Astronomy)"&gt;class of galaxies&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/planetarium-large-web.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/planetarium-large-web-thumb-500x337-48274.jpeg" width="500" height="337" alt="planetarium-large-web.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe you want to make a living doing this stuff.  What &lt;a href="http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/careers.php"&gt;career options&lt;/a&gt; are there?  Well, in the education arena, there are jobs at planetaria (above) and science museums, as well as many outreach projects.  However, these types of jobs usually -- at minimum -- require a bachelor's degree in physics, astronomy, engineering or education.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you're willing to get a bachelor's degree, there's a whole wonderful world that opens up to you...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/DaveS2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/DaveS2-thumb-500x725-48276.jpeg" width="500" height="725" alt="DaveS2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instrumentation!  From telescope-making to cameras, from automated software to grinding mirrors, instrumentation is one of the most fundamental areas of research into astronomy and astrophysics!  Jobs range from working for commercial telescope makers like Celestron and Meade to working for colleges and universities, standalone observatories, or national labs.  And while there are many people who go through grad school and get their PhD's, that isn't the only way to get involved in this field!  For instance, if you wanted to be &lt;a href="http://members.aas.org/jobreg/JobDetailPage.cfm?JobID=24623"&gt;McDonald Observatory's Telescope Operator&lt;/a&gt;, you don't need any special training to qualify.  And McDonald -- my example -- is a world-class observatory in Texas!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/adn.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/adn-thumb-500x371-48278.jpeg" width="500" height="371" alt="adn.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if you want to actually become a professional astronomer?  Long nights writing proposals, flying to the observatory, collecting your data, reducing your data, trying to figure out what's a signal and what's noise, etc.  If that sounds like a dream to you, then you'll want to apply to graduate school in astronomy and become a professional observational astronomer!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/Keck_observer.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/Keck_observer-thumb-500x404-48280.jpeg" width="500" height="404" alt="Keck_observer.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular opinion, you don't spend most of your time looking through a telescope; you hardly ever use an eyepiece at all!  Computers take your data; they're far more reliable and the data is permanent!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can observe with a terrestrial telescope &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; with a Space Telescope, depending on your project!  The most spectacular images ever taken, like this one...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/crabmosaic_hst_f.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/crabmosaic_hst_f-thumb-500x400-48282.jpeg" width="500" height="400" alt="crabmosaic_hst_f.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...were taken by professional observational astronomers!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other route?  If instrumentation or observing doesn't do it for you, there's theory, which is the route I went down.  This is incredibly math and physics intensive, and you will spend most of your time writing computer code, running simulations, and trying your best to find approximate solutions to unsolvable equations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/nseqs.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/nseqs-thumb-500x374-48284.gif" width="500" height="374" alt="nseqs.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't for everyone; it's for the people who love it!  And I'm not going to pull any punches, there's a cost. Graduate school in astronomy or astrophysics -- to get your PhD alone -- usually takes between &lt;b&gt;five&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;seven&lt;/b&gt; years.  And even then, there are many more people with PhDs than there are jobs as professional observers or professional theorists!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which isn't to say you shouldn't do it!  But you should only do it &lt;i&gt;if you love it&lt;/i&gt;, and only if you love it so much that it will be worth the other things you'll need to give up in order to do it well.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people (including myself), the payoff is huge!  The end result is that I get to think about the entire Universe...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/expand_universe_capsule_history.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in/expand_universe_capsule_history-thumb-500x429-48286.jpeg" width="500" height="429" alt="expand_universe_capsule_history.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and, as much as it makes sense to &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt;, it seems to make sense to me, too.  But it's been a lot of hard work, and even for me, there are still huge gaps in my understanding of many things.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you've got the time, energy, and drive to do it, you can do this &lt;b&gt;at any age&lt;/b&gt;.  (I knew someone in his early 50s who was in graduate school with me when I was in my early 20s; he's a professional physicist now.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; want to get involved but you still want to learn about this stuff, well, that's one of the major goals I'm trying to accomplish by writing this blog!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I hope you have a little better of an appreciation for what opportunities are out there, and I look forward to discovering this Universe with you, from the subatomic to superclusters of galaxies, and everything in between! &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/05/so_you_want_to_get_involved_in.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272936625900"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=176941">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5884863899bf8cd1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="eco-friendly"/><category term="eco-friendly consumption"/><category term="eco-friendly home"/><category term="eco-friendly shopping"/><category term="eco-friendly shopping guide"/><category term="Green Living"/><category term="Marcal"/><category term="National Geographic"/><category term="NRDC"/><category term="Seventh Generation TP"/><category term="Trader Joe's 100% Recycled Toilet Paper"/><category term="whole foods"/><category term="Whole Foods 365 100% Recycled Toilet Paper"/><category term="Whole Foods 365 brand"/><category term="whole foods market"/><category term="Whole Foods Market 365"/><category term="Whole Foods Markets"/><title type="html">Eco-Friendly Toilet Paper: Think Before You Wipe</title><published>2010-05-03T22:00:05Z</published><updated>2010-05-03T22:00:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/eco-friendly-toilet-paper-think-before-you-wipe/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/05/sb10069137at-001.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="sb10069137at-001" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/05/sb10069137at-001-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When you think of saving the environment, you probably think of cars, gas, plastic bags, eating locally, and making sure you separate your cans from your corrugated cardboard. But what about wiping your ass? According to &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/thegreenguide/2010/04/27000-trees-a-day-used-for-toilet-tissue.html"&gt;toilet paper wipes out 27,000 trees &lt;em&gt;per day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. That’s a lot of wood-splitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though we don’t recommend you ditch downstairs hygiene altogether, we do think it’s worth spending the extra pennies – or even dollars – to buy forest-friendly TP. According to the National Resources Defense Council, if every household in the  U.S. replaced just &lt;em&gt;one roll &lt;/em&gt;of virgin fiber toilet paper (500  sheets) with a 100% recycled one, we could save 423,900 trees.

Scholars have long known that Darwin's family suffered significant fertility troubles from inbreeding--after all, he did marry his first cousin, Emma Wedgewood! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more genealogical digging, scholar James Moore recenlty found (according to the &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/genetics/article7114113.ece"&gt;times &lt;/a&gt;online):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Darwin's maternal grandfather, Josiah Wedgwood, had married his own third cousin, Sarah, and had eight children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- The couple's eldest daughter, Susannah Wedgwood, married Robert Darwin, her cousin. Charles was their child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I would like to clarify a few things which may be confusing to those not utterly saturated in the oil industry from a young age as I have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/em&gt; is known as a semi-submersible drilling platform. It does the drilling then gets out of the way for a production platform to come in and produce the oil from the well. It is a very, very expensive rig which Transocean lost quite a bit of money on. They drilled six holes (read: spent lots of money) and never made any hits with it (read: lost a lot of money). It was then leased to BP (probably to make up for lost money) and used to drill in the Mississippi Canyon area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are currently blaming the problem on the failure of something called a “blowout preventer” (BOP)–those of you not familiar with the oil industry would probably want to know what a blowout is first. A blowout is when oil or natural gas enters the drill string (the pipe that drills the hole) and flows back up through the drill string to the surface. This happens when the pressure at the bottom of the hole is greater than the weight of the drilling fluid (aka mud or slurry) to the top of the hole. This can happen one of several ways: an unexpected pocket of high-pressure gas may be reached, a fissure in the formation may cause drilling fluid to leak, or human error. All three of these are usually not a problem because of the BOPs currently used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A BOP is not just one valve, but a series of valves to prevent the flow of material to the surface. The first to be used is the annular preventer, which stops the flow of returning drilling fluid and has a hole for the drill string. This is used when returning mud increases its returning velocity. Usually, increasing the pressure of the mud going into the pipe will be sufficient to stop the backflow of material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this fails, the second to be used is the shear ram which cuts the drill pipe and closes it off to the surface, if there is no pipe, the blind ram can be used instead of either of the two. These three are last ditch efforts to prevent a blowout (well, a blind ram can be used to just close off the hole if there is no pipe), and if they are being used, there has probably already been a series of mistakes. At the time of the explosion, they were cementing casing in the hole, which means there was no drill string in the hole at the time, so the blind rams or shear rams could have been used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What likely happened is that they had just finished cementing the casing in place (via a process called “squeezing” and began to pump out the excess wet cement and did so too rapidly. This decrease in pressure caused the cement plug which had just been put in place to collapse resulting in a blowout. The sudden decrease in pressure and failure of the BOP to operate properly likely caused the blowout.&lt;/p&gt;

Every time Kent Hovind gets a little bit of press, his weird fans start googling his name, and presto, they stumble onto one of my old threads and start waxing indignant. The latest zombie thread is about the Shroud of Turin, and I can guess what has prompted people to start digging on the web for info: that &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/05/02/italy.pope.shroud/index.html"&gt;goofy ol' Pope Ratzi is genuflecting before the Shroud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that keeping up that hope is the message of the Shroud of Turin, in which disciples see their sufferings "mirrored" in the suffering of Christ, CNA reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, no, no. That's not the message of the Shroud. It's a much more reassuring one for the papacy: the moral is that even the cheesiest, most absurd con game can be kept going for centuries if it involves religion. That's the message of hope the Catholic hierarchy can take from a fake relic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more genealogical digging, scholar James Moore recenlty found (according to the &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/genetics/article7114113.ece"&gt;times &lt;/a&gt;online):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Darwin's maternal grandfather, Josiah Wedgwood, had married his own third cousin, Sarah, and had eight children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- The couple's eldest daughter, Susannah Wedgwood, married Robert Darwin, her cousin. Charles was their child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; There's no shortage of stupidity in the world. And, alas, it comes in
many, &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; different kinds. Among the ones that bug me, pretty much
the worst is the stupidity that comes from &lt;em&gt;believing&lt;/em&gt; that you know
something that you don't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This is particularly dangerous for people like me, who write blogs like
this one where we try to explain math and science to
non-mathemicians/non-scientists. Part of what we do, when we're writing our
blogs, is try to take complicated ideas, and explain them in ways that make
them at least somewhat comprehensible to non-experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; There are, arising from this, two dangers that face a math or science blogger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; There is the danger of screwing up ourselves. I've demonstrated this plenty of
  times. I'm not an expert in all of the things that I've tried to write about, and
  I've made some pretty glaring errors. I do my best to acknowledge and correct those errors,
  but it's all too easy to deceive myself into thinking that I understand something better
  than I actually do. I'm embarrassed every time that I do that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; There is the danger of doing a good enough job that our readers believe that 
  &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; really understand something on the basis of our incomplete 
  explanation. When you're writing for a popular audience, you don't generally get into
  every detail of the subject. You do your best to just find a way of explaining it in a way
  that gives people some intuitive handle on the idea. It's not perfect, but that's life.
  I've read a couple of books on relativity, and I don't pretend to really fully understand it. I
  can't quite wrap my head around all of the math. That's after reading several entire 
  &lt;em&gt;books&lt;/em&gt; aimed at a popular audience. Even at that length, you can't explain all
  of the details if you're writing for non-experts. And if you can't do it in a three-hundred page
  book, then you certainly can't do it in a single blog post! But sometimes, a reader will
  see a simplified popular explanation, and believe that because they understand &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;,
  that they've gotten the whole thing. In my experience, relativity is one of the most common
  examples of this phenomenon. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Todays post is &lt;a href="http://www.cosmicfingerprints.com/blog/incompleteness/"&gt;an example of
how terribly wrong you can go&lt;/a&gt; by taking an intuitive explanation of
something, believing that you understand the whole thing from that intuitive
explanation, and running with it, headfirst, right into a brick wall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2010/05/the_danger_when_you_dont_know.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2010/05/the_danger_when_you_dont_know.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/BVxV7e3MbhY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272930211185"><id gr:original-id="1024 at http://layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2550f816cfa8128c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Conspiracies" scheme="http://layscience.net/woo/conspiracies"/><category term="Darwin" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/438"/><category term="evolution" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/61"/><category term="Physical Sciences" scheme="http://layscience.net/science/physical-sciences"/><category term="Natural World" scheme="http://layscience.net/science/natural-world"/><title type="html">Study confirms what we all knew already--Darwin was inbred</title><published>2010-05-03T23:33:03Z</published><updated>2010-05-03T23:33:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://layscience.net/node/1024" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_03/darwinsplitDM1704_468x477.jpg" width="400" height="450" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Calvey&lt;/strong&gt;, the president of the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2201752582&amp;amp;v=wall"&gt;Atheists, Humanists, &amp;amp; Agnostics&lt;/a&gt; group at the University of Wisconsin – Madison, is planning to do the same thing on his campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the group at U of I, Chris knows this is not an attack on Muslim students.  This is a response to the ridiculous rules that radical Muslims think the rest of us have to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to be civil, he &lt;a href="http://wiscatheists.blogspot.com/2010/05/letter-to-muslim-student-association.html"&gt;wrote a letter to the Muslim Student Association&lt;/a&gt;, letting them know exactly what AHA would be doing and why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We are aware that depicting images of Muhammad is a controversial issue that is highly offensive to many Muslims around the world. We acknowledge that you may view this as an unproductive, misguided, or hurtful event. We are very sensitive to these facts, and want to ensure that this event is done in a way that does not lead to Muslims feeling uncomfortable on campus. That is why I want to explain our position and our intentions as clearly as possible before the event takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These drawings are not intended to mock, intimidate, or harass anyone -– rather, we aim to make the following statements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) We have the right to criticize religion and to perform actions considered blasphemous, even if many individuals find this offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) A free society cannot tolerate violence or threats of violence which seek to limit our freedom of expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, we fully understand that Revolution Islam is a radical, fringe organization that does not represent mainstream Islam in any way. It goes without saying that the overwhelming majority of Muslims, in the U.S. and across the world, do not view their tactics as acceptable.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can argue whether or not he should’ve sent this email.  The other option was to just chalk the campus as planned and let them discover the drawings with no warning.  I can respect why he felt sending the email would be a more honorable thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in response, the Muslim students wrote back and said they understood why Chris and the AHA were responding that way, and while they don’t approve of the tactic, they acknowledge that students have a right to voice their opinions in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… I’m just kidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ahmed Fikri&lt;/strong&gt;, the MSA Vice President, wrote back to Chris to say that his group is pissed off that anyone would &lt;em&gt;dare&lt;/em&gt; offend their prophet and &lt;a href="http://wiscatheists.blogspot.com/2010/05/response-from-muslim-student.html"&gt;they’re preparing to defend the radical mindset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dear Chris Calvey,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the Vice President of the MSA and I will cut straight to the chase. Your apology is not accepted since your act is actually offensive…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to inform you that, as far as we understand, the event you are planning is illegal by the constitution of the University of Wisconsin (88-12 RACIST AND OTHER DISCRIMINATORY CONDUCT POLICY). Deviating from this law will offend not only the UW Muslim Students Association but the entire Muslim community on this campus and other organization of similar culture and faith. The Dean of Students shall be contacted immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I politely suggest that you cancel this event and prefer instead that we meet and discuss the issue respectfully before resorting to what we feel to be rather drastic measures. No offense, but giving less than 24 hours notice seems to betray ill intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I respect the fact you let us know about your plans beforehand but I also want to reiterate that we do not approve or agree with your highly offensive acts. I assure you that we believe in freedom of expression just as much as you purport to do.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing a stick figure with the word Muhammad is racist, discriminatory, and illegal?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about overreaction…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a stick figure drawing&lt;/strong&gt;.  Chill.  Out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose Chris could also draw images of Jesus, Buddha, Joseph Smith, and Krishna alongside Muhammad.  Hell, draw all the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Best_Friends"&gt;Super Best Friends&lt;/a&gt;.  But there’s no need to.  The Muslim students are the ones overreacting about someone else disobeying the laws of their faith.  You don’t see Jews getting this upset when other people eat pork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I doubt atheists would get angry if MSA students went around drawing images of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is precisely why I support drawing images of Muhammad&lt;/em&gt;.  It teaches the lesson that, in America, beliefs are allowed to be criticized.  More importantly, you don’t have a special right &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to get offended.  You don’t have to draw obscene, offensive drawings to make your point, either.  A simple drawing will accomplish the same goal — Chris knows that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the MSA wanted to have a debate about this act after the fact, I’m sure the AHA group would love to have one.  Let there be a free exchange of ideas.  Let there be a further discussion about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope Chris gets a positive response from all this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***Update***&lt;/strong&gt;: Chris met with the Associate Dean of Students earlier today and &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=118598444828025&amp;amp;ref=mf"&gt;reported this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We had a very productive and civil discussion. He stopped short of making a definitive statement about whether or not this event is in violation of any code of conduct – as the issues involved are complex and the outcome of the MSA’s complain is unpredictable. The event is still on.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ll get together tonight to do the chalking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://madridnt.blogspot.com/"&gt;Rebecca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for the link)&lt;br&gt;

Robert Dee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please do take a moment to visit his website.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Dee is a professional tennis player and, as such, one would expect his website to list his trophies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the trophies on Mr Dee's website are not from international tennis tournaments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, they are the apologies of newspapers in response to threatened libel claims.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In case this list disappears, I set it out below in full:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The BBC Apology &lt;br&gt;The BBC Damages &lt;br&gt;The Daily Mail Apology &lt;br&gt;The Sun Apology &lt;br&gt;Reuters Apology &lt;br&gt;Daily Star Apology &lt;br&gt;The Mirror Apology &lt;br&gt;The Independent Apology &lt;br&gt;Daily Express Apology &lt;br&gt;Washington Post Apology &lt;br&gt;Evening Standard Apology &lt;br&gt;Int Herald Tribune Apology &lt;br&gt;Fox Sports Apology &lt;br&gt;The Guardian Apology &lt;br&gt;Birmingham Mail Apology &lt;br&gt;Northern Echo Apology &lt;br&gt;NBC Sport Apology &lt;br&gt;Yahoo Sport Apology &lt;br&gt;Mail on Sunday Apology &lt;br&gt;AOL Sports Apology &lt;br&gt;The Scotsman Apology &lt;br&gt;ABC Apology &lt;br&gt;The Boston Globe Apology &lt;br&gt;ESPN Tennis Apology &lt;br&gt;STV Scotland Apology &lt;br&gt;Daily Record Apology &lt;br&gt;Yahoo Canada Apology &lt;br&gt;CCS Sport Group Apology &lt;br&gt;Yahoo Asia Apology &lt;br&gt;Comcast.Net Apology &lt;br&gt;DichMay Vietnam Apology &lt;br&gt;IFSC Online Dublin Apology &lt;br&gt;The Post Chronicle Apology &lt;br&gt;News Daily Apology &lt;br&gt;RecentNews.co.uk Apology &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You must agree that they are a quite incredible collection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But how was this haul achieved?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One can even imagine George Galloway and Uri Geller looking in awe at this fine young challenger for their defamation crowns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These trophies of Mr Dee are, it would seem, due to him not being quite as bad a tennis player as the newspapers suggested that he was.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Usually the newspapers alleged (wrongly) that he was the worst professional tennis player.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Of course, with a finite number of professional tennis players, someone must be the worst.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Dee took exception to these allegations and (presumably) backed with the threat of legal action, the newspapers offered an apology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Mr Dee actually did nothing wrong in seeking such redress because the state of English libel law meant he could do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nor do I really blame the newspapers for giving these apologies.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such a trivial issue is hardly worth using their scarce resources in fighting a libel battle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So look again at that list of apologies: these trophies of Mr Dee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This list is an index of just how bad English libel law has become.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And between this list of trophies at one extreme and the public health cases of Simon Singh, Peter Wilmshurst and Ben Goldacre at the other, there is the great mass of threatened and actual libel cases which distort on a daily basis the information to which the public have access.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually Mr Dee went after one trophy too far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Daily Telegraph stood firm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2010/924.html"&gt; rather wonderful judgment&lt;/a&gt;, Mrs Justice Sharp had to determine whether the following statement was defamatory:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"A BRITON ranked as the worst professional tennis player in the world after 54 defeats in a row has won his first match.Robert Dee, 21, of Bexley, Kent, did not win a single match during his first three years on the circuit, touring at an estimated cost of £200,000.But his dismal run ended at the Reus tournament near Barcelona as he beat an unranked 17-year-old, Arzhang Derakshani, 6-4, 6-3. Dee, below, lost in the second round."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do read the judgment in full.  It is an exhilarating document.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sadly, she had to conclude that such a statement was defamatory: that it could be the basis of a libel suit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such is the disgracefully low hurdle set by "defamatory meaning" in English libel law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(English libel law has still not recovered from its dismal and discrediting low point of &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1996/564.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Berkoff v Burchill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where it was held that calling an actor "hideously ugly" was capable of being defamatory and so a libel suit could be maintained.  Have a look at the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Berkoff&lt;/span&gt; judgment to see how appalling the majority are and how sensible Millet LJ was in the minority.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But having conceded that the passage was defamatory, Mrs Justice Sharp moved quickly to show that the meaning could be justified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Dee had indeed lost all those circuit matches: the other matches he had won were not those which were on the international circuit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So Mr Dee lost his first properly competitive case in the great libel tournament.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps Messrs Galloway and Geller can rest easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And all credit to the Telegraph group for taking this on.  No one would have cared had they just been another notch on Mr Dee's website.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For me, Mr Dee's case shows the ridiculous ease with which a libel case can be threatened.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What constitutes a defamatory statement is just so low, and a libel action can be brought without any proof of damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, please do admire Mr Dee's list of trophies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They tell us a great deal about the current substance and practice of English libel litigation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And have a think about who, in far less trivial circumstances, will have taken advantage of the awful state of English libel law to limit what you can read and hear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published; always use a name for ease of reference by other commenters.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-8348873695900019466?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272926859107"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-2138499628395611758">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/96c92b8789edd8e0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Matt McCormick debated Russell DiSilvestro on the Resurrection</title><published>2010-05-03T18:00:00Z</published><updated>2010-05-03T18:00:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/DkIdbwlyplk/matt-mccormick-debated-russell.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/2138499628395611758/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=2138499628395611758" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2010/05/matt-mccormick-debated-russell.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;See what you think.

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of the IJCSNS article includes, e.g., the following two claims: &lt;span style="color:#ff00ff"&gt;"The time-frequency analysis has been carried out using wavelet transforms for the divine sound OM. We have concluded that OM chanting affords steadiness in the mind scientifically.&lt;/span&gt;", and on the same lines "&lt;span style="color:#ff00ff"&gt;we have confirmed scientifically the accomplishments of OM chanting in reducing the stress from the human mind.&lt;/span&gt;" But in fact all that the article does is present wavelet analyses in pictorial form (like the one above), inviting the reader to spot the uniformity of the signal over time, and hence infer reduced stress and increased mental steadiness. There is no actual measure of psychological state other than the acoustic analysis of the ommm chants themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the acoustic analysis is ridiculously limited. Wavelets are used in signal processing and signal analysis, e.g. for compression, so the claim might have been made that better ommming was measurable by increased compression ratio. But no such claim is made. We just see pictures, and a hint that the ommm pictures of experienced chanters are steadier than those of less experienced chanters. As you gather from the conclusions I listed above, this is supposed to show that experienced ommmmers have reached a steadier mental state than less experienced ommmmers, but in fact all it shows, if anything, is that experienced ommmmers are better at ommmming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the pictures mean more to the enlightened than they do to me. The article is so bad that I can't see it as anything other than a spoof. And the premise is amusing enough. But I don't know enough about the IJCSNS article genre to really get the joke. If there is one. Maybe the journal in question simply has very low standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder whether the good journalists at the Guardian know whether they are reporting on a spoof or not?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Beaver</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272925347143"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2010/05/many_years_ago_when_fascist.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c1dad18adaac8011</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Narcissistic self-involvement"/><title type="html">Papers please</title><published>2010-05-03T22:30:17Z</published><updated>2010-05-03T22:30:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/LMl7IAIaUMQ/many_years_ago_when_fascist.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2010/05/many_years_ago_when_fascist.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, when fascist Jean-Marie Le Pen was riding a wave of racist sentiment in France, I was a young student out with friends on a perfect spring evening along the Seine.  There was at that time always a vigorous national police presence in Paris. The CRS with their sub-machine guns were visible outside government buildings and patrolling the streets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Racism was a palpable presence in Paris.  A popular deli, Jo Goldenberg's, had been bombed a few years earlier, and the nearby Holocaust museum had bullet holes in one of its glass walls.  One time when I tried to order coffee at a cafe, the waiter said, "Are you sure you don't want cous-cous?  You look like you want cous-cous."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on this spring night after final exams, all was well.  My classmates and I were eating something good---I can't for the life of me recall what---and drinking wine.  Lots of wine.  One of my friends drank far too much, and was obviously soused.  My friend John and I were holding her up, working on hailing her a cab, when a couple of well-armed CRS officers approached, pulled me aside, and demanded my papers.  They did not ask for anyone else's.  I gave them a photocopy of my passport and explained that I was an American student returning home in a few days, and not wanting to risk losing my passport I carried copies instead.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not the right answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John, who "looked" French, was still holding up our friend, but also starting to become alarmed by my encounter with the feds.  The officers asked me the same questions over and over, getting the same answers.  Then, they said, "you're talking funny...are you drunk?"  "No," I explained, "I'm American and just don't speak good French."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They slowly walked me further and further from my friends, when a cab finally came.  John got our friend in and came over to see what was going on.  In his much more fluent French he repeated everything I'd told the cops, and showed his papers, also a photocopy of his passport (that was sort of the standard for students at the time).  With his French looks, clear speech, and French last name, he was able to convince the CRS to let me go home.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I loved Paris, I was very happy to return home to the U.S., where we don't stop people in the street and demand their papers for looking a little bit swarthy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/LMl7IAIaUMQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272924502884"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchbloggingorgNews/~3/fkf7UZVuOJo/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/97f0bf8f11b7c4f4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">ResearchBlogCast #5: A mathematical model for ecological impact</title><published>2010-05-03T16:33:31Z</published><updated>2010-05-03T16:33:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/fC2nFeOrALc/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchbloggingorgNews/~3/fkf7UZVuOJo/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">There’s no denying that global warming will impose massive changes on the environment.

FBDD hinges on the fact that fragments, as opposed to complete ligands, are easier to optimize and study since they possess lesser molecular complexity and have fewer binding interactions.When fragments are optimized to bind to parts of a protein&amp;#39;s active site, they can gain powerful binding affinity by being linked together. Usually fragments are relatively weak binders, and connecting them with linkers can provide orders of magnitude improvements in the free energy of binding. The reason for this affinity increase is usually stated to be entropic. The rationale is that when two fragments are linked together, the entropic cost that they would have to pay were they to separately bind is already paid for by the linker. Thus the combined free energy is much more favorable than the pairwise free energy. The increase in free energy is quantified by a number called the &amp;quot;linking coefficient&amp;quot;, where a value of less than zeo indicates enhanced binding relative to the fragments.However, such an analysis assumes that the contribution to the binding process from other factors is minimal, and the entropic advantage is the only major player in the affinity increase game. But as with protein-ligand interactions, the picture is more complex. There can be unfavorable enthalpic contributions from the fragments losing favorable binding interactions upon being constrained by linkers. There can sometimes be favorable enthaplic interactions from new contacts between the ligand and protein. And there can be enthalpic and entropic contributions from the linker itself. Thus, dissecting the factors that go into the free energy upon fragment linking is like the classic conundrums of physical organic chemistry which I encountered in college, where controlled experiments are deviously hard, and changing one factor inevitably changes another (when does it not?).An ideal system for studying the contribution of entropy to FBDD would be a system of two fragments binding to a protein which can be linked together by a single bond and which retain all their existing contacts with the protein upon being linked. Such systems would admittedly be hard to design, but a group of Italian researchers has come up with a neat system linking two very simple fragments, a hydroxamic acid and a benzenesulfonamide, with a single bond. The fragments and resulting molecule inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), a key enzyme implicated in cancer and inflammation. The authors perform x-ray crystallographic and isothermal calorimetry (ITC) to investigate the thermodynamics and binding of the individual fragments and their linked counterpart to MMP. They demonstrate that the two fragments preserve their binding modes even when linked together and observe a rather large free energy enhancement of almost 4 kcal/mole on fragment linking. This is a nice case where a careful analysis and dismissal of other factors points accurately to entropy as the main contributor to enhanced binding of linked fragments.Borsi, V., Calderone, V., Fragai, M., Luchinat, C., &amp;amp; Sarti, N.

&lt;p&gt;In 1991, a 21-year-old Finnish computer science student named Linus Torvalds got annoyed. He had bought a personal computer to use at home, but he couldn’t find an operating system for it that was as robust as Unix, the system he used on the computers at the University of Helsinki. So he wrote one. He posted it online, free for anyone to download. But he required that anyone who figured out a way to make it better would have share the improvement with everyone else who used the system. Torvalds would later &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.11/linus_pr.html"&gt;tell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; that his motives were not noble. “I didn’t want the headache of trying to deal with parts of the operating system that I saw as the crap work,” he said. “I wanted help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his quest to avoid crap work, Torvalds unleashed a monster. People began to download the system, dubbed Linux, all over the world. Within a few weeks, Torvalds was getting emails from hundreds of users, explaining how to fix bugs and how to add new bells and whistles. People began to write programs that would only work on Linux computer. They founded companies around Linux-based software. Millions of people chose Linux for their computers, and major computer companies like Microsoft and Dell begn to support the system. Along the way, Linux evolved. Torvalds’s first version contained 10,000 lines of code. Linux now holds over 12 million lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those 12 million lines may seem like a hopeless thicket of code, but it actually has a hidden structure. It’s divided up into chunks, each of which carries out a particular task. All told, they carry out 12,391 separate functions. The functions are also connected. If Linux carries out one function, the system will direct the computer to carry out other functions. You can think of Linux as a network, with the functions joined together by links of control. Computer programmers can map out that network as a so-called “call graph.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux bears an uncanny resemblance to the genes in a living cell. Many genes make proteins that act as switches for other genes. The proteins clamp onto DNA near a target gene, allowing the cell to read the gene and make a new protein. And that new protein may, in turn, grab onto many other genes. Thanks to this hierarchy of switches, cells can respond to changes in their environment and quickly carry out complex behaviors, such as reorganizing themselves to feed on a new kind of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of scientists have begun to compare natural and manmade networks. A lot of the same rules appear to be at work in the growth of the Internet, airport connections, brain wiring, ecosystem food webs, and gene networks. But very often, scientists are finding, it’s the differences between natural and manmade networks that are most revealing, offering clues to the different ways in which people and evolution  build complex things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; this week, Koon-Kiu Yang of Yale and his colleagues present the first detailed comparison of Linux’s network to a gene network. (The paper will be &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0914771107"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) Thanks to the open-source nature of Linux, the scientists could look at every line of code in every version of the system over the past two decades, from Torvald’s first primitive stab to its current sophisticated form. And for a living cell, Yang and his colleagues turned to the living equivalent of Linux–a biological network they could analyze from top to bottom. They chose &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. coli, since it is the best-studied species on Earth. (Why &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;? There’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMicrocosm-coli-New-Science-Life%2Fdp%2F037542430X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1190687076%26sr%3D8-1&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325"&gt;a certain book&lt;/a&gt; that will explain it to you.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past fifty years, scientists have mapped 1,378 interactions among &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; genes. Out of that research, Yang and his colleagues built a microbial call graph. They assigned each gene to one of three categories. If a gene switched on one or more genes, but was not itself switched on by another gene, they called it a “master regulator.” If a gene was switched on by a different gene and then, in turn, switched on other genes, the scientists dubbed it a “middle manager.” And if the gene was switched on but did not then switch on any other genes, they called it a “workhorse.” The scientists drew the network of master regulators, middle managers, and workhorses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists sorted all the functions in Linux by the same rules. Here is the picture that emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/05/transcriptedit2.0011.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="transcriptedit2.001" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/05/transcriptedit2.0011.jpg" alt="transcriptedit2.001" width="600" height="438"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(N.B.: for the sake of clarity, the scientists only used 10% of the nodes in the full Linux call graph. But the complete picture would look the same.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Linux and &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; are organized into hierarchies. But their hierarchies have different shapes. &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;’s genome is dominated by workhorses. Middle-managers and master regulators make up less than 5% of the total number of genes. In Linux, by contrast, over 80% of the functions are in the upper echelons. Each workhorse in Linux is controlled to many middle managers. In &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, each workhorse gene is typically controlled either by a few genes or just one. And so in &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; it’s the higher levels where genes have the most links, not the workhorses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Yang and his colleagues had drawn the two networks, they looked at the paths information takes as it flows from master regulators down to workhorses. &lt;em&gt;E. coli’s &lt;/em&gt; genes are organized into relatively distinct modules. When a master regulator swings into action–in response, say, to a spike in temperature–it switches on a set of other genes with relatively little overlap with the genes switched on by other master regulators. Linux, by contrast, has blurry boundaries. Four out of five Linux modules overlap, in contrast to 5% of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The networks in &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; and Linux don’t just look different. They also grew in different ways as well. The oldest genes in &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;’s network–the ones shared by many other species of microbes–are its workhorses. The genes higher up in the &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; hierarchy have emerged more recently. Those higher-ranking genes have also been undergoing a lot of evolutionary change since they first emerged. The old genes, by contrast, have changed little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of Linux has played out differently. A lot of the oldest functions in Linux are middle managers or master regulators, not workhorses as in &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. And while old genes in &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; haven’t evolved much, programmers have heavily rewritten Linux’s old functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both networks developed, step by step, as increasingly sophisticated systems for operating things–computers or cells. But the Linux network was the work of programmers, while &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; is the product of four billion years of evolution. The differences in the history and shape of the two networks emerge from the ways in which they developed. The programmers who built Linux did not have the time to invent entirely new workhorse functions. It was simpler for them to just use the old workhorse functions in new modules. But this strategy leaves Linux a lot more fragile than a biological network. Its modules overlap, so that in many cases, a workhorse function is essential for many different modules at once. As a result, Linux gets buggy and prone to crashing. And so as programmers improve Linux, they’ve had to fine-tune its all-purpose functions at every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; is far more rugged. Mutations crop up all the time as the bacteria multiply, and yet they generally don’t suffer a catastrophic network crash. One reason &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; is so robust is that its modules have evolved to be distinct. Overlapping modules make cells particularly vulnerable to mutations, because a single mutation can shut down a lot of their essential biology. Natural selection favors organisms with a more rugged network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; is the product of evolution, rather than of programmers, parts of its genome have changed relatively little over billions of years. The oldest parts of the network are the workhorse genes–the ones that encode primitive proteins that do the fundamental work of life, like building new pieces of DNA. They can tolerate very little change. It’s much easier instead for &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; to evolve new ways of controlling those workhorses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of comparison is very new, and it’s not clear yet what scientists will find when they compare Linux to other genomes–particular to the genomes of more complex species like ourselves. &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; has only about 4300 genes. We have 20,000 protein-coding genes. A lot of those genes control other genes. Indeed, a typical human gene has a lot of switches, all of which have to be thrown in order for the gene to make a protein in a certain situation. The human genome is also packed with thousands of genes that don’t encode proteins, but which may encode RNA molecules that also switch genes on and off. Scientists just don’t know enough yet about the human genome to map its network the way they’ve mapped &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. But it’s possible that when they finally do, it will be a lot more top-heavy, with a lot more overlapping modules and multi-tasking workhorses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that turns out to be the case, biologists will have a new question to keep them busy for a long time to come: how did Linus get to be so much like Linux?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Am I a Former Smoker? Part 3&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is secondhand smoke really as dangerous as they say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury is still out, but I expect that the answer is no. At least, I have seen nothing that causes me to think that this particular kind of hand-wringing has merit. I am the first to agree that smoking cigarettes is dangerous to your health. On the other hand, while I cannot say with certainty, I strongly suspect that much of the hand-wringing about secondhand smoke is manipulative B.S. promoted by activists. It is aimed at exploiting our fears by frightening us into accepting mean-spirited and even draconian ordinances that make smokers’ lives a little more unpleasant, but do nothing for public health per se. It’s designed to get rid of smoking by pushing smokers into uncomfortable and even humiliating situations, battering down their absolute right to engage in an unhealthy but somehow very human activity that many find comforting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the ordinances that result from these efforts can &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt; be dangerous to smokers’ health. For example, requiring individuals to smoke 20 feet away from a public building in downtown Berkeley during a rainstorm borders on the sadistic, and the same mean-spirited ordinance will put you into the path of oncoming vehicular traffic even on sunny days?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activists are gaining ground. Hostility toward smokers and secondhand smoke is growing. I’ve seen duly-indoctrinated non-smoking pedestrians become agitated when they smell someone smoking on sidewalks, even to the point of waving their arms and issuing hateful drop-dead looks to the smoker. A few years ago I was having lunch at an outdoor restaurant, and after eating I stepped well outside the dining area and lit a cigarette. A woman seated at a table fifteen feet away complained indignantly to me that my smoke was getting into “her air.”So I moved away and said: “Sorry, I was unclear on where your air ends and mine begins.” Surely I can understand that non-smokers may not want to put up with my smoke wafting across their crème brûlée. But her ostentatious tone was unnecessary and rude. It showed that, as a smoker, my right to expect polite treatment has been compromised, and I should have to endure her hostility because I am a pariah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the result of the anti-smoking zealots’ mean-spirited effort to make the lives of smokers as miserable as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are smokers such easy targets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the answer to this one. They have no organization to speak of, they feel like pariahs because they are treated like pariahs, and finally, they have grown willing to silently accept the abuse that is leveled on them. As a former smoker, I think it’s a shame that smokers have been so beaten down that now they run, rather than stand up and fight for their rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do the zealots bully smokers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, too, is an easy one. Many in the public health community want to get rid of smoking because it has been determined that it is a (perhaps&lt;em&gt; the&lt;/em&gt;) primary cause of lung cancer – a nasty disease that is very expensive to treat. One can argue that this is a legitimate and even righteous goal. But is it possible to achieve it? My answer is no. What we have instead is a conflict in which the zealots, having largely won their battles with tobacco companies, have now turned their attention to individual smokers. They do this because they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do it (after wrapping themselves in motherhood and flag), because smokers don’t fight back, and because the activists are getting something from it. I leave it for you to speculate on &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what the subconscious payout is for these bullies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I find this indifference to the health of smokers like me to be shocking: What’s important to the zealots is their anti-smoking agenda, not my health or your health. Once I understood that, I found their lack of compassion in advancing their agenda to be chilling.&lt;/p&gt;

It was one of my usual off-the-cuff rants, full of piss and vinegar, and I promised to write the second part soon after. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then &lt;span&gt;MT4 &lt;/span&gt;happened and I couldn't log in and it was just all too much for a while, and I never got around to it--and the election is in three days' time so I can't really be arsed, to be frank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not to say I don't care about the election--I do, very deeply, and will be trotting off to the polling station early on Thursday morning to make my mark (not that it actually matters in Southwark, the safest flaming LibDem seat in the country--but that's not really the point). I also care about a number of issues, and having spent a few years in a foreign country paying taxes and whatnot and not being able to vote, I was not unsympathetic when Jenny mooted the idea of a Thames Tea Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we'd do, she said, was get a bunch of scientist friends who were working in the UK but who couldn't vote, and throw some tea into that great river of ours to remind people (a) how unfair things still are and (b) that, actually, science &lt;em&gt;depends&lt;/em&gt; on immigrants and maybe there should be some recognition of that fact. I would photograph the occasion for posterity, and we started drumming up support on twitter, with the hashtag #ThamesTeaParty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a whim I pinged &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/markgfh/"&gt;Mark Henderson&lt;/a&gt; at the Times, and he put me in touch with Judith Evans, who runs the &lt;a href="http://timesonline.typepad.com/election10/"&gt;Election blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it happened: a bunch of us turned up at Greenland Pier, Jenny handed out some tea leaves and we made a very, very weak cup of tea. Kat Brown at the Times really got behind the idea and &lt;a href="http://timesonline.typepad.com/election10/2010/05/boston-tea-party-thames-protester-say-give-foreign-nationals-vote.html"&gt;wrote it up&lt;/a&gt; on the Election Blog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fun afternoon; we all had a great laugh and a jolly little post-revolutionary barbecue afterwards. But it was a serious point--after wars have been fought over these things, why are people still disenfranchised (at local and national levels)? We're not talking about  economic refugees or any sort of undesirable here: these are professional scientists who work, pay taxes, own property--yet can not have a say in the democracy they live in. It's not just the UK being reactionary either; we at least allow Commonwealth citizens to vote in elections, although the arrangement is not reciprocal. And most graduate supervisors in the UK will encourage their charges to go to the US for at least their first post-doc, where they will face the same issue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We scientists are an itinerate lot, highly-trained and relatively well off (which means we pay a lot in taxes) but a great many of us have no representation at any level. You're not telling me that's not worth a pack of tea.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Richard P.

Given competition with other carnivores, prehistoric hyenas (like their living counterparts) would probably have disarticulated and transported parts of horses they killed. From Diedrich 2010.

In Hollywood films, there is nothing like an assemblage of bones strewn about a cave floor to testify to the power and voraciousness of a predator. Every skeleton is a testament to the hunting prowess of the carnivore, which causes even more alarm when the person who has stumbled into the cave realizes that they have just walked into a literal dead-end.

Although amplified for dramatic effect in the movies, this cinematic convention is based upon fact. Some mammalian carnivores do create bone assemblages in caves, and through the fossil record we know that they have been doing so for millions of years. In fact, the bone-collecting habits of carnivores have proven to be a boon for paleontologists, creating assemblages which not only represent the animals which lived in the area, but also provide clues as to the interactions between predator and prey during the distant past.

One such monument is Srbsko Chlum-Komin Cave in the Czech Republic. Discovered in 1942, this Upper Pleistocene site was once a spotted hyena den, and the activities of these predators caused many of the over 3,500 large mammal bones to become preserved at the site. Over 350 elements from hyena skeletons, bone-filled coprolites (fossil feces), and tooth-marked bones identify the cave as a place where the prehistoric hyenas took parts of their prey in order to consume them in relative peace, but, as explained by paleontologist Cajus Diedrich in Quaternary International, this assemblage is not quite like the other fossil hyena dens found elsewhere in Europe.

But this is one of the exceptions to my normal rule.  An amazing paper was published a few days ago in Science by Nancy Moran and Tyler Jarvik.  Lateral Transfer of Genes from Fungi Underlies Carotenoid Production in Aphids -- Moran and Jarvik 328 (5978): 624 -- ScienceI first found out about this from Ed Yong&amp;#39;s blog post here (just a note - his Not Exactly Rocket Science is such a frigging incredible blog).  He really does the whole story on this so I am just posting a bit here.Anyway Moran and Jarkiv paper focuses on genes in the aphid genome that encode enzymes for carotenoid synthesis.  These enzymes are involved in red and/or green coloring seen in the pea aphids.  Recently the pea aphid genome was sequenced (a paper about this was published in PLoS Biology ) and it was analysis of the genome data that helped lead Moran and Jarvik to the study reported in the recent issue of Science.In their study they report a detailed evolutionary and phylogenetic analysis of the carotenoid synthesis genes found in the aphid genome and show quite convincingly that these genes do not appear to be of &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; descent.  That is, they seem to have an ancestry separate from many of the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; animal genes in the genome.  Instead, these genes are related to genes from fungi.  In fact, these genes are embedded in an evolutionary sense, in a group of genes which are all from fungi and thus Moran and Jarvik conclude the most likely explanation is that some time in relatively recent pea aphid evolutionary history, these genes were acquired from some fungus. About to have some eye drops put in my eyes so gotta go for now, but just wanted to get something out there about this fascinating work. For more on this story - there is lots out there, such as the following:Aphid&amp;#39;s Color Comes From a Fungus GeneAphids Pilfered Red Genes from FungusPea Aphids Create Their Own Coloring, Study RevealsInsect stole fungus gene to make plant pigmentAnimals Can Get Genes From Other Species: ResearchAphids evolved special, surprising talents1 st pigment-making animal foundAphids make their own bright colorsMoran, N., &amp;amp; Jarvik, T.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1: Chronic Lyme Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So-called "chronic Lyme disease" (CLD) is a diverse constellation of symptoms which are often attributed to Lyme disease, but without objective evidence of infection with the organism that causes Lyme disease.  Patient advocacy have been very active in insisting that reality conform to their beliefs, going so far as&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/05/connecticut_attorney_general_p.php"&gt; convincing the Connecticut Attorney General to investigate&lt;/a&gt; the Infectious Disease Society of America.  As part of an agreement to get the AG to stop this foolishness,&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/05/lyme_disease---who_is_credible.php"&gt; the IDSA agreed to review its guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, without any guarantee of changing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.idsociety.org/Content.aspx?id=16556"&gt;Their review is now complete&lt;/a&gt;, and they have decided against any changes.  The heart of the AG's investigation was an allegation that the IDSA had too many conflicts of interest.  In order to allay some of these concerns (foolishly, in my opinion, as that is akin to trying to tell the Pope not to believe in God), an outside ethicist was brought in who reviewed the panel for conflicts of interest, and found none.  According to the IDSA statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Review Panel concurred that all of the recommendations from the 2006 guidelines are medically and scientifically justified in light of the evidence and information provided, including the recommendations that are most contentious: that there is no convincing evidence for the existence of chronic Lyme infection; and that long-term antibiotic treatment of "chronic Lyme disease" is unproven and unwarranted. Inappropriate use of antibiotics (especially given intravenously) has been shown to lead to deadly blood infections, serious drug reactions and C. difficile diarrhea, as well as the creation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria or "superbugs."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that settles that, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2: "Morgellons" syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So-called&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/03/morgellons_scratchpad.php"&gt; morgellons syndrome&lt;/a&gt; is a term coined by someone who felt she had unexplained skin rashes and strange fibers in her skin.  Over the last couple of years, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/05/raise_your_hand_if_you_just_do.php"&gt;a loose group of people and one or two scientists &lt;/a&gt;have come together to try to find the cause of their suffering.  They have managed to &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/unexplaineddermopathy/investigation.html"&gt;enlist the CDC in an investigation&lt;/a&gt; in an investigation which is still ongoing, but given the history of similar claims, if the CDC does not find an explanation to their liking, the conspiracy theories will make chem-trails and UFOs look rational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that's your update.  Enjoy the discussion which is sure to erupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/-vcnC9CMSMg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272913341335"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4950">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ef17355c45c8ed2d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Chiropractic"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">Pediatric Chiropractic Care: Scientifically Indefensible?</title><published>2010-05-03T18:30:44Z</published><updated>2010-05-03T18:30:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4950" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a paper published in 2008, two academic chiropractors offered this observation: “The health claims made by chiropractors with respect to the application of manipulation as a health care intervention for pediatric health conditions continue to be supported by only low levels of scientific evidence. Chiropractors continue to treat a wide variety of pediatric health conditions.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite lack of support by the medical and scientific community, chiropractic treatment of children is growing in popularity, and more chiropractors are specializing in “chiropractic pediatrics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Chiropractic Association offers a post-graduate “Diplomate in Clinical Chiropractic Pediatrics” (DICCP) and publishes a “peer reviewed” &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Chiropractic Pediatrics. &lt;/em&gt;The diplomate syllabus is a 30-module, 360+ hours classroom course during weekends over a three-year period. There is no hospital training and no contact with diseased or injured children — only a “mandatory observational/training weekend at a chiropractic center for special needs children under multi-disciplinary care.”&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; A post-graduate certification in chiropractic pediatrics (CICCP) can be earned after 180 hours of classroom instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a June 2008 joint press release, the American Chiropractic Association’s (ACA) Council on Chiropractic Pediatrics and the Council on Chiropractic Pediatrics of the International Chiropractors Association (ICA) announced that the ICA’s Diplomate in Clinical Chiropractic Pediatrics (DICCP) is now recognized by the ACA and its council as the official credential for specialization in chiropractic pediatrics.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noting increasing public support for chiropractic treatment of children, a January 2009 press release from the American Chiropractic Association made this announcement: “Survey data indicates that the percentage of chiropractic patients under 17 years of age has increased at least 8.5 percent since 1991.…Studies are beginning to show that chiropractic can help children not only with typical back and neck pain complaints, but also with issues as varied as asthma, chronic ear infections, nursing difficulties, colic and bedwetting.”&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trend toward greater utilization of chiropractic by children has not gone unnoticed by the medical profession. An article in the January 2007 issue of &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics &lt;/em&gt;(the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics) described chiropractic as the most common complementary and alternative medicine practice used by children, who made an estimated 30 million visits to US chiropractors in 1997.&lt;sup&gt;5 &lt;/sup&gt;In 1998, children and adolescents constituted 11% of patient visits to chiropractors.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promoting a broad scope of practice for pediatric chiropractors, the ICA Council on Chiropractic Pediatrics offers links to abstracts from chiropractic journals that support chiropractic treatment for a great variety of a childhood ailments.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Chiropractors commonly claim to have an effective treatment for otitis media, asthma, allergies, infantile colic, and enuresis. While many of the pediatric conditions treated by chiropractors are self limiting, treatment is offered for such serious conditions as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, myasthenia gravis, ADHD, and Tourette syndrome. For the most part, treatment for all these conditions is based upon detection and correction of “vertebral subluxations.” An article titled “The Child Patient: A Matrix for Chiropractic Care” in a 2005 edition of the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Chiropractic Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;, for example, stated: “Any alteration in form or function in the child may signal the presence of subluxation, and the subluxation may in turn alter the physiology of the child.”&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; For wellness and prevention reasons, parents are advised that children should visit a chiropractor 6 to12 times a year to be checked for subluxations.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2009 survey of chiropractors and parents of chiropractic pediatric patients, conducted by the International Chiropractic Pediatric Association, revealed that “The indicated primary reason for chiropractic care of children was ‘wellness care’.”&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Such care would require manipulating the spines of healthy children for “subluxation correction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no credible evidence to support the contention that “subluxation correction” will restore or maintain health or that such subluxations even exist.&lt;sup&gt;10,11,12&lt;/sup&gt; There are hundreds of subluxation-based studies published in chiropractic journals supporting chiropractic treatment for children but only a few studies disputing such treatment. I suspect that most medical researchers feel that claims based on the chiropractic vertebral subluxation theory are too implausible to warrant investigation. But such claims should not go unchallenged, especially when they involve treatment of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top:2em"&gt;Evidence Fails to Support Chiropractic Treatment of Childhood Ailments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, legitimate properly-controlled studies have failed to support the claims of chiropractors who treat children for organic ailments. In the case of asthma, for example, a randomized, controlled trial of chiropractic spinal manipulation for children with mild or moderate asthma, published in a 1998 issue of &lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine,&lt;/em&gt; revealed that “the addition of chiropractic spinal manipulation to usual medical care provided no benefit.”&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; A randomized, controlled trial of infantile colic treated with chiropractic spinal manipulation, published in a 2001 issue of &lt;em&gt;Archives of Diseases in Childhood, &lt;/em&gt;concluded that “Chiropractic spinal manipulation is no more effective than placebo in the treatment of infantile colic.”&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; A recent systematic review of randomized clinical trials offered this conclusion: “There is no good evidence to show that spinal manipulation is effective for infant colic.”&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that use of osteopathic manipulative techniques as an adjuvant therapy in routine pediatric care of recurrent acute otitis media might have potential benefit by affecting the patency of the auditory tube.&lt;sup&gt;16 &lt;/sup&gt;Chiropractors who manipulate a child’s neck in a misguided attempt to correct “subluxations” might provide some symptomatic relief for secretory otitis media by inadvertently stretching the Eustachian tube, facilitating drainage of fluids from the middle ear. But the risk of such treatment outweighs any possible benefit. (Although otitis media is normally self limiting, it should be kept under observation by a pediatrician who can prescribe antibiotics, if needed, when there is acute otitis media with bacterial infection. Otitis media commonly occurs in children under 3 years of age. As the child grows older, changes in the length and angle of the Eustachian tube reduce chances of bacteria or virus traveling from the throat to the middle ear.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the implausibility of the chiropractic vertebral subluxation theory and the training chiropractors receive, there is good reason to question the ability of chiropractors to diagnose and treat childhood ailments. A correct diagnosis notwithstanding, there is no evidence to support the belief that manipulating the spine of a child to correct “vertebral subluxations” would be appropriate treatment for anything. A 1993 risk/benefit analysis of spinal manipulative therapy for relief of lumbar or cervical pain, published in &lt;em&gt;Online Neurosurgery, &lt;/em&gt;advised neurosurgeons that “Potential complications and unknown benefits indicate that SMT [spinal manipulative therapy] should not be used in the pediatric population.”&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the damage that manipulation might do to cartilaginous growth centers, there is no known justification for using spinal manipulation on an infant or a pre-adolescent child. Yet, some chiropractors recommend that the spine of a newborn baby be adjusted at birth to correct “subluxations.” According to the ICA (International Chiropractic Association) Council on Chiropractic Pediatrics, “Chiropractic care can never start too early.”&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, pediatricians think of a child as being under 18 years of age — before vertebral end plate growth is completed. In a child under the age of 8 to 10 years, the cartilaginous growth centers are too immature and too vulnerable to injury to be subjected to spinal manipulation. There is some speculation that injury to growth plates might result in spinal deformity (such as scoliosis or Scheuermann’s kyphosis) as growth progresses.&lt;sup&gt;19 &lt;/sup&gt;Such injury may not be detectable. “The incidence of subtle growth plate fractures following high-velocity [manipulation] techniques in children is surely under-appreciated because of the occult nature of these injuries.”&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under normal circumstances, it seems unlikely that the cartilaginous, flexible spine of a healthy child would be as easily injured as an adult spine that has been weakened by degenerative changes. Referred pain caused by organic disease is not commonly experienced by children. When back pain in a child does occur, it is potentially more serious than back pain in an adult and should always be brought to the attention of a board-certified pediatrician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinal manipulation has the potential to injure the spine of a child. A systematic review of 13 studies published up to June 2004 uncovered 14 significant manipulation-related injuries in children up to18 years of age, 9 of which were serious (e.g., subarachnoidal hemorrhage, paraplegia) and 2 of which were fatal (one child died from a brain hemorrhage and another from dislocation of the atlas following neck manipulation). Ten of the injuries were attributed to manipulation done by chiropractors, 1 to manipulation by a physiotherapist, and 1 to manipulation by a medical doctor; 2 injuries were caused by unspecified providers of manipulation. In 20 cases of harm caused by delayed diagnosis as a result of using manipulation, 7 involved a delayed diagnosis of cancer; 2 children died because of delayed treatment for meningitis.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; The incidence of spinal injuries in children is reported to be 2 to 5% of all spine injuries.&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top:2em"&gt;Dubious Methods Used to “Detect and Correct” Pediatric “Subluxations”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High velocity, low amplitude thrusting, commonly used by chiropractors, is usually the type of manipulation that injures a child’s spine. Most chiropractors who manipulate an infant’s spine may simply use light thumb pressure to “adjust” an allegedly misaligned vertebra, thus reducing possibility of injury. Gentle touch may have a calming affect on an infant. But any manipulative technique applied to the neck of an infant is unnecessary and potentially dangerous. Some chiropractors may use a spring-loaded stylus or an electrically-powered mallet in an attempt to tap vertebrae into alignment. Chiropractors who adjust newborn babies to correct “subluxations” may concentrate on the upper cervical (neck) area of the spine. The upper neck is more likely to be injured by delivery during birth and is most vulnerable to injury caused by manipulation. Pediatricians have observed that “The most common traumatically injured region of the immature spine is the first and second cervical vertebrae.”&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no credible evidence that chiropractors are able to find “subluxations” in the spine of an infant. It seems unlikely that a chiropractor could detect vertebral misalignment by palpating the flexible, cartilaginous spine of an infant through a thick layer of baby fat. I have always suspected that chiropractors who say they can use their fingertips to feel subluxations in a baby’s spine are either deceiving themselves or misinterpreting what they are feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some chiropractors use surface electromyography, thermography, leg-length checks, or some other questionable device or approach to locate subluxations. It goes without saying that chiropractors should not expose a child to unnecessary radiation by x-raying his or her spine in a search for elusive or nonexistent “subluxations.” In Canada, the Alberta Society of Radiology has recommended that radiologists refuse requests from chiropractors who ask for diagnostic imaging of any type involving children aged 18 years or younger.&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the claims made by chiropractors, I regard the claims made by those who treat children to be the most problematic. I have always advised against manipulating the spine of a small child or a newborn baby for any reason. Manipulation of the spine of an adolescent child under the age of 18, no matter who does it, should be done in concert with an evaluation and a diagnosis provided by an orthopedist, preferably a pediatric orthopedic specialist. Caring for children is very different from caring for adults and requires a special expertise. Board-certified medical and osteopathic pediatricians are best qualified to provide or recommend appropriate care based on a correct diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top:2em"&gt;Drawing the Line on Chiropractic Treatment of Children&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although spinal manipulation is often recommended as a treatment for back pain, this recommendation does not often apply to children. When the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published a Clinical Practice Guideline suggesting that spinal manipulation can be helpful for patients with acute low-back problems without radiculopathy (sciatic pain) when used within the first month of symptoms, the report included this statement: “The recommendations included in the guideline may not apply to persons younger than 18 years since diagnostic and treatment considerations for this group are often different than for adults.”&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; An adolescent child might benefit from appropriate manipulation designed to relieve symptoms caused by uncomplicated, mechanical-type back problems. But use of chiropractic “spinal adjustments” for “subluxation correction” may delay appropriate treatment based on a correct diagnosis — and the younger the child the greater the chances of misdiagnosis or injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some chiropractors believe that adjusting a child’s spine will stimulate the immune system and help prevent infection. On September 8, 2009, for example, the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Pediatric, Maternal and Family Health — Chiropractic&lt;/em&gt; issued a press release titled “Chiropractic Part of Swine Flu Prevention Program in Children.” The editor of the journal recommended that all children should be checked for vertebral subluxations before and during the flu season. “Since the nervous system has a direct effect on the immune system and because the spine houses and protects so much of the nerve system it is important to have your child’s spine checked for any interference.”&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such alarming and unscientific views find support in the basic definition of chiropractic and in official chiropractic publications. The National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE), for example, advises that “Psychoneuroimmunology has revealed an interrelationship between the central nervous system and immunity (consistent with chiropractic philosophy)….By manually manipulating vertebrae into their normal physiological relationship, chiropractic practitioners relieve interference with the nervous system along with accompanying symptoms.” Regarding treatment of children, the NBCE advises that “Chiropractic management of childhood disorders primarily consists of adjusting concomitant spinal subluxations and providing specific nutritional advice and/or support and other palliative measures.”&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things considered, it is an understatement to say that “Pediatric chiropractic care is often inconsistent with recommended medical guidelines.”&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;em&gt;Recommendation of any complementary alternative medicine therapy that has a risk/benefit ratio that is not acceptable and is not supported in medical literature may make a referring physician liable for negligence if the referral causes harm by delaying necessary conventional treatment&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know of any reason to believe that it might be necessary to refer a child to a pediatric chiropractor or to use spinal manipulation on a child prior to onset of adolescence. “Wellness care” in the form of “subluxation correction” is unnecessary and scientifically indefensible, and it places children at risk. &lt;/p&gt;

In the last few years a significant amount of research has been published on methamphetamine psychosis. Methamphetamine can produce a psychotic state characterized by paranoia, agitation and behavioral problems.  Not all individuals appear to experience this induced state.  This leads to the question of what factors might be related to the risk of psychosis in those using methamphetamine.  Certain dose and duration of methamphetamine exposure play a role in psychosis.  But other individual risk factors are likely to be present. Japanese researchers lead the way in looking for genetic risk for methamphetamine psychosis.  Methamphetamine abuse is a serious problem in Japan leading to a significant number of subjects for study.Beyond the importance of methamphetamine psychosis is the question of pathways to schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.  Studying methamphetamine psychosis may provide valuable clues to the genetic mechanisms involved in schizophrenia.Methamphetamine causes a surge in the release of brain dopamine.  It is logical to look for variation in dopamine receptor genetics to explore the mechanism of methamphetamine psychosis.  A recent study found genetic variants of the dopamine 2 receptor (DRD2).  The key findings from this research were:Both protective and risk gene variants for rapid methamphetamine psychosis were identifiedThese genes were tied to prognosis--poor prognosis was noted by psychosis extending for greater than 1 months and limited response to antipsychotic treatment. The A1/A1 homozygote of DRD2 provided a protective effect for psychosisThe genotype of -141C Del positive increased risk for rapid onset of methamphetamine psychosisGlutamate and serotonin receptor gene status also are promising models of methamphetamine psychosis risk.  Another Japanese group examined the role of two genes, GRM2 (glutamate receptor 2) and HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) in both methamphetamine psychosis and schizophrenia in a general population.  Here is a synopsis of the key methods in the study:Case-control study design738 schizophrenia patients, 196 methampetamine psychosis patients and 802 controlsSingle nucleotide (SNP) for GRM2 and HTR2A selected for association analysisThe study found a statistically significant association between GRM2 receptor status and methamphetamine-induced psychosis.  No such association was found in the schizophrenia group.  No association with HTR2A gene status and methamphetamine psychosis or schizophrenia was found.Look for future studies that use methamphetamine psychosis as a model for understanding the psychosis of schizophrenia.  This may prove to be a key strategy for understanding new drug development for schizophrenia and other forms of chronic psychosis.

&lt;p&gt;This was a really enjoyable one, because it’s been quite some time (…at least since 2006, by my reckoning…) that I’ve been interested in just how the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org"&gt;James Randi Educational Foundation&lt;/a&gt; works on the ‘Education’ part in their name. So, to hear that they have a new person in and some of the projects they have in mind was fantastic. Thanks very much to Michael Blanford for making the time in his very busy schedule to answer some rather tough questions on my part!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, there is no conspiracy about the number of ‘Michael’s’ I feature on the show, it’s just one of those things. :p&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, people should be considering contributing to the &lt;a href="http://www.shethought.com"&gt;SheThought site&lt;/a&gt;, since I know a few have been following my links to the essay by &lt;a href="http://shethought.com/2010/04/30/the-rise-of-the-placebo-protest/"&gt;Michael McRae about the ‘Placebo Protest&lt;/a&gt;‘. That site is open to contributors and you don’t (as you might have guessed) need to actually be female to send something in.&lt;/p&gt;

So naturally there was a packed house at the Hammer Museum on April 22 to hear a talk called "Beautiful Tools" by artist/scientist John Underkoffler of Oblong Industries -- part of a series of lectures sponsored by 5D on the future of immersive design. Underkoffler (who is an advisory board member of the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/"&gt;Science &amp;amp; Entertainment Exchange&lt;/a&gt;) consulted on &lt;em&gt;Minority Report&lt;/em&gt;, and drew on some of his own groundbreaking research at MIT while doing so. (He's also consulted on &lt;em&gt;The Hulk, Aeon Flux, Stranger Than Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Iron Man&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://5dconference.com/"&gt;5D conference&lt;/a&gt; "explores the profound impact of the convergence of art and science across all narrative media: film, game, animation and architecture," and the organization sponsors an ongoing lecture series to particularly explore the new emerging relationship "between artists and scientists, designers and engineers, and the pervasive effect of this new collaboration not only on design and science process but as a fundamental change in the relationship between artifact and audience." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Underkoffler opened with a still of the very first Apple computer introduced in 1979, at a time when the "computer" was all about creativity, or "making stuff." You had to program in everything; there were no handy operating systems or cute little icons, no mouse, no "drag and drop" feature, and so forth. Fast forward to 2010, and we have ingenious handled deices like the iPod and the iPad -- which are impressive pieces of industrial design but are essentially about media consumption. Underkoffler thinks it was the Web that changed things: "stuff is no longer just on your computer, it's distributed, on a server, within cloud computing."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He prefers to view the machine as an extension of the human: "a gift, an act of generosity, and an aesthetics of agency, if you will." His vision was to build "a distinct ecosystem in which devices work as digital exoskeletons: amplifiers for human creative intent... to aid in making, in building, in design." If you're Underkoffler, and you're at MIT, you start with a simple light bulb. It's a useful medium with no particular "message," but turn on a light and it enables us to work in the dark, for instance.  Underkoffler decided to take this one-way illumination and transform it into a two-way conduit of information. Per &lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/underkoffler.html"&gt;this Website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://twistedphysics.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c9c1053ef013480247c70970c-pi" style="float:right"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ill-hands" src="http://twistedphysics.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c9c1053ef013480247c70970c-320wi" style="margin:0px 0px 5px 5px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The I/O Bulb is based on a traditional light bulb but is able to not only project light, but also collect live video of the objects and surfaces it projects light onto. The Luminous Room may then be used as an optics simulator for a variety of purposes; Underkoffler sees the I/O Bulb as having applications for urban planning and architectural modeling, where planners and designers would be able to observe light patterns and reflections resulting from various arrangements of structures and buildings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While working on his PhD, Underkoffler also designed a gestural interface system (now known as G-Speak), which allows users to navigate and interact with data by interpreting a user's motion so the user move through datasets with no need for a computer mouse or any other physical object to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hollywood art director Alex McDowell (also an Exchange board member) heard about his work, and asked Underkoffler to consult on &lt;em&gt;Minority Report&lt;/em&gt; to help director Steven Spielberh create a believable world 50 years into the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most notably, the filmmakers decided to use Underkoffler's work on the gestural interface system to build a forensic analysis display. They needed a cool new technology to help Cruise's character sift through all the images collected from the "pre-cogs" and match them to information on file within their massive database. It would all be showcased on a gigantic curved display, using their hands to "conduct" the information  -- with no voice technology, no keyboards, and no mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on his prior work, Underkoffler literally invented a sign language for the film, drawing on bona fide sign language for the deaf, SWAT signals, and musical systems to synthesize into a new language. The actors had to study the "thesaurus" of gestures and practice them using training videos. When they put it all together -- Lights! Camera! Action! -- it looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/NwVBzx0LMNQ%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's almost performance art. With G-Speak, "Physicality comes back into computing space," said Underkoffler. "We built a real program with real language and trained real people to use it -- even though it was fictional." Oblong has since built a prototype G-Speak system: a new machine that can be used to design rather than just tedious tasks like file management, with an operating system that is not predicated on the use of a mouse. Even better, more than one user can collaborate in the virtual space at a time: it's no longer just "one user, one screen." Check out this video of Underkoffler and colleagues working their magic with the real-world G-Speak:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/dyMVZqJk8s4%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;height=385" width="640" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The tools' form ensures that acts of construction are often indistinguishable from acts of exhibition. Inherently, working means performing, whether anyone is watching or not," says Underkoffler. ""And underlying it all is a digital architecture that acknowledges space -- the real-world geometry that structures the rest of existence -- for the first time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ideally, the Hollywood/science interaction should benefit both the entertainment and research communities, and Underkoffler's work is a prime example of that. His research informed &lt;em&gt;Minority Report&lt;/em&gt;, which in turn inspired him to develop his rudimentary system into a viable real-world prototype. And we have no doubt whatever he's working on now will end up informing another film at some point in the future.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-1005877316585714743?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

All that noise can be annoying, but researchers have found that prolonged exposure to many of those sounds can cause permanent hearing loss. Even if you’re not going to loud concerts like you did when you were younger, you could still be exposed to sounds loud enough to hurt your ears. Do you know how loud is too loud?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The answer to &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/daily-health-quiz-how-much-sun-exposure-do-you-need-to-get-enough-vitamin-d/"&gt;Monday’s health quiz&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;How much sun exposure do you need to get enough vitamin D? According to the &lt;a href="http://health.nih.gov/"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, most adults can get sufficient Vitamin D from 5-30 minutes of sun exposure on the hands, feet, and body twice a week. That’s a total of 10-60 minutes per week. Just over half of our readers answered correctly, and most though you should get even less sun exposure. Glad you’re keeping your sunscreen on, just make sure to get enough vitamin D!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Jelka Crnobrnja-Isailovic from the University of Belgrade, Serbia, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Jela pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Jela%20pic.jpg" width="336" height="448" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;I was born and I live in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade" title=""&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;, a very unique old city in Southeastern Europe. It is  now the capital of the Republic of Serbia. My origins are in the Balkan peninsula (former Yugoslavia), which is one of three important biodiversity refuges of Europe and a famous gene-flow route from east to west, north to south and vice versa.  Wonderful diversity of natural and cultural heritage but lot of hard times. So, my professional interest for biodiversity and, unofficially, cultural diversity conservation dates back from my early childhood. I also used to spend a lot of time in virtual space of myths and fairy tales of the world and it turned me into a real, complete cosmopolitan. Now, in many places in the world I really feel at home and do not like borders at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fascination with wilderness, especially snakes, dates back to the time when I was about five years old. Apart from that, I was also very devoted to music and painting, later writing and photography. Thanks to my father, an academic musician, I became familiar with the best of classical music before entering primary school. So, speaking about formal education, it was difficult to choose between journalism, art and science. But, adventurous nature combined with restricted contact with the real wilderness because my parents were very scared of everything (and family opinion was that „girls should play with dolls"), finally directed me to biology. I was formally trained as evolutionary biologist (PhD) with origins in population biology and herpetology (graduate studies). Once I had discovered conservation biology, some 20 years ago, it became my leading star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were almost no chances for young scientists in Serbia to design independent projects before obtaining PhD, what I did in 1997. But, even after that, system was pretty rigid, until beginning of XXI Century. So, I started with first independent project in 2002, focused on evolution of life history traits in some amphibian and reptile species with the idea to apply non-invasive procedures for collecting data and to establish long term monitoring of particular populations for their conservation. Before that, I was mostly oriented toward population genetics and multivariate morphology. In 2003 I won two small grants - that was an amazing feeling after so many years of isolation: &lt;a href="http://www.seh-herpetology.org/" title=""&gt;Societas Europaea Herpetologica&lt;/a&gt; Grant for pilot study on endangered European viper species &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipera_ursinii" title=""&gt;Vipera ursinii&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;  in Montenegro and &lt;a href="http://ice.ucdavis.edu/project/daptf" title=""&gt;DAPTF&lt;/a&gt; Seed Grant for assessment of  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Crested_Newt" title=""&gt;Great Crested Newt&lt;/a&gt; breeding sites in Serbia. Monitoring of that particular &lt;i&gt;Vipera ursinii&lt;/i&gt; population is still in progress and the goal is to establish and maintain good database upon which population status could be regularly checked in the future. I think that I am right when I say that it is the first long term population monitoring of a reptile species in this part of the Balkans, if not in the whole area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with a teaching job some years ago when I realized that it is pretty masochistic trying to stay 100% employed in science in Serbia, especially if you are out of local politics and trying to work honestly in ecology and biodiversity protection. Nowadays, even work with students takes a lot of my time. I am dividing my time between science and teaching at the university. I am teaching Organic Evolution and Conservation Biology at different levels -undergraduate and graduate at Faculty of Sciences and Mathematics at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Ni%C5%A1" title=""&gt;University of Nis&lt;/a&gt;, and some aspects of conservation biology on PhD studies at the &lt;a href="http://www.bg.ac.rs/eng/memb/facult/mathem/en_bioloski.php" title=""&gt;Biology Faculty at the University of  Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;. Apart from that, I am devoted to cooperation with &lt;a href="http://www.iucn.org/" title=""&gt;IUCN&lt;/a&gt; as a member of Amphibian Specialist Group and Red List Assessor Team. Also, I am currently involved in making Strategy of Biodiversity Conservation in Serbia as a member of an &lt;a href="http://www.undp.org/" title=""&gt;UNDP&lt;/a&gt; expert team and I would like to take part in changing the system there in a way that young people, trained well during their biology and ecology studies, after reaching graduate level, have real opportunity for jobs in biodiversity conservation. I recognize in my students very strong will to work in biodiversity conservation but most of them, after graduating, must accept completely different jobs for a living or they cannot find job at all, and in the same time there is no continuous biodiversity monitoring in Serbia in local communities at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would like to complete just one but really good conservation study and think that maybe for that I should move somewhere else where society really appreciates and understands it. And I hope that it will happen. Somewhere in the world, does not matter where, biodiversity is valuable to be protected everywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised when I realized how much you people in the States are using internet facilities for communication and really want to ask you: do you have time for communication with your family members on the daily basis if, after working hours (and I suppose that your working day lasts at least eight hours), you still have enough energy for blogging? It is really amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both me and most of my colleagues, simple and fast access to literature is very important. In comparison to the situation some 20 years ago it is better now for sure. Good thing is that Open Access idea is spreading inevitably across the Globe. It is very important to have free access to scientific literature, especially for students and free lancers in science, who have no funds to pay subscriptions to journal editors and libraries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science blogs are very interesting but, as I mentioned before, I have no time at the moment to engage myself there as much as I would like to. I am using Facebook for networking with students and colleagues and relatives and friends but have no time to visit it often. Generally, in these days when we face a lot of obstacles such as  global economic crisis for example, it is wonderful that there is an alternative for exchange of information; for example, I recently participated in online training  organized by IUCN, instead of classical workshop that could cost a lot. Opportunities for cooperation are easier with these new tools and it is good that, using them, you can add some personal dimension to communication, to show to others what are your hobbies, which music do you like, it is important for us as social creatures.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs? What are some of your favorites? Have you discovered any cool &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Participants_Blogroll/" title=""&gt;science blogs by the participants&lt;/a&gt; at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first science blog I started to read was A Blog Around The Clock. The title was intriguing; it reminded me of famous "Rock around the Clock" so I took a look in order to find there some nostalgic rock stories from the 60ies. But it was a surprise - and nice surprise I can say - the story was about the science. And, I must confess that my consequent diving into the blog world used to begin from the "Blog Around The Clock" platform.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first Science Online conference, but not the last, I hope. Diversity of attendants was amazing, looking at their professional backgrounds. The strongest feelings were provoked by all these brave women and men that continue to fight against mediocrity in science. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea about &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/The_Importance_of_Meatspace/" title=""&gt;meeting places or science motels where freelance scientists &lt;/a&gt;could  have opportunity to realize their projects is absolutely fabulous, though its realization couldn't be easy and we discussed a little bit about that at the end of the session. Anyway, it is clear that new organizational patterns for doing science are inevitable, and some modular way of organization seems very realistic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to see you again and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/scienceonline2010_-_interview_39.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/ReOkLo7aC7o" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272903060352"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=33843">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ed7a6e6bd99911d8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="environment"/><category term="nuclear energy"/><category term="oil"/><title type="html">Will the Gulf Oil Spill Be This Generation's Three Mile Island?</title><published>2010-05-03T15:00:05Z</published><updated>2010-05-03T15:00:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/RF2S54yOdLk/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/will-the-gulf-oil-spill-be-this-generations-three-mile-island/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Is it the end for offshore drilling?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/RF2S54yOdLk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By STEPHEN J.

What really makes it sound worth reading, though, is a &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Science-Warriors-Ego-Trips/65186/"&gt;review by Carlin Romano&lt;/a&gt; that pans it, Pigliucci, and a whole great legion of scientists irritated with the public endorsement of nonsense: Romano complains that we're on "ego trips." Why? Because Pigliucci expresses such strong certainty about the conclusions of science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the heart of the review. It's a lot of aggravating piss-pottery about &lt;i&gt;tone&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigliucci offers more hero sandwiches spiced with derision and certainty. Media coverage of science is "characterized by allegedly serious journalists who behave like comedians." Commenting on the highly publicized Dover, Pa., court case in which U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III ruled that intelligent-design theory is not science, Pigliucci labels the need for that judgment a "bizarre" consequence of the local school board's "inane" resolution. Noting the complaint of intelligent-design advocate William Buckingham that an approved science textbook didn't give creationism a fair shake, Pigliucci writes, "This is like complaining that a textbook in astronomy is too focused on the Copernican theory of the structure of the solar system and unfairly neglects the possibility that the Flying Spaghetti Monster is really pulling each planet's strings, unseen by the deluded scientists."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Is it really? Or is it possible that the alternate view unfairly neglected could be more like that of Harvard scientist Owen Gingerich, who contends in God's Universe (Harvard University Press, 2006) that it is partly statistical arguments--the extraordinary unlikelihood eons ago of the physical conditions necessary for self-conscious life--that support his belief in a universe "congenially designed for the existence of intelligent, self-reflective life"? Even if we agree that capital "I" and "D" intelligent-design of the scriptural sort--what Gingerich himself calls "primitive scriptural literalism"--is not scientifically credible, does that make Gingerich's assertion, "I believe in intelligent design, lowercase i and lowercase d," equivalent to Flying-Spaghetti-Monsterism?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Tone matters. And sarcasm is not science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romano is oblivious to the actual facts of the Dover case. William Buckingham was not some thoughtful theist who wanted a philosophical discussion in the science classroom; he wasn't even an ID proponent. He was a born-again jesus freak befuddled on hillbilly heroin who was more of a young earth creationist. He wanted to get the Christian Bible into the public school classrooms, was willing to lie on the witness stand to do it, and saw intelligent design only as a tool to smuggle Jesus into the science classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Inane" is also how Judge Jones described the school board's actions: to be precise, he called it "breathtaking inanity". The view they were trying to push on children, that the there is a magic man in the sky who poofed us all into existence, is actually entirely as silly as the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Pigliucci was right. Romano is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if Buckingham had been a genteel, considerate, ruminative Owen-Gingerich-style Pennsylvania populist? Would that make any difference? &lt;b&gt;No.&lt;/b&gt; Gingerich is a religious cosmologist who believes that &lt;span&gt;"a common-sense and satisfying interpretation of our world suggests the designing hand of a superintelligence."&lt;/span&gt; There is absolutely no evidence for this, despite his claims that that bogus 'fine-tuning' argument supports the notion. It's a fabulous fantasy of a grand cosmic super-brain hovering about at the beginning of the Big Bang that is just as ludicrously unfounded as the claim that Jesus did it, or that the Flying Spaghetti Monster flapped a few noodly appendages to conjure a home for pirates into existence. Leaving the word "Jesus" out of your explanation does not turn it into science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing I agreed with in Romano&amp;#39;s cranky review was the second to the last sentence above: &amp;quot;Tone matters.&amp;quot; It certainly does, but not in the way he imagines. Romano has written a kvetching review in which he reserves all of his bile for the fellow promoting an evidence-based view of reality, and provides nothing but gentle strokes for people who favor fantasies over hard truths…and his complaint is that scientists are insufficiently conciliatory to those deceitful purveyors of faith and fables. Tone does matter when you use that brand of argument to beg special treatment for liars, and to justify chastising those who deliver a blunt truth — it means one is pandering to faith-based folly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tone matters, because too many have been insufficiently fierce in their criticism of pious excuses for sloppy thinking. Tone matters because we haven&amp;#39;t been rude enough in the face of special claims of privilege for religious inanity. We need to flip that tone argument around 180°—the problem isn&amp;#39;t that our tone is so harsh, it&amp;#39;s that yours is so inappropriately soft towards people who lie to children, who want to gut our educational system, and who want to taint science with a bias for magic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/massimo_pigliucci_is_so_very_r.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/-D6f5afsIwo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272900018925"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=23867">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2d45e60aa8ae04b8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Advice"/><category term="Coming Out"/><category term="GLBT"/><category term="General"/><category term="Richard Wade"/><title type="html">Ask Richard: Respecting Beliefs Vs.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Richard, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a seriously fundamentalist Christian home (e.g. we weren’t allowed to watch most kinds of TV or be good friends with non-Christians).  Since leaving home, I’ve become an atheist and come out as a lesbian.  My relationship with my mom has become so strained that it’s hard to carry on a conversation without either of these things being brought up.  I want to be respectful of what she believes, but I don’t feel like she’s making the same sort of effort.  She’s always blurting out prayers or casting demons out of me or telling me about a guy at her church that God told her I should date.  I’ve discussed how her actions make me feel, but she believes that she’s right and I’m wrong, and I’m going to hell.  It would be simple to not talk to her anymore, but I don’t want to isolate myself from my roots, and I’m hoping that eventually she’ll come around to at least respecting my point of view.  I wonder if you can suggest any way that I can gain her respect without compromising who I am.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much!&lt;br&gt;
Monica&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Monica,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you should do is to sort out the important difference between respecting someone’s beliefs or point of view, and treating them respectfully. By trying to respect your mom’s beliefs and hoping that she will respect your point of view, you are asking for more than either of you can provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t be respectful of what she believes.  I’m sure that you find your mother’s beliefs absurd at the very least. Her behaviors that you described sound downright bizarre. You aren’t going to be able to &lt;em&gt;respect&lt;/em&gt; those things.  You can respect her Constitutional right to have those beliefs, and you can &lt;em&gt;treat her respectfully,&lt;/em&gt; as in not losing your temper and finally screaming something like, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Mom, spouting prayers out of context is crazy! You’re not an exorcist! Believing in demons is wacko! About homosexuality, you’re superstitious and ignorant! God is not running a dating service by whispering boy’s names in your ear!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m guessing that statements like those are closer to your true opinions and feelings about her beliefs than something like, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Mom, I really respect your beliefs about religion, demons, my sexual orientation, and God’s preference for whom I should date, and I hope that you respect my opinions about those things, which are of course, the exact opposite.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That isn’t going to work, is it?  Neither of you are going to be able to genuinely hold each other’s opinions in reverence or high esteem. You both think the other is dead wrong, and that is not going to change unless someone has a very powerful turnaround. On the other hand, letting fly with your frank disrespect for her beliefs is just going to provoke more conflict and hurt feelings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You say you want to gain her respect without compromising who you are. You’re probably not going to get that unless she compromises who she is.  That does not seem likely for the foreseeable future. From what you describe, it appears that rational discussion, informative instruction, reasoned persuasion, and heartfelt sharing have not resulted in her respecting you, who you are, what you are, or what you think and feel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead, shift your efforts to aim for &lt;em&gt;treating each other respectfully.&lt;/em&gt; Focus on behaviors instead of thoughts, beliefs and opinions.  In both of your cases, this is going to be mostly about what not to say.  Follow a regime of behavior modification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she brings up your sexuality or your atheism, quietly say something like, &lt;em&gt;“Mom, that is not your concern, and we just fight about it. Instead, let’s talk about…” &lt;/em&gt; (Have some topic pre-selected that you can both share pleasantly.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she blurts out prayers in a disruptive way, or casts out demons, politely say something like, &lt;em&gt;“Mom, you don’t do these things to guests visiting your house, and I expect the same respectful treatment as any other guest, so please stop.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she tells you whom you should date, (with or without the recommendation of the Almighty) gently say something like, &lt;em&gt;“Mom, my friends have to be my choice. You don’t choose your friends in order to please me, so don’t ask me to choose my friends in order to please you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all these scenarios, you’re not respecting what she’s doing or believing, but you are treating her respectfully, and you’re asserting your right to be treated respectfully as well. Keep your voice calm, without tension, irony or sarcasm in the tone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here is where the behavior modification comes in.  She’s probably not going to immediately stop that stuff.  So when she persists after your polite and respectful request, you have to provide the reinforcement.  Immediately stand up and quietly say, &lt;em&gt;“Mom, I’m leaving now because you’re still doing that. I’ll come back some other time and we’ll try again.”&lt;/em&gt;  Then quietly leave. Don’t storm out, don’t slam the door. Model in every detail of your own behavior the respectful, adult behavior that you want her to show you.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drive off slowly, park your car around the corner and then you can scream your head off and pound the steering wheel, letting off steam.  After you have vented,  you may notice a  sense of empowerment and validation. You have asserted your right for respectful treatment, and you have done it in a completely respectful way. The fact that she didn’t give it to you is not the point at this early stage. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; have given it to &lt;em&gt;her.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no guarantee that this will change her behavior, and if it does it will likely take some time. You will probably have to patiently repeat your respectful requests and repeat your respectful reinforcement many times. But each time you will also be reinforcing &lt;em&gt;in yourself&lt;/em&gt; a calm strength, a gentle self confidence and a patient good will.  Eventually, when you don’t have to reinforce by leaving, you may be able to stay and reinforce her better behavior with smiles, laughter and hugs. Even though your initial goal was to modify &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; behavior, the more important change will have taken place in you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monica, this has nothing to do with either of you respecting beliefs or opinions that you find ridiculous or highly objectionable. It is only about what you and she are &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; with each other.  In the final analysis, that is what is real about people. We are what we &lt;em&gt;do.&lt;/em&gt; We may think, feel, and believe all sorts of things, but our actuality is made of our actions, and our relationships are made of our interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from being a silly comment, it made me reflect upon how it was the SkepticTrack at Dragon*Con that I first thought of in regards to seeing all of them again. More recently I’ve reconnected and consolidated communication with a few overseas friends, with a mind to catch up later in the year. A conference seems to be the most sensible way to facilitate this – you have a large function in common, there’s activities and lectures to attend and the possibility of after-hours activities that you can opt in and out of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then realised that in recent email exchanges that it wasn’t so much ‘who’ was presenting that was uppermost in my mind, but who’d be seeing lectures &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; me. I’d say that the vast majority of people that I want to see at future events aren’t going to be on a stage or familiar to many beyond online social networking ‘code names’ or ‘aliases’, like ‘Digital Cuttlefish’ or ‘Naontiotami’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the year, Chrys of the Atheist Nexus wrote a fantastic recap of what it was like for her as an attendee at the Global Atheist Convention, mostly about the interaction with &lt;a href="http://www.sunshinecoastatheists.com/2010/04/07/atheist-in-wonderland/"&gt;fellow members of the Sunshine Coast Atheists&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a pub, I meet Gold, an intimidating six-foot plus New Zealander with a shaved head, pierced ear and huge gothic, silver buckled boots. Gold turns out to be a warm-hearted, good-natured but passionate atheist who’s literally spent his last cent to fly over for the Convention.  Despite being penniless, he offers to help us set up a website for our new atheist alliance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patrick and Grace from the Charlotte Atheists and Agnostics of North Carolina are here too — after meeting online they’re spending their honeymoon at the Convention. We adopt them as honorary Aussies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I sit next to April for the Dawkins’ presentation. “I’ve just retired and I’ve got time to spare,” she says, “Tell me how I can get involved!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also reflected in a blog-post I read recently about friends meeting up at a UK Skeptics in the Pub, where everyone knew each other by their blog-names or Twitter-names – &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/apr/18/nick-cohen-simon-singh-libel"&gt;Now charlatans will know to beware the geeks&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “skeptic movement” (always spelt with “k” by the way, to emphasise their distinctiveness) had come to Singh’s aid. He was now in the protective custody of men and women, who, with straight faces, introduced themselves by the titles of their blogs: “Hi, I’m Gimpy.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Jack of Kent, pleased to meet you, love your writing. This is Holford Watch, Zeno, Jago, and I thought I saw the Quackometer getting a round in at the bar.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unnerved by their determination, I said to &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/"&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt;, demolisher of pseudo-science in all its fraudulent forms: “The nerds are on the march. I wouldn’t like to be the one standing in their way.” An uncharacteristically mystical look passed over the great debunker’s face. “Yes,” he said. “Strike us down, we shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was only later that I realised this is what Obi-Wan Kenobi says to Darth Vader in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars and that the Skeptics movement’s highest cultural reference point was a 1970s’ B-movie. I shouldn’t have mocked. More to the point, neither should the English establishment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Reed Esau (who continually surprises me with his reflections that always seem to be one step ahead of the main) who sent me the following link: &lt;a title="Permanent Link to Is Social The New Conference Black &amp;amp; Are Attendee Lists The New Allure?" rel="bookmark" href="http://jeffhurtblog.com/2009/07/30/is-social-the-new-conference-black-are-attendee-lists-the-new-allure/"&gt;Is Social The New Conference Black &amp;amp; Are Attendee Lists The New Allure?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve recently read blogs, Facebook updates and tweets of colleagues that have waited until one to two weeks before a major event to register.&lt;/strong&gt; (Interesting these people are posting their conference registration on their social network profiles.) I’ve even made the decision to attend some local events within the last week before that conference’s official start date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt; When I ask colleagues and friends why they wait until the last minute to register, I get a variety of answers and one seems to bubble to the top. “&lt;strong&gt;I waited because I wanted to see who else was attending.”&lt;/strong&gt; When I dig further, I get this answer. “I wanted to see if any people from my online social networks were attending.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter has clearly changed things for us too – we use “hashtags” to track each other’s comments, to coordinate around the event we’re attending Is this something that is more magnified, rather than &lt;em&gt;new? &lt;/em&gt;At the last Amazing Meeting I attended, there was a community white-board used to help people find each other and pass on messages, which I suspect will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, should events be more proactive with establishing Twitter hashtags (sometimes tough trying to figure out what’s the ‘official’ one!), message-boards on Facebook pages for events and recognising that there’s more to a convention than the appeal of the ‘big names’? I hope so – I’m certainly encouraging the likes of the Young Australian Skeptics to lead the way here, after they created the ‘Bloggers’ Breakfast’ at the GAC.&lt;/p&gt;

We have all this data taken from the scene of some sort of event, and have to piece together what happened. But those folks on CSI have it easy: they get to actually walk around the scene, poke and prod it, examine various stains, and even take physical evidence back to the lab. Astronomers are stuck standing a quintillion kilometers away, and we only get to see things at one angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But oh, what an angle. If it pleases the court, I’d like to enter this evidence for your consideration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.subarutelescope.org/Pressrelease/2010/03/18/fig.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/subaru_m81.jpg" alt="subaru_m81" title="subaru_m81" width="610" height="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; kind of evidence (click to embiggen). It’s an image of the lovely grand-design spiral galaxy M81, one of the nearest major galaxies to our own. At about 12 million light years away it’s bright enough to be seen in binoculars (and in fact some extremely keen-eyed observers have been able to see it with their unaided eyes). That means it’s close enough to study in detail… and what detail!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.subarutelescope.org/Pressrelease/2010/03/18/index.html"&gt;This image&lt;/a&gt; is from the monster Subaru telescope, an 8.2 meter (27 foot!) goliath at the peak of the Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii. The purpose of the image was to examine the galaxy’s halo, the vast region of stars surrounding the main body of the galaxy itself. The current thinking is that big galaxies like M81 and our own Milky Way form when smaller galaxies collide. We have a lot of evidence for this in our galaxy — we’re in the process of eating and digesting several small galaxies even as you read this — but the exact process is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why we look at galaxy halos. When galaxies collide, a lot of stars get kicked into higher orbits, propelling them out of the main body of the wreck and into the halo. If this were a crime procedural drama, you could think of these stars as blood spatters seen on walls, pointing back silently to the method of the crime, giving the investigators clues on how they got there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, the halo of M81 is weird. You might think it would look a lot like the Milky Way’s halo: the masses of the two galaxies are roughly the same, and we expect they formed the same way. But the population of stars surrounding M81 is different! For one thing, these new Subaru images indicate that our neighbor’s halo is much brighter than expected. Also, the stars have more heavy elements than expected — that is, more elements like oxygen, iron, and so on (heavy elements, to an astronomer, are essentially any other than hydrogen and helium). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_178.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/galex_m81_m82.jpg" alt="galex_m81_m82" title="galex_m81_m82" width="300" height="298"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What does this mean? That part’s not so easy to understand. Maybe the smaller galaxies that wrecked into each other were different than the ones that eventually built up the Milky Way. Maybe the halo was disturbed by the near-collision of M81 with the galaxy M82, a cigar-shaped mess of a galaxy that clearly interacted with M81 a few hundred million years ago (seen here in the ultraviolet in &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_178.html"&gt;a GALEX image&lt;/a&gt;). M81 is also odd in that it has roughly the same mass as the Milky Way, but is not even half its size. Is that another clue to how the mini-galaxies collided to build up M81 billions of years ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the halo of M81 is so odd that astronomers are rethinking what they call a halo. It’s not even clear if it’s just an extension of the main body of the galaxy, or a separate entity unto itself. Obviously this will take a lot more study. And we need a lot more evidence. Blood spatters are critical clues, but to pin the crime on the perp you could also use DNA, fibers, fingerprints… and, of course, a motive would be handy to understand as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, rounding up the usual suspects simply isn’t enough. Even — especially — when your neighbor is not the kind of person you’d think could do such a thing. M81 always seemed polite, quiet, keeping to itself… but we know how &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; goes.&lt;/p&gt;

To be clear, I am in no way defending the practice described (eating live animals). I want to focus on this statement:

Because octopuses have sophisticated nervous systems and feel pain just as acutely as mammals do...

Octopuses and other cephalopods have sophisticated nervous systems, granted. I’ve written about their wonderful behaviour several times on this blog. But let’s look at the second half of that statement. “Feel pain as acutely as mammals do.” It sounds plausible, but what’s the evidence supporting it?

Pain is a very complicated subject. Comparing pain between humans is tricky, and we have the advantage of being able to talk to each other. Last week’s episode of All in the Mind contained this thought on the difficulty of comparing pain in different people (emphasis added):

Henry Greely: (P)ain is a huge question in law suits. Injury law suits, accident law suits, in workers’ compensation cases, in disability cases. And we don&amp;#39;t have great tests for pain: we know that some people lie, that they say that their lower back hurts so badly they can’t go to work, but in fact occasionally a lucky defendant will have a private detective who&amp;#39;s got video of the claimant bouncing up and down on a trampoline. But we don’t have a good test for it. ...

I don’t know that I see it ever as being plausible that we could say that the pain you&amp;#39;re feeling is greater or less than the pain I am feeling.

We have crude methods of comparing nociceptive behaviour in very similar kinds of mammals. And even those crude measures give us very good reason to think that not all mammals experience pain to the same degree (see, for example, Park et al. 2008 on naked mole rats), which is an underlying assumption of the quote above.

Comparing levels of pain across the broad reaches of the animal kingdom? None that I know of. And given the paper that we just published (Puri &amp;amp; Faulkes 2010), I’ve been looking, trust me.

Let’s look at the more tractable issue of whether octopuses have nociceptors. There’s good physiological evidence that some mollusks have nociceptors; Aplysia californica do, for instance (Illich &amp;amp; Walters 1997). But to the best of my knowledge, nobody has shown nociceptors in octopuses. Varner (2003) wrote:

(Octopuses) have stunning learning abilities, but about whom little is known regarding nociception, endogenous opiates, and responses to analgesics.

I did find a paper on anesthetics in octopuses (Andrews &amp;amp; Tansey 1981), and those authors speculated that octopuses might have sensory neurons like mammalian nociceptors. An even more recent review (Mather &amp;amp; Anderson 2007) did not mention any physiological evidence for nociceptors in octopus, though providing a variety of behavioural reasons to suspect their presence.

Kavaliers (1988) noted that Wells (1978) claimed that there were “pain pathways” in Octopus vulgaris, but I don’t have the book at my fingertips to check what evidence Wells gives to support this claim.

To sum up, there are many good reasons to think that octopuses have nociceptors, but almost no experimental evidence. But is there anyone with the technical skills and the inclination to to to get that evidence? Not sure. While great for behavioural experiments, octopuses can be quite tricky animals to work with for detailed neurophysiology.

Given that cephalopods do have complex nervous systems, and that this has rightly fueled concerns about appropriate care levels for cephalopods, it may be very difficult for anyone to get permission to do the experiments that might determine if octopuses have nociceptors and what their properties are. The nature of octopus nociceptors would be incredibly interesting from a comparative and evolutionary point of view. Octopuses may have a completely different way of detecting tissue damage than is found in those organisms with a backbone. 

Octopuses always challenge us, because there is no other organism on the planet that so obviously seems to have some kind of intelligence, but housed in an animal that might as well have come from another planet.

The problem with relying upon one’s judgment is that it is  fraught, even overwhelmed, with personal bias. The “default mode” of  human behavior (which means most people do this most of the time) is to  construct an elaborate rationalization for what we already believe, and  want to believe. The more intelligent we are, the more sophisticated and  elaborate our rationalizations – giving more confidence in our  conclusions, but not necessarily deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this problem is to develop a specific intellectual  skill set – knowledge of the many and various ways in which we bias our  thinking and the constant application of this knowledge to our own  beliefs. In other words, we need to be skeptical, especially of  ourselves. But not just skeptical in attitude, systematically skeptical  of the process of our own thought. But since this is necessarily  self-referential (we can bias our assessment of our biases) it is also  necessary to check your beliefs and thinking against other people,  people with different perspectives – from different backgrounds, areas  of expertise, and cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposite of this approach is to be insular, to have a  self-contained belief system that feeds on itself but which is  completely disconnected from logic and reality. Humans seem to have an  unfortunate penchant for falling into such self-contained belief  systems, cults being the ultimate expression of this tendency.  Conspiracy theories are another manifestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="More..." src="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;One  manifestation in particular I want to discuss today is the  “demonization” of a person, belief, or system that we don’t like. You  can make anything sound sinister and broken, if you exaggerate and  emphasize the flaws and weaknesses of a system and ignore or downplay  the virtues. For example, if you really wanted to make a case that  democracy is broken, you could point out the corruption in the system,  the power of lobbyists, the failures of the election system and the  electoral college. The 2000 election would stand as a prime example. You  could then conclude that we need to reject democracy for something else  – anarchy, or perhaps a benign dictator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-ullman/medical-research-lies-dam_b_555525.html"&gt;Dana  Ullman has done to science&lt;/a&gt; at the Huffington Post. He essentially  says that science is broken and not to be trusted – therefore trust my  pseudoscience (homeopathy) and help this new medical science to replace  what we have now. It is a remarkable piece of propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His primary strategy is to point out weaknesses in the practice of  science (not the underlying philosophy or methods), as if this is news  to anyone. Science is a human endeavor, and is subject to all the  frailty of humans. Skeptics and science educators (like Carl Sagan) are  the first to point this out. The application of science can fail in a  hundred ways, which is why we need to be vigilant, exacting in our  evaluations, and rely upon consensus of evidence and consensus of  interpretation. Ullman, of course, simply does not like the consensus of  logic, evidence, and opinion that homeopathy is pure bunk, and so he  rails against the practice of science as if it will save him and his  preferred belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are too many examples for me to dissect every one here, so I  will give some salient examples. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern medicine uses the double-blind and  placebo-controlled trial as  the gold standard by which the  effectiveness of a treatment is  determined.  On the surface, this  scientific method is very reasonable.  However, serious problems in  these studies are widely acknowledged by  academics but remain unknown  to the general public. &lt;strong&gt;Fundamental  questions about the meaning of  the word “efficacy” are rarely raised. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He contradicts himself here – academics acknowledge this problem but  it is also rarely raised? This is a case of what we call – making shit  up. Ullman clearly has insufficient direct familiarity with clinical  research, where fundamental questions about efficacy are constantly  raised and discussed. I have actually been involved with designing  clinical trials, and a great deal of time, thought, and care has always  been given to exactly what we would measure, and what it means. Do we  follow a clinical marker of disease, net clinical outcomes, overall  quality of life, or all of these things? In most trials multiple  endpoints are followed in order to blanket the notion of “efficacy” as  much as possible. We want objective measures to know that something  biological is happening, clinical measures to know that there is  relevant benefit, and quality of life measures to know that patients will  actually feel better. We also consider how long we need to follow  subjects – are benefits sustained or temporary? Frankly, saying that  clinical scientists do not question the notion of efficacy is profoundly  ignorant and naive – the kind of thing someone writes when they are  trying to build a case against science, not fairly assess it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we discover what Ullman is really getting at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, just because a drug treatment seems to  eliminate a  specific symptom does not necessarily mean that it is  “effective.” In  fact, getting rid of a specific symptom can be the bad  news. Aspirin may  lower your fever, but physiologists recognize that  fever is an  important defense of the body in its efforts to fight  infection.  Sleep-inducing drugs may lead you to fall asleep, but they  do not lead  to refreshed sleep, and these drugs ultimately tend to  aggravate the  cycle of insomnia and fatigue, while conveniently (for  the drug  companies) tend to create addiction.  Long-term safety and  efficacy of  many modern drugs for common ailments remains unknown,  despite the high  hopes and sincere expectations from the medical  community and the rest  of us for greater certainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again – more nonsense.  A great deal of ink, as they say, has been  spilled exploring all of these questions in the medical literature.  A  low grade fever is not a problem, but a high fever can cause damage to  the brain, lead to seizures in young children, and should absolutely be  treated. Fever is not essential for the body to fight off an infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep inducing drugs are tricky to use well. First we need to  distinguish sleep onset problems vs sleep maintenance problems. For  sleep onset problems a sedative may be effective, and in fact will  restore the sleep cycle. But it must be done in conjunction with what we  call sleep hygiene – no napping during the day, avoid eating late at  night, etc. Sure, some primary care doctors with insufficient training  and experience with sleep disorders may just prescribe a sedative. That  is a reason to improve education and practice, not chuck the whole  system. Because those with more experience and training take a very  sophisticated approach to sleep. Start with sleep hygiene. Then treat  either sleep onset, maintenance, or both as needed. The goal is to  reestablish a normal circadian rhythm and then wean off the medications.  Addictive medications are to be avoided – some sleep medications are  not addictive, but patients may become dependent upon them if they do  not also work on sleep hygiene, or if they have another unidentified  sleep problem. So if this approach does not work – then order a sleep  study or perhaps consult with a sleep expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of going over sleep medicine is to contrast the reality to  Ullman’s cardboard cartoon. His goal is not to understand or elucidate,  but to confuse and poison the well. But also to support an alternative  to the scientific view – the homeopathic view that all symptoms are good  – they are the body’s way of fighting disease. Treating symptoms is  therefore counterproductive. While this may be true is a minority of  cases, this is not a general rule of medicine or biology. It is a  homeopathic philosophy, nothing else, and is not based upon evidence.  Pain does not help the body fight off any ailment that causes pain. Pain  only warns us of a problem. So you would not want to numb someone to  all pain, because then you cannot follow it as an outcome. But you do  want to provide relief to improve quality of life. Pain should be  treated – just with care and thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, there are two kinds of pain: nociceptive and neuropathic.  Nociceptive pain is the body sensing tissue damage, and provides a  protective and warning function. It should be alleviated, but not  masked. Neuropathic pain serves no function, it is a malfunction of the  nervous system, caused by trauma, disease, and sometimes even genetic  mutations that alter nerve function. With neuropathic pain, the pain is  the disease. There are specific medications that may reduce neuropathic  pain – not regular pain medication, but neurologically active medications  that suppress the abnormal pain generation or pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeopaths like Ullman white wash over all this nuance and  complexity. To them, symptoms are good, and all symptomatic treatment is  bad. And then they criticize science-based medicine from their own  childish perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on comes this gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventional drugs used today are so new that there is  very little  long-term research on them. There are good reasons why a  vast majority  of modern drugs used just a couple of decades ago are no  longer  prescribed: they don’t work as well as previously assumed,  and/or they  cause more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugs used today have been available for a variety of time. Some  drugs in common use have been used for decades. I routinely prescribe  drugs that have been around for 40-50 years – so-called tried and true  drugs. There are few surprises in store when using such drugs. Others  have been around for 10 or so years – enough time for post-marketing  experience to have been tracked and for doctors to have a good fix on  long term efficacy and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sure, there are also new drugs always coming on the market. It is  acknowledged that with such drugs we, by necessity, lack long term  experience. And so they are used with more caution, while their effects  in the real world are tracked and studied. Some drugs ultimately fail at  this stage, while others go on to become established drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again we see the complex reality, and Ullman’s self-serving cartoon. I  would also like to hear what an alternative to this system would be –  how do we gain decades of experience with large numbers of patients  without, you know, using drugs for decades in large numbers of patients.  Ullman has his alternative – chuck the whole system and replace it with  nonsense and pseudoscience – his particular flavor of pseudoscience.  Trust in the gurus, not science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a physician, Ullman’s rant is a transparent and naive polemic. But  to someone not personally familiar with the intricacies of modern  medicine, who cannot put his claims into perspective, his case can seem  superficially compelling. Reading his article is like watching Loose  Change without any further background knowledge about 9/11. If you pile  up a bunch of biased misinformation in one place, the sheer size can  seem impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ullman also entirely misses the big picture that medical science is  self-critical and self-corrective (unlike, say, homeopathy which is  insular and protective). All of the criticism he exploits to attack  medicine are self-criticisms that academic physicians and scientists  have and continue to raise. We are asking the questions – how long do we  need to study a drug before we can confidently extrapolate its long  term effects? Then we look back and ask – how is this working? Maybe we  need to follow these drugs longer before approval. Maybe we need to  follow different outcomes. Maybe we need a different strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that way medicine continues to scratch and claw forward. It’s a  messy process, fraught with error, missteps, even bias and fraud. But  just like democracy, it may be a frustratingly flawed system, but it is  the best we have. And I would no more want to chuck science-based  medicine for the wishful thinking and magic Dana Ullman is selling, than  I would want to chuck democracy and accept a dictator.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272890830455"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/marys_monday_metazoan_frighten.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c8d950c84403a797</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Organisms"/><title type="html">Mary's Monday Metazoan: Frightening?

Even though the grants aren't due until Wednesday, Tuesday happens to be my operating room day, meaning I need to get this done and buried by tomorrow afternoon at the latest. In any case, I had been planning on just posting a rerun or two, as is my wont when real life gets so crazy that even my rapid-fire blogorrhea is curtailed, and then someone had to go and send me something that merits at least a brief bit of Insolence. Try as I might not to get sucked into this issue again, I failed utterly, because it just irritates me that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember last fall how I made a bit of a stink about something? (I know what you're thinking: Orac? Make a stink about something? Perish the thought!) In any case, this time around the particular stink I raised was about what could only be described as the purest burning stupid, namely the Atheist Alliance International (AAI) awarding the Richard Dawkins Award to that &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/12/bill-maher-anti-vax-wingnut.html"&gt;anti-vaccine loon&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/03/is-bill-maher-really-that-ignorant_07.html"&gt;germ theory denialist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/bill_maher_and_anti-science.php"&gt;anti-science (at least medical science) tendencies&lt;/a&gt;, who's become a target of special oppobrium on this blog for his using his celebrity (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/more_maher_idiocy.php"&gt;and Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) to spread his pseudoscience, which even &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/is_bill_maher_really_that_ignorant_part_2.php"&gt;includes cancer quackery&lt;/a&gt;. No, I'm not talking about Jim Carrey, although when I learned about the AAI's selection I did liken giving Maher the Richard Dawkins Award to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/bill_maher_gets_the_richard_dawkins_awar.php"&gt;giving Jenny McCarthy an award for public health&lt;/a&gt;. The reason is I got so annoyed is because part of the award criteria is that the winner "through writings, media, the arts, film, and/or the stage advocates increased scientific knowledge," and an example of someone who is about as far from doing that as can be imagined, at least when it comes to science, is Bill Maher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do I see over on Dawkins' website? Well, at first it looked to me like a little video of &lt;a href="http://www.richarddawkins.net/articles/5520"&gt;Maher attacking Muslim religious extremists&lt;/a&gt;. So far, who cares? But then I saw a comment from Richard Dawkins himself:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/quoth_richard_dawkins_i_am_proud.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/quoth_richard_dawkins_i_am_proud.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/SgADjRtA3hY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272890242115"><id gr:original-id="http://jaycueaitch.wordpress.com/?p=491">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/27ff58f4c9ec8b94</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Unevidenced Policy</title><published>2010-05-03T10:03:26Z</published><updated>2010-05-03T10:03:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jaycueaitch.wordpress.com/2010/05/03/unevidenced-policy/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">[BPSDB]The computer system at my workplace, a state secondary school, was down for three days last week.

&lt;p&gt;Tom Christensen, who heads excavations at storied Lejre on Zealand, Denmark, has a paper about the lovely Lejre figurine in &lt;i&gt;ROMU&lt;/i&gt; 2009 (&lt;a href="http://www.roskildemuseum.dk/Files/Billeder/Web/Vores%20viden/Forlag/ROMU/ROMU%202009/Odin_fra_Lejre.pdf"&gt;full text on-line&lt;/a&gt;) and another one in the new issue of &lt;i&gt;Skalk&lt;/i&gt;. Here he offers some well-chosen comparative material and presents his arguments for the figurine's gender and identity. Everybody agrees that the figurine's throne, with its wolf heads and pair of ravens, must depict Odin's high seat Hlidskjalf. Everybody also agrees that the piece dates from the 10th century. But Denmark's foremost experts on 1st Millennium dress (and myself) classify the person on the throne as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/01/the_lejre_freya_miniature.php"&gt;unequivocally dressed in female garb&lt;/a&gt;. Christensen thinks it's a male - most likely Odin. Here are his main arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.The upper ridge of what I call a collar or neck-ring is actually a moustache. Only the lower identical ridge is according to Christensen a neck ring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.The hanging arcs covering the person's chest and belly are not, as I have suggested, four bead strings, but a gold collar from c. AD 500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.Only a man would wear a brimless hat / helmet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christensen then presents a figurine from Højby near Odense to support his case. This figurine has a prominent beard, a moustache and a brimless hat, but is otherwise completely nude, affording us a view of its petite penis. Everyone agrees that the Højby figurine is male. But it dates from before AD 500 and is thus irrelevant here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My reply to Christensen's arguments are that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Yes, it is funny that the Lejre figurine's mouth and chin are covered by its neck ring. But it really doesn't look the way moustaches are depicted in the era's art. It's a single object with two parallel ridges that continue round onto the back of the person's neck, as shown by the eminent photographs published by Christensen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Multiple bead strings were common in the 10th century. Migration Period gold collars are completely unknown from that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Brimless hats may be somewhat male-gendered today, but they were not in the Viking Period. And nothing suggests that it's a helmet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am still convinced that the figurine is a female. Christensen gracefully points out that even in the Medieval Icelandic version of the mythology that has come down to us, goddesses are sometimes allowed to use Odin's high seat. And that's the sort of scene the Lejre figurine depicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom Christensen &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/11/odin_from_lejre_no_its_freya.php#comment-2434449"&gt;commented here&lt;/a&gt; two weeks ago that the debate about the figurine has given him some insights about Swedish archaeologists' &lt;i&gt;selvforståelse&lt;/i&gt;. This term is difficult to translate exactly, but I think I'm not too far off the mark with "high opinion of their own importance". I assume that I am one (or all) of the Swedes he refers to. The best reply is probably to quote something I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/01/the_lejre_freya_miniature.php"&gt;wrote back in January&lt;/a&gt;: "What I said here on &lt;i&gt;Aard&lt;/i&gt; wasn't controversial. I just happened to be the first to say something that every specialist in the field of Late Iron Age gender studies realises immediately."&lt;/p&gt;

The problem with relying upon one’s judgment is that it is fraught, even overwhelmed, with personal bias. The “default mode” of human behavior (which means most people do this most of the time) is to construct an elaborate rationalization for what we already believe, and want to believe. The more intelligent we are, the more sophisticated and elaborate our rationalizations – giving more confidence in our conclusions, but not necessarily deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this problem is to develop a specific intellectual skill set – knowledge of the many and various ways in which we bias our thinking and the constant application of this knowledge to our own beliefs. In other words, we need to be skeptical, especially of ourselves. But not just skeptical in attitude, systematically skeptical of the process of our own thought. But since this is necessarily self-referential (we can bias our assessment of our biases) it is also necessary to check your beliefs and thinking against other people, people with different perspectives – from different backgrounds, areas of expertise, and cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposite of this approach is to be insular, to have a self-contained belief system that feeds on itself but which is completely disconnected from logic and reality. Humans seem to have an unfortunate penchant for falling into such self-contained belief systems, cults being the ultimate expression of this tendency. Conspiracy theories are another manifestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One manifestation in particular I want to discuss today is the “demonization” of a person, belief, or system that we don’t like. You can make anything sound sinister and broken, if you exaggerate and emphasize the flaws and weaknesses of a system and ignore or downplay the virtues. For example, if you really wanted to make a case that democracy is broken, you could point out the corruption in the system, the power of lobbyists, the failures of the election system and the electoral college. The 2000 election would stand as a prime example. You could then conclude that we need to reject democracy for something else – anarchy, or perhaps a benign dictator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-ullman/medical-research-lies-dam_b_555525.html"&gt;Dana Ullman has done to science&lt;/a&gt; at the Huffington Post. He essentially says that science is broken and not to be trusted – therefore trust my pseudoscience (homeopathy) and help this new medical science to replace what we have now. It is a remarkable piece of propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His primary strategy is to point out weaknesses in the practice of science (not the underlying philosophy or methods), as if this is news to anyone. Science is a human endeavor, and is subject to all the frailty of humans. Skeptics and science educators (like Carl Sagan) are the first to point this out. The application of science can fail in a hundred ways, which is why we need to be vigilant, exacting in our evaluations, and rely upon consensus of evidence and consensus of interpretation. Ullman, of course, simply does not like the consensus of logic, evidence, and opinion that homeopathy is pure bunk, and so he rails against the practice of science as if it will save him and his preferred belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are too many examples for me to dissect every one here, so I will give some salient examples. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern medicine uses the double-blind and placebo-controlled trial as  the gold standard by which the effectiveness of a treatment is  determined.  On the surface, this scientific method is very reasonable.  However, serious problems in these studies are widely acknowledged by  academics but remain unknown to the general public. &lt;strong&gt;Fundamental  questions about the meaning of the word “efficacy” are rarely raised. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He contradicts himself here – academics acknowledge this problem but it is also rarely raised? This is a case of what we call – making shit up. Ullman clearly has insufficient direct familiarity with clinical research, where fundamental questions about efficacy are constantly raised and discussed. I have actually been involved with designing clinical trials, and a great deal of time, thought, and care has always been given to exactly what we would measure, and what it means. Do we follow a clinical marker of disease, net clinical outcomes, overall quality of life, or all of these things? In most trials multiple endpoints are followed in order to blanket the notion of “efficacy” as much as possible. We want objective measures to know that something biological is happening, clinical measures to know that there is relevant benefit, and quality of life measure to know that patients will actually feel better. We also consider how long we need to follow subjects – are benefits sustained or temporary? Frankly, saying that clinical scientists do not question the notion of efficacy is profoundly ignorant and naive – the kind of thing someone writes when they are trying to build a case against science, not fairly assess it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we discover what Ullman is really getting at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, just because a drug treatment seems to eliminate a  specific symptom does not necessarily mean that it is “effective.” In  fact, getting rid of a specific symptom can be the bad news. Aspirin may  lower your fever, but physiologists recognize that fever is an  important defense of the body in its efforts to fight infection.  Sleep-inducing drugs may lead you to fall asleep, but they do not lead  to refreshed sleep, and these drugs ultimately tend to aggravate the  cycle of insomnia and fatigue, while conveniently (for the drug  companies) tend to create addiction.  Long-term safety and efficacy of  many modern drugs for common ailments remains unknown, despite the high  hopes and sincere expectations from the medical community and the rest  of us for greater certainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again – more nonsense.  A great deal of ink, as they say, has been spilled exploring all of these questions in the medical literature.  A low grade fever is not a problem, but a high fever can cause damage to the brain, lead to seizures in young children, and should absolutely be treated. Fever is not essential for the body to fight off an infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep inducing drugs are tricky to use well. First we need to distinguish sleep onset problems vs sleep maintenance problems. For sleep onset problems a sedative may be effective, and in fact will restore the sleep cycle. But it must be done in conjunction with what we call sleep hygiene – no napping during the day, avoid eating late at night, etc. Sure, some primary care doctors with insufficient training and experience with sleep disorders may just prescribe a sedative. That is a reason to improve education and practice, not chuck the whole system. Because those with more experience and training take a very sophisticated approach to sleep. Start with sleep hygiene. Then treat either sleep onset, maintenance, or both as needed. The goal is to reestablish a normal circadian rhythm and then wean off the medications. Addictive medications are to be avoided – some sleep medications are not addictive, but patients may become dependent upon them if they do not also work on sleep hygiene, or if they have another unidentified sleep problem. So if this approach does not work – then order a sleep study or perhaps consult with a sleep expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of going over sleep medicine is to contrast the reality to Ullman’s cardboard cartoon. His goal is not to understand or elucidate, but to confuse and poison the well. But also to support an alternative to the scientific view – the homeopathic view that all symptoms are good – they are the body’s way of fighting disease. Treating symptoms is therefore counterproductive. While this may be true is a minority of cases, this is not a general rule of medicine or biology. It is a homeopathic philosophy, nothing else, and is not based upon evidence. Pain does not help the body fight off any ailment that causes pain. Pain only warns us of a problem. So you would not want to numb someone to all pain, because then you cannot follow it as an outcome. But you do want to provide relief to improve quality of life. Pain should be treated – just with care and thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, there are two kinds of pain: nociceptive and neuropathic. Nociceptive pain is the body sensing tissue damage, and provides a protective and warning function. It should be alleviated, but not masked. Neuropathic pain serves no function, it is a malfunction of the nervous system, caused by trauma, disease, and sometimes even genetic mutations that alter nerve function. With neuropathic pain, the pain is the disease. There are specific medications that may reduce neuropathic pain – not regular pain medication, but neurologically active medication that suppress the abnormal pain generation or pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeopaths like Ullman whitewash over all this nuance and complexity. To them, symptoms are good, and all symptomatic treatment is bad. And then they criticize science-based medicine from their own childish perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on comes this gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventional drugs used today are so new that there is very little  long-term research on them. There are good reasons why a vast majority  of modern drugs used just a couple of decades ago are no longer  prescribed: they don’t work as well as previously assumed, and/or they  cause more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugs used today have been available for a variety of time. Some drugs in common use have been used for decades. I routinely prescribe drugs that have been around for 40-50 years – so-called tried and true drugs. There are few surprises in store when using such drugs. Others have been around for 10 or so years – enough time for post-marketing experience to have been tracked and for doctors to have a good fix on long term efficacy and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sure, there are also new drugs always coming on the market. It is acknowledged that with such drugs we, by necessity, lack long term experience. And so they are used with more caution, while their effects in the real world are tracked and studied. Some drugs ultimately fail at this stage, while others go on to become established drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again we see the complex reality, and Ullman’s self-serving cartoon. I would also like to hear what an alternative to this system would be – how do we gain decades of experience with large numbers of patients without, you know, using drugs for decades in large numbers of patients. Ullman has his alternative – chuck the whole system and replace it with nonsense and pseudoscience – his particular flavor of pseudoscience. Trust in the gurus, not science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a physician, Ullman’s rant is a transparent and naive polemic. But to someone not personally familiar with the intricacies of modern medicine, who cannot put his claims into perspective, his case can seem superficially compelling. Reading his article is like watching Loose Change without any further background knowledge about 9/11. If you pile up a bunch of biased misinformation in one place, the shear size can seem impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ullman also entirely misses the big picture that medical science is self-critical and self-corrective (unlike, say, homeopathy which is insular and protective). All of the criticism he exploits to attack medicine are self-criticisms that academic physicians and scientists have and continue to raise. We are asking the questions – how long do we need to study a drug before we can confidently extrapolate its long term effects? Then we look back and ask – how is this working? Maybe we need to follow these drugs longer before approval. Maybe we need to follow different outcomes. Maybe we need a different strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that way medicine continues to scratch and claw forward. It’s a messy process, fraught with error, missteps, even bias and fraud. But just like democracy, it may be a frustratingly flawed system, but it is the best we have. And I would no more want to chuck science-based medicine for the wishful thinking and magic Dana Ullman is selling, than I would want to chuck democracy and accept a dictator.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272888861894"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/thoughtfulanimal/2010/05/monday_pets_where_did_cats_com.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/83c0ba0cc3fe107d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Monday Pets: Where Did Cats Come From?</title><published>2010-05-03T07:45:40Z</published><updated>2010-05-03T07:45:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/_aYfNUm0Z0s/monday_pets_where_did_cats_com.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/thoughtfulanimal/2010/05/monday_pets_where_did_cats_com.php"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Let me tell you a little story. When I was born my parents had two cats. One was named Garfield. The other...well, I don't remember what the other one was called. Not long after I was born, and little Jason was coughing up furballs, the doctors informed the parents that their little bundle of skin and hair was allergic to cats. It was then that teams were picked and lines were drawn. It was me or the cats. Luckily, the parents decided to keep me, and lose the cats. Imagine how much it would have sucked if they decided to keep the cats and lose me. I imagine if my younger brother had actually been my OLDER brother, he might have lobbied for the cats.

Figure 1: I like to imagine that the cats were not happy about this, and decided to wage eternal war.

And despite losing the battle of who got to live with the Mommy and Daddy Goldman, I think the cats are still trying to win the war. The thing is, I'd like to make peace with the cats. But every time I go near a cat, my eyes water, my throat gets all scratchy, I start sneezing. It's really pretty unpleasant. I once worked at a beautiful conference center near Los Angeles. And some very kind person had decided to donate their used couches to the institute. The couches were very comfortable, and so I decided to take a nap on one of them, one day. Within minutes, the all too familiar eye-watering and throat-scratching began. And I thought to myself: "these people had cats." How thoughtless of them to have donated their couches without at least having them cleaned. Or at least a minimal vacuuming. And then, I thought to myself: "evil cats probably orchestrated the whole thing!"

So, dear reader, it's not that I think cats are bad, per se. It's that cats have decided to wage holy war on me, for ousting them from their former place of reverence. And that is seriously bad times.

But because I love my readers more than I loathe cats, I set out today to learn some things about cat cognition. I spent two hours at a cafe (with poor service, good coffee, and free wifi) crawling through PubMed, Google Scholar, JSTOR, Web of Science...to no avail! And I think the reason I wasn't able to find very much on cat cognition is because...there aren't very many people studying cat cognition in the first place! Sure, I found a random study here and there, but nothing particularly interesting. No titles or abstracts that made me think "wow, this is really interesting." No extended lines of research.

And that got me thinking. Why were cats domesticated in the first place? And how? Read the rest of this post... | Read the comments on this post......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Prior to Ecklund's study, the most prominently cited study of religious beliefs among elite scientists that I know of was by Edward Larson and Larry Withham in Nature in 1998. They  surveyed members of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and found that only 7 percent embraced a belief in God. At the time, this result got a lot of news attention, and it continues to be discussed today--e.g., in Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion.

Ecklund's findings are very different--she gets 36 percent belief in God, and 50 percent religiosity among scientists at elite universities (the difference is apparently due to the large percentage of scientists who claim some type of religious identity but do not believe in God; many are Jewish).

I want to know the reason for this large apparent divergence in findings.

Some possible explanations: The ten year gap between the two studies; the greater age of NAS members; different polling questions, or different definitions of religion; Ecklund's inclusion of social scientists in her study, where Larson/Withham only polled natural scientists.

Just from the title, it sounds very promising, yes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this extended, exclusive passage from the book may get your atheist senses tingling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It talks about the limits and powers of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pigliucci argues that scientists &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; know everything, contrary to what he claims many scientists believe.  While science is a wonderful field, indeed, it has its problems.  Pigliucci adds that people like &lt;strong&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt; are wrong when claiming science can refute religious claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But are there really people out there who believe that science will eventually answer &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; we want to know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can’t religious beliefs like a “virgin birth” be refuted by scientific knowledge?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the history of science make the discipline look stronger or weaker?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the entire passage and let the debate begin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Scientists are not gods, even though one may sometimes have some difficulty making the distinction, judging from the ego that some of them (the scientists, not the gods) display when talking about what they do. It is not uncommon to hear physicists and cosmologists expounding on the possibility of “theories of everything,” although what they mean is actually a mathematical solution to a specific problem concerning the conceptual unification of natural forces. Cosmologists such as Stephen Hawking freely talk about having seen “the mind of God” when they come up with a new theory about the distant future of the universe (never mind that so far we do not have a unified theory of forces or that Hawking’s initial predictions about the fate of the universe have been proven spectacularly wrong by recent empirical research). Or consider biologist Richard Dawkins, who goes so far as to (mistakenly, as it turns out) claim that science can refute what he calls “the God hypothesis.” The examples above are instances of scientism, a term that sounds descriptive but is in fact only used as an insult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term “scientism” encapsulates the intellectual arrogance of some scientists who think that, given enough time and especially financial resources, science will be able to answer whatever meaningful question we may wish to pose — from a cure for cancer to the elusive equation that will tell us how the laws of nature themselves came about. The fact that scientism is an insult, not a philosophical position that anybody cares officially to defend, is perhaps best shown by the fact that there is no noun associated with it: if one engages in scientism one is “being scientistic,” not being a scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only can science never in principle reach the Truth because of the untenability of the correspondence theory of truth, but it has also demonstrably blundered in the distant and recent past, sometimes with precisely the sort of dire social consequences that constructionist critics are so worried about. The only reason scientists are by and large unmoved by such instances is because most of them don’t “waste” their time studying the history of their own discipline. If they did, they would realize with dismay that every single scientific theory proposed in the past has been shown to be wrong. What makes us think that the story will not continue and that everything we hold true now will not in turn be seen as naïvely wrong by our descendants? Of course, the same history of science can also be read from the diametrically opposite viewpoint, since it equally well illustrates the idea that science is a self-correcting, arguably cumulative enterprise. It may blunder today, but it will likely make up for the mistake a few years or decades down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way one looks at it, it is surely instructive to recall the words of Albert Einstein: “There is not the slightest indication that energy will ever be obtainable from the atom.” And how about Lord Kelvin, one of the greatest scientists of the nineteenth century, confidently claiming that “X-rays will prove to be a hoax”? And finally, one of my favorites: British astronomer royal Richard Woolley, who in 1956 said, “All this talk about space travel is utter bilge, really.” Yuri Gagarin was the first human to orbit the earth just five years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of evolutionary biology offers another instructive story of blunder and embarrassment, this one complete with a clever hoax and a culprit who has never been found: the story of the so-called Piltdown Man. Whenever one debates creationists (admittedly a questionable, yet hard to kick habit), one is bound to run against the infamous Piltdown forgery. This is the case of an alleged missing link between humans and so-called lower primates, which was found in England (near Piltdown, in fact) and announced to the world on 18 December 1912. The announcement was made by Arthur Smith Woodward, a paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History, and Charles Dawson, the local amateur paleontologist who had actually discovered the fossils. The problem is — as creationists never tire to point out — that the “Dawn Man of Piltdown” (scientific name &lt;em&gt;Eoanthropus dawsonii&lt;/em&gt;, in honor of its discoverer) turned out to be a fake. Moreover, it took scientists four decades to figure this out, an alleged example of what happens when one takes science on faith, in this case the theory of evolution. But is this view accurate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many scientists are rather embarrassed by the Piltdown debacle, apparently feeling guilt by association, considering themselves indirectly responsible for whatever goes wrong in their chosen profession. And yet, Piltdown should instead be presented in all introductory biology textbooks as a perfect example of how science actually works, as we shall see in a moment. First off, we need to realize that before Piltdown, very little was known of the human fossil record. When Darwin wrote The Descent of Man he had to rely largely on comparative data with other living species of primates, for then only the clearly almost-human Neanderthals were known to paleontologists. A few years before Piltdown, two important discoveries were made: that of “Java man” in 1891 and that of “Heidelberg man” in 1907, but neither of these was very ancient. When a significantly older set of prehuman remains was allegedly found at Piltdown, the scientific world was simply ready for the discovery. It was what practitioners in the field had expected, something that surely the perpetrator of the hoax knew very well and magisterially exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pitldown findings occurred on more than one occasion and at two separate sites, yielding fragments of skulls, of a lower jaw, and even of stone tools associated with the “culture” of the predawn men. While there were skeptics from the beginning, the hoax was simply too elaborate and cunningly put together to raise the suspicions of a significant number of paleontologists — at least initially. National pride probably also played a role in a professional establishment that at the time was dominated by British scientists, with the British Museum being the epicenter of all the activities surrounding the study of the Piltdown fossils. Understandably, the British scientists involved were only too happy to claim their motherland as the place of origin of all humanity. Yet, suspicions about the genuineness of &lt;em&gt;Eoanthropus dawsonii&lt;/em&gt; grew until a group of researchers including Wilfrid Le Gros Clark, Kenneth Oakley, and Joe Weiner applied stringent chemical tests to the remains, demonstrating that the “fossils” had been planted and chemically altered to make them seem appropriately ancient: the Dawn Man was nothing but a perfectly ordinary human skull paired up with a somewhat unusually small jaw from an orangutan. What Weiner and colleagues couldn’t say for sure was who carried out the hoax, although a strong case was made by Weiner that the perpetrator was none other than Dawson himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be that as it may, what does this story tell us about how science works? On the negative side, it is painfully clear that science depends on an assumption of honesty on the part of its practitioners. Peer review is designed to uncover methodological or reasoning errors, not possible frauds. But since science is, once again, a human activity, egos, financial reward, and the search for glory — however brief — are still to be reckoned with. As Piltdown and other forgeries have shown, scientists are continuously open to the possibility of someone fooling them by not playing the game by the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, science is a social activity unlike any other that human beings engage in: it is a game of discovery played against a powerful but neutral opponent — nature itself. And nature cannot be ignored, at least not for long. The reason suspicions kept mounting about the true origin of the Piltdown remains was that the more paleontologists uncovered about human evolution, the less Dawn Man seem to fit with the rest of the puzzle. In a sense, the very factor that made the acceptance of &lt;em&gt;Eoanthropus dawsonii&lt;/em&gt; so fast in the beginning — because it seemed to be the much sought after “missing link” in human evolution — was also the reason why, four decades later, scientists kept pursuing the possibility that it was not genuine after all. While forty years of delay may seem an inordinate amount of time, they are but the blink of an eye when compared to the history of the human pursuit of knowledge. Moreover, it is important to note that it was scientists who uncovered the hoax, not creationists, which is both an immense credit to the self-correcting nature of science and yet another indication that creationism is only a religious doctrine with no power of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, then, why Piltdown — far from being an embarrassment to the scientific community — should be prominently featured in biology textbooks: it is an example of how the nature of science is not that of a steady, linear progression toward the Truth, but rather a tortuous road, often characterized by dead ends and U-turns, and yet ultimately inching toward a better, if tentative, understanding of the natural world. The problem is that some of those U-turns can be painful to society when the consequences of scientific blunders don’t stay neatly confined within the rarefied atmosphere of the ivory tower, but spill into the everyday social world with sometimes disastrous consequences for human welfare. The quintessential case study of this dark side of science is the eugenic movement that swept America during the first half of the twentieth century. Eugenics is often referred to as a “movement” (rather than a science) for a good reason: it was weak on science, but strong in the area of public outreach and even political intervention. It was a political ideology cloaked in the shining mantel of science, a disguise that all pseudoscience attempts to don, from the anti-HIV movement to the intelligent design movement.&lt;/p&gt;

Vernon Middle School resumed April 29 and 30 after a 15 week hiatus.  These two sessions saw testimony from four adults–Freshwater, Ruth Frady, Sherri Perry, and Lori Hubbell–and a parade of former students in Freshwater’s science class in 2007-2008.  I’ll treat the two days as though they were one here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll get to the students’ testimony after I describe the testimony of Freshwater and the other adults.  I’ll say just this above the fold. What we saw in R. Kelly Hamilton’s questioning of the students was the shameless exploitation of students, some of them special needs students, by  Hamilton.  I’ll explain why that’s the case when I describe the students’ testimony below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Columbus Dispatch stories on these two days are &lt;a href="http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2010/04/29/teacher-hearing-continues-burn-cross-accused.html" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2010/04/30/science-teachers-hearing-resumes.html" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, while the Mt.

&lt;p&gt;More below the fold&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We left off in December 2009 with Freshwater on the stand undergoing redirect examination by R. Kelly Hamilton, Freshwater’s attorney.  His redirect occurred in two fragments on the 29&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, and was not completed due to interruptions caused by scheduling of other witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned that the &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/01/freshwater-day-13.html" rel=""&gt;abrupt adjournment&lt;/a&gt; of the hearing on January 15, 2010, was due to the arrival of anonymous letters sent to Freshwater and Superintendent Steve Short identifying additional materials from Freshwater’s classroom that had allegedly not been forthcoming in response to subpoenas from Freshwater.  The long hiatus was to allow time for examination of those materials by Freshwater and his attorney and for preparation of more witnesses.  In April Hamilton requested that subpoenas be issued for (at least) 16 additional witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freshwater redirect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued from &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/01/freshwater-2009.html" rel=""&gt;December 2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton spent the first part of re-direct attempting to establish the premise that the district had not been fully forthcoming in its responses to subpoenas for materials from Freshwater’s classroom.  Freshwater testified that he first learned the district held additional materials on January 15, 2010, the day after an anonymous letter with 5 pictures enclosed arrived.  The pictures enclosed with the letter showed material like a file labeled “Freshwater Room Inventory” which Freshwater testified he had not made.  There was a copy of a letter from Elle Button (another 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science teacher) to Freshwater; a lesson plan of Freshwater’s containing a note from Debbie McDaniel, a previous middle school principal; a xerox of a a photo of four teacher’s editions of science textbooks, four with Freshwater’s name on them; and a photo of one of the “motivational posters” Freshwater had in his room (“You can build a throne with bayonets, but you can’t sit on it long.”).  Freshwater testified that those had been left in his room when he left the school after being suspended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freshwater testified that knowing of those and other materials would have been of aid in preparing his case to retain his job.  He testified that he did not know who the anonymous source is nor did he have any clues as to the identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[There was a break in Freshwater’s redirect here to accommodate other witnesses, but I’ll finish him before moving to the other witnesses.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resuming redirect, Freshwater testified that when he and his attorney heard about the existence of additional materials from his room, he, together with the referee and several attorneys (Freshwater’s and the board’s and insurance company’s), conducted an inspection of those materials on January 15, 2010, pursuant to a public records request.  He testified that there were worksheets, tests, quizzes, seating charts, videos, lab/demo specimens (a preserved snake, deer antlers, etc.), and some “personal stuff.”  The five textbooks shown in one of the photos from the anonymous letter were not there.  In all Freshwater said there were approximately 17 boxes of such material in the district offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freshwater testified that in March he and his attorney received copies of all the material held by the district, and he then instructed Hamilton to begin interviewing students.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton showed a short powerpoint presentation.  The first slide was two halves of an 8.5x11 paper, with text (typed or machine-printed) on both halves.  The top half was the anonymous note received by Superintendent Short on Jan 14, while the bottom half was the anonymous note received by Freshwater.  Judging from the match of the somewhat irregular cut between the halves it looked like they came from the same piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other slides showed boxes of materials and some individual materials, and one showed a small unlighted room off a women’s bathroom in which the material was apparently stored and from which they were retrieved for the Jan 15 inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point Freshwater’s redirect examination was suspended again to accommodate other witnesses, and it did not resume in this two days of the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sherri Perry Direct Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next witness was Sherri Perry, daughter-in-law of a former Superintendent (George Perry) and sister-in-law of Superintendent Short.  As far as I know she herself is not officially connected to the school district.  Her son was a student in Freshwater’s science class some years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton introduced an email she had sent to members of the Board of Education, Director of Teaching and Learning Weston, and Superintendent Maley in 2003 in support of Freshwater’s “objective origins” science curriculum proposal.  She argued that Freshwater was only trying to present all sides regarding theories of origins, and that he should be able to “objectively present all facts and theories.”  She said “Darwin’s theory is indeed a theory and should be taught as such.”  Other theories should be taught as well.  Asked for examples, she named Big Bang theory.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said she assumed all scientific theories were taught.  She said education is a process by which theories and facts are analyzed.  She said that anything that anything short of that trains children to be too narrow, and it should not stop when it comes to evaluating the theory of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that Freshwater “may have been singled out because he held traditional beliefs about the origin of the world.”  Her son Joe, who had Freshwater in science class, wrote a letter in support of Freshwater’s proposal 2003 that was read to the Board of Education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that based on her understanding, Freshwater was only attempting to objectively analyze scientific theories with students.  (She used “objectively” a lot.  Recall that Freshwater’s 2003 proposal was lifted verbatim from &lt;a href="http://www.intelligentdesignnetwork.org/" rel="external "&gt;Intelligent Design Network&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that from hearsay in 2003 she thought initially that Freshwater was proposing to teach creationism or intelligent design, but when she learned that he “just wanted to objectively evaluate the theory of evolution” she was surprised that he couldn’t teach the “holes” (her word) in the theory of evolution.  Asked what “holes,” she said the theory “… takes findings from various areas and combines them.  Some things are taken on assumption.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sherri Perry Cross Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cross examination David Millstone asked Perry what assumptions she was referring to.  She couldn’t remember.  She said, “It’s a theory based on some scientific evidence, and there are periods of time when there is a lack of evidence” … “It is a theory.  All theories of the origin of the world are &lt;em&gt;theories&lt;/em&gt;” (emphasis in her intonation).  Asked, she said “A theory is a hypothesis that is based on gathered data.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding her email to the BOE in 2003, Millstone quoted her as writing “Because Christianity is a major religion of the world it should be permitted.”  Asked if it should be permitted in science class, she replied “Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ended her cross; there was no redirect or recross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lori Hubbell Direct Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Hubbell is a caretaker for a male student in Freshwater’s class who was allegedly shocked on his back with the Tesla coil the same day Zachary Dennis was marked.  He is a special needs student, and she testified that it was doubtful that he could accurately or reliably report the incident.  She reported that professionals at the coordinator of the boy’s health care, Moundbuilder’s Guidance Center, were of the opinion that it would not be in the boy’s best interests to testify in the hearing.  She provided a letter from them to that effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that the boy thought highly of both Freshwater and Superintendent Short.  She said that Freshwater spent a good deal of one-on-one time with the boy, tutoring him in the subject matter.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that during his interview with the boy (in the caretaker’s presence), he played the “Watchmaker” video for him and he denied having seen it before.  She testified that the boy had identified a red mark on his side or back (it was described as both at one time or another in testimony)  as having been produced by the Tesla coil.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that she had been Freshwater’s student in science class in 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade, identifying the year as 2001.  She testified that Freshwater never mentioned religion or God in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lori Hubbell Cross Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross was brief.  The only noteworthy testimony was that Hubbell said that the boy described the incident in which he was marked as “an accident.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth Frady Direct Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruth Frady was a paraprofessional in the middle school in 2007-2008, an aide in several areas.  She said she wanted to testify to clarify and address some aspects of the report of her comments in the HR OnCall investigative report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that she has known Freshwater since 2007, but knew of him earlier because her children went through Mt. Vernon middle school.  She started attending Fellowship of Christian Athletes meetings in 2007 on Freshwater’s invitation.  He invited her because “he knew I was a Christian.”  She attended both the Monday leadership meetings and Tuesday regular membership meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about the HR OnCall report, she said that she was concerned about how it described her “input,” and that material she provided was left out of the report.  She said that she had “… proof that he did not say what he was accused of saying.”   She said that the investigators’ report seemed “omissive” and therefore slanted against Freshwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that had the prayer circle had the character of an exorcism or had Freshwater been an active participant/leader of it, she would have objected and reported it to the principal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that the Monday FCA leadership meetings were casual and “laid back,” and that Freshwater was typically at his desk doing school work and generally did not participate.  She testified that Freshwater never made speaker suggestions and that to her knowledge the students always made the calls to speakers.  Attendance at the leadership meetings was 6 to 10 students, and around 30 students at the Tuesday meetings.  After parental permission slips were required for the Tuesday meetings attendance fell off to around 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that it was she who mentioned “Satan” in the prayer circle that FCA members, Frady, and Freshwater formed around Pastor Zirkle that has been described as a “healing ceremony” and “exorcism” in various contexts.  In such a prayer circle, the participants form a circle around the person being prayed for, all of them touching that person.  Members of the circle individually pray aloud as they wish.  She testified that in her prayer she said something to the effect of ‘Don’t let Satan bring this man down.’  (That’s not a direct quote, but it’s close.)  That’s consistent with &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/04/freshwater-day-12.html" rel=""&gt;the pastor’s testimony&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that Freshwater was also in the prayer circle about 4 feet from her.  She had her eyes closed so she didn’t see what he did.  The bell for the end of that period rang during the prayer circle, and after a 5-10 second pause Freshwater said something innocuous about ending and said “Amen.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton referred to Zachary Dennis’s testimony in which he said that Freshwater raised his arms and prayed to the effect of ‘Satan, devil, you can’t have this man.’  She said that didn’t happen and that she would have reported it had he done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth Frady Cross Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone pointed to several passages in the investigators’ report that seemed to contradict Frady’s perception of it being “omissive.”  He read a passage that said there was no evidence that Freshwater had mentioned Satan.  She responded that it was omissive because she told the investigators that she had mentioned Satan and the report didn’t contain that fact.  She didn’t recall who initiated the prayer circle and agreed that it could have been Freshwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frady agreed that in the report she used the words “concluding prayer” to describe Freshwater’s verbalization closing the prayer session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth Frady Re-Direct Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked if HR OnCall elicited a written statement from her.  They had not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frady commented that “I work a lot with students and I don’t share my faith with them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no re-cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student Testimony&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton called 10 students who were in Freshwater’s 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science class 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; period in 2007-2008, the class at issue with respect to the Tesla coil procedure.  I will not here name them, but will refer to them by clever pseudonyms (Girl A, Girl B, etc.).  I’ve decided not to name them for a couple of reasons.  First, they were in varying degrees anxious about testifying.  Second, they were led by Hamilton’s questioning to make some serious allegations, and to identify those allegations with specific students would raise the possibility of recriminations among classmates in the school.  The school has seen enough hassle without that exacerbating it.  Finally, some of the students are special needs (“IEP”) students and that fact was mentioned in their testimony.  I don’t care to embarrass them or their parents by naming them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, bear in mind that these students are all currently minors, 15 or 16 years old and sophomores in high school.  Hamilton apparently began actively interviewing students from that class in early April.  He generally contacted them by phone before meeting with them, and usually got permission from their parents/guardian to interview them.  &lt;em&gt;That was not always the case.&lt;/em&gt;  In several instances Hamilton interviewed a student and obtained an affidavit from that student without a parent or guardian being present.  In at least one case Hamilton interviewed a minor student and obtained an affidavit from that minor student without the parents even knowing the student was being interviewed, say nothing of swearing to a document in front of a lawyer.  I don’t know how the bar association feels about that, but I see it as unethical at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I used the title “Exploiting kids” for this post.  First, in his re-enactment Hamilton misrepresented Zachary’s (and implicitly Taylor Strack’s) testimony concerning the use of the Tesla coil.  Second, he used a hypothetical question based on that re-enactment to induce several of the students to say Zachary (and by implication Strack) was lying.  Third, he interviewed some minor students out of the presence of their parents/guardians, and in at least one case &lt;em&gt;without the knowledge of the student’s parents/guardians&lt;/em&gt;.  Fourth, he used special needs kids.  Fifth, Hamilton produced an unwarranted and disruptive (and in my opinion staged) outburst during the testimony of one student that so distressed that student that we had to take a break for her to recompose herself to resume her testimony.  FInally, Hamilton had a sophomore student shilling his cards around the high school without permission from the district.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton’s questioning of the students followed a common script, with variations depending on the specific student.  The script had basically this outline:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.  Elicit identifying information and information concerning how Hamilton obtained an affidavit from the student.  The affidavits were written by the students themselves, apparently using Hamilton’s notes from the interview.  They were signed and sworn before Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.  Hamilton would ask them about the video (the “Watchmaker” vid (see &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/11/freshwater-day-1.html" rel=""&gt;Mahan testimony here&lt;/a&gt;) he showed them on a laptop, asking whether they had seen it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.  Hamilton had the students draw a diagram showing where they sat in the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.  Hamilton would question them about the Tesla coil incident.  As part of that, he put on a heavily over-dramatized re-enactment of &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/10/freshwater-hear-1.html" rel=""&gt;Zachary’s description &lt;/a&gt;).  Hamilton’s re-enactment misrepresented Zachary’s testimony in important respects.  For example, Zachary testified that he put his hand on the surface of the overhead projector and that Freshwater held his hand down and drew the cross shape on his arm with the Tesla coil.  In his re-enactment, however, Hamilton, playing the role of Zachary, stooped and held his whole forearm, fist clenched, on the overhead projector’s plate.  Playing Freshwater, Hamilton laid his forearm, against with fist clenched, on top of the arm already on the overhead.  His motions were large, abrupt, and dramatic.  Contrast that with &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/11/freshwater-oct.html" rel=""&gt;Taylor Strack’s description&lt;/a&gt; of how it occurred:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She testified that Freshwater asked if anyone in the class wanted to try it (being zapped). A student would approach him at the front of the room and put an arm on the overhead projector and Freshwater would apply the arc to the arm. She testified that if the student asked Freshwater to stop, he would stop. That is consistent with Zachary Dennis’ description of what happened. Overall, it’s not clear in her testimony whether Freshwater put his hand on a student’s hand on the overhead or not. She implied both that he did and didn’t during her testimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And see &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/10/freshwater-hear-1.html" rel=""&gt;Zachary’s testimony&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Freshwater] then solicited volunteers to be zapped individually. Zach described how he placed his hand on the plate of an overhead projector. According to Zach’s testimony, Freshwater held his hand down and made two vertical passes with the Tesla coil and two horizontal passes. Zach testified that Freshwater told him that “It was like a temporary tattoo and those crosses would last a while.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.  Hamilton asked whether Freshwater taught religious ideas in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.  For those students who participated in FCA Hamilton asked some questions about Freshwater’s behavior there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7.  For a couple of students there were questions concerning the contents of the &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/02/freshwater-the-1.html" rel=""&gt;“black bag”&lt;/a&gt; which were introduced into evidence.  A 400+ page folder containing all the papers and photos in the black bag was introduced into evidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ll briefly summarize each student’s testimony, elaborating where appropriate.  It was noteworthy that several of the girls went to Freshwater after their testimony and hugged him.  Note also that each case where a student identified a mark as resulting from the procedure contradicts Freshwater’s claims that it didn’t leave marks on students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Girl A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Direct Examination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girl A was clearly anxious about testifying.  Hamilton had interviewed her at her home and obtained an affidavit from her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that “she knew he didn’t do it,” based on radio accounts of the charges against Freshwater.  She had not talked with the investigators or anyone else from the school about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showed the Watchmaker video, she said she had not seen it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that students volunteered for the Tesla coil exercise and that no one complained about it.  She said the incident where one student was touched on the back was an accident.  She testified that Freshwater did not hold students’ arms during the Tesla coil procedure.  She said that he didn’t mention ‘temporary mark’ or ‘tattoo’ with reference to the Tesla coil exercise.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that Freshwater didn’t talk abour religion or his personal beliefs, and didn’t touch his Bible in class.  She said students didn’t ask religious questions in class.  She wasn’t aware of the Bible on his desk until the allegations became public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified she attended FCA a few times, but stopped when the permission slip policy was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cross examination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cross examination she testified that she couldn’t remember what a Tesla coil is used for, didn’t remember Freshwater stimulating tubes of various gases to show the different colors, didn’t remember whether the tip of the Tesla coil or just the arc touched the arms of student volunteers, and didn’t remember the ‘daisy chain’ exercise with the Tesla coil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone moved to the use of the Tesla coil on the students.  As he did so Girl A began to be somewhat distressed.  Millstone was attempting to resolve a difference between Girl A’s verbal testimony that Freshwater made just one pass on the arm and her non-verbal demonstration where she showed two passes, one vertical and one horizontal.  (Recall that the record on which the referee will base his recommendation is the written record of verbal testimony, and the written transcript will reflect only the verbal testimony of the witness with no gestures indicated.)  Girl A was beginning to show some confusion and distress during the questioning, so Millstone started to back off.  At that point Hamilton jumped to his feet and advanced into the space between the referee and the witness.  He shouted that he had promised that witnesses would be treated with respect and that this is why he had asked that the hearing be closed.  He grew so vehement that the witness became very distressed and the referee told Hamilton he wasn’t helping and ordered him to sit down.  There was a break in the hearing so the witness could recompose herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton’s outburst was pure theatrics.  Nothing in the demeanor of the witness or in Millstone’s questioning warranted it.  Millstone is soft-spoken and consistently questions witnesses from a seated position, reducing the intimidation factor.  Hamilton was playing to the gallery, pure and simple, exacerbating the witness’s stress as he did so.  He had no regard for the witness.  He was pretending to be a protector of children by stressing a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girl A then testified that Freshwater’s motion appeared to be an X, and that she saw the mark on kids’ arms later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She did not recall Freshwater teaching about hydrosphere theory.  She said Freshwater talked about evolution and that people could believe what they want.  She didn’t recall the use of “here” in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Girl B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Direct examination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the same preliminaries of identification, interview, affidavit, and seating diagram, Girl B testified that she had not previously seen the Watchmaker video.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She remembered the Tesla coil class, and after Hamilton’s exaggerated re-enactment said she didn’t see Zachary’s arm being held down.  She didn’t recall any mention of temporary tattoo or crosses by Freshwater.  Hamilton didn’t do his re-enactment for Girl B, perhaps because she’d told him in their interview what she later said in cross examination (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that she didn’t see Freshwater’s personal Bible on his desk, and that he didn’t visit Answers in Genesis during class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton then turned to the ‘black bag’ materials.  One item in the black bag was a letter Girl B had written for an assignment in an English class late in the 2007-2008 school year.  The assignment was to write a letter to someone who had an influence on her and deliver it to that person.  Girl B wrote to Freshwater and her letter was included in the black bag.  She agreed that she wrote the letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cross examination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cross Girl B said that Freshwater first used the Tesla coil to show what it did to different gases.  He then used it on himself.  He then asked for volunteers and used it on them.  She said Freshwater was standing beside the overhead projector and “He would hold their arm and he would use it.”  Asked, she said she could see it left a mark on all of them.  She wasn’t sure of the shape of the mark(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She recalled the ‘daisy chain’ exercise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She didn’t recall Freshwater teaching hydrosphere theory or about vapor canopies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She knew there were posters in the room but couldn’t recall what was on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girl B redirect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked if Taylor Strack and two others whose names I didn’t get were in the same English class in which she wrote the letter assignment.  She couldn’t recall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Girl C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girl C direct&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again we went through the preliminaries of interview and affidavit.  Girl C was concerned about testifing because Taylor Strack told her it was “scary.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When shown the Watchmaker video by Hamilton in their interview she said she had not seen it before.  Even though he had shown it to her a few weeks ago she couldn’t remember what it was about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Tesla coil incident, she testified that no one got hurt, and all were volunteers.  After  Hamilton’s over-dramatized re-enactment she said she “didn’t see anything like that.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She drew a seating diagram showing where she sat.  She saw the boy get touched by the Tesla coil.  Hamilton asked, “If Zachary Dennis said Freshwater looked like he intentionally zapped the boy, what would you say?”  “He’s lying,” she replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked, “If Zachary Dennis said Freshwater held his arm down what would you say”?  “He’s lying.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that Freshwater said something about a mark but that it would go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about religious items in the room, she identified the Ten Commandments on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said she attended FCA 10 or 11 times, but quit when the permission slip policy was instituted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said she was a good friend of Zachary Dennis and had a text message exchange with him in 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade.  She said that she’d heard he had made the complaint and texted him asking if it was so.  She said he responded that his “parents blew it out of proportion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girl C cross&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that she saw Freshwater touch the boy in the back with the Tesla coil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She described the volunteering process, saying that Freshwater called on people to ask if they wanted to do it.  She described Freshwater making a two-pass “X” with the Tesla coil on their arms and that he told them it would leave a mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that the Ten Commandments were high on the wall opposite her, and “they went around the room.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone asked her about &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/01/freshwater-2009.html" rel=""&gt;the questionnaire&lt;/a&gt; Freshwater gave to students the first day of his class in August 2007.  She didn’t recall it.  Shown the questionnaire she had filled out she remembered.  Millstone asked about the exercise in which students were shown an object and were to write a paragraph or two describing it.  She said that Freshwater told them it was 400 billion years old, and that “they found someone who had stepped on a trilobite.”  She said Freshwater showed a picture of a footprint in cement on a trilobite.  She said “The’re too old to be still alive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She didn’t recall being asked about religion on a questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girl C redirect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked if the incident where the boy got zapped on the back was an accident.  She replied that it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked of the trilobite exercise was a “creative writing assignment.”  She replied that it was.  Asked if it was to compare a fossil and something in concrete, she responded “Yes.”  She was asked if it was intended to teach the scientific method and she answered “Yes.”  He asked if it cast doubt on evolution, and she responded “No.”  Was it her first introduction to the scientific method?  Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked if the question on a questionnaire that asked “Is religion is important to me” was offensive.  She said “No.”  Was Freshwater tring to promote religion?  No.  Did he spend much time on it?  No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton showed her a picture of a bulletin board with a Cross Club poster (predecessor of FCA) on it.  She identified it as being in the front of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girl C recross&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone asked her if she’d talked to anyone during the break (we took a break during her testimony).  She replied she’d talked with Hamilton about it.  Hamilton then asked if he had attempted to influence her testimony and she replied “No.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Girl D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girl D direct&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again we went through the interview/affidavit prologue.  Girl D said she feared “lawyers twisting my words.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shown the Watchmaker video by Hamilton during their interview she said she had not seen it before.  “It was very odd.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said she thinks she was in class the day of the Tesla coil incident.  She said she didn’t see Freshwater hold an arm down during the deomnstration.  When Hamilton did his dramatic re-enactment she said she didn’t see that.  She said Freshwater didn’t say anything about a temporary tattoo or a mark.  She said Freshwater made an “X” on the arms, and was sure it wasn’t a cross.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about the boy who was allegedly touched on the back with the Tesla coil, she said “That never happened.  I don’t remember that.”  She said no one complained about being touched with the Tesla coil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said Freshwater never held up a Bible in class, and that she didn’t notice it on his desk.  She said if Zachary Dennis said Freshwater had held up a Bible in class, “He never done that.”  She said Freshwater never talked about the Bible or about God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girl D cross&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone asked what theTesla coil lesson was.  She replied “Energy.  Demonstrating electricity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girl D described the Tesla coil as “a pointy thing”, “a pin-point … hooked up to a big square box … with a cord to an outlet.”  She said it was on the table where the overhead normally was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said Zachary and the other volunteers went up and Freshwater touched them with “the pin thing.”  He “did an X.”  He did the same with each volunteer, she said.  She testified that he said “The mark would go away in a little while.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She didn’t remember the glowing tubes of gases nor the daisy chain exercise.  She said doing the marks on the volunteers was the only thing done with the Tesla coil that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She did not recall if there was a debate on evolution and creationism, nor did she recall mention of hydrosphere theory or water canopies.  She remembered videos about volcanoes, the earth, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girl D redirect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked by Hamilton, she agreed it was hard to remember 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Girl E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girl E direct&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again we did the interview/affidavit intro and the seating diagram exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, shown the Watchmaker video by Hamilton during the interview, she said she had never seen it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day of the Tesla coil incident, she testified, Freshwater did not hold anyone’s arm down.  She said all were volunteers, and no one cried out or showed pain.  She knew Zachary Dennis well–she rode the bus with him.  Given Hamilton’s dramatic re-enactment, she said “It never happened.”  Pressed, she said he “would not be telling the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She recalled the exercise with the gas-filled tubes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said Freshwater didn’t hold up the Bible or talk about it.  She didn’t see it on his desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said Freshwater did not talk abou creationism or intelligent design.  Regarding the incident where the boy was touched on the back with the Tesla coil, she said she didn’t see it.  The boy said something about it later, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She rode the bus with Zachary after school that day, sitting a row or two behind him.  He and two friends were looking at the mark on Zachary’s arm.  According to her he did not complain of pain, and she thought that the mark appeared to be fading.  She was surprised n the picture of Zachary’s arm in the newspaper, and thought it looked worse in the photograph than it did on the bus that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girl E never attended FCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girl E cross&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked by Millstone, Girl E did not recall an evolution/creationism debate, or discussions of Good Friday or Easter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked to describe the procedure with the volunteers, she said that Freshwater stood to the side of the overhead.  The volunteer would hold out an arm.  She said Freshwater didn’t force them down, and he made one line up the arm and one across.  She drew a cross shape on her own arm.  She testified that he said it “show up for for a couple of minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She didn’t remember the daisy chain exercise, nor whether Freshwater used the Tesla coil on himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She couldn’t recall the beginning of year questionnaire.  Showed her own questionnaire, she didn’t recall the trilobite exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if she saw the mark on Zachary’s arm, she replied “Yes.”  Asked what it looked like, she said “a cross or T.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girl E redirect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked if kids got excited when the Tesla coil came out.  She replied that they did.  He asked if Freshwater ever asked religious questions.  She replied he did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Girl F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girl F direct&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, we went through the interview/affidavit/seeting diagram preliminaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girl F though she had seen the Watchmaker video before, but she couldn’t recall when or where.  She said it showed “a different way the world had come.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about the Tesla coil exercise, she didn’t remember the gas tube demonstration.  She testified that she did not recall Freshwater holding anyone’s arm down, and she didn’t recall where the overhead was.  Shown Hamilton’s dramatic re-enactment, she said she didn’t see that.  She couldn’t remember if she herself had volunteered–Zachary had testified that she did, but she couldn’t recall whether she did or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked, she said Freshwater didn’t talk about the Bible in class, and she didn’t remember seeing one on his desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was another of the students who did the English class writing assignment that was in the black bag.  Shown hers, she couldn’t remember much about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girl F cross&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked b Millstone, she couldn’t recall if she saw the Watchmaker video in Freshwater’s class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Tesla coil demonstrations, she said he may have tried it on himself.  “I don’t rell remember much about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boy A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again we saw the interview/affidavit/seating diagram exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shown the Watchmaker video during his interview with Hamilton, Boy A said he had not seen itbefore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Tesla coil incident, Boy A recalled the gas tubes demonstration.  He didn’t recall theboy being touched on the back with the Tesla coil.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Hamilton’s dramatic re-enactment, Boy A said he didn’t see anything like that.  Pressed by Hamilton, he said Zach must be lying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy A was one of the volunteers.  He said on a pain scale of 0 to 5, it was a 0.  Asked about the pattern Freshwater traced, Boy A said one line straight down.  Freshwater did it on himself first, Boy A testified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy A said he saw Freshwater’s Bible on his desk.  He went to FCA once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boy A cross&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cross Boy A testified that he didn’t remember the one FCA meeting he went to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy A testified that Hamilton geve him some of his cards and asked him to distribute the cards to students in school.  (A teacher got wind of that and reported it to the principal, who put a stop to it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy A testified that the Tesla coil contact felt “weird.”  He testified that Freshwater said that the Tesla coil might leave a small mark.  He remembered the daisy chain exercise and the gas tube demonstration.  He said the mark on his arm lasted 2 or 3 minutes before fading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boy B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boy B direct&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the interview/affidavit/seating chart exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, shown the video by Hamilton during their interview, Boy B said he had not seen it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Tesla coil events, he said he didn’t remember the gas tube demonstration.  Asked if he recalled the Tesla coil being used, he replied, “Not really.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Hamilton’s re-enactment, Boy B said he didn’t even remember Zachary getting up.  He didn’t remember the incident of the boy being touchedon the back with the Tesla coil.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked, Boy B said he couldn’t remember if Freshwater mentioned intelligent design, creationism, God, or the Bible.  He didn’t remember if Freshwater ised the “here” code.  Finally (and perhapsnot surprisingly), Boy B didn’t recall seeing a Bible on Fershwater’s desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boy B cross&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cross Boy B volunteered that he does not have a real good memory for that year because, he said unprompted, he was on ADHD medication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boy C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again the interview/affidavit/seating diagram introductory material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy C bought Boy D with him to the interview without either’s parents and without Boy D’s parents even knowing he was going to the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, shown it by Hamilton, Boy C said he had not seen the Watchmaker video before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Hamilton’s dramatic re-enactment, Boy C said he didn’t see that happen and had he seen it he would have jumped up to help the person whose arm was being held down.  Pressed by Hamilton on a hypothetical, Boy C said Zachary would not be telling the truth if he said that happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy C was also a volunteer, and rated the pain as 1 on a 0 to 5 scale.  He testified that he saw no one hurt that day.  He testified that he did not see the boy touched on the back with the Tesla coil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did not hear Freshwater say anything about temporary tattoo or cross marks with reference to the Tesla coil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said he did not hear Freshwater say anything about religion in class, nor did he see the Bible on Freshwater’s desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boy C cross&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked by Millstone, Boy C couldn’t remember who volunteered for the Tesla coil exercise.  Asked if Zachar had volunteered, Boy C replied that he had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked, Boy C now said Freshwater said there may be a temporary mark from the Tesla coil.  He said Freshwater moved the Tesla coil “down and across.”  He said it didn’t leave a mark on him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t recall an evolution/creationism debate.  He didn’t attend FCA.  Asked, he said there were not Ten Commandments posters in Freshwater’s room.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boy D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boy D direct&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minor Boy D’s parents were unaware that he was being interviewed and an affidavit solicited and obtained from him by attorney Hamilton.  He went with Boy C to meet Hamilton, and Hamilton apparently regarded him as a target of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again we covered the interview/affidavit/seating diagram introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, shown the video by Hamilton, Boy D said he’d never seen it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Tesla coil incident, he did not remember the gas tube demonstration.  He was one of the volunteers and testified that it felt like “static.”  He rated it a 0 on the 0-5 pain scale.  Boy D testified that Freshwater said nothing about a temporary tattoo or cross.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing Hamilton’s dramatic re-enactment, Boy D said he didn’t see that.  He said he saw Zachary being zapped.  Pressed for a hypothetical, he said, “I think he’s lying, to tell you the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy D testified that he didn’t know Freshwater had a Bible on his desk, and Freshwater never talked about creationism or intelligent design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boy D cross&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone asked if Hamilton had talked to his parents before the interview along with Boy C.  He answered “No.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Tesla coil incident, he testified that Freshwater asked for volunteers to “see what it felt like.”  People raised their hands and came up when Freshwater called on them.  He doesn’t remember who was first, nor who else volunteered except Boy C.  (Yes, I know that’s different from his direct testimony,)  HE did not recall Freshwater saying it would leave a mark.  He didn’t remember the daisy chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus endeth those two days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next scheduled hearing date is June 2, and they’re tring to get 5 days in before the summer recess.  Yes, my children, we’re recessing for the summer again if we don’t finish by June 8.  I still haven’t heard if the federal trial is going ahead on May 24 given the recent withdrawal of two of Freshwater’s trial attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line: &lt;/strong&gt;when dealing with &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/ultrafundamentalism.html"&gt;fundamentalist religion&lt;/a&gt;, especially when faced with a brand of fundamentalism so whacked out that it preaches violence against critics (such as the modern-day radical “Islamists”), in my view you have but one of two choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Cater to the fundamentalists and watch your liberty slowly slip away, or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. embrace your fundamental freedoms – such as the freedom of inquiry &amp;amp; expression.  This means you’re going to have a fight on your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess which one I choose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t go into a long screed on how I think the South Park guys are just totally badass for having the guts to take on, well, everyone’s goofy beliefs and poke fun at them (even hardcore &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/atheism.html"&gt;atheists&lt;/a&gt; such as Richard Dawkins).  I also won’t waste time pillorying the weak-kneed panzies over at Comedy Central for capitulating to a bunch of idiotic radical Muslims who should be, if anything, basically ignored.  I won’t even take more than this line to point out the obvious: if you cannot handle your religious beliefs being questioned and, sometimes, being ridiculed by non-believers, then you have deeper issues that need to be addressed and should go live on an island in the middle of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of fighting back against this creeping notion that “we cannot criticize the religious beliefs or take a chance on ‘offending’ anyone who holds such belief”, specifically regarding Islam, I want to pass along a really great idea I stumbled upon a few days back: &lt;a href="http://www.jihadwatch.org/2010/04/may-20-everybody-draw-muhammad-day.html"&gt;Draw Muhammad Day (DMD).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 20th, 2010, will mark the first DMD – despite the fact that the cartoonist who originally came up with the idea decided to back out.  It’ll happen regardless, because now the whole idea of DMD has gone completely viral on the Internet.  No doubt that some people will take this opportunity to draw the prophet Muhammad in a less-than-glamorous light, such as outlined by this image…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/muhammad_cartoon.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="muhammad_cartoon" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/muhammad_cartoon.jpg?w=249&amp;amp;h=304" alt="" width="249" height="304"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… and I’m sure that some jerks will come up with many much more offensive images than that which are specifically designed to offend.  Fine by me – being a jerk is well within the bounds of free speech; but, in my view, being a jerk isn’t what DMD should be about… it should be about promoting free inquiry/expression.  What is bothersome to me, more than anything, is the notion among some of these radical Muslims that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; depiction of Muhammad is somehow offensive, and that to spare them from “offense” everyone else (including many moderate Muslims) should cater to their whims.  It is also worth noting that the image of Muhammad has been depicted countless times over the course of history, even by various Muslim cultures – this is an important detail the radicals would rather have you not know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;For example,&lt;a href="http://zombietime.com/mohammed_image_archive/misc_mo/"&gt; take a look at this page which outlines a series of images of Muhammad in various contexts&lt;/a&gt; (none of which label him as a terrorist, btw).  My favorite is the depiction of Muhammad as one of the traditional law-givers on the frieze of the Supreme Court building in Washington, DC…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/scotusnfrieze.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img title="scotusnfrieze" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/scotusnfrieze.jpeg?w=444&amp;amp;h=426" alt="" width="444" height="426"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://zombietime.com/mohammed_image_archive/islamic_mo_full/"&gt;Not to mention the various depictions of Muhammad by a wide variety of Muslim artists over the centuries.&lt;/a&gt; In 1999, Islamic art expert Wijdan Ali wrote a scholarly overview of the  Muslim tradition of depicting Muhammad, which can be downloaded &lt;a href="http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/anpt/ejos/pdf4/07Ali.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in pdf format. In that essay, Ali demonstrates  that the prohibition against depicting Muhammad did not arise until as  late as the 16th or 17th century, despite the media’s recent false  claims that it has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; been forbidden for Muslims to draw  Muhammad. Until comparatively recently in Islamic history, it was  perfectly common to show Muhammad, either in full, or with his face hidden. Even after  the 17th century, up to modern times, Islamic depictions of Muhammad  (especially in Shi’ite areas) continued to be produced.  Here are some examples (all captions were copied from &lt;a href="http://zombietime.com/mohammed_image_archive/misc_mo/"&gt;the source site&lt;/a&gt;)…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/mo1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="mo1" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/mo1.jpg?w=439&amp;amp;h=263" alt="" width="439" height="263"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Illustration showing Muhammad (on the right) preaching his final sermon  to his earliest converts, on Mount Ararat near Mecca; taken from a  medieval-era manuscript of the astronomical treatise &lt;em&gt;The Remaining  Signs of Past Centuries&lt;/em&gt; by the Persian scholar &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni"&gt;al-Biruni&lt;/a&gt;;  currently housed in the collection of &lt;a href="http://expositions.bnf.fr/livrarab/grands/0_01.htm"&gt;the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Manuscrits  Arabe 1489 fol. 5v&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/jami_al-tawarikh_gabriel.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Jami_al-Tawarikh_Gabriel" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/jami_al-tawarikh_gabriel.jpg?w=441&amp;amp;h=331" alt="" width="441" height="331"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Muhammad receiving his first revelation from the angel Gabriel.  Miniature illustration on vellum from the book &lt;em&gt;Jami’ al-Tawarikh&lt;/em&gt; (literally “&lt;em&gt;Compendium of Chronicles&lt;/em&gt;” but often referred to as &lt;em&gt;The  Universal History&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;History of the World&lt;/em&gt;), by Rashid  al-Din, published in Tabriz, Persia, 1307 A.D. Now in the collection of  the Edinburgh University Library, Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/mo-mural.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="mo-mural" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/mo-mural.jpg?w=249&amp;amp;h=247" alt="" width="249" height="247"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hamshahri.org/vijenam/javan/1384/841115/panke3.htm"&gt;This Iranian site&lt;/a&gt; contains a photograph of a mural  which appears to depict Muhammad (sixth picture down) on a contemporary  building in Iran. The mural shows Buraq (the animal that carried  Muhammad on his Night Voyage, described as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buraq"&gt;being white  and having the face of a woman and the tail of a peacock&lt;/a&gt;, which this  creature is and does) carrying a figure who could therefore only be  Muhammad. A word-for-word transliteration of the Farsi caption to that  picture is (according to &lt;a href="http://www.1-800-translate.com/machine_trans/"&gt;this  automated translation site)&lt;/a&gt;, “The Messenger mounted mainland shiny  door village (&lt;em&gt;yzdlaan&lt;/em&gt;) (&lt;em&gt;kvyry&lt;/em&gt;) village blinds to ascension  wine river,” which obviously doesn’t translate well but which does make  mention of “The Messenger,” a traditional epithet for Muhammad (as the  messenger of Allah). Note: this image is hosted on the Web site of the  Iranian newspaper &lt;em&gt;Hamshahri&lt;/em&gt;, which is &lt;a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/02/07/news/web.0207toon.iran.php"&gt;sponsoring a contest of cartoons about the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; as an outraged response to the publication of the Muhammad cartoons in  the West. Yet the newspaper itself is currently displaying this  depiction of Muhammad. (&lt;a href="http://www.hamshahri.org/vijenam/javan/1384/841115/024864.jpg"&gt;This image&lt;/a&gt; also on the &lt;a href="http://www.hamshahri.org/vijenam/javan/1384/841115/panke2.htm"&gt;newspaper’s site&lt;/a&gt; appears to be a different modern  image of Muhammad as well.)  [&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: All the images linked to in this caption have now been  taken offline by the &lt;em&gt;Hamshahri&lt;/em&gt; newspaper, apparently after having  been exposed here; the search-engine caches for the pages have also now  expired, meaning that the small photo shown above is the only known  surviving image of this unusual contemporary Muhammad depiction.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/iranian_mosque_mural.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Iranian_mosque_mural" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/iranian_mosque_mural.jpg?w=382&amp;amp;h=484" alt="" width="382" height="484"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This 17th-century mural on the Iman Zahdah Chah Zaid Mosque in Isfahan,  Iran is identified by various sources as depicting either the  assassination of Ali (Muhammad’s cousin) in 661 A.D., or Ali receiving a  blow at the Battle of the Camel five years earlier in 656 A.D. Either  way, it seems that the veiled figure holding up the wounded Ali is  Muhammad himself, or at least his spirit. His facial features are  clearly visible beneath the veil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="mo_gabriel_giant" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/mo_gabriel_giant.jpg?w=386&amp;amp;h=482" alt="" width="386" height="482"&gt;Muhammad (far right) and the Archangel Gabriel standing in front of a  giant angel. From the Miraj-name, Tabriz (c. 1360-70). In the Topkapi  Palace Library, Istanbul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are plenty of other examples available.  My whole point here is that it seems the modern-day Islamic radicals are on a crusade to crush dissent, free expression, and free inquiry not only among the secular critics of Islam in the West, but also those whom would dissent within Islam itself!  It is my profound hope that this coming DMD, May 20th, the numerous &amp;amp; varied depictions of Muhammad which will spring forth over the Internet shall encourage those brave folk within the Islamic world to take up the torch of free inquiry and push back against the fundamentalists who are destroying their religion and their world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**Aside:&lt;/strong&gt; It looks as if some people are getting a head start on DMD.  For example, &lt;a href="http://www.skepticmoney.com/university-of-illinois-students-draw-over-150-images-of-muhammad/"&gt;see how a group of University of Illinois students are already attempting to broaden the discussion.&lt;/a&gt; Hat tip to Phil over at &lt;a href="http://skepticmoney.com"&gt;Skeptic Money&lt;/a&gt; for this news! &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I got this last week and as I’m sure you know, it’s the second law of thermodynamics (the original equation, by Clausius) before -N even represented entropy. This is a strange story, because I’m not a physics or math major, I’m a female philosophy person. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I really do love physics though, and I’m about to leave my home country and all my undergrad friends behind and go and do my MSc at LSE. So the sentiment behind this is that now, after undergrad, we begin to disseminate. Entropy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s also a great boyfriend filtration system:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Can I have your number?’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Wait, what’s this mean?’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Um… I don’t know?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Too bad, you were cute’ (walk off)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What did animals do to deserve their pain? I argue that it doesn't matter one whit whether humans inflict this pain on them or whether God did. There can be no moral justification for it at all, none. I also consider whether these animals, all of them, will be compensated in heaven for their sufferings, as some Christians have affirmed. All you need to do is imagine what a heaven would be like with fish in it, for example, and you can see the silliness of the whole concept. Besides, merely compensating creatures for their sufferings cannot morally justify their sufferings, otherwise we could justify torturing any sentient being by simply compensating them afterward.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-5604863694765244701?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It&amp;#39;s been nearly 50 years since Jane Goodall made the observations that inspired these words. Today, they are still true—chimpanzees are second only to humans in the variety of tools they use and the innovative ways they employ those tools. 

Since Jane Goodall&amp;#39;s pioneering work began in the early 1960s, she and other scientists have discovered that chimpanzees not only use tools, they combine them, use them in sequence, and create new tools from various subcomponents.

This is the kind of hunger that comes from not buying a pair of shoes in at least 2 weeks.  Much longer and I am going to start developing a rash or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I am in love with these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I *heart* these so?  I think that they remind me of what a huge fan I was of Jem and the Holograms when I was a kid...&lt;/p&gt;

Posts in the first few weeks discussed the road to becoming a self-identified skeptic, distinguishing between philosophical and scientific skepticism, public perceptions of science, and a particularly interesting piece on &lt;a href="http://woofighters.org/2010/04/a-brief-introduction-to-youth-perception-of-the-skeptic-community-somethings-not-quite-right/"&gt;counterproductive divisiveness&lt;/a&gt; within the skeptical community.  I also urge you to read &lt;a href="http://woofighters.org/2010/04/my-inspiration/"&gt;Drescher’s account&lt;/a&gt; of where she drew the inspiration from that led to her worldview and projects like the Woo Fighters. Like many, her early understanding of rational skepticism was informed by the work of James Randi on The Tonight Show.  I hope all of the Woo Fighters stay inspired and have some success in their new endeavor.</summary><author><name>mblanford@randi.org (Michael Blanford)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272842484877"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c2095fb399943dc5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Your Next Iced Latte Could Come From The Abominable Snowman</title><published>2010-04-30T17:44:15Z</published><updated>2010-04-30T17:44:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/973-your-next-iced-latte-could-come-from-the-abomniable-snowman.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Fsgjtwr-vm0&amp;amp;width=346&amp;amp;height=286" width="346" height="286"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watched it? Good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re now one of hundreds of thousands of people who&amp;#39;ve seen the &amp;quot;Oriental Yeti&amp;quot; that was discovered in early April. If you Google &amp;quot;Oriental Yeti,&amp;quot; you&amp;#39;ll come across &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/7557799/Oriental-yeti-discovered-in-China.html" title="this article from the Telegraph UK"&gt;this article from the&lt;em&gt; Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; UK&lt;/a&gt;, which tells the "whole story." And an article from &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; UK claims that "&lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/biology_evolution/article7088318.ece" title="Scientists Are Baffled"&gt;Scientists Are Baffled&lt;/a&gt;." I wonder if there's a number to call to find an anonymous baffled scientist — they seem to turn up quite frequently in these tales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing that like me, you don't think the animal in the video looks very much like the Yeti or Abominable Snowman we came to know and love on&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDExN_V7-TY" title="Scooby Doo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scooby Doo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There's a reason for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article claims that the creature was sent to a lab in Shanghai for DNA identification. But a couple of skeptics posited, and a Chinese naturalists confirmed, that this creature is not actually a Yeti. It is, in fact, a coffee enhancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I contacted Blake Smith of the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/podcasts/monstertalk/" title="MonsterTalk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MonsterTalk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; podcast to ask him what he thought about this case. He pointed me to &lt;a href="http://www.atlantaskeptics.com/2010/04/06/yet-another-hairless-cryptid/" title="this link"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;, which suggested that maybe a creature in the family &lt;em&gt;Viverridae &lt;/em&gt;contracted sarcoptic mange, which caused it to lose its fur. This condition is caused by a truly horrific animal, the &lt;a href="http://www.fcps.edu/islandcreekes/ecology/sarcoptic_mange_mite.htm" title="sarcoptic mite"&gt;sarcoptic mite&lt;/a&gt;, which looks far scarier than any bipedal hominid I&amp;#39;ve encountered. &lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/yeti-mangy-monster-sightings.html" title="Ben Radford also wrote on this"&gt;Ben Radford also wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the creature, and consulted Loren Coleman, a well-known cryptozooligist, for his opinion. Again, Coleman thought it might be something from &lt;em&gt;Viverridae.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, videos are being created and articles written proposing that a new animal has been discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s little doubt now that the creature is, in fact, a &amp;quot;civet cat.&amp;quot; Though the common name for the animal has &amp;quot;cat&amp;quot; in it, it&amp;#39;s not closely related to the feline family. In fact, the civets are little known to westerners. However, this animal has received a lot of attention lately because if its dietary habits. It seems that, like humans, the creature enjoys a good caffeine buzz. Allegedly, the animal is picky, and only chooses the best coffee drupes to eat. Enzymes in the animals digestive tract help mellow the beans, and out they come in the normal mammalian fashion. Famers then collect, &amp;quot;sanitize,&amp;quot; and dry them. Gathered up by the pound, they sell for as much as &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YV8LPY?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=thejamesrandi-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002YV8LPY"&gt;$55 a pound on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, your next iced latte could come from the abominable snowman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s time for the media to stop reporting on every afflicted animal it encounters. &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7076192.stm" title="Mangy coyotes"&gt;Mangy coyotes&lt;/a&gt; have been alleged to be proof of El Chupacabra and a &lt;a href="http://www.cryptomundo.com/wp-content/Beast1a.jpg" title="mangy chow"&gt;mangy chow&lt;/a&gt; was thought to be some sort of &lt;a href="http://www.cryptomundo.com/cryptozoo-news/maines-dog-killing-hyena/"&gt;murderous hyena&lt;/a&gt; for a time. Animals are often completely covered with fur, and when they lose that fur, they look alien to us. The media is all-to-eager to report on the &amp;quot;strange animal&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s terrorizing the countryside, but will seldom report the &amp;quot;mangy raccoon&amp;quot; that lived a wretched existence and died. In fact, they&amp;#39;re the same story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Fox News is giving credence to &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,591747,00.html" title="breatharianism"&gt;breatharianism&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;quot;We Report. You Decide.&amp;quot; Well, I&amp;#39;ve decided: We can&amp;#39;t trust the media. Mark Twain got his start by writing fake news stories on slow days. One &lt;a href="http://www.historybuff.com/library/refpetrification.html" title="famous example is here"&gt;famous example is here&lt;/a&gt;. While I can't go so far as to call these stories "fake," I am charging the mainstream media with reporting stories for the sole purpose of gaining market share, and doing so at the expense of journalism. While I doubt few skeptics were taken in by the "Oriental Yeti," many people believed it. And many more believe in breatharianism now that Fox News has weighed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have a solution except to keep reminding people not to believe everything they read, and to keep directing people to skeptics' sites for a more complete picture of whatever oddment is being reported. One by one, we'll make a difference. But I think we could make a bigger difference if more journalists employed a bit of skepticism in their reportage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Rant over. Enjoy your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

The request sounds quite massive, according to the Hook:
Among the documents Cuccinelli demands are any and all emailed or written correspondence between or relating to Mann and more than 40 climate scientists, documents supporting any of five applications for the $484,875 in grants, and evidence of any documents that no longer exist along with proof of why, when, and how they were destroyed or disappeared.

The request also appears to cover a six year period.

This is clearly another attempt to make fire out of the mere smoke that was ClimateGate. But remember, so far, Mann has been vindicated by his university. In this context, I don't see how one can possibly justify putting scientists through such an extensive and burdensome inquiry. There is obviously strong potential for a chilling effect on their research.

I am sure this post will prompt a lot of comments--so, be good.....&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/4s14o3slbqnbbtt5h00bhpgldc/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fintersection%2F2010%2F05%2F02%2Fattack-on-climate-scientists%2F" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272831379860"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=23839">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/52e77905c30667ac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheist Parenting"/><category term="General"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Atheism and Diabetes</title><published>2010-05-02T20:00:59Z</published><updated>2010-05-02T20:00:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/02/atheism-and-diabetes/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;40-Year-Old-Atheist&lt;/strong&gt; has a son with Type I Diabetes.  Recently, he went to a conference for families dealing with the same issue and &lt;a href="http://40yearoldatheist.com/why-me-daddy/2010/05/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+40YearOldAtheist+%2840+Year+Old+Atheist%29"&gt;he encountered a lot of religious families&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That set him apart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I do not ask “Why him?”. Not ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that very question was asked (or at least implied) by several people over the course of the day. It started with the Keynote speaker who frequently invoked God in trying to give comfort to us. “God has a plan” he’d say. “Your child’s diabetes is God’s way of strengthening your character” he’d say.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;40-Year-Old-Atheist knows why his son has diabetes.  It may not be as comforting as thinking a god has some special plan in motion, but at least it’s honest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The reason our sons have diabetes is that one in four hundred children get diabetes and, unfortunately, our children drew the short stick in the statistical lottery. Our sons becoming diabetic is no different from the fact that one in eight women get breast cancer, or that one in four men are bald by the time they are 30. There is no ‘why me?’ to these statistics –- they simply describe the fact that shit happens in predictable frequencies within the population.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know being on the short end of the stick isn’t the greatest feeling ever.  But sometimes, that works in our favor, too.  (We’re alive, aren’t we?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it discomforting, anyway, to think a god’s special plan for me or my family involves our health or physical well-being not being as good as it should be.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Every weekend, I try to bring something light to you, but there's a lot of heavy stuff going on in the world right now.  So instead of the usual, I'd like to tell you just a little bit about why putting even a &lt;i&gt;little&lt;/i&gt; bit of oil in the oceans can be so disastrous.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I can't think of a better modern voice to take us through that than &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regina_Spektor"&gt;Regina Spektor&lt;/a&gt;, whose voice reminds me of greats such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Simone"&gt;Nina Simone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Fitzgerald"&gt;Ella Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;.  Take a listen to her song &lt;i&gt;Apres Moi&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_why_is_oil_i/07%20Apres%20Moi%201.mp3"&gt;Apres Moi&lt;/a&gt; by Regina Spektor&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Most of you know that if you take pretty much any type of oil, it will float on top of water.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_why_is_oil_i/oilandwater.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_why_is_oil_i/oilandwater-thumb-500x319-48193.jpg" width="500" height="319" alt="oilandwater.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if the amount of water you have is much, much larger than the amount of oil that you have?  It turns out that the oil will spread out over the surface as much as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much is as much as possible?  Until the oil on the surface of the water is just &lt;b&gt;one molecule thick&lt;/b&gt;.  So, how thick is one molecule of oil?  Believe it or not, Ben Franklin was the first person to measure it, and you can measure it, too!  All you need is some oil, an eyedropper, and a flat, clean body of water.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_why_is_oil_i/eyedropper.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_why_is_oil_i/eyedropper-thumb-500x316-48196.jpeg" width="500" height="316" alt="eyedropper.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eyedropper is great, because a single drop of anything that comes out of an eyedropper is going to be almost exactly one milliliter of volume, or one cubic millimeter.  That's &lt;i&gt;tiny&lt;/i&gt;, isn't it?  You'd have to line up &lt;i&gt;one thousand drops&lt;/i&gt; in a line to get something one meter (a little over three feet) long.  But when you drop just a &lt;i&gt;single drop&lt;/i&gt; into a flat pool of water, it spreads out to make a circle that's huge!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_why_is_oil_i/oildropexperiment.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_why_is_oil_i/oildropexperiment-thumb-500x191-48198.jpg" width="500" height="191" alt="oildropexperiment.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This single drop, which was just a millimeter in size (about 1/25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of an inch), now spreads out to a diameter of &lt;b&gt;24 feet&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;over seven meters&lt;/b&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I work out my math, that means a single molecule of oil is only about &lt;b&gt;2 nanometers&lt;/b&gt; (or 20 Angstroms) thick!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Beware of &lt;a href="http://www.worsleyschool.net/science/files/molecular/thickness.html"&gt;the number one hit on google&lt;/a&gt;, which unwittingly uses far less than a milliliter of water in their experiment, and gets an answer that's almost 50 times too large!)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, what does that mean if -- instead of a &lt;i&gt;drop&lt;/i&gt; of oil -- I dump an entire &lt;b&gt;gallon&lt;/b&gt; of oil into a large body of water?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_why_is_oil_i/1920s%201%20Gallon%20Can.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_why_is_oil_i/1920s%201%20Gallon%20Can-thumb-500x638-48200.jpeg" width="500" height="638" alt="1920s 1 Gallon Can.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would spread out to make a circle that was &lt;b&gt;450 meters&lt;/b&gt; in diameter.  That's over a &lt;i&gt;quarter of a mile&lt;/i&gt;.  From just one gallon (about 3.8 liters).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what about the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/us/29spill.html"&gt;Oil Leak&lt;/a&gt; which is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/casaubonsbook/2010/04/drill_babyoops.php"&gt;spilling oil&lt;/a&gt; into the gulf of Mexico right now?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_why_is_oil_i/29spill_337-span-articleLarge.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_why_is_oil_i/29spill_337-span-articleLarge-thumb-500x275-48202.jpeg" width="500" height="275" alt="29spill_337-span-articleLarge.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;i&gt;currently&lt;/i&gt; spilling an estimated 200,000 gallons of oil into the gulf of Mexico &lt;i&gt;every day&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, every day, a new 125,000 square kilometers (or 50,000 square miles) of ocean will eventually get coated in oil when it finishes spreading out.  That's almost as big as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York"&gt;New York State&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practically, of course, this much oil won't spread out to be one molecule thick; more like 100 molecules thick in most places, but that's still a &lt;i&gt;huge&lt;/i&gt; disaster!  Many of you will remember the Exxon Valdez spill and the consequences this caused:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_why_is_oil_i/PWS_tanker_oil_spill.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_why_is_oil_i/PWS_tanker_oil_spill-thumb-500x319-48204.jpeg" width="500" height="319" alt="PWS_tanker_oil_spill.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the one in the Gulf of Mexico, as I write this, is only &lt;b&gt;seventeen miles&lt;/b&gt; away from the Mississippi Delta.  It's one thing to look at pictures of animals killed from an oil spill.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_why_is_oil_i/Exxon%27s%20oil%20coated%20this%20dead%20whale.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_why_is_oil_i/Exxon%27s%20oil%20coated%20this%20dead%20whale-thumb-500x386-48206.jpeg" width="500" height="386" alt="Exxon&amp;#39;s oil coated this dead whale.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't only about animals this time.  This isn't happening in a corner of the world where very few people live.  This is happening in a place that will affect millions of people.  And by time this leak is fixed, we may well exceed the total volume dumped by the 1989 spill.  This is about your world, your oceans, your environment and for many of you, your own health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/05/weekend_diversion_why_is_oil_i.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272823757011"><id gr:original-id="http://madlabrat.blogspot.com/2010/05/modelling-virotherapy-for-cancer.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b4ca25a71d712bc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Modelling Virotherapy for Cancer</title><published>2010-05-02T13:00:01Z</published><updated>2010-05-02T13:00:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/jfgCTEYyu_w/modelling-virotherapy-for-cancer.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://madlabrat.blogspot.com/2010/05/modelling-virotherapy-for-cancer.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Most cancer-related research, particularly medical cancer-related research tends for rather obvious reasons to involve animal research, and while I'm more than willing to agree that it's a necessary sacrifice it does always make me feel a bit squeamish on a personal level. Which was why the first thing that struck me when a certain jazz-playing poetry-writing philosopher-doctor sent this paper my way was that it was involved in developing a mathematical model for treatments. Not to replace animal testing, obviously, but to cut the tests down to those that were more likely to work, reducing the need for animal use.The paper is exploring glioma virotherapy, which uses synthetic viral capsules to target cancer cells and kill them, while not harming the surrounding normal cells. These viruses are known as ontolytic viruses and while they may originate from harmful strains they've had almost all of their own DNA knocked out, turning them into little balls of protein designed to target cancer cells only. This approach has several problems associated with it, but one of the main ones is that the human body generally doesn't like having virus's inside it. Any injected cancer-targeting virus capsids are in danger or being effectively destroyed by the bodies immune system.One solution to this is to use immunosuppressants, which naturally comes with problems of its own, including the question of dosage. How much immunosuppressant do you give the patient, depending on the corresponding number of viruses used, and the size of the cancer. In order to explore this without having to kill huge numbers of rats, Friedman and colleagues developed a model to explore the effects of differing virus and immunosuppressant concentrations.First, they needed to specify the parameters they were using: Number of tumour cells infected with virus = y Number of tumour cells uninfected = x Necrotic (dying) cells = n Immune cells (destroying the viruses) = z Free virus particles = vThen some rates to take into account: Proliferation of non-infected cells = λ Infection rate of tumour cells = B Diffusion coefficient of virus particles = DAdding this all together with some mathematical magic (and a function to include immunosuppressant levels) leads to what is to me a totally incomprehensible series of mathematical squiggles (anyone whose desperate to read them can find them in the appendix of the reference paper below). But somewhere along the line the magic works, as seen when they compare it to experimental data:The table above (from the reference) isn't remarkably clear, suffice to say that the blue bars are the actual experiment results (carried out in rats) while the red bars are the results of the model simulation. Graph A shows infected tumour cells (after 6 and 72 hours), graph B shows immune cells (after 6 hours 72 hours and just before the rat dies) while graph C shows the immune cells after addition of the immunosuppressant (after 6 hours, 72 hours, and just before the rat dies). The x-axis shows the percentage of cells.Having got a model that shows a reasonable degree of accuracy, the experimenters can then play around with the parameters without any more rats having too be involved. For example they can explore the effects of adding more viruses. More viruses in the system increase the immune cell response, even in suppressed patients (although obviously the response is lessened). However as the numbers of viruses decrease, the immune cells start to leave the area, allowing any viruses that have survived to quickly recover the population and the immune cells rush back in again. This leads to a feedback loop which, with my knowledge of the effects of the immune system, can't be all that good for the patient.The results below from the model show the effect  of adding varying amounts of virus on the number of infected tumour cells.The cyclical pattern can be clearly seen, especially for the larger numbers of viruses (the blue, red and green lines represent increasing numbers of virus's injected into the system - as the colours are rather faint the blue line is the mostly straight one, the red line is the bumpy one and the green 'line' is a series of peaks). The model was also used to explore different concentrations of immunosuppressant and different dosage schedules (one a  week, twice a week etc.) for treatment. There are limitations to the model, it only considers injections into the centre of spherical tumours, for example, and does nothing to model any potential problems caused by metastasis (bits of the tumour breaking off and moving away). However is does provide the framework of a system to explore different options for bench experimentation, to ensure that any work that is done on animals will be the useful and relevant for the development of this system into a working treatment for human cancers.---Friedman, A.

It is just that, given the limitations imposed upon us (until we invent the time machine, that is), we cannot detect “probable miracles” even if they happened! Historical inquiry cannot touch them, even if time travel would show them to have been real!...Faith claims to be able to do an end-run around the data and to obtain certainty about an ostensible miracle via some other way. But what way is that? It is, I think, nothing more than &lt;i&gt;the will to believe&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hume already allows us to accept a miracle report, provided any naturalistic explanation would sound even more far-fetched than a supernatural one. In appealing to the universal facts of human experience, Hume is being neither deductive nor circular. He is merely appealing to what everyone knows: the frequent reports of the extraordinary we hear from UFO abductees, Loch Ness Monster fans, people who see ghosts or who claim psychic powers, always seem to turn out to be bunk upon examination.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The molecule is caffeine, and the tattoo itself was designed by artist Glendon Mellow of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://glendonmellow.blogspot.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Flying Trilobite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.  I got it to celebrate my PhD. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Why caffeine, you ask?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) I had a friend once tell me that my friendship was like a hot cup of coffee.  Warm, vivacious, stimulating, and comforting.  It was one of the best compliments I ever received.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) I have spent the last six years of my life studying drugs in various forms.  Caffeine always spoke to me as a stimulant, because it is so different from other traditional drugs classified as stimulants.  I’ve always been a little different myself.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) I also spent the past six years studying various neurotransmitters.  I will spend more years studying different neurotransmitters.  Which ones I study and why will change over time, but caffeine will be with me through all of it.  &lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I think it was a compilation of so many shots to a kid that obviously had some autoimmune disorders. So I would say &lt;strong&gt;maybe a couple of months, a month or so after the MMR, I started to notice some physical ailments&lt;/strong&gt; such as constipation, rashes, eczema. &lt;strong&gt;That was like the first little sign&lt;/strong&gt;. And then the train just kind of descended from there.  [My bold.]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jenny is saying that her son’s autism didn’t start immediately after just one shot (the MMR), but that “some physical ailments” of autism appeared over “a couple of months.”  This was just “the first little sign.”  (Note, just a “little” sign at that point.)  But, here’s the thing, as I wrote in &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2010/02/the-two-jb-handleys.html"&gt;The Two J.B. Handleys&lt;/a&gt;, Jenny had, only three years ago, stated quite clearly and unambiguously something very different: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Right before his MMR shot, I said to the doctor, &amp;#39;I have a very bad feeling about this shot. This is the autism shot, isn&amp;#39;t it?&amp;#39; And he said, &amp;#39;No, that is ridiculous. It is a mother&amp;#39;s desperate attempt to blame something,&amp;#39; and he swore at me, and then the nurse gave [Evan] the shot,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;And I remember going, &amp;#39;Oh, God, I hope he&amp;#39;s right.&amp;#39; &lt;strong&gt;And soon thereafter -- boom -- the soul&amp;#39;s gone from his eyes.  &lt;/strong&gt;[My bold.]  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note, not “some physical ailments” or just a “little sign” – back then it was “the soul&amp;#39;s gone from his eyes” which, I think you’ll agree, is completely different.  Also not over “a couple of months,” but “boom.”  Different story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why does this matter?  Well, Jenny, Handley and the rest have been telling us for years that the reason they know vaccines cause autism is that their kids got autism “boom” right after the vaccine was given.  (With Handley it was after a shot containing Thimerosal, while with Jenny it was MMR which never had Thimerosal, but we’ll gloss over that for now.)  Now that Wakefield’s MMR hypothesis has been discredited, and numerous epidemiological studies have failed to find a link with Thimerosal, the only way to keep their vaccines-cause-autism  claims alive is to &lt;em&gt;move the goalposts&lt;/em&gt;.  And you see that in the Frontline program – Jenny says it’s not MMR, or Thimerosal, or too many vaccines at once – it’s “all of the above.”  She actually says she doesn’t know what it is that’s causing autism, but she knows it’s the vaccines, somehow.  But the thing is, if they’re now saying the signs of autism appeared gradually over several months, on what basis are they saying vaccines cause autism?  If autism appeared gradually, and not “boom” after one shot, then they don’t even have the correlation (vaccine immediately followed by autism) to rely on.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And what’s more, &lt;em&gt;they know they’ve changed their story and they know they’ve moved the goalposts&lt;/em&gt;.  Why do I say that?  Well, when I wrote &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2010/02/the-two-jb-handleys.html"&gt;The Two J.B. Handleys&lt;/a&gt; less than ten weeks ago, I included a link to the interview with the Jenny “boom” quote on Jenny’s own Generation Rescue site, &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org/evan.html"&gt;Jenny: Evan&amp;#39;s Story&lt;/a&gt;.  Check that link now.  Search Generation Rescue for any part of that interview.  &lt;strong&gt;It’s gone&lt;/strong&gt;.  Disappeared.  Never happened.  Not part of the official anti-vaccine history any more.  (And I know Handley read that post and saw the link because &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2010/02/the-two-jb-handleys.html?cid=6a00d83451df0c69e201310f44d9c7970c#comment-6a00d83451df0c69e201310f44d9c7970c"&gt;he appeared in the comments&lt;/a&gt; four days after I wrote it in an attempt to defend himself.)  If you needed any more proof of the dishonesty and intellectual bankruptcy of Generation Rescue and the anti-vaccine kooks, there it is.  Fortunately for us, there is one thing that George Orwell didn’t imagine when he wrote his famous 1984 novel, and that’s the Wayback Machine – the cache that never lets anyone completely disappear inconvenient facts they want you to forget.  Courtesy of the internet, here again is what Jenny said in 2007, &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080405214005/http://generationrescue.org/evan.html"&gt;Jenny: Evan&amp;#39;s Story – “a&lt;strong&gt;nd soon thereafter -- boom -- the soul&amp;#39;s gone from his eyes.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hallmark of the pseudo-scientist and the kook, is they they won’t change their beliefs no matter what the evidence, instead they devise ad hoc explanations and move goalposts to accommodate contradictory evidence.  Jenny and Handley have been caught, again, doing just that.  Rather than re-evaluate their beliefs, they just change their previous story so that it fits the currently known facts.  And they try to cover their tracks by deleting the now embarrassing things they said before.  Rather strangely, they fail to notice that, with their new story, there is no longer any reason to link vaccines to autism.  Either autism occurred “boom” just after the shot (and so they can point to correlation), or it didn’t.  Which is it?  They want it both ways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, there was one thing in that PBS interview with Jenny, that I though she got right.  It was this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;…that night went on Google and typed in &amp;quot;autism.&amp;quot; And on the corner of the screen, in the sponsored links, it said, &amp;quot;Generation Rescue.&amp;quot; And I decided to click on it, because right underneath it, it said, &amp;quot;Autism is reversible.&amp;quot; And I thought to myself, well, this must be a load of crap, because if it was true, why didn&amp;#39;t the best neurologist in the world tell me there&amp;#39;s something I could do to reverse autism?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Precisely.  And if she’s only stopped right there she could have avoided making a complete fool of herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272821714574"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=3260">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6a2b2d576cc234e4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All About Me"/><category term="Australia"/><category term="Blogroll"/><category term="Challenges to Science"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Events"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Podcasting"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Religion"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Technology"/><category term="#boobquake"/><category term="activism"/><category term="Desiree Schell"/><category term="feminism"/><category term="Michael McRae"/><category term="news"/><category term="outreach"/><category term="protests"/><category term="Science communication"/><category term="skeptically speaking"/><category term="Token Skeptic"/><title type="html">New Token Skeptic Episode Out!

&lt;p&gt;This particular episode is another conversation with Science Communicator and the ‘Science By Email’ editor, Michael McRae, about the &lt;a href="http://www.blaghag.com/2010/04/and-boobquake-experiment-has-begun.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;#boobquake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; day, held on the 26th April. You can hear him on &lt;a href="http://www.tokenskeptic.org"&gt;previous episodes, #9 and #10&lt;/a&gt;, also about science communication and skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also, &lt;a href="http://virtualds.wordpress.com/"&gt;thanks to the Virtual Drinking Skeptically chat&lt;/a&gt; which inspired me, have &lt;a href="http://skepticallyspeaking.com/"&gt;Desiree Schell of Skeptically Speaking included!&lt;/a&gt; As a community outreach worker, she brings her own experiences in terms of rallies and protests – what did she think and what did fellow feminists and skeptics say to her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he published an essay on the &lt;a href="http://shethought.com/2010/04/30/the-rise-of-the-placebo-protest/"&gt;SheThought site&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to clear up a few things in my mind in regards to what really was happening, was it about communicating science, as some claimed – or was it something that really showed how not many of us are reflecting on the impact of actions skeptics take? It’s more conversational than ‘interview’ with the pair – so I hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;This is Chook, our male Superb Lyrebird at Adelaide Zoo.

&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://www.greenr.ca/"&gt;Greenr&lt;/a&gt;, a green living website that focuses on practical ways to help make the planet more eco-friendly – starting with your home and personal life, but extending to technology, transportation, and global issues (like the recent disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today we like &lt;a href="http://www.greenr.ca/"&gt;Greenr&lt;/a&gt; for telling us about two super-cool eco-conscious inventions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– The “&lt;a href="http://www.greenr.ca/harness-energy-with-the-soccket-soccer-ball/"&gt;sOccket&lt;/a&gt;,” a soccer ball that generates electricity the more it’s kicked around during play – developed by four Harvard women students in their engineering class (think soccer-obsessed developing nations that lack reliable electrical grids).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– A &lt;a href="http://www.greenr.ca/generate-energy-with-a-jump-rope-flashlight/"&gt;jump rope&lt;/a&gt; that harnesses skipping energy and funnels it into an LED flashlight that’s actually one of the jump rope’s handles – designed by Hyun Joo Lee and Eu Tteum Lee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first show was about the Big Bang, and hits all the right notes. The graphics are pretty good — that’s &lt;em&gt;de rigeur&lt;/em&gt; for modern TV shows — but the music is nice, too. The writing is engaging, and Mike Rowe is a terrific narrator. All in all, I recommend it… tonight’s (Sunday) episode is about black holes. I have word that a certain Bad Astronomer is interviewed for that one… and I did a bunch of other topics for them as well, so I assume you’ll be seeing more of me on the show in later episodes, too! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has banned here for a long time. He&amp;#39;s banned just about everywhere, which he complains bitterly about, but it&amp;#39;s entirely because he&amp;#39;s obsessive and insane and repetitive — even the ID/creationist blogs can&amp;#39;t stand him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he&amp;#39;s been dunning me with email, apparently. He&amp;#39;s usually yelling at me to pay attention to him, and spamming links to one of his blogs…usually to some specific comment at his blog, because, as is par for the course, his blogs have almost no actual entries, just long mumbling rants by himself in the comment threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he's been so persistent that I'll give him a moment's attention, just to taunt him. Because he's such an ass, though, I'm going to torment him by deleting all the links he sent me. Trust me, they all say the same thing: "I love it so," and various permutations of his claim that evolution is finished, and that he has proven it wrong. He hasn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just the most recent of his missives. There are many more, but I've deleted them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;22 April:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey PeeZee,
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Why don't you call the attention of your drooling retards to the emails you get from me? I'll look for it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;27 April:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;30 April:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;PeeZee
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Why don't you rate my book? I'm sure your fans would love to see you destroy it. I will look for it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;30 April:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pee Zee
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I see you, like Dawkins and Elsberry, go right on petending I don't exist. That won't work  any longer. You clowns are finished. Now get cracking  and recognize that you have been mortally wounded. The longer you ignore me and my sources the worse it wll be for you. I will see to it. Trust me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 May:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear PeeZee
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
How does it feel to realize that everything you believe is about to be exposed as meaningless drivel? It must be awful for you. Check out my Why Banishment? thread from time to time. There you will discover that thegang@pandasthumb.com refuses to accept my emails, a response in itself. Lynn Margulis has resorted to the same  desperate device. If you Darwinian mystics think you can continue your time honored tradition of ignoring your real adversaries, you are all very sadly mistaken. It is crunch time PeeZee. Gird your loins. The longer you insist on silence the worse it will be for you. I will see to it and will enjoy every moment of it! Trust me.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Cheers
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
John&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's just getting crazier and crazier, and now he's beginning to sound like that other banned kook, Dennis Markuze.&lt;/p&gt;

I was pleased to arrive just in time to hear Jessica Palmer of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bioephemera"&gt;Bioephemera blog&lt;/a&gt; talk about her experiences creating a space that explores the intersection between  science and art.  Getting to meet my sister blogger was one of the real highlights of the event.  She is one fierce chick and I have been a long time fan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="unruly democracy.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/unruly%20democracy.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="450" height="582"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: The poster from Unruly Democracy.  Hats off to the people who designed it. I've never been invited to a seminar or symposium with such a fierce poster.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I am still trying to synthesize my thoughts.  It was a bit of a whirlwind day for me, but I am grateful to the Harvard Kennedy Business School for having the trust to invite someone whose real name they don't know and to folks like &lt;a href="http://inversesquare.wordpress.com/"&gt;Tom Levenson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://inversesquare.wordpress.com/"&gt;Kimberly Isbell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026852.500-why-its-not-as-simple-as-god-vs-the-multiverse.html"&gt;Amanda Gefter&lt;/a&gt; for holding down an incredible panel that included one exhausted Isis the Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am mostly grateful to Tom Levenson for medicating one exhausted Dr. Isis post-panel with an evening that included a top-down, red sports car, a battle axe, Tom Levenson's blood, Star Wars legos and copious scotch (see &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/drisis"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for a recount of the evening).  How could anyone &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; think that sounds like the greatest night ever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, battle axes aside, you should go read &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bioephemera/2010/05/the_switzerland_problem.php"&gt;Jessica's reflections&lt;/a&gt; on the day's event. My favorite paragraph is this one:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;So where did the workshop end up? With, of all things, a classic 
old-fashioned in-person argument between our own Dr. Isis, speaking on behalf of 
active academic researchers, and the head of MIT's Knight Journalism 
Fellowships, &lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/knight-science/contact/phil.html"&gt;Phil 
Hilts&lt;/a&gt;. Phil Hilts was complaining that many scientists won't serve as 
sources for journalists. Isis quite reasonably asked how a scientist who wants 
to combat a misperception about her science is supposed to do so, if the media 
don't call her. It was like a timewarp back to graduate school, pre-blogosphere, 
when our concerns about graduate students' ability to articulate their science 
and be comfortable with journalists led some colleagues and I to start the &lt;a href="http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/"&gt;Berkeley Science Review&lt;/a&gt;! I really 
appreciated the response by Francesca Grifo of &lt;a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/"&gt;UCS&lt;/a&gt;: she recognized that science journalists 
face challenges (especially in such a tough economy) but also noted that 
scientists aren't generally rewarded for engaging the public, and often don't 
have the toolkit or time to advocate for themselves. There are so many different 
challenges in science communications; blogging is only one of them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An old-fashioned argument involving Isis the Scientist?  Who could have predicted that?  I will simply end by saying that it was a real delight to meet one of my frequent lurker/commenters who told me, &amp;quot;I came because I heard that whenever you are on a panel, people yell at each other.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilarity, but still productive, I think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/05/check_out_bioephemeras_thought.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/2E7VNKGuzeY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272810437738"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2293">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c86e576a3842d24b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Sociolinguistics"/><title type="html">Postural accommodation?</title><published>2010-05-02T14:05:03Z</published><updated>2010-05-02T14:05:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2293" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In reading about the &lt;a href="http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/middlesex-university-in-the-uk-cuts-its-highest-raerated-program-in-its-entirety.html"&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt; at London's Middlesex University to delete its department of philosophy, I came across this video clip, "&lt;a href="http://www.play.mdx.ac.uk/videos/5u68"&gt;WBL gives companies the edge&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, presented by Professor Edward J Esche, Dean of the School of Arts &amp;amp; Education:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know a lot about British varieties of English, so my first reaction to this clip was &amp;quot;wow, there&amp;#39;s some place in England where they talk a lot like midwestern Americans — I wonder where that is?&amp;quot; Then I listened again and thought, &amp;quot;no, this guy must be an American who&amp;#39;s picked up some features of British speech — failing to flap and voice the word-final t&amp;#39;s in &amp;quot;quite a few&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;out of&amp;quot; &amp;quot;quite a bit&amp;quot;; r-lessness in &amp;quot;their staff&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;of course&amp;quot; (though r-fulness is retained in &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;therefore&amp;quot;); the stressed vowel in &amp;quot;often&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot;; something about the dynamics of his falling pitch-accents; etc.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still wasn't sure. So I checked, and sure enough, &lt;a href="http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/staffdirectory/professor_edward_j._esche.aspx"&gt;Prof. Edward J. Esche&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America, in 1953 and immigrated to the United Kingdom in 1982″. His undergraduate degree is from Southern Methodist University, which is in Dallas TX, but he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have retained any Texan features, or at least none that are apparent in this clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time that I listened to this clip, of course, I was influenced by the context — this is the dean involved in a controversy at a British university, so I naturally assumed that he was British. But I think that I was also influenced by his posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't quantify this feeling. I can't even express it very precisely. But there's something about the way he sits, the angle of his head, the fact the arm nearer the camera is immobile while he gestures with the other arm, that says "British academic" to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Prof. Esche's research interests "Include the Editing and Stage History of Shakespeare and Renaissance Drama, and Modern Drama in English", it's not implausible that he should be deploying body-language suited to his station. On the other hand, I freely admit that my perception is colored by the context, unsupported by any other evidence, and quite possibly complete nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know of any empirical investigation of this sort of thing? (Where by "this sort of thing" I mean something like regional variation in posture among cultural subgroups.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272809515461"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=8237">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/41828e7c28ccbb39</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Media and Science"/><category term="Bioephemera"/><category term="harvard kennedy school"/><category term="jessica palmer"/><category term="science blogging"/><title type="html">Reflections on “Unruly Democracy” from Bioephemera (Jessica Palmer)</title><published>2010-05-02T14:11:36Z</published><updated>2010-05-02T14:11:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/05/02/reflections-on-unruly-democracy-from-bioephemera-jessica-palmer/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">I think I can safely say that our event on Friday at the Harvard Kennedy School, entitled "Unruly Democracy: Science Blogs and the Public Sphere," was a success, and perhaps even exceeded expectations. The room was full; the presentations were great; we had a historic first panel bringing together representatives of Seed, Discover, and The Boston Globe to talk about three different approaches to science blogging; we had a real debate about whether blogs are "good" or "bad" for science--and we had a move towards some constructive suggestions for finding better norms in the blogosphere.

If you want proof that the event has caused some very important thought and reflection, you need go no further than this lengthy post from Jessica Palmer of Bioephemera, who attended and gave a rockin' talk on my panel. Jessica is, broadly speaking, in my camp--or what on Friday was called the "Sunsteinian" camp--when it comes to the negatives of blogging. Why? Some excerpts from her post:
My big concern? While individual blogs often have communities who are internally civil and share norms and history, when you move from blog to blog, those norms and history break down. There are no universal norms in the science blogosphere, ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/4s14o3slbqnbbtt5h00bhpgldc/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fintersection%2F2010%2F05%2F02%2Freflections-on-unruly-democracy-from-bioephemera-jessica-palmer%2F" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272807736926"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/the_reverse_pharma_shill_gambit_applied.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/69b2a37dccdd0c51</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">The reverse pharma shill gambit applied to Age of Autism?</title><published>2010-05-02T14:30:11Z</published><updated>2010-05-02T14:30:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/0j1jvVSOibg/the_reverse_pharma_shill_gambit_applied.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/the_reverse_pharma_shill_gambit_applied.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's a common tactic of suuporters of alternative medicine or other pseudoscience related to medicine to try to smear defenders of medical science as being hopelessly in the thrall of pharmaceutical companies, or, as they like to call it, "big pharma." For example, the anti-vaccine movement in general, and Generation Rescue in particular, love to use this gambit, for which I coined a phrase back in 2005 (at least I think I coined it), the &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/08/pharma-shill-gambit.html"&gt;pharma shill gambit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've always wondered what would happen if we defenders of science-based medicine attempted a "reverse pharma shill gambit," if you will. Now I &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkingautism.com/RethinkingAutism/Blog/Entries/2010/5/1_Oh%2C_the_Irony!_by_Dana_Commandatore.html"&gt;think I know&lt;/a&gt;. The hypocrisy of the anti-vaccine movement knows no bounds. I've actually challenged the odd AoA member on this, and their invariable reply is that these are relatively small companies and pharma is big. Sorry, that doesn't work. If Lee Silsby et al are providing AoA with a significant cash infusion for advertising relative to its budget, then it's just as much a potentially corrupting influence as Sanofi Aventis, Pfizer, or Bristol-Myers-Squibb buying advertising in a medical journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADDENDUM:&lt;/strong&gt; A photo of the dreaded Lee Silsby in Cleveland Heights taken this winter during a visit to my old stomping grounds. (I used to live only two or three miles away back in the 1990s.)&lt;/p&gt;

In fluoxetine-treated motor neurons there was ~52% cell death  while in paroxetine-treated cells there was 14% cell survival.... Both SSRIs decreased cell survival in a dose-dependent manner.  This study is provocative enough to call for further in vivo  studies.Standard doses of fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil), two of the biggest-selling SSRI antidepressants, both had a devastating effect on the survival of mammalian nerve cells growing in a dish. Within just 24 hours, the antidepressants had caused over half the cells to expire, 85% of them in the case of Paxil. Take a look:Oh dear. Should we be worried for the safety of the nerves of everyone taking SSRIs? I&amp;#39;m not, for two reasons.Reason #1 is that one of the authors on this paper was a Dr Amy Bishop, aka the University of Alabama Shooter. Three months ago, Bishop shot dead 3 colleagues and injured 3 others during a departmental meeting at the  University of Alabama in  Huntsville.A blog called Shepherd and Black Sheep did some nice investigating into Bishop&amp;#39;s work following the shootings. They pointed out that of the five authors on the SSRI paper, one was Amy Bishop, and the other four were her husband and three children. They&amp;#39;re all listed as working for a &amp;quot;Cherokee Lab Systems&amp;quot;, butThe website for  Cherokee Labsystems --  www.cherokeelabsystems.com --  has a notice &amp;quot;Please stand by. We are currently updating our site and  will be on-line shortly&amp;quot; and also shows the web address defaults to  http://cherokeelabs.com/ According to the Wayback Machine this web address --  http://cherokeelabs.com/  -- was only active October 16, 2003 through  January 30, 2005, but all the archived pages for that period show a  website that relates to Cherokee Labrador dogs,  not a genetic research  laboratory.  Moreover, Googling with street view the claimed address for Cherokee  Labsystems -  2103 McDowling Dr. SE, Huntsville, AL - shows a  residential home...Hmm. But, hang on, the fact that this research was done by a spree killer and her family operating from their garage, doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s wrong. Maybe the research was why she did it: Was Dr. Bishop Mind-Controlled To Shoot Her Victims As Retaliation For Her Critical Research Paper On Prozac In 2009? Hey, I&amp;#39;m just asking questions. Fortunately there&amp;#39;s a second reason to doubt that SSRIs cause this kind of motor neuron toxicity in  people: SSRIs don&amp;#39;t cause this kind of motor neuron toxicity in  people. If they did, everyone would collapse and/or die  after popping a single Prozac.That millions of people have been taking  SSRIs for years and, whatever else may have happened to them, they are  still standing, is proof they don&amp;#39;t. The fact that a low dose of alcohol (0.08% i.e. just &amp;quot;legally drunk&amp;quot;) also killed a large  proportion of nerve cells in this study is more evidence that these results can&amp;#39;t be extrapolated to humans. Antidepressants are in fact commonly used to help treat the pain resulting from neuropathic nerve damage.It&amp;#39;s always possible to explain away such differences: maybe SSRIs can cause motor neurotoxicity in humans, but only at higher doses, or only after very long periods, or only in some people. Anything&amp;#39;s possible. But given that the effects actually seen in this study - dramatic, rapid, and present at normal doses - never happen in humans, such possibilities are no more likely, in the light of these results, than they were before.This is the serious lesson of this paper: if you&amp;#39;ve got data showing that something causes some  effect in animal models or cell cultures, but it doesn&amp;#39;t do that in real  life, the simplest explanation is that there&amp;#39;s something wrong  with your model, or your data. Unfortunately, Anderson et al is by no means the only example of putting the experimental cart before the clinical horse...Lily B Anderson, Phaedra B Anderson, Thea B Anderson, Amy Bishop, &amp;amp; James Anderson (2009).

Mann had worked at the University of Virginia for 5 or 6 years, doing climate studies that cost the state about a half million dollars over that time. (To put that in perspective, that's a middling sized grant; big biomedical researchers can get much more than that.) Cuccinelli is claiming that Mann committed fraud, and wants to demand all that money back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no grounds to consider Mann to have committed &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; breach of ethics. The sole foundation for his legal attack is the hacked email messages from the CRU, which contained no nefarious revelations…other than that some scientists are really pissed off at clueless denialists like Cuccinelli. Most annoyingly, &lt;a href="http://www.research.psu.edu/orp/Findings_Mann_Inquiry.pdf"&gt;Mann was already subjected to an ethics review&lt;/a&gt;, again driven by people complaining about the CRU emails, and was completely absolved of any wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a witch hunt, nothing more. Cuccinelli is not pursuing a scientist because he did wrong, he is pursuing a scientist because he did not like the results he honestly got. He is using the law to take a political cheap shot with no basis in substance. That can only have a chilling effect, if carried out: apparently, the only results you are allowed to get at the University of Virginia are those that fit the preconceptions of conservative ideology.

Spring reading contest.</title><published>2010-05-02T11:16:25Z</published><updated>2010-05-02T11:16:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/02/we-have-a-winner-spring-reading-contest" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many books, so little time!  I’ve finally finished plowing through the long list of nonfiction books entered in our &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/contest-spring-reading/"&gt;spring reading contest&lt;/a&gt;.  As you may recall, the contest opened April 16 and closed at 5 p.m. on April 23.  The rules were these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please recommend one &lt;em&gt;nonfiction&lt;/em&gt; book  that you think everyone should read, and explain in no more than&lt;em&gt; three sentences&lt;/em&gt; why we should read it. &lt;/strong&gt; The book need not  be about science, though those entries are welcome too.  The only books  excluded from this contest are mine and Darwin’s &lt;em&gt;Origin&lt;/em&gt;, which  has been done to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entries will be judged on both the suggested book and the sales  pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have realized that this would be a tough one to judge.  It was hard not to favor books I’d already read and liked, but this was counterbalanced by my desire to read some juicy new books that were well pitched.  On the other hand, I just couldn’t get behind books that I’d read but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; liked, even if the pitch was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not of the new everyone-is-a-winner school, but really, we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; won this one by compiling such a great reading list.  I for one now have a big backlog of books I want to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all who entered.  Perhaps a diligent soul will compile these all into one list? If you do, send it to me and I’ll put it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve divided my favorite entries into three sections.  The first two get the “order of merit” for “books that Jerry has read and liked” and “books that Jerry now wants to read” respectively. Finally, we have the list of &lt;em&gt;finalists&lt;/em&gt;, from which I chose one winner.  Be aware that to keep the lists manageable, I’ve not singled out every suggested book that I’ve liked.  And how well you touted or described a book was definitely a factor in getting on the lists.  Finally, when an author was recommended for more than one book, I’ve highlighted just one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group 1.  Order of Merit for books that Jerry has read, liked, and recommends &lt;/strong&gt;(recommender in parentheses)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Letters from the Earth&lt;/em&gt; by Mark Twain (Dale)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Years of Lyndon Johnson: Master of the Senate&lt;/em&gt; by Robert A. Caro (JJE).  This is the third volume of Caro’s biography. I highly recommend this and the first two volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;God: the Failed Hypothesis&lt;/em&gt; by Victor Stenger (Rev. El). I’ve also read and liked Stenger’s latest, &lt;em&gt;The New Atheism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oranges&lt;/em&gt; by John McPhee (Jeff Chamberlain).  Let me put in a plug here for nearly everything that McPhee has written. I particularly like his earlier collections of essays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group 2.  Order of Merit for Books that Jerry wants to (and will) read based on the recommendations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Bang &lt;/em&gt;by Simon Singh (Jordan)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Coming Plague &lt;/em&gt;by Laurie Garrett (Damien)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bright-Sided&lt;/em&gt; by Barbara Ehrenreich (Lynn Wilhelm).  I’m reading this now based on Lynn’s suggestion, and am enjoying it immensely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A drum roll now for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group 3: The Finalists!&lt;/strong&gt; (I indicate whether or not I’ve read the book)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Song of the Dodo&lt;/em&gt; by David Quammen (Dennis).  Not read&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Young Men and Fire&lt;/em&gt; by Normal Maclean (Onychomys).  Not read&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three Cups of Tea:  One Man’s Mission to Promote Peace One School at a Tim&lt;/em&gt;e by (TreeRooster) by Greg Mortenson and David Oliver Relin  Not read&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hot Zone&lt;/em&gt; by Richard Preston (Peter Beattie). Not read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now. . . the winner.  Actually, there are two runners-up too: winner gets a hardback, runners-up a paperback, all signed as you wish.  If you are one of these three, please email me (my address is easily available on the Web) and let me know where to send your prize.  Remember that the pitch played a big role in making the final list. I’ve added the Amazon links should you wish to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;John TR&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Chance-See-Douglas-Adams/dp/0345371984"&gt;Last Chance to See&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pitch: Most know of Adams through the Hitchhiker’s series and his wit and humour carry over brilliantly in narrating the journey to observe the world’s most endangered creatures. From the hilarious story of trying to buy condoms in China to the awe of patiently searching for white rhinos in Africa, Adams remains endearing and never condescending while educating the reader about such pressing environmental issues. This is the uproarious and enlightening story of an Englishman so far displaced from his clean and proper life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Chance to See gets excellent reviews at &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8696.Last_Chance_to_See"&gt;GoodReads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/5827"&gt;LibraryThing. &lt;/a&gt;As many of you know, this book was turned into a BBC television show with Stephen Fry and Mark Carwardine.  The show’s website is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First runner-up&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Doc Bill&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Love-Chemistry-Romantic/dp/0805077960/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1272804037&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why We Love: The Nature and Chemistry of Romantic Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Helen Fisher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pitch:  In this enjoyable and well-documented read, Helen Fisher strips away the “mystery” of love and replaces it with my favorite subject, chemistry. Mind-brain dualists (calling Dr. Egnor!) may howl at the moon that emotion is “mere chemistry,” but the fascinating interplay of chemicals in the brain as we grow and age explains why we do what we do when our logic says “no” though our glands say “Yes!”If you love evolution, you’ll love reading about the evolution of love and go ape over this book as I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second runner up:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Onychomys&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Young-Men-Fire-Norman-Maclean/dp/0226500624/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1272804070&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Young Men and Fire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Norman Maclean&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pitch: I’m going to suggest Norman Maclean’s “Young Men and Fire”. It’s about Mann Gulch, Montana, where in August of 1949, 16 smokejumpers parachuted in to fight a small fire. The wind shifted, the fire exploded, and two hours after they landed, 13 of them were dead. This would be a compelling story of courage and tragedy if told by a hack writer, but in Maclean’s (who wrote “A River Runs Through It”, and who was undoubtedly my state’s greatest author) hands, it becomes something special. I cry every time I read it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t read any of these, so I can’t vouch for their quality, but the pitches certainly made me want to read them (also, I’d read and liked Maclean’s &lt;em&gt;A River Runs Through It&lt;/em&gt;, a terrific book that is not widely known). If &lt;em&gt;you’v&lt;/em&gt;e read these, do post your take on them—or on any of the other books mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thanks again to all. Happy reading!&lt;/p&gt;

But to my knowledge, nobody has attempted to justify the rapes with reference to Catholic religious doctrine. The church's attitude has roughly been "We think this is really nasty behaviour, but more importantly we don't want any bad press".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Nigeria, it is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to marry. But senator Ahmad Sani Yerima, 49, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8651043.stm"&gt;is under investigation&lt;/a&gt; for taking a girl as his fourth wife when she was allegedly 13 years old. He is said to have paid a dowry of $100,000 for her. Sani is an Islamist who, as governor of Zamfara state, oversaw the introduction of Sharia law there in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sani denies that the girl was only 13 but agrees that she was under 18. However, he is not concerned with secular Nigerian law on this issue, which may strike the reader as odd given that the man is a member of the National Assembly of the Republic of Nigeria. Said Sani to the BBC, "I don't care about the issue of age since I have not violated any rule as far as Islam is concerned ... History tells us that Prophet Muhammad did marry a young girl as well. Therefore I have not contravened any law. Even if she is 13, as it is being falsely peddled around."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s vaccine &lt;a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;q=cache:EFWr9iuGv2gJ:www.fwahs.health.nsw.gov.au/resources/publichealth/immunisation/pdf/CSL_FluvaxJnr_PI_2010_season.pdf+%E2%80%A2+A/California/7/2009+%28NYMC+X-181%29+%28A/California/7/2009+%28H1N1%29+%E2%80%93+like%29+7.5+%C2%B5g+haemagglutinin+per+dose+A/Wisconsin/15/2009+%28NYMC+X-183%29+%E2%80%A2+%28A/Perth/16/2009+%28H3N2%29+%E2%80%93+like%29+7.5+%C2%B5g+haemagglutinin+per+dose,+%E2%80%A2+B/Brisbane/60/2008+%28B/Brisbane/60/2008+%E2%80%93+like%29+7.5+%C2%B5g+haemagglutinin+per+dose&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=au&amp;amp;pid=bl&amp;amp;srcid=ADGEESjVz1sqdCs3wWcR9ibHUDVqyQy_vpXl137m3m5fQCN-ULfgJw6bbqRmg_r9RG45nH7yR_obTgzbpgsAhLlByfbIm0-JqFcTjWaaOChoxGms0QVvcBNYI5C7ply-KYVVKQ1eyP3h&amp;amp;sig=AHIEtbROHTqjly0Di4N7sgbqGbWd5AvwyQ"&gt;contains&lt;/a&gt; three viral components,&lt;br&gt;
• A/California/7/2009 (NYMC X-181) (A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) – like) 7.5 µg haemagglutinin per dose&lt;br&gt;
• A/Wisconsin/15/2009 (NYMC X-183) (A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) – like) 7.5 µg haemagglutinin per dose,&lt;br&gt;
• B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Brisbane/60/2008 – like) 7.5 µg haemagglutinin per dose, a combination not used in Australia before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Barr, the deputy-director of the World Health Organization’s influenza centre in Melbourne, was interviewed for the &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2010/s2882792.htm"&gt;World Today on ABC radio&lt;/a&gt; on Monday April 26th, about the question of whether the current seasonal flu combination has been tested in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IAN BARR&lt;/strong&gt;: In Australia we don’t require that the influenza vaccine, the seasonal vaccine is tested for combinations but they have done that overseas, so they have tested in fact giving a full seasonal vaccine with the swine flu, so four vaccines at once if you like and there were no untoward effects there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think there’s a high expectation that the combination of these three viruses will be no different from any other three viruses which we include every year without doing formal safety testing which takes quite a period of time and it is extremely expensive and time consuming.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHARLOTTE GLENNIE&lt;/strong&gt;: So in your opinion the fact that it is a combination vaccine would have nothing to do with this situation that we’ve got at the moment as far as you know now?&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IAN BARR&lt;/strong&gt;: I think that’s unlikely to be a factor. Certainly all viruses are slightly different but in terms of how they’re produced in the laboratory and tested in laboratory and then made in the commercial scale vaccine production areas, they’re all investigated individually for any particular differences in those viruses which might lead to some of these things we’re seeing currently, such as fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think that it’s unlikely but I guess we have to wait and see on analysis of these particular batches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But subsequent tests by the &lt;a href="http://www.tga.gov.au/"&gt;TGA&lt;/a&gt; and other independent agencies have not identified a batch related problem. The Federal Government’s chief medical officer, Professor Jim Bishop, says there is no evidence to suggest that faulty batches of flu vaccine are to blame for adverse reactions in children, although further testing is yet to be completed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/panvax.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:6px" title="panvax" src="http://www.skeptics.com.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/panvax.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="181"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Could old technology be to blame?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But rival vaccine manufacturers are questioning the manufacturing technique used by &lt;a href="http://www.csl.com.au/s1/cs/auhq/1182280826145/content/1182280826258/home.htm"&gt;CSL Limited&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;q=cache:e9GzKmvk14MJ:www.federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/content/national_partnership_agreements/HE001/National_Partnerhsip_agreement_on_Essential_Vaccines.pdf+Influenza+Deeds+of+Agreement&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=au&amp;amp;pid=bl&amp;amp;srcid=ADGEESh9qNUTm7NSPVK0oo4FgktOFoBEu1eB89uJE7cRT4c27AwyHG4QkwZCKo4JkKr0Ol8I-8FJJIGQ_yAX7zbr7fxPIUclneHiB6QwsHOrkA6-4-m4RyVVlfYun1ZqPg4JH1mm1VRA&amp;amp;sig=AHIEtbR0j0AH8aDCwg8HYe0bHpW_N4JNPw"&gt;Influenza Deeds of Agreement&lt;/a&gt; are in place with CSL Limited and Sanofi Pasteur for the supply of seasonal, pre-pandemic and pandemic influenza vaccines, but CSL is the primary supplier of AH1N1 vaccines to the Australian government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSL was once a division of  the Federal government. Known as the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, it was established in Australia in 1916, then incorporated in 1991 and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in 1994. But CSL continue to maintain a close relationship with the government much to the critique of their rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flinders University’s &lt;a href="http://immunome-research.com/edboard/start.asp?id=114130"&gt;Professor Nikolai Petrovsky&lt;/a&gt;, the research director of rival vaccine manufacturer Vaxine, says CSL’s relationship with the Federal Government virtually guarantees it funding. So CSL has no interest in developing better vaccines with new technology such as genetically engineered proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“They’re comfortable to really exploit the old technology which is highly profitable to sell each year to the Australian Government.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSL’s seasonal flu vaccine, Fluvax, is based on technology which involves growing the influenza virus in eggs – a technology which has been around for about 50 years. Professor Petrovsky says the CSL vaccine varies from batch to batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“That’s one of the consequences of using a 50-year-old technology, you get that variability,”&lt;/strong&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is calling for an independent inquiry into the Federal Government’s relationship with CSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A spike in vaccinations means a spike in reactions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, there have been 57 reports of adverse reactions (including high fevers and convulsions) in WA, six in Victoria, four in NSW and Queensland, two in South Australia and one each in Tasmania and the ACT. One child died in QLD after receiving a flu injection. Initial findings from the coroner did not find the vaccine at fault but tests are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof Bishop said some three million doses of the seasonal flu vaccine have gone out this year, with up to two-thirds sent to WA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be a “partial explanation” as to why the western state has experienced a much higher rate of complications, normally expected in one out of every 1000 to 10,000 cases, Prof Bishop said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WA provides the seasonal flu shot for free to children under five, whereas the rest of the country doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WA trials were started after the 2007 flu season, after 8 children across Australia under five years of age, died within 24 hours of developing mild and non-specific symptoms of respiratory infection. Although the cause of death has not been reported in many of these cases, these deaths appeared to be associated with influenza A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, almost 65,000 children aged 5 and younger in Western Australia received free flu vaccinations made by CSL and Sanofi- Aventis SA as part of a trial that reduced hospitalizations by 88 percent, the state’s health department said in a &lt;a href="http://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Lists/Statements/DispForm.aspx?ID=131428"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year, CSL’s Fluvax vaccine contains fragments of three different types of influenza virus as recommended by the TGA and this depends on the strains of infectious flu in the environment. In addition, flu viruses mutate from season to season so vaccines become less effective and need to be modified to keep up with the current mutants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The components have been tested individually but not in combination.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the current Fluvax® combination has not been tested in Australia, the individual components have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluvax® Jnr (2005/2006 batches) showed very good safety and efficacy profile in clinical trial.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety and efficacy of CSLs Fluvax® Jnr – seasonal flu vax (no thimerosal, no H1N1) This study was undertaken using the 2005-2006 flu vaccines, is designated the Paediatric study &lt;a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00700193"&gt;CSLCT-FLU-04-05&lt;/a&gt; and was &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19903213"&gt;published in 2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of Fluvax® vaccine was tested in 298 participants from a paediatric population (&amp;gt; 6 months to &amp;lt; 3 years and &amp;gt; 3 years to &amp;lt; 9 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group A&lt;br&gt;
Equal to or &lt;strong&gt;greater than 6 months to less than 3 years old&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Biological: Influenza Virus Vaccine&lt;br&gt;
2 dose vaccine regimen: 2 X 0.25mL vaccinations 30 days apart and a booster vaccination was administered 12 months after the first dose&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group B&lt;br&gt;
Equal to or &lt;strong&gt;greater than 3 years to less than 9 years old&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Biological: Influenza Virus Vaccine&lt;br&gt;
2 dose vaccine regimen: 2 X 0.50mL vaccinations 30 days apart and a booster vaccination was administered 12 months after the first dose&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
The total number of participants was 298 (Group A n=151; Group B n=147). There were no reports of serious adverse events related to Fluvax® vaccine during the vaccination period. Within 7 days after administration of Fluvax® vaccine, all adverse experiences reported with an incidence of 2% or greater. Unsolicited adverse events were collected for 30 days post-vaccination. Very common unsolicited events (&amp;lt; 1/10) reported were rhinitis, cough, teething and influenza-like illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panvax® Jnr was tested in a 2009 trial and showed ~30% adverse effects in children under the age of 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing began on CSLs 2009 H1N1 Influenza Vaccine (CSL425) in July 2009, on 370 kids aged between 6 Months to 8 Years.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
CSL Limited makes two AH1H1 vaccines, Panvax® and Panvax® Jnr (thimerosal free). The clinical trial is &lt;a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00940108"&gt;registered &lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20026597?dopt=Abstract"&gt;published here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mild adverse effects were defined as adverse events easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and do not interfere with everyday activities (e.g., soreness at injection site)?.&lt;br&gt;
Following the first vaccination:&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• 16.3% had a mild fever (&amp;gt;37.5 degrees C &amp;lt; 38.5 degrees C) in the 15µg group&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• 23% had mild fever in the 30 µg group&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined mild adverse reactions, for 15 µg and 30 µg were 31.9% and 33.7%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For moderate adverse reactions, 15 µg and 30 µg were 18.9% and 27.2%, respectively. This was defined as significantly discomforting, interferes with daily activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinical trial data was evaluated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and reviewed by the expert Advisory Committee on Prescription Medicines (ACPM). The evaluations found the vaccine, delivered in two doses not less than 28 days a part in children aged 6 months to 9 years, to be both safe and to offer good protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panvax® was approved by the TGA on December 3, 2009 and the national immunisation program began on 30 September 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TGA has been closely monitoring any side effects from the use of the vaccine. To that date approximately 6 million doses of Panvax® had been distributed in Australia. As at 31 December 2009 a total of 1289 &lt;a href="http://www.tga.gov.au/alerts/medicines/h1n1vaccine1.htm"&gt;suspected side effects&lt;/a&gt; have been reported to the TGA following vaccination with Panvax® in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the current trial of the 2010 vaccine, containing A/California/7/2009 (NYMC X-181), (A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) – like)  A/Wisconsin/15/2009 (NYMC X-183), (A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) – like)  &amp;amp; B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Brisbane/60/2008 – like)&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current Influenza Vaccine Study in 6 month to 17 year olds&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia is considering introducing the Influenza vaccine for all children under 5 years. At the same time, this study aims to improve our knowledge of the safety of Fluvax® in children aged from 6 months to 17 years old. Information from this study will help future decisions on how best to use Fluvax® in children.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does the study involve? Each participant will be in the study for about 6 or 7 months. They will receive 1 or 2 doses of Fluvax®, depending on their age and how many doses of ‘flu vaccine they have had in the past. You will be asked to record certain reactions that might occur for 30 days following each vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
This study has been approved by a human research ethics committee. In Perth the study is run by the research staff at the Vaccine Trials Group, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research in conjunction with Princess Margaret Hospital for Children and the University of Western Australia School of Paediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest information on the website says; “recruitment complete” which means they have enough people for the trial. I don’t know what stage they are at with respect to results. There is a brochure available &lt;a href="http://www.ichr.uwa.edu.au/vtg/studies/flu"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Parents call for calm.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, some parents are calling for calm and warning others not to shun vaccines completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kellie Connolly &lt;a href="http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/put-fear-aside-dont-hesitate-to-vaccinate/story-e6frezz0-1225860330197"&gt;writing for the Daily Telegraph &lt;/a&gt;on April 30th, recounts how her three year old contracted swine flu last year and was extremely ill for 2 months. He couldn’t keep food down for 13 days, lost a third of his body weight and he eventually developed pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she took him for his flu shot this year, around the time of the recent scare, he suffered an adverse reaction of high temperatures, vomiting and headaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kellie says that of course she has concerns and she expects the authorities to thoroughly investigate them, but she was adamant;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“..As a mother of a child who’s had a terrible case of swine flu, and then witnessed an adverse reaction to a vaccine, I still say VACCINATE for everything else recommended by our health officials.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, &lt;a href="http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/parenting/community/kylie-orr/why-i-choose-to-immunise-20100427-tq31.html?s_rid=rainbow:hp5:immunise:eb:kylie:30apr10"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Kylie Orr on the Essential Baby blog&lt;/a&gt; says;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Why would I question a free service provided by  the government, which  has been exhaustively researched and documented? I  am not a scientist,  medical practitioner or spokesperson for a  pharmaceutical company.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ultimately, I am a mum and if the experts tell me immunising my child is the best bet for keeping them safe from potentially deadly diseases,  well that’s  enough for me. If someone offers a counter argument, showing me figures and relevant links, backed up by science…..”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccination programme for under fives remains suspended. You can report an adverse effect to vaccination, or other drugs at the &lt;a href="http://www.tga.gov.au/problem/medicines.htm#medicines"&gt;TGA website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

And imagine if most of them voted, “Yes! Teach it!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn’t matter.  Creationism isn’t science and it should stay out of the classroom, regardless of how many people want it to be taught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if students voted in favor of a prayer to be read over the intercom each morning during class?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn’t matter.  Still illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, the administration at Greenwood High School in Indiana seem to think it’s &lt;a href="http://www.wishtv.com/dpp/news/local/south_central/greenwood-prayer-in-judges-hands#viewSingle96429509"&gt;ok to have students vote&lt;/a&gt; on saying a prayer during their graduation ceremony.  The students voted in favor of the prayer, but that still doesn’t make it legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess those of us who see that know more about the law than the school’s attorney:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The school did not endorse religion! It hasn’t coerced anyone. It hasn’t done anything wrong! It’s merely giving students a forum for which they can seek and express their own viewpoints,” said Attorney Judy Woods.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school gave students a ballot asking if they wanted to pray.  That is an endorsement of prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, if students want to pray when they graduate, they can.  Hell, I think a valedictorian who wants to thank god in her speech giving her academic strength (or whatever) should be allowed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there can be no “official prayer” at a graduation.  It doesn’t matter what the students want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least  Judge &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Evans Barker&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.newsok.com/judge-bars-prayer-at-ind.-high-school-graduation/article/feed/155003"&gt;knows better&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
U.S. District Judge Sarah Evans Barker late Friday issued a preliminary injunction against Greenwood High School, which had planned the prayer at its May 28 commencement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana claimed the prayer and a senior class vote approving it unconstitutionally subjected religious practice to majority rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barker’s ruling says the vote to allow the prayer and the prayer itself violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an easy call to make.  Students ought to be embarrassed by the adults in their building who don’t even understand basic concepts of the law.  What sort of education are you going to get when your school is run by people like this?  I at least hope some teachers were vocal against this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, here’s the kicker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit against the school was &lt;a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20100501/LOCAL/5010347/Judge-rules-against-school-in-prayer-case"&gt;filed by the school’s valedictorian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Workman&lt;/strong&gt;.  If you go to &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/15/indiana-high-school-puts-graduation-prayer-up-for-a-vote-valedictorian-sues/"&gt;this posting&lt;/a&gt; from a couple months ago, you can find a link to the &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/28255503/Workman-v-Grenwood-Complt"&gt;original lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said before, I can’t wait to read a transcript of his valedictorian speech.&lt;/p&gt;

The full list is &lt;a href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/2010/04/twitticisms/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.   You can follow &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/DrTwittenheimer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This obesity epidemic is making it harder and harder to find low-fat Soylent Green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing with a Chia pet is about as much fun as watching grass grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the success of the Snuggie: the Bleenex. Won’t keep you warm, but you can wipe your nose on the sleeve with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure why, but to me Cheerios sound like the happiest of all circular shaped cereals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I consider the cup half empty or half full? Depends on whether I’m emptying it or filling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gang war between the squirrels and the raccoons must be escalating, based on the number of drive-by victims at the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New character: Snarky Shark. Still rips you apart like a regular shark, but he’s all “Well, I guess you shoulda stayed in the boat, dummy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a man is clapping one hand and a tree falls on him.. no, wait, how does that go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beauty is only skin deep. Below that it gets pretty gross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physics and biology can definitely connect, but there has to be chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there’s no need for that kind of language. Sanskrit, I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t mind having to eat my words, as long as they’re minced and sugar-coated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking for help is not a sign of weakness. Unless you’re asking someone to help you lift something that doesn’t weigh very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bunch of my friends threw a surprise party for me. It was fun, but why am I always the last to find out about these things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it weren’t for all the traffic, this would probably be a pretty popular highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old figure of speech notwithstanding, it is entirely possible to overemphasize anything. I can’t stress that enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop, drop, and roll will protect you from fire. But not from fire ants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little known fact: napalm smells exactly the same in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an actual anti-gas product in the UK called “Deflatine”. Other names considered but not chosen: “Ceasfartin” and “Stoptutinol”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many things did they try before they decided that clam was the best thing to mix with tomato juice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think money talks, you need to quit spending it on acid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saw a fashion report saying that with low riding jeans in style, butt cracks are the new cleavage. What was wrong with the old cleavage???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A waiter asked me to leave him a good tip. So on a napkin I wrote, “Avoid linguistic ambiguity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex sentence structure does not a wise statement make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I laid awake all night again worrying about why I’m always so tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans: 1. Trampolines: 2,359,442.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheaters never prosper. No word yet on whether they live long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the pesticide companies are up to something. Sure would like to be a fly on the wall at the Raid factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First ice ages, now global warming. I’m beginning to think the Earth is bipolar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can cancel delivery of any newspaper you want. The ones you don’t want will keep appearing in your driveway in plastic bags, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ticket: $14. Popcorn and drink: $9. Seeing the first movie to use full 3D technology and revolutionary special effects: $23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My latest invention is a 3D, ultra-high definition, full-scale, totally immersive experience. I call it “Actual Reality”. Patent pending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do dermatology conferences have breakout sessions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, acrophobics are almost always down to earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually feel sorry for top mathematicians who have nothing left to prove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve uncovered a big conspiracy in the elevator industry, and this thing goes all the way to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think euphemism is just a fancy word for hiding the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m drawing a blank. Or at least the outline of one. (I’ll fill it in later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are you calling a “mutant”, one-head?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the state of the union this month is… Idaho! Congrats!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. And then in a crappy spin-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a song. It goes, “A little something like this, a little something like this, a little sooooomething like thiiiiiis”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quit your screaming. What did you think I meant by “come in here and help me clean up this bloody mess”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think “sometimes say sometimes” is more reasonable, and far less hypocritical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, for one, is a common typo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little known fact: the head of state of Canada is not the Prime Minister. (It’s the Optimus Prime Minister).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Songwriters — I’m not sure if you know this yet, but “knees” rhymes with “please”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president of Molson seems like the kind of guy I’d like to have a beer with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If having a liberal political orientation is wrong, then I don’t wanna be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ttyl everybody — off to watch the Go Fish championships on ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Scrabble, I think patience should be worth 100 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wave your hands in the air! Wave ‘em all around like you’re relatively indifferent to the current situation in which you find yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s almost no nutritional value in marbles, which probably explains why those hippos are always so hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knock, knock. Who’s there? Howcan. Howcan who? How can anyone say that sarcasm is the lowest form of humor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To people unfamiliar with Twitter, 140 characters (including spaces) may not sound like very much, but in actuality it’s more than enough to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick quiz: A or B?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They make stuff up, wrap it in “life-inspiring” packaging, and Christians swallow it whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case in point, &lt;a href="http://donmilleris.com/2010/04/29/does-god-have-a-specific-plan-for-your-life-probably-not/"&gt;this post from author &lt;strong&gt;Don Miller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  I actually liked &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785263705?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0785263705"&gt;one of his books&lt;/a&gt; a lot.  But this post frustrates me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His goal is to say God doesn’t have a “specific plan for your life.”  Rather, he gives you the free will to do what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which, of course, is something he just made up.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure he can find support from other Christian writers/theologians, but it’s all interpretation and it’s no more or less believable than what a fundamentalist believes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end, he tries to make a joke… but &lt;a href="http://donmilleris.com/2010/04/29/does-god-have-a-specific-plan-for-your-life-probably-not/"&gt;it falls flat for me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here’s how you know, based on scripture, whether God has a specific plan for your life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. If you are a virgin and you get pregnant anyway.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. If your donkey talks to you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. If an angel wants to wrestle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If any of this happens to you, God is definitely at work. He also wants you to see a counselor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And there are a few more. You get the point. &lt;/strong&gt;If God has something specific for you, you’ll know, I promise. But if He is setting a box of crayons down in front of you (a box of crayons called life) then by all means draw. He’s taught you right from wrong, good from bad, beautiful from profane, so draw. He will be with you, proud of you, cheering you on, so draw. He loves you, so draw in the inspiration of the knowledge of His love. Draw a purple horse, a red ocean, a nine-legged dog, it doesn’t matter. Lets stop being so afraid. Lets live, and show the world what it really means to be grateful we don’t live in a dysfunctional family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the miracles that we’re told happened in the Bible are *obviously* ridiculous.  It’s never going to happen to you.  [I assume some Christians would find this funny... which boggles my mind, because they&amp;#39;re the ones who actually believe these things.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller goes on to say that you’ll &lt;em&gt;just know&lt;/em&gt; if God has a plan for you because… &lt;em&gt;you’ll just know&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a creative thought, that’s not your neurons firing. That’s God giving you the inspiration.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a special talent, that’s not your hard work and skill. That’s God giving you a gift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a child, that’s not basic biology at play. That’s God working a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all sounds very nice and, I’m sure, comforting for Christians reading it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you &lt;a href="http://donmilleris.com/2010/04/29/does-god-have-a-specific-plan-for-your-life-probably-not/comment-page-4/#comments"&gt;read the comments on that thread&lt;/a&gt;, it’s easy to tell no one is bothering to think critically about what he’s saying.  They’re just soaking it in, repeating it, and acting like it’s something profound, when in fact Miller is saying nothing of the sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s tell the truth — something you won’t find in Miller’s posting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God doesn’t have a specific plan for your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God doesn’t even have a general plan for your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only plan anyone has for your life is the one you come up with.  Hopefully, you have the support of friends and family to make it happen.  But no gods are there to help or guide you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m inspired by that.  I get to choose how to live my life.    I have to find my own skills and hone them.  If I make mistakes, I have to learn from them because it’s not like there’s some god out there “testing” me.  I don’t have to attribute any success to some imaginary voice in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s powerful.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Some of them were identical twins, but others ranged in genetic relatedness from normal siblings to half-siblings (i.e. one parent different) to cousins to adopted (unrelated).Using this data, they were able to split up the causes of religion and also teen drinking into three factors: genetic, family environment, and external environment (the external environment is the social environment that is not shared by siblings).Paige Harden's first finding is that only one third of the differences in religion in these American teens is down to religion. That fits in with other studies that have found that religion is mostly down to the environment in which you are raised (at least for teens, that is - genetics might be more important in later life).She points out that this does not mean that we have genes that 'code for' religion. What it means is that, in certain cultural contexts, there are genetic factors that predispose you to adopting behaviours that fall under the label 'religion'. In a different cultural context, these same genese might act differently.But what about religion and drinking?Well, what she found was that religious teens (i.e. those above the middle-line of religiosity) were older on average when they had their first alcoholic drink. But the difference was tiny - religious teens postpone their drinking by only six months (from just under 14 years to just over).However, when she looked at siblings who were raised in the same home but had different levels of religiosity, there was no difference. In other words, it's not the teenager's religious beliefs that cause the difference in drinking, but something in their environment.Paige Harden demonstrated this more formally by showing that the family influences that are linked to religiosity are also linked to later drinking (but not the genetic factors), and that when you take this into account individual religiosity is irrelevant.What could these family influences be? One obvious answer is that religious parents delay teen drinking. But she also found that religious mothers had no effect on the onset of teen drinking.The most likely explanation, then, is that there is something in the wider social environment (but still shared with their family members) of teens that is linked to religion and that causes a small delay in when they choose (or are able to) take their first drink.In other words, it's about living in an environment where teen drinking is frowned upon (which, in the highly religious USA, also tends to be religious environments).Does this matter? Well, yes it does, because it suggests that programmes that try to make children more religious are unlikely to affect teen drinking. As the Paige Harden concludes:These results suggest that increasing an individual adolescent’s own level of religiosity, independent of his or her family background, may not protect against early drinking initiation. Federal ‘faith-based’ initiatives, if they focus on increasing adolescent involvement in religious organizations but do not change the adolescent’s family environment, may be ineffective in preventing adolescent substance use.Harden, K.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Importance of Being Dad: Paternal Care in Primates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although human males often get criticized for being "deadbeat dads", the truth is that compared to most mammals, human males are simply outstanding fathers. Join us as Dr. Susan Alberts discusses why we don't generally expect male mammals to provide paternal care (answer: because we think they usually can't recognize their own offspring), and the unusual and surprising case of paternal care in a primate species where we least expect to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the baboons of the Amboseli basin of southern Kenya males differentiate their own offspring from other males' offspring, and provide care to them. Dr. Alberts will talk about why this should be so, and what it means about males of all species and their tendencies to provide offspring care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="width:93px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Bookalley3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Bookalley" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Bookalley3.jpg" alt="" width="83" height="124"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Novel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel has always been one of my all-time favorite warnings on spiritualism and the things that can happen  when you “reach too far” as the line in the 1947 film noir classic goes. How could I resist a novel about a ruthless mentalist who becomes a spiritual guru? Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Variety”&lt;/em&gt; has called it &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“one of America’s deepest, darkest, dirtiest noir fictions”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and tells us it is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“a nexus of religion, spiritualism and sensuality underlying the American dream.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; I agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was threading my way through the maze that was the psychic racket in the late 90’s, watching the main characters in this film creep along an inevitable highway to ruin managed to keep me sane. It was a time in my life when I was torn between making vast amounts of money by selling myself to the devil of psychic scamery or listening to my conscience and keeping cool. Every time I got a heated testimonial about how “blessed” I was or was told that I had a “true gift,” I made it a habit to sit down and re-watch the film over and over. It was a cinematic cathartic and helped me cope with the tendency to take myself too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/z24.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, my background in magic, mentalism and deception gave me a totally different outlook on psychics. I doubt if I would have ever first read the book &lt;em&gt;“Nightmare Alley”&lt;/em&gt; if I hadn’t had the “good fortune” to have some very savvy magic teachers who recommended reading it cover to cover. Then later, without Tyrone Power’s fall from grace in the film version, it’s possible that I might have lost all sense of equilibrium and ended up one of the thousands of lost woo con artists in the mode of that other Edward, VanPraagh and Sylvia Browne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:124px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/two-villians1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="two villians" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/two-villians1.jpg" alt="" width="114" height="124"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyrone Power &amp;amp; Helen Walker (from the film)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel is solid gold, the film (as usual) is not quite as good – but still should be mandatory viewing for anybody involved in skepticism. I’m sure Randi would wholeheartedly agree. It remains a dark study on deep psychological questions such as how we read and interact with each other and a study in the power of suggestion that begs the question: Are we driven by fate to make the choices we do, or can we ever know ourselves enough to change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/psychicblues1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="psychicblues" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/psychicblues1-150x203.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="203"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When I wrote &lt;em&gt;“Psychic Blues,”&lt;/em&gt; it was meant to be a humorous contemporary version of &lt;em&gt;“Alley’s”&lt;/em&gt;core issues. I refer to it often because it has always been right up my alley. It became a code I lived by for a long time. As much as I hate to admit it, I suppose in some ways I am as Penn Jillette said on the episode of &lt;em&gt;“Bullshit”&lt;/em&gt; that I appeared on; “…a reformed con artist.” Watch the film or read the book and you will have a keen edge on everything I’ve worked hard to avoid – and even harder &lt;em&gt;to make people aware of.&lt;/em&gt; The story connected so deeply with Gresham’s internal agony that he said, “to get rid of it, I had to write it out.” I can totally relate to that sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/images/pixel.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/alley27.bmp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Hollywood has once again gotten its claw hooks on something potentially golden.  So with a message that could make a difference skeptically, what did they do with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:153px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/geek.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="geek" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/geek.jpg" alt="" width="143" height="107"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to Feed the Geek!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot really. Not everything was to my liking. Bear in mind I’m not a person who like musicals anyway. I find that nothing disturbs a good dramatic premise more than when main characters who are decent actors build up the belief in what they are doing, only to have that belief shattered when they suddenly break into a song. Barring that, this production is definitely worth seeing if you are a fan or familiar with the story. Many of this production’s key scenes were taken almost verbatim from the film script. That was a pleasant surprise. The sets were nicely done with beautiful side-show banners festooning the walls. Costumes: great. Lighting and music: great. The feel of the gritty side-show mood was well rendered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:235px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Nightmare460d1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Nightmare460d" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Nightmare460d1-225x153.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="153"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stan gets a Reading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did miss a few characters from the film, most notably: Bruno the Strongman. In the film, this character was type-cast to perfection by ex-pro wrestler Mike Mazurki. In that role, he played an important part as the female lead’s guardian/protector, who kept the maniacal mentalist’s sexual advances under control. Bruno symbolized a sort of moral underpinning that was still present in the musical, but without having an actual character to play it out, was not as strongly reinforced. The moral angle was suggested here and there; and there was certainly no quarter given to the religious aspects of the main character’s greed.  Some sections of the original story were re-organized, left out and a few liberties were taken with the original material. Unless you were a completest like me, it didn’t matter. I’m sure 90% of the audience could have cared less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that irked me a bit was this: if you are going to mount a period piece (in this case the Great Depression) please refrain from throwing in contemporary wording and phrases. It kills the momentum and tone of the whole thing. I realize we may be in another Great Depression right now, but when I see a play or something like this, I want to totally immerse myself in the time and place the director is suggesting. Hearing dialogue from later eras kills that nuance. For example: I really doubt that back then what a psychic did was known by the term “cold reading,” which was bandied about frequently. I don’t think that term came into usage until after mentalist Robert Nelson published his seminal works on the subject in the early 50’s. Other asides and comments made by various characters seemed oddly ad-libbed and similarly distracting. The second act was much better than the first and kudos to Larry Cedar who played Pete the mentalist , the Sheriff and Addie Peabody and Michael McCarty as Clem and Ezra Grimble. Both actors were finely-tuned and believable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Nightmare460g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this musical have to do with skepticism? Plenty. The theme of psychic cons, cold reading, people needing someone to relate and talk to and other facets of what makes people believe in weird things was powerfully portrayed, despite the songs and dances. With a little reading between the lines, the message was clear: Nothing has changed. &lt;em&gt;“Nightmare Alley – the Musical”&lt;/em&gt; shows us that the same frauds and phony mediumship that started with the Fox Sisters and carried on through the 30’s right up to today’s talk-to-the-dead vultures like Sylvia Browne, Chip Coffey and Robbie Thomas has always been with us and is still alive and flourishing. When recession turns into depression and economies get worse and worse, these pariahs come out of the woodwork. The parallels between yesterday’s religious tent revivals and today’s millionaire televangelists was underscored by a hilarious gospel number &lt;em&gt;“Cross that River”&lt;/em&gt; that really nailed that whole glorious manipulation. Give me that ol’ time religion…gimme, gimme, gimme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Nightmare460d.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:470px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Nightmare460g1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Nightmare460g" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Nightmare460g1.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="288"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Final Seance and Spirit Cabinet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were even a few “skeptical” songs that I think should be mentioned. One number that caught my attention was &lt;em&gt;“Science,” &lt;/em&gt;which slightly deviated from the original novel and film by injecting the idea that at that time in American history, because of Darwin’s influence, anything that could be hyped-up with a “sciencey” patina was popular. The main character Stanton Carlisle (James Barbour) does this with his mentalism act.  A nice touch that is not too different from how we see happening today in slimy groups like the &lt;strong&gt;ESP Bookcamp &lt;/strong&gt;phonies or woo “paranormal investigation” websites that link up their shtick with Carlos Castaneda, Bucky Fuller and John Lilly to snare their clients. In a crash course in mediumship, another song &lt;em&gt;“Human Nature” &lt;/em&gt;used about three short minutes to perfectly encapsulate cold reading. It was delightful. That alone is worth the price of admission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more spoilers. I’m happy to report that the denouement stayed true to the novel and not the film version. A much better choice and one that will stick in the minds of anyone who sees this musical for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a scale of 10, I rate it a 7.5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello skeptical friends and neighbors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just got back from the gym. I walk a mile or so down Hollywood Boulevard to get to the gym and I usually spend my time avoiding the drug dealers, the people in costumes and the guys who try to get &lt;img src="http://img714.imageshack.us/img714/4563/stormtrooper.jpg" alt="storm trooper" width="270" height="270"&gt;you to go on the star home tours. No, I don’t want to see Madonna’s house and no, I don’t want to buy an ounce of weed. Yes, I DO want my photo with the storm trooper but that will have to wait! Today on the way back from the gym, something sorta of lovely happened. I got to help a blind guy across the street. I saw that he couldn’t click the walk button because he didn’t know it was there (and strangely there were no storm troopers around to help at the time) so I pressed the button and then asked the man if I could help him across. He said yes, and so escorted him across. He was very sweet and I have to say that even though I was technically helping him, it really made &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; feel good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good deeds are great for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Have you done any simple acts of kindness recently? Do you do anything to help the community or your friends and family that in turn makes you feel good? Would you like me to take a message for Elyse?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atheists often talk about how religion brainwashes children before they really have a chance to decide for themselves what they think about religion/god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to Christian merchandising stores, for example, it’s not hard to find &lt;a href="http://www.wearhisname.com/ecomm/pc/Toddler-and-Baby-Christian-T-Shirts-c34.htm"&gt;Jesus clothing&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://faithbaby.com/cart/index.php?main_page=page&amp;amp;id=10&amp;amp;chapter=0"&gt;infants and toddlers&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wearhisname.com/ecomm/pc/Toddler-and-Baby-Christian-T-Shirts-c34.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/ToddlerJesus.png" alt="" title="ToddlerJesus" width="200" height="244"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://faithbaby.com/cart/index.php?main_page=page&amp;amp;id=10&amp;amp;chapter=0"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/BabyJesusTees.png" alt="" title="BabyJesusTees" width="384" height="515"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disturbing, no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how would you feel about shirts advocating non-religion being marketed for children of atheist parents?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would hope most of us would be against that sort of thing.  It’s the same type of thing as called a 3-year-old a “Muslim child” when the kid has made no such decision for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Brights were &lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.com/brightsshop/"&gt;selling clothing&lt;/a&gt; marketed for children.  It was just their logo, but it’s still an implicit endorsement of what the Brights stand for.  A member of the group rightly called them out on it by sending the following email to the Brights’ website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“I checked the &lt;a href="http://the-brights.net/movement/merchandise.html"&gt;merchandise page&lt;/a&gt; and saw that baby clothes with the Bright logo are being sold. Surely not appropriate, since babies will eventually make up their own mind? Dawkins makes the point about ‘Muslim Child / Catholic Child’ categorisations in his books. Surely a ‘Bright Child’ falls into the same dubious category? (Just a minor complaint though – keep up the good work, and best wishes from Wales, UK. Regards, Steve.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve had a point.  And &lt;strong&gt;Paul Geisert&lt;/strong&gt; (who coined the “Brights” name originally) responded by &lt;em&gt;talking to the person running that part of the Brights’ site and removing anything targeting children&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s awesome.  Good for Paul and the Brights’ crew for responding quickly to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So… when do you think the Christian sites are going to take down their kid-themed merchandise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.  I’m not holding my breath, either.&lt;/p&gt;

I posted &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/" title=""&gt;153 times&lt;/a&gt; in April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, importantly, I again committed scienceblogging in April, with the post &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/evolutionary_medicine_does_rei.php" title=""&gt;Evolutionary Medicine: Does reindeer have a circadian stop-watch instead of a clock?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April focus appears to be Twitter - hence two posts specifically about it: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/twittering_is_a_difficult_art.php" title=""&gt;Twittering is a difficult art form - if you are doing it right&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/more_on_mindcasting_vs_lifecas.php" title=""&gt;More on mindcasting vs. lifecasting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in April, I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/introducing_the_open_laborator.php" title=""&gt;introduced the Open Laboratory 2010 editor&lt;/a&gt; and made available &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/the_submit_to_open_laboratory.php" title=""&gt;the 'submit to Open Laboratory 2010' buttons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A science journalist curmudgeoned herself, so I felt compelled to collect all the responses, in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/for_the_millionth_time_blogger.php" title=""&gt;For the millionth time: bloggers vs. journalists is over!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Duke to see the student rendition of RENT and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/rent_at_duke.php" title=""&gt;wrote a long review of it afterwards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/this_week_well_be_in_new_york.php" title=""&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, mainly to attend the #140conference, which I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/the_140conf.php" title=""&gt;subequently blogged about&lt;/a&gt;, and also posted a lot of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/140conf/" title=""&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; from the talks and sessions I liked the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in the last week of the month, the biggie of all the Web conferences happened - the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/www2010_conference_this_week_i.php" title=""&gt;WWW2010&lt;/a&gt; conference, right here in Raleigh NC. More about it shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more-and-more amazing interviews with ScienceOnline2010 participants are coming in - check out &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_interview_28.php" title=""&gt;Christie Wilcox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_interview_29.php" title=""&gt;Maria-Jose Vinas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_interview_30.php" title=""&gt;Sabine Vollmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_interview_31.php" title=""&gt;Beth Beck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_interview_32.php" title=""&gt;Ernie Hood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_interview_33.php" title=""&gt;Carmen Drahl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_interview_34.php" title=""&gt;Joanne Manaster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_interview_35.php" title=""&gt;Elia Ben-Ari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_interview_36.php" title=""&gt;Leah D. Gordon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_interview_37.php" title=""&gt;Kerstin Hoppenhaus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_interview_38.php" title=""&gt;Hilary Maybaum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is worth highlighting again: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scientists_engineers_experts_-.php" title=""&gt;Scientists, engineers, experts - your Government needs you!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work-related, I announced the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/plos_one_blog_pick_of_the_mont_6.php" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE Blog Pick of the Month for March 2010&lt;/a&gt;, announced &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/two_new_plos_collections.php" title=""&gt;two new PLoS Collections&lt;/a&gt; and some more &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/various_plos_news.php" title=""&gt;various PLoS news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/blog_reviewed.php" title=""&gt;got reviewed&lt;/a&gt; and so did the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/another_open_laboratory_2009_r.php" title=""&gt;Open Laboratory 2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I collected in one place all of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/best_post_on_media_science_jou.php" title=""&gt;Best posts on Media, (Science) Journalism and Blogging at 'A Blog Around The Clock&lt;/a&gt;'. I also collected a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/weekend_reads.php" title=""&gt;bunch of interesting links&lt;/a&gt;, mostly about journalism, and then posted &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/some_links_for_the_weekend.php" title=""&gt;some more&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks later. And another linkfest - &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/stuff_i_showed_on_my_panel_at.php" title=""&gt;Stuff I showed on my panel at AAAS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some PR for Aidel's Vice store - &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/never_go_anywhere_unprepared.php" title=""&gt;Never go anywhere unprepared&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/environmentally_friendly_chico.php" title=""&gt;Environmentally friendly chico bags&lt;/a&gt; - the proud sponsor of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/the_2010_post_with_the_most_bl.php" title=""&gt;The 2010 Post with the Most blogging contest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/best_of_april.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/DyHiu2imkCg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272737159807"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/texans_shall_demonstrate.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/22b1fa3e56e3f3ee</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Texans shall demonstrate</title><published>2010-05-01T17:42:36Z</published><updated>2010-05-01T17:42:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/bKgIPvlppEg/texans_shall_demonstrate.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/texans_shall_demonstrate.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;On 16 May, there will be a &lt;a href="http://www.atheists.org/events/Texas_Rally"&gt;demonstration protesting the foolish curriculum the Texas Board of Education is imposing on the state&lt;/a&gt;. If you're near the capitol, join in! Here's their rationale:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A religious-right faction dominating the Texas Board of Education is trying to distort the content of public school textbooks. This revisionist history includes downplaying or eliminating mention of Enlightenment thinkers including Thomas Jefferson, more emphasis on religious themes and figures (theocrats like John Calvin!), and even attacks on Darwinian evolution. These religious extremists wish to turn our public schools into pulpits for sectarian preaching and an authoritarian social and cultural agenda.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Their actions could affect the content of school texts in nearly two-dozen other states as well!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We urge you to join us for a peaceful assembly on the steps of the Texas State Capitol in Austin to protest this outrage, and to express support of teaching solid science, balanced history and facts over sectarian religious dogmatism. Stop the Texas Textbook Massacre!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go and send me photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the official state seal of Virginia. A few people don't like it, for the expected prudish reasons, including the &lt;a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2010/04/cuccinelli-opts-more-modest-state-seal"&gt;Attorney General for the state of Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli apparently isn't fond of wardrobe malfunctions, even when Virginia's state seal is involved.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The seal depicts the Roman goddess Virtus, or virtue, wearing a blue tunic draped over one shoulder, her left breast exposed. But on the new lapel pins Cuccinelli recently handed out to his staff, Virtus' bosom is covered by an armored breastplate.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When the new design came up at a staff meeting, workers in attendance said Cuccinelli joked that it converts a risqué image into a PG one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The epidemic of young men publicly masturbating to the display of the state seal must be a real problem in Virginia, requiring such action. Or perhaps it's just that prevert Cuccinelli who feels a disturbing flutter below the belt whenever he sees a 200+ year old icon. Or maybe he's acting to prevent earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a poll, but it looks like Virginians already see Cuccinelli as a bit of a nut.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pilotonline.com/"&gt;What do you think of Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli's decision to issue lapel pins of the state seal with a covered breast?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It's the right call
6%&lt;br&gt;

It's a bad idea

No opinion

The roads are blockaded as a swarm of Christmas Island Red Crabs (Gecarcoidea natalis), one hundred million strong, makes its way from the forests to the sea. This massive migration is fueled by the strongest urge an animal has: to reproduce. They must travel from their forest homes to the sea to spawn. The drive is so strong that the crabs will crawl their way onto, into and over whatever they must to reach the water's edge. So many migrate that the horde of legs, claws and carapaces can be seen from the air, and there can be so many in one area that the crabs are literally shoveled off of the streets. 

This strange phenomena has fascinated scientists ever since the crabs were discovered. It's strange enough to find a sea creature living so contentedly inland. The crabs have adapted well to forest life, scavenging fallen fruit, leaves, seedlings and carrion. They are a key species in the forests, recycling nutrients and aerating the soil with their burrows. Indeed, what really puzzled scientists wasn't how they live in the forest, it's how they make it to the sea. Crabs that spend their lives within a short scuttle of their burrows suddenly take it upon themselves to travel 3 to 4 miles to the ocean to spawn. When you think about it, their annual migration is akin to a couch potato suddenly deciding to compete in the Iron Man to get a girlfriend. What goes on in their bodies to drive such a dramatic shift? And how is it they can make it at all?

After merely mentioning this book's existence drew over 180 comments on the blog recently, I get the feeling that really digesting Ecklund's findings will make for quite a show.

It is worth noting that this will be the first time a Point of Inquiry show that I've done has gotten into the hotly contested subject of science and religion. My own views on this topic are widely known, have been widely aired and debated, and also sometimes criticized. See, e.g., my POI episode with D.J. Grothe about Unscientific America.

In that show I was the guest; but now I'm in the host's shoes at Point of Inquiry, and my goals and responsibilities are very different. Rather than advancing a particular view, my objective will be to include a diversity of voices on science and religion--starting with Ecklund, but extending to include a range of perspectives as I do more shows in the future. That includes interviewing “New Atheists” like Vic Stenger and others.

With that said, then, I'm encouraging folks to submit questions for Dr. Ecklund, either here ...</summary><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272727536966"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2292">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d4abd1e67e221a7e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and culture"/><title type="html">"Begging the question": we have examples</title><published>2010-05-01T14:54:06Z</published><updated>2010-05-01T14:54:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2292" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In one of the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2290#comment-65951"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; on my recent &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2290"&gt;"begging the question" post&lt;/a&gt;, Samantha asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Could someone give me a concrete example of this fallacy (the simpler, the better?) It would be especially great if it was an example like what Aristotle had in mind, something that showed "how such arguments can be disguised so as to appear persuasive." I've read the Wikipedia articles about the fallacy but I still can't wrap my mind around it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, Aristotle's discussion (e.g. in &lt;a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/prior.2.ii.html"&gt;Part 16 of Book II of the Prior Analytics&lt;/a&gt;) is entirely abstract. However, others have supplied plenty of concrete illustrations of the concept over the centuries: here's an example from Ryan North's &lt;a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=693"&gt;Dinosaur Comics for 1/5/2006&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/TRexBegging.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/TRexBegging.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, in most real-world cases where someone accuses someone else of somehow smuggling the point to be proved into their premises, the structure of the offending argument is not nearly so clear-cut .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my earlier post, I gave an example from Paul Krugman's blog ("&lt;a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/austrian-followup/"&gt;Austrian Follow-up&lt;/a&gt;", 4/7/2010):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;As predicted, many of the comments to my &lt;a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/martin-and-the-austrians/"&gt;Austrian economics post&lt;/a&gt; are of the form “Well, of course employment rises when investment is expanding, and falls when the investment is falling — in the first case the economy is booming while in the second it’s slumping.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;As I tried to explain, however, that’s assuming the conclusion; there’s no “of course” about it. Why do periods when the economy is investing more correspond to booms, while periods when it’s investing less correspond to slumps? That’s easy to understand in Keynesian terms — but the whole Austrian claim is that they’re an alternative to Keynesianism. Yet I have never seen a clear explanation of this central point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;What happens, instead — or at least that’s how I read it — is that Austrians slip Keynesianism in through the back door. Implicitly, they associate booms and slumps with rising or falling aggregate demand — utterly unaware that their own theory doesn’t actually make room for such a thing as aggregate demand to exist, or at least to affect overall employment. So Austrians are basically Keynesians in denial — self-hating Keynesians? — pretending to themselves that they’re not using ideas that are in fact essential to their story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this example was clearly not clear enough to help Samantha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of Krugman&amp;#39;s accusation is simple — &amp;quot;Austrians slip Keynesianism in through the back door&amp;quot;. However, in order to understand the content of this claim, you need to understand two different classes of economic theories. At least, you need to grasp what it means to say that &lt;a href="http://lexicon.ft.com/term.asp?t=Austrian-economics"&gt;"Austrian" economic theories&lt;/a&gt; don't "make room for such a thing as aggregate demand to exist", and why this might be a problem for the Austrian version of an apparently common-sensical explanation of the connections among employment, investment, and demand. To make the situation worse, Krugman cites no specific instance of the allegedly question-begging argument, but only gives us his caricature of it. (I'm not saying that Krugman was wrong, just that the passage that I quotes was too complex and too allusive to be useful as an illustration of "assuming the conclusion".)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's another attempt.  In a (comment on his) blog post "&lt;a href="http://helives.blogspot.com/2010/04/honest-science.html"&gt;Honest Science&lt;/a&gt;" (4/12/2010), David Heddle argued that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;If free will is an illusion, then deterrents are an illusion. How can a deterrent make me choose not to commit a crime, unless I have the facility of choice?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a somewhat persuasive piece of rhetoric, in my opinion. I tried it out on a couple of random acquaintances, whose initial responses were something like "yeah, that makes sense". But Jeffrey Shallit's response ("&lt;a href="http://recursed.blogspot.com/2010/04/muddled-thinking-about-free-will.html"&gt;Muddled Thinking about Free Will&lt;/a&gt;", 4/30/2010) points out the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;Let&amp;#39;s pretend that humans are soulless computational machines, shaped by evolution […] Now the human machine suddenly sees resources, for the taking, that belong to another. The human machine does a cost-benefit analysis to &amp;quot;decide&amp;quot; whether to take the resources or not. In the absence of a known deterrent, such as a dangerous dog or future incarceration, the human machine may decide to take the resource. In the presence of a deterrent, the human machine may make another decision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;How does this involve "free will"? You can call this decision-making "free will" if you like. But then a thermostat has free will, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heddle&amp;#39;s argument reasons from a premise like &amp;quot;The threat of punishment can make someone choose not to commit a crime&amp;quot; to the conclusion &amp;quot;Free will exists&amp;quot;.  But as Shallit observes,  someone who sees human choice is an algorithmic response to circumstances has no difficulty in applying this analysis to the case of deterrence.  Heddle&amp;#39;s argument works as a piece of rhetoric because its premise evokes a situation that most people think of as involving free will — in other words, it works by smuggling the conclusion, in a disguised form, into its premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I've ignored the fact that Heddle's argument has the form of a &lt;em&gt;reductio ad absurdum&lt;/em&gt; — if free will is an illusion, then deterrents are an illusion, and deterrents clearly work to some extent, therefore … The key point, however, is getting the reader to accept that &amp;quot;deterrence&amp;quot; — making a choice that&amp;#39;s influenced by potential punishment — is an instance of &amp;quot;free will&amp;quot;. Since the question at issue is whether human choices are ever instances of &amp;quot;free will&amp;quot;, this is a clear example of &lt;em&gt;petitio principii&lt;/em&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;

There are Septeloids:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The male non-human originated from the star system Delta Pavonis, 20 light-years from Earth where it was the 4th planet from their sun. It is roughly the same size as our Earth."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"We called the captured alien Septeloids. That was the identifying alien species name given to them by the astrobiologists on our team. I have no idea how they picked that name as well as some of the other odd-sounding alien species names ending with the suffix of 'loid.'"
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"The travel time to Earth was 18 Earth months using a very complex propulsion system and time-space displacement travel mode. Back then in 1980, we could not understand the alien propulsion system and we never saw his spacecraft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are Trantaloids:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source also reportedly stated to Martinez that the home world of the alleged hostile alien species, the Trantaloids, "is the third planet out from the star Epsilon Eridani in the constellation Eridanus at 10.5 light-years away. Although somewhat cooler and fainter than our sun, it is very similar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something about this story was nagging me, besides the fact that it was such weird conspiracy story/ufology mishmash — and then I remembered. &amp;quot;Time-space displacement travel mode&amp;quot;? Epsilon Eridani? Delta Pavonis? Me and some fellow geeks obsessed over that stuff in my college years: we were addicts of an old board game called &lt;a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2524/starforce-alpha-centauri-interstellar-conflict-in"&gt;&lt;i&gt;StarForce&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which you used time-space displacement travel to bop about the local stellar neighborhood, fighting aliens who were based on a few stars nearby…guess which ones? It was a nice star map that we played on, too, that actually had the coordinates of the known stars within (I think) 20 light years of earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crazy conspiracy theorists are still around, but you don&amp;#39;t find games like that any more — this was 30 years ago, before computers took over gaming. I think I still have it stuffed away in a box down in the basement, unless mice have gotten in and eaten all the cardboard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/beware_the_trantaloids.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Mx2NSGsXw4w" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272726351553"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/the_university_of_illinois_wil.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1414fb4efdc169fb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">The University of Illinois will be smitted…smoted…smattened…CURSED for their heresy!</title><published>2010-05-01T15:09:34Z</published><updated>2010-05-01T15:09:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/Is11rl1tyK8/the_university_of_illinois_wil.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/the_university_of_illinois_wil.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;They're in big trouble now: the &lt;a href="http://uiucatheists.blogspot.com/2010/04/chalkin-it-up-to-free-speech-aaf-stands.html"&gt;atheists chalked portraits of Mohammed on sidewalks all over campus&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I know, it’s Caturday, but I’ve expanded the concept — it’s &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; blog, y’know — to include all animals that I want it to. So here’s a pair of cuties for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/24229547@N03/4555650613/sizes/l/in/set-72157623161507347/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3003/4555650613_bdc7d2f43a.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click to enhootenate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/24229547@N03/4538513281/in/set-72157623161507347"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4024/4538513281_a839717ca3_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;These owlets — actually, Great Horned Owlets — are nested in a hollow stump about 5 meters off the ground along a creek not too far from my house. My wife heard about them, and we told her brother Chris, and he ran down there to get this and some other great pictures of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama and Papa Owl are usually nearby, in another tree, keeping watch. I was down there last week to see, and also spotted a hawk, a muskrat… and this guy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/greatblueheron_fish.jpg" alt="greatblueheron_fish" title="greatblueheron_fish" width="610" height="617"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a Great Blue Heron — a lot of birds around here are Great — and I saw it standing in a lake not far from the creek and the owl. As I watched, the heron suddenly stuck its head into the water and came up with that fish (anyone know what kind that is?). That’s a pretty good meal! I noticed another heron a bit farther away, and I wonder if they’re mates. A little while later I saw one of them flying around, and in the air they are simply amazing. Graceful and huge, and I stood there and gawked at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, that was a nice day to be out walking. Boulder in the spring is lovely (even if it snowed the other day; it melted in an hour or two though), and I have to remember to take some time to walk away from this accursed computer/internet/web thingy and actually breathe in some real life. There’s a lot of life out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bronze Age Scandinavians believed that the sun was pulled across the sky in a chariot by a horse. They built models depicting this out of cast bronze. A well-preserved one has been found at Trundholm on Zealand, and fragments remain of one from Tågaborg in Scania. They also depicted the motif on burial razors and, rarely, rock-carvings.&lt;/p&gt;

They are working there with fellow rock-art authorities Joakim Goldhahn and Kenneth Ihrestam. The team has also found more than a hundred carved ships, making Casimirsborg Småland's heaviest rock-carving location. This is the data coverage we're working with: all you have to do to re-draw the map completely is send a surveyor with specialised knowledge into one of the white spots. Well done, guys!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This attack on neo-Darwinism is misguided on two counts.  First, neo-Darwinism doesn’t really require that genetic variation originate by mutation in the species in which that variation is selected.  The dynamics of natural selection will work on adaptive genetic variation no matter what its source. Second, while bacteria often acquire genes from different species (much of antibiotic resistance, for example, is carried on plasmids—small circular pieces of DNA—that one species acquires from another), there are only a handful of cases in which nonbacterial “eukaryotes” (animals, plants, and fungi) get genes from a different species (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has a nice summary of these cases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason we think that LGT is fairly rare in eukaryotes is because we’d detect it by making DNA based phylogenies.  Genes captured from a different species, especially one that is quite different, would stick out of these phylogenies like sore thumbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, that is the method used by two researchers in a really nice demonstration of LGT between fungi and aphids, reported by &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/328/5978/624?sa_campaign=Email/toc/30-April-2010/10.1126/science.1187113"&gt;Nancy Moran and Tyler Jarvik in this week’s &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moran and Jarvik were studying a color polymorphism in the pea aphid (&lt;em&gt;Acyrthrosiphon pisum&lt;/em&gt;): some individuals are red, and others are green (Fig. 1).  This polymorphism behaves as if it were controlled by a single gene, with red color dominant to green.  Assays of differently colored aphids showed that they contain different kinds of the pigment carotene: green aphids have three types of carotenes, while red ones have those three and two additional ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-11216" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/01/aphids-nab-pigment-genes-from-fungus/red-vs-green-aphids_2/"&gt;&lt;img title="Red vs. green aphids_2" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/red-vs-green-aphids_2.jpeg?w=396&amp;amp;h=120" alt="" width="396" height="120"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;Fig. 1.  Clones of red and green aphids (from Moran and Jarvik).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the polymorphism is thought to be maintained by natural  selection: ladybugs preferentially pick off the red aphids, while green  aphids are more often destroyed by parasitoid wasps.  This may cause  frequency-dependent selection, in which the color morphs are kept polymorphic  because the &lt;em&gt;rarer&lt;/em&gt; forms are eaten/parasitized less frequently.  This kind  of selection can, theoretically, maintain both genes—and colors—in the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puzzled Moran and Jarvik, because all carotenes in animals have  been thought to come solely from diet, since no animal species is known  to make the pigments with its own metabolic machinery. (In &lt;em&gt;WEIT&lt;/em&gt;, I discuss how male house finches become more attractive mates if they have redder  feathers; the red pigment derives from carotenoids in the seeds that the  finches eat, and is a sign to a female of a healthy, well-fed male who  would be a better father [see photos below].)  But it’s unlikely that  aphids get carotenoids from plant sap (the aphids’ food), because those  pigments are not soluble in sap, and the carotenoid polymorphism  appears, as I said, to act as if it were produced by genes in the aphids  themselves.  Indeed, DNA sequencing—the aphid genome was just sequenced  completely—revealed that aphids do indeed carry carotenoid-synthesizing  genes in their genome.  There were seven of them, coding for both  carotenois desaturases and carotenoid synthases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led Moran and Jarvik to hypothesize that somehow the aphids  acquired genes for making carotenoids from another species, presumably  bacteria. They thus compared the aphid carotenoid genes to those from  other species in the genome databank.  And they got a surprise.  Yes,  the aphid genes did come from another species, but not a bacterial one.   They were closely related, instead, to genes from fungi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 gives a phylogenetic tree of the carotenoid desaturases, and  shows clearly that the aphid genes nest within the group of desaturases  from fungi.  This tree (and the tree for synthases as well) also show  that all seven of the aphid genes were acquired from fungi in a single  capture event between 80 and 30 million years ago.  We don’t know how  this happened, but it’s possible that an ancestral aphid infected with a  fungal disease captured some of the fungus DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-11207" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/01/aphids-nab-pigment-genes-from-fungus/aphids/"&gt;&lt;img title="Aphids" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/aphids.jpeg?w=408&amp;amp;h=528" alt="" width="408" height="528"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Fig. 2.  Phylogeny of carotenoid desaturase genes from various species.   Bacteria in black, plants in green, fungi in red, and aphids in blue.   Aphid genes cluster within fungus genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moran and Jarvik also showed that the red-versus-green polymorphism   is  based on a mutation that presumably happened &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the genes   were  captured:  green aphids derive from a “mutation” in one of the    carotenoid desaturase genes, a mutation that deleted about 30,000 base    pairs of the DNA.  Presumably the red color was ancestral, and the  green   resulted from an error in DNA replication.  (Moran and Jarvik  also   studied a mutation from red to green that spontaneously arose in  the   lab, and found that the new green form was based on a single  amino-acid   change, from glutamic acid to lysine, in the same  carotenoid desaturase   gene.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a remarkable use of an  acquired gene in an adaptive way, for  the captured fungus DNA is the  basis for the color polymorphism  presumably maintained by natural  selection.  It’s clear, then, that  evolution in one species can be  based on the acquisition of genetic  information from a distantly  related species.  Now that different  species’ genomes can be sequenced  quickly and reasonably cheaply, we’re  bound to find more cases like  this.  I don’t think they’ll be that  common, simply because we don’t  see evidence of LGT from existing gene  trees in animals and plants. Nevertheless, Moran and Jarvik have shown that nature still has the  capacity to surprise us.  And a  good thing, too, because it makes our  jobs as evolutionary biologists  even more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_CEL4Ypb_OQk/S9ti9JspiPI/AAAAAAAAAE0/grlWUeTajWU/s640/MainUnion.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_CEL4Ypb_OQk/S9ti9JspiPI/AAAAAAAAAE0/grlWUeTajWU/s640/MainUnion.JPG" title="Muhammad" width="550" height="416"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s Muhammad in the upper left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that offensive?  I say no.  If you get offended by that, no one should be taking you seriously, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AAF &lt;a href="http://uiucatheists.blogspot.com/2010/04/chalkin-it-up-to-free-speech-aaf-stands.html"&gt;justifies what they did like this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… AAF has wrestled with its collective conscience. It has weighed the dangers, it has been assaulted by the wielders of white guilt, and in the end it has decided that standing up against the enemies of freedom is worth the discomfort of a few who are innocent and our friends. Silencing anyone, including Matt Stone and Trey Parker, via threats and aggression is intolerable; and it will never stop until all of us agree that no one’s sacred cow unwrites basic human rights. You can cater to the whims of fundamentalists, or you can cater to fundamental rights, but you can’t do both.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More power to them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m also a fan of the Facebook groups that are supporting a &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Everybody-Draw-Muhammad-Day/116425498385947?ref=search&amp;amp;sid=32801186.71347645..1"&gt;Draw Muhammad Day&lt;/a&gt;.  You don’t have to draw him in some evil way (though you’re more than welcome to).  The point is that the rest of us don’t have to abide by Islamic law.  We have the freedom to draw whatever we want, whenever we want, and if there are people out there who want to stop us, we can fight back by banding together and drawing the image and having them take notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://imgur.com/XhMAP.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://imgur.com/XhMAP.jpg" title="Muhammad2" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;150 images of Muhammad were drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s more than enough to get the point across, even if some were erased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/uiucatheists/sets/72157623965391330/"&gt;more of their chalkings here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My respect to the AAF students who made this happen.  The drawings were simple and inoffensive.  It was a creative and powerful thing to do. &lt;/p&gt;

I am traveling to Harvard to participate in a panel organized by Chris Mooney on online science communication. The guy next to me is being a huge assclown. Sometimes I am fascinated by the level of assclownery in the world. I am intermittently amusing myself by turning and pretending to squeeze his head between my fingers. I am sure that this blog will continue to be crafted during the course of my travels, because I am too distracted by head squishing to finish it in a single bout.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of you may remember references on this humble blog to a "Dr. Buttercup," the faculty member that I share some lab space with. Well, yesterday I had the pleasure of introducing in a formal way a new character on the blog. I have traveled with the head of my academic division before and he has always known about the blog, although he has never been a regular reader. It wasn't until traveling to Experimental Biology together for the first time that he came to understand just how famous and beloved Isis the Scientist is. I mean, how could anyone not love me? I am hilarious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, yesterday while we were flying together, I wrote the post about narrowly avoiding a bar fight and he read it over my shoulder. Then, when I was finished, I asked him if it was alright to include it in my blog. He seemed surprised and asked, "Don't you write about me already?" I said, "No. I know that you don't really read my blog and I only write about people who give me permission and that I know will read the things I've written about them." He replied, "Well, I think I should start reading this more regularly so you can write about me." I told him that he would need a hilarious pseudonym if he was going to become a famous character on the interwebz. We chuckled and both agreed that I should give him the name I already use for him in real life - Dr. Triple Threat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why Dr. Triple Threat, you ask? A few months ago Dr. Triple Threat was getting his resources and funding issues in order, and forwarded me a letter of support that someone had written for him so that I could offer some feedback. It included the following statement:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm referring, of course, to [real name redacted] who is truly a "triple threat" physician-scientist in the most difficult field of [field redacted], namely [division redacted].&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;This statement cracked me up for hours and I had to immediately call him and tease him about it. You see, I get that the first part of the "triple threat" is that he is a physician. I get that the second part is that he has been trained as a scientist by world-famous physiologists. But, I don't get what the third part of the triple threat is and I have frequently speculated as to what it might be. His ninja skills? His invisibility cloak? High jumping abilities? Margarita making? Fast running? The possibilities are endless!! In fact, I would invite you to speculate in the comments section about the third skill that would truly make him a triple threat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday, Dr. Triple Threat and I returned to MRU together. At least, we tried to return to MRU. Traveling to MRU from the west coast is a challenge that frequently requires two plane changes. I had arranged an itinerary that took us through the seemingly harmless Salt Lake City airport, onto to a large hub airport, and then to MRU. However, because I am participating in a panel discussion at Harvard today, my plan was to continue from MRU on to Boston last night. It seemed like a fantastic plan, except for one problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It snowed yesterday in Salt Lake City. I mean, it really snowed. It snowed a huge clusterfuck of a mess all over Salt Lake City and we sat on the plane for more than 2 hours before we finally departed. This means that we missed our connection to MRU at the large hub airport, and I missed the leg of my trip that would take me to Boston. Now, I think the truest test of one's relationship with anyone comes when being stranded together for many hours without a clear path home. And, let me just say, our relationship was tested. Oh, how it was tested.&lt;br&gt;When we arrived at the large hub airport around 5pm, we found that we had been rescheduled for an MRU flight the following day that would arrive late morning. This worked for neither of us. He would not return in time for morning rounds and I would not make it to Boston in time for my panel. After much plotting and scheming, we decided that we would rent a car, drive the 5-6 hours to MRU, that I would drop him off, and then drive the additional 2 hours to another regional airport that had a flight that would get me to Boston in time to participate in my panel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bear in mind from yesterday's post that he and I had been up all night drinking scotch and getting in to trouble. Really, it sounded like a good idea at the time to just drive. However, in order to drive, we needed a car. The car rental place was down a level and I walked to the escalator. Dr. Triple Threat is a very active guy. An elite athlete, you might say, who takes every opportunity to move that he can find. He revolted against the escalator. "Do you know where the stairs are?" So, then I revolted. "If the biggest drama today is that you had to ride the escalator, I can call it a success. Get on the damn escalator."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We then went from car counter to car counter looking for a car that I could drop off 7 hours from the major hub airport. National. No dice. Enterprise. No dice. Budget. No dice. Hertz. No dice. Finally we found a car at Avis. As I was filling out the paperwork, Dr. Triple Threat asked, "Can we add an additional driver without charge." The lovely gentleman at Avis responded, "Well, are you married?" I was tired. I was exhausted. I just wanted to go home. And so I answered emphatically, "Yes." A man and a woman, 25 years apart in age, with different last names and driver's licenses from different states, but I exclaimed "Yes," praying that the man behind the counter would buy it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then I turned to look at Dr. Triple Threat, whose eyes had doubled in size. Desperate to leave the major hub city, I asked "Right, darling?" At that moment his phone rang in his hand and he responded, "Of course, sweetheart. The kids are calling." This scored us a car and, one new marriage and abandoned lost luggage later, we started our way towards MRU. But, I just could not seem to get over the humor of my new marital situation and, while leaving, made sure to tell the Avis representative that I was on my honeymoon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I thought our journey would be a success when I saw...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/05/rainbow-thumb-350x466-48136.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="DISPLAY:block;MARGIN:0px auto 20px;TEXT-ALIGN:center" height="466" alt="Thumbnail image for rainbow.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/05/rainbow-thumb-350x466-48136-thumb-350x466-48137.jpg" width="350"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: A lovely double rainbow. Surely a sign that we would have a safe journey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Little did I know that the Lord would soon forsake us...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img style="DISPLAY:block;MARGIN:0px auto 20px;TEXT-ALIGN:center" height="300" alt="Thumbnail image for rain.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/05/rain-thumb-400x300-48138.jpg" width="400"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Dr. Triple Threat driving through the tremendous, blinding thunderstorm that left us completely unable to see for some time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, Dr. Triple Threat told me to sleep while he drove. When I woke up, he looked exhausted. So, we stopped at Arby's and switched. I drove the rest of the way, but I was more than a little moved that even though he looked so exhausted, he was willing to take one for the team and keep driving so that I could sleep. Twenty-four hours of traveling together through some horrible conditions and we didn't kill each other. Dare I say, we still like each other. I might even go as far to say that I treasure these times together to talk about science and our careers, free from the demands of students, of clinical and scientific responsibilities, of teaching and committees and seminars. Now, almost 36 hours later, I have made it to Harvard and have given a successful talk largely because my newest husband let me sleep. I am pretty thankful for him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, welcome Dr. Triple Threat as a character to the blog.

Although Leptospira could survive out in wet environments if they had to, they thrive in the kidneys of rats and other maintenance hosts, where they form dense masses lining the inner surface of the kidney tubules.  The spirochetes spill into the urine that forms in the tubules, which drain into the bladder.  Animals colonized by their &amp;quot;preferred&amp;quot; serovar (immune type) shed Leptospira throughout their lives without ever showing signs of illness.  The tainted urine ends up contaminating soil and water with infectious Leptospira.Humans aren&amp;#39;t regarded as long-term carriers of Leptospira.  Rather, they are deemed &amp;quot;accidental&amp;quot; (incidental) hosts who may suffer serious complications from infection, including kidney failure and lung hemorrhage.  Humans get infected when they come into contact with contaminated water or soil or following direct exposure to infectious animal urine or tissue.  Leptospira enters through cuts in the skin or mucous membranes.  From there the motile spirochete spreads via the bloodstream and invades internal organs, including the kidneys, where they remain for the duration of the disease.  Patients typically stop releasing Leptospira into their urine after they recover from the illness, presumably because the spirochetes have been eliminated from their kidneys.  However, there have been a few reports of Leptospira excreted in urine months or even years following recovery from leptospirosis.  The truth is that no one has ever done a systematic study to determine how common the chronic carrier state is in humans.A team of investigators from the United States and Peru set out to find long-term carriers of Leptospira.  Their study is described in the February issue of PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases.  The authors examined the inhabitants of a rural Amazon village of Padrecocha near the city of Iquitos, Peru, where leptospirosis is endemic. The tropical climate is ideal for the survival of Leptospira in the moist environment favored by the spirochete.  Indeed, in an earlier study the authors detected infectious strains of Leptospira in the streams and wells serving the village.  Cattle, pigs, dogs, and rats, all potential carriers, freely roam the area.Ganoza and colleagues wanted to determine what percentage of the villagers were chronic carriers of Leptospira.  They first identified villagers who were not recently infected with Leptospira.  Out of the 314 healthy villagers enrolled in the study, 102 (32.5%) had no clinical or serological evidence of recent infection; they did not recall experiencing a fever during the previous year (fever is a typical symptom of leptospirosis), and they tested negative for newly-acquired Leptospira infection by IgM ELISA.The investigators next identified those whose kidney were colonized by Leptospira among the 102 who were not newly infected.  Since Leptospira living in the kidney tubules are shed into urine, they screened urine samples by nested PCR using primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene of Leptospira.  To exclude false-positive signals, the investigators screened the PCR-generated DNA (amplicon)  by dot blot  analysis with a Leptospira 16S rRNA probe.  Many false positive signals occurred because their Leptospira PCR primers also hybridized  to the 16S rRNA gene from Atopobium vaginae, a bacterium recently found to be associated with vaginosis.  When urine from the 102 &amp;quot;long-term&amp;quot; healthy individuals was screened, Leptospira DNA was found in 6 (5.9%).  Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that the carriers were colonized with L. interrogans, L. fainei, and L. licerasiae.  So it turns out that the asymptomatic carrier state is not as rare as initially believed.  More than 1 in 20 individuals who had been healthy for at least a year were colonized with Leptospira in their kidneys.The investigators found seven additional individuals colonized with Leptospira by screening urine from the other 212 individuals in the study.  Overall the percentage of shedders of Leptospira among all healthy individuals, irrespective of when they were infected, was 4.1% (13/314).  The concentration of Leptospira in the urine of shedders, as measured by quantitative PCR, was low, in the 102-104/ml range.  In contrast, rats may shed up to 108 spirochetes/ml!The study unearthed another surprise.  All 13 individuals who were shedding Leptospira at the time of the study (including the 6 chronic carriers) were women.  The proportion of women with Leptospira DNA in their urine (13/13, 100%) was significantly higher than the proportion of women in the group lacking detectable DNA in their urine (199/301, 66%, p = 0.011).  This result raises the possibility that women are more likely to become persistent carriers than men.  However, the authors pointed out that men were underrepresented in the study sample.  Less than one third of the villagers enrolled in the study were men.  Most of the other men were away at work when the authors were recruiting people for the study.  Agricultural occupations, which bring workers into contact with environmental sources of Leptospira, are well-known risk factors for infection by the spirochete in endemic areas.  Hence, male shedders of Leptospira may have been inadvertently excluded from the study.Another surprising result was that sera from all six chronic carriers failed to agglutinate Leptospira by MAT (microscopic agglutination test), a standard serological test used to check for Leptospira infection whether it occurred recently or years ago.  The authors mentioned that this was entirely consistent with old studies failing to detect agglutinating antibodies in the sera of some maintenance host animals excreting Leptospira. However, another possibility is that the &amp;quot;chronic human carriers&amp;quot; may have actually acquired asymptomatic infections very recently.  They could have been enrolled in the study before the anti-Leptospira IgM and agglutinating antibodies had enough time the accumulate to the cut-off value selected for the IgM ELISA and MAT, respectively.  Although the authors discout the possibility of newly acquired asymptomatic infections accounting for seronegative results of the shedders, they recommended longitudinal studies to clarify the issue.The authors posed several questions raised by their study:Does persistent Leptospira infection of human kidneys have any subtle effect on their function? If so, is antibiotic treatment warranted?Are some strains of Leptospira more likely than others to persistently infect the kidneys of humans?  .Can persistent human shedders be a source of transmission of Leptospira to other humans (and animals)?Future studies will need to include urine cultures to demonstrate that Leptospira shed by human carriers are alive.In conclusion, this is an important study that challenges the simplistic notion that humans are incidental hosts of Leptospira.  The reality appears to be more complicated.ReferenceGanoza, C.A., Matthias, M.A., Saito, M., Cespedes, M., Gotuzzo, E., &amp;amp; Vinetz, J.M.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They  basically were able to convince the victim that some money she had   gotten was cursed money and that somehow that curse had transferred to   other money that she had,” said Chicago police Detective Milorad   Sofrenovic of the Grand Central area. “They told her that in order to be   able to remove this curse, they needed to take this money physically  to  a shrine in Indiana and with prayers drive the curse from the  money.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn that cooties!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/04/29/shocker-semen-isnt-holy/"&gt;Fake rabbi tricks women into thinking his semen is holy&lt;/a&gt; – The story I remember the most from The Decameron was &lt;a href="http://cheetahschoice.50webs.com/dec.html"&gt;the tale of the priest who teaching a woman how to put the devil back into the Hell&lt;/a&gt;. By devil he meant his penis. And by hell, he meant her vagina. This story is a lot lot like that only its a guy pretending to be a rabbi and he convinced women that his semen could heal body and soul. And of course he could pass this holy power to them through touch and by cleansing their bodies. And of course they bought it. Of course, had he not used religion to lure them into a false sense of blind trust, this probably never would have happened. Silly rabbi. Tricks are for kids. But where can I find women this gullible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Am I a Former Smoker? Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bias and Activism In the Public Health Community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been put off by the aggressive efforts from the more extreme elements of the public health community. Though my own field is very different, I’m close to this subject because my wife is a researcher on public health issues. (I hasten to add that she’s not among the radicals I’m targeting here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the worst of these efforts are biased and even propagandistic. They’re a clear violation of basic scientific principles and values (perhaps pseudo-science is a more appropriate term for it), because they imply using fear to manipulate individuals into a desired way of thinking. I wanted to understand the motives that lay behind such a corruption of scientific values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I freely admit that I despise the people who do this; conversely, I admire those who seek to put their own strongly held views aside and strive for objectivity. What follows are some good examples of both with names, and some random observations that you can evaluate as you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before launching my own (latest and so far successful) quit, I visited some websites devoted to quitting smoking. There are so many useless ones! Here are three that I found interesting and useful. They illustrate the strikingly different ways that smokers who want to quit are seen by public health professionals. The first offers simple, straightforward support by way of short videos and essays. The second addresses the effectiveness of many of the quit smoking products, and the third reveals the entrenched attitudes of some of the more radical no-smoking advocates and what it is they really&lt;br&gt;
seek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Joel Spitzer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, &lt;a href="http://whyquit.com/"&gt;Why Quit&lt;/a&gt; is a useful site you can trust (founded and edited by John Polito, based on the smoking cessation work of Joel Spitzer). But keep in mind that one needs to be critical when browsing Spitzer’s documents and videos. For example, one of Spitzer’s documents asserts that addiction to smoking is a disease, perhaps even a form of mental illness. That’s poppycock, of course. But that curious document is an exception to the rule of this site: He has posted many videos that are engaging, funny, and helpful. The fundamental principle underlying everything on this site is the idea that you must quit cold turkey. The mantra is: “Never take another puff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I couldn’t manage a perfect cold turkey quit – the result being that even though I learned from Spitzer’s site, his method failed for me. I’ve no doubt that it can work for others, however, and surely this is a site that deserves your attention. Spitzer has obviously put a great deal of thought, time, and effort into it; he seems to have no hidden agenda; and in particular, he makes no money from the documents/books that are offered up for downloading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Scott Leischow, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Leischow is a prominent public health professional – a professor in  both colleges of medicine and public health at the University of Arizona. I include him because in &lt;a href="http://streaming.biocom.arizona.edu/event/?id=20746"&gt;this particular 50-minute video&lt;/a&gt;, he discusses results of clinical trials of various Nicotine Replacement Therapies (gum, zyban, patches, etc.). These NRT devices all deliver nicotine to the body as cigarettes do, but by different routes that do not involve the lungs. They have no long-term effect on nicotine addition, and presumably, the issue is whether by avoiding the lungs and ingesting these products in a controlled way, they can help smokers on a program of quitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His lecture begins after an excruciatingly long-winded introduction by an administrator. About 15-20 minutes into the lecture itself, you will hear professor Leischow say, quite unequivocally, that in the “real world”, nicotine replacement therapies do not work! He goes on to say that some of the newer products – such as Champix, which works directly on the neurotransmitters of your brain – seem to be promising, but have not yet had sufficient clinical trials to rigorously establish their effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Stanton Glantz, Ph.D.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though we don’t know each other personally, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanton_Glantz"&gt;Stanton Glantz&lt;/a&gt; and I are in some sense colleagues. (He’s on the faculty of the medical school of UCSF, while I’m in a science department of UC Berkeley.) However, on public health issues concerning smoking, we are polar opposites. So while I have an obligation to try to be even-handed with what I say about him, I also have a duty to criticize more sharply than I normally would. I do not intend this as a personal attack, but rather an alert for the unwary: Professor Glantz is an idealogue who follows his advocacy, and smokers should view his positions as those of an adversary – with caution if not suspicion. He’s certainly not our friend – having little or no compassion for smokers – even smokers who are searching for a way to quit. I have the impression that he sees himself as a champion of virtue (Off with their heads, Hallelujah!), with ends justifying means – brimming over with hubris. On a subconscious level he scares me – as do all zealots who are not simply fools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I emphasize that Glantz is a prominent anti-smoking activist who has been effective in actions against the tobacco industry (which is laudable). He is also a leader in the movement to curtail smoking cigarettes by anyone, anywhere – and I suspect that what he wants is the complete elimination of  smoking cigarettes (not so laudable, in my opinion). It’s even conceivable to me that what he really wants is to criminalize smoking cigarettes – just like illegal narcotics. Certainly it’s no secret that elimination of smoking is the Holy Grail to extreme anti-smoking activists like Glantz. Never mind the lessons learned from prohibition, the backyard stills, the bad booze, and Al Capone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago I attended a dinner on the UC Berkeley campus for which Glantz was featured speaker. He was proselytizing about the dangers of secondhand smoke. One of the main points of his talk was to promote fear of “free” cigarette smoke as a carcinogen even when diluted by orders of magnitude from its presence in inhaled cigarette smoke. I recall that he made the point in the following way: “If someone across the room lights a cigarette right now, I will begin to smell it in less than a minute.” The point being, I suppose, that if you can smell it, it might be enough kill you. I remember thinking that if I were to light the log in the room’s fireplace, in short order everyone in the room would smell it and be exposed to all those impurities and carcinogens in the flames of the burning log. But wouldn’t most of us enjoy smelling that log burn, and how many of us are put at risk by smelling burning logs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, this was a red herring, and I was annoyed. I remember taking out my pack of cigarettes and putting it on the table in front of me, thinking how much fun it would be to light up and test his hypothesis. Alas, lighting the thing would have created a ruckus, and ruined what had been a pleasant enough evening before professor Glantz began his indoctrination. So I didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took questions after his lecture, and I asked: “You’ve advocated huge increases in taxes on cigarettes. This will impact people with little money significantly more than the rest of us. Does it concern you that the poorest people will be among the most impacted?” I don’t recall the details of his response, but I do recall that it was disturbing to learn that this was not something that particularly concerned Professor Glantz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’ve only done one cold reading in my life,&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/psychics-contract-michael-jacksons-ghost/#comments"&gt; in the comments section of this very blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t waste time for Rosemary. I’ll do it. Your mother says she’s in a  wonderful place. She loves you and she knows how much you love her. She  wants me to acknowledge a piece of jewelry you wear and/or old  photograph you keep framed by your bed that reminds you of her. Oh, and  I’m getting a what looks like either the letter J or the letter M that  is somehow associated with your mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that one was free on account that, like Rosemary, I have no  actual psychic powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I was given very high marks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the free reading. I realize you make no claims as does  Sylvia Browne so it means a lot. Ever since I lost her in 1976 I have  always wanted a reading, but never trusted a pychic enough to pay for  one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother’s name was Jane, so you got the “J” right. There were two  “M’s” in her maiden name, and her sister’s name was Marian, in fact.  My  Aunt Marian was also like a mother to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought you got the rest wrong at first glance but had to think  about it.&lt;br&gt;
I do have a framed picture by my bed near it, kind of next to it, and  have all of her old jewelry but don’t think I wear any of it regularly.   The jewelry is also next to my bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get any other feelings I would welcome more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am extremely psychic, have predicted that someone was going to die  and when, and they did. Very disturbing and haunting. Not much of a gift  but more of a curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t channel from dead people but I can read live people pretty  well. I can see things other people don’t. I can take an initial dislike  to someone and see a vision where something isn’t right. I have had  dreams come true and predicted at least one disaster through a dream.  Dreamt people died and actually heard a news broadcast before George  Wallace was shot that he was shot then came home and heard the same  broadcast, although it was real that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks. I look more to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of them is the “home study.” The adoption home study is a comprehensive written report about the prospective adoptive parents. It is written by a social worker and paints a picture of you and your life so that they can find the child that would be the best match for your family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information for the home study is gathered over a period of months before you are licensed to adopt. Though each state or country is different, the home study generally includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autobiographical and family background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Criminal background checks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial statements or tax returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical health reports and TB tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;References from friends and family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information gathered by interviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A worker will conduct an interview or series of interviews in your home. They will check to make sure that your home is safe and that ample space is available for a child or children. In the interview, they aim to find out more about the type of child that you would like to adopt, your hobbies, personality, lifestyle, sense of humor, parenting style and everything else about you. Relax during the interview and let your personality shine through!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home study is crucial in receiving a placement. When selecting a family for a child available for adoption, they review a number of home studies (maybe hundreds) before making their selection.&lt;/p&gt;

Many experts agree that it is a valuable and positive experience for infants that may even affect their relationships later on in life. So, what about adopted &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/babies/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=babies&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;babies&lt;/a&gt; – do they have to miss out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:460px"&gt;&lt;img title="breastfeeding_feat" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/03/breastfeeding_feat.jpg" alt="Breastfeeding" width="450"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When going through the adoption process, some parents don’t realize that breastfeeding is actually feasible. All women can produce some &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/breast/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=breast&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;breast&lt;/a&gt; milk, though it varies how much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using a breast pump every few hours, mothers may be able to induce lactation. A &lt;a href="http://www.medelabreastfeedingus.com/products/breastfeeding-devices/51/supplemental-nursing-system-sns"&gt;Supplemental Nursing System&lt;/a&gt; may be needed as well. If you really want to breastfeed and aren’t producing any milk, drugs such as Domperidone will also help but consider the side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of books on the subject of adoptive breastfeeding, including &lt;em&gt;Breastfeeding the Adoptive Baby and Relactation&lt;/em&gt; by Elizabeth Hormann. You can also check out the &lt;a href="http://www.llli.org/WebIndex.html"&gt;La Leche League&lt;/a&gt; to find out more about breastfeeding. They have local groups for support and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all the positive feedback, there are people who view breastfeeding a baby that is not biologically yours to be…well, disgusting. What do you think about breastfeeding an adopted baby? Do you think all babies should be breastfed?  Let us know your experiences below.&lt;/p&gt;

Nuclear threats, unfair elections, captive reporters, a lack of religious freedom, all seem to demand that we do something. But what is to be done? What are the actual conditions in Iran, and what kind of leverage do we in the Western world, and particularly in the U.S. have to effect change? Last summer, Stephanie Zvan was privileged to chat with Dr. William Beeman, professor of anthropology at the University of Minnesota and a leading Western scholar of Iran. They discussed the intersection of religion and politics in Iran, U.S.-Iranian relations, and the culture of Iran, including conditions for women. Some of what she learned surprised her. It may surprise you too. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the great things that the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years.php"&gt;Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; has given us is a whole slew of images of supernovae and remnant of past supernovae, from recent ones like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1987A"&gt;SN 1987a&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/supernova_remnants_now_and_the/lores.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/supernova_remnants_now_and_the/lores-thumb-500x390-48117.jpeg" width="500" height="390" alt="lores.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to supernovae that are hundreds of years old, like Tycho Brahe's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1572"&gt;supernova from 1572&lt;/a&gt;.  In fact, Hubble is so powerful that it actually found the companion star that resulted in the Supernova exploding in the first place!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/supernova_remnants_now_and_the/heic0415a.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/supernova_remnants_now_and_the/heic0415a-thumb-500x260-48119.jpeg" width="500" height="260" alt="heic0415a.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one of the remarkable things about these supernovae is that their outer layers -- the gases blown off by the explosion -- are &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; expanding!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce you to the first supernova ever recorded in human history: the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1006"&gt;supernova of 1006&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/supernova_remnants_now_and_the/SN1006.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/supernova_remnants_now_and_the/SN1006-thumb-500x500-48121.jpeg" width="500" height="500" alt="SN1006.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These gases are hot, and so are best viewed by an X-ray telescope; Chandra was the one that snapped the above image.  But there are ribbons of gas that glow at the right temperature that they emit visible light, and the Hubble space telescope can see them!  Take a look for yourself.  (And, like all the images in this post, click for a huge, full-screen version.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/supernova_remnants_now_and_the/Supernova%20Remnant%20SN%201006.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/supernova_remnants_now_and_the/Supernova%20Remnant%20SN%201006-thumb-500x200-48123.jpeg" width="500" height="200" alt="Supernova Remnant SN 1006.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hubble took this picture in 2006, and it's awfully pretty (and will remind some of you of &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111280/"&gt;Star Trek: Generations&lt;/a&gt;).  The ribbon of gas is about 7,200 light years away, which makes imaging it in any detail an amazing feat!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what's remarkable about this ribbon is that a different large telescope, &lt;a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/"&gt;CTIO&lt;/a&gt;, imaged it back in 1998, eight years prior.  And what do you suppose we see if we overlay those two images on top of one another?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/supernova_remnants_now_and_the/File%3ASN%201006%20Remnant%20Expansion%20Comparison.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/supernova_remnants_now_and_the/File%3ASN%201006%20Remnant%20Expansion%20Comparison-thumb-500x380-48125.jpeg" width="500" height="380" alt="File:SN 1006 Remnant Expansion Comparison.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ribbon is moving, and &lt;i&gt;quickly&lt;/i&gt;!  (Remember, it's 7,200 light years away!)  It must be moving awfully quickly to notice a change in its position over just eight years, and what did we find?  Exactly what we'd expect: the ribbon is expanding &lt;b&gt;away&lt;/b&gt; from the center of the explosion!

How and when it will be stopped is entirely unknown.  The mayonnaise-like oil is being blown ashore into the nursery for shrimp for the whole region and the home of hundreds of the other species.  Welcome to what may turn out to be the worst single human-caused environmental disaster ever.   (Unless you regard global warming in general as a single event.  Semantics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/04/leak.jpg" alt="leak" title="leak" width="432" height="318"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thing is going to need a name.  The Exxon Valdez incident was a spill – there was a finite amount of oil aboard the ship.  A lot of oil: 11 million gallons (40 million liters).   The new one in the Gulf of Mexico could blow past that, depending on whether present efforts to &lt;a href="http://media.al.com/live/photo/oilslickundergraphicjpg-57e28ddd55b0847f.jpg"&gt;close the valve or drill a relief well&lt;/a&gt; work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that we called it the “Exxon Valdez” incident clearly indicates the responsible (if not guilty) party involved.  So, though I like the moniker “Spill, Baby, Spill” from a political point of view, it doesn’t lay any blame and this thing is not a spill.  It’s a leak, and BP leased the rig from Transocean LTD, the world’s largest offshore drilling contractor.  I think the responsibility has yet to be determined.  If you rent a car, and wipe out a family in an accident because the steering was faulty, is it your fault or the car manufacturer’s?   It may take some time, or even never be known, what happened a week ago to cause this tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of the rig was the Deepwater Horizon, but that doesn’t convey ownership or responsibility.  Will this become known as the “BP Deepwater Horizon Spill”?  The “Transocean/BP Leak”?   The media seem to be stuck on “spill” and so I bet that will be in the name long term…and it will take a very long time to assess responsibility here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart goes out to the families of the 11 lost on the rig, and to the thousands of fishermen and others whose livelihoods are in peril.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve suspended new offshore drilling until we have understood this incident better.  And no doubt a new debate about offshore drilling will ensue.  This has certainly put the lie to those who claim that new modern drilling rigs are far safer than in the past, something even President Obama was saying as recently as April 2.  Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

There has been a recent outbreak in Pennsylvania; don't rush out to buy the last of the fruits in an apocalyptic terror, it's just a hint of a potential problem for the future, but you can worry a little bit. And maybe you can promote some science that will help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tomorrowstable/2010/04/honey_sweet_plum.php"&gt;new variety of plum called the Honey Sweet has been genetically engineered&lt;/a&gt; that is completely resistant to the virus. It is just now in the process of being deregulated by the EPA, and they're looking for &lt;a href="http://www.regulations.gov/search/Regs/home.html#docketDetail?R=EPA-HQ-OPP-2008-0742"&gt;public comment&lt;/a&gt; (it's a confusing site: look for "Public Participation for Coat Protein Gene of Plum Pox Virus", and "Comment Due"; click on it and &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; can tell the government what they should do).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work fast, this is the last day for input.

They seem to be always looking for better education opportunities, for strategies to help them wend their way through the special education minefield, and, for help paying for their child's special needs and the extra-ordinary costs they have because they have a special child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Obama transition, I read several blogs where people were encouraged to raise their issues, and, the autism parents did. They mentioned how health insurance refuses to pay for science based treatments because Autism is considered to be a pre-existing condition. They mentioned how hard it is to get respite care, for themselves and their child. They mentioned so many things, except, finding a "cure" or a cause of Autism. These are the parents who are truly hurting for their kids. Read &lt;a href="http://www.massmutual.com/autism"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What continually amazes me is that these parents are uniformly ignored by the likes of JB Handley, Jenny McCarthy, Dan Olmsted, David Kirby, Katie Wright, and the other pied pipers of the AoA/Anti-Vaccination collective. How often is there a blog article about these issues? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we do know is that Mr. Handley is rich and wrong about just about everything. I've been wondering how much rich plays into this. Handley, the Wrights, Jenny McCarthy--none of them have to think about whether their child will attend a good school, get good therapies and, most of all, whether they will be cared for after their parents are gone. These families are wealthy, and they have taken care of these issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the best of my knowledge, Olmsted and Kirby (who is now pursuing BigFarma) do not have children or family affected by Autism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clearly, they are all out of touch with the rank and file of parents, and seem to have zero incentive to advocate for anything really worthwhile for autistic kids or adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone think that they could care less if public schools had better special education classes or if there were programs for autistic (and other disabled) adults to help them live at something above the poverty level? This will not impact their children (unless they lose their fortune in the next collapse) and they seem to be just too narcissistic to care about anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder what they will do when their child who will still be autistic reaches adulthood. I strongly suspect that they will be quietly placed in an institution or "home" somewhere out of sight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What seems to aggravate people like Handley, et al, the most is that their child being autistic is - for many of them - is the first problem they've ever encountered that couldn't be solved by money. I would wager that they have hired help at home. Someone to help provide for day-to-day services for their children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is not to say that all wealthy people are like this. I personally know one family, who was wealthy before George (Washington, not Bush) was president. They give, and they advocate in more ways than one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, some of them (JB, for instance) seem equate wealth with high intelligence precisely BECAUSE they are so rich. Has he actually said this? No. However, reading between the lines, and observing his actions, have led me to believe this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of them, notably JB, have repeatedly denigrated real scientists - ALL of whom know more about autism, mercury, vaccines, medicine, biology, chemistry, etc. - than he does (or ever will). They calls them "stupid", pharmashill, or worse. When pressed, their arguments always devolves into some form of "I'm filthy rich and they aren't, so I MUST be smarter than they are." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it never occurs to these rich people that they GOT that way largely by chance - by birth (the ultimate random event) or by making the right bet in business, stocks, etc. Years ago, I heard a comment about some spoiled rich kid. The person mentioned that the kid was lucky because his father was born before him. When his father died, he took over the business, and ran it into bankruptcy in short order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With this mindset, all they have left is to want a cure to rid themselves of the inconvenience of having a special needs child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One other point. The vitriol aimed at some of the scientists and physicians is intense. However, if you, as they say, "follow the money" you will see that the level of bile that these people spill out is directly proportional to the money these scientists have made. This explains why JB, et al, have always made Dr. Paul Offit their number one target. To them, Dr. Offit had the unmitigated nerve of making a lot of money, and then still caring about all children, even autistic ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they will finally "get it" perhaps some of the families who are truly under an onerous task of raising a special child will get help. Until then, the cloud is as dark as the ash cloud from the volcano no one can type or pronounce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Major kudos to LB/RB for bringing this to the attention of the blogosphere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a comment Mike Stanton raises the question of where the advocacy organizations are on this issue. The letter that prompted the investigation is signed by 30 groups. 30? Why not hundreds? There are many more advocacy groups that 30.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Think about this for a moment. Our troops in Iraq could not use these aversive devices against prisoners at Abu Graib, since it would be torture. We cannot use them at Gitmo, for the same reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where are the bloggers who are speaking out on this issue? Why the silence?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I specfically wonder where AoA is?

Actually, he was trying to promote a monkey study by Andy Wakefield, who had recently been reamed out by the GMC in the UK, and them got another thrashing when the Lancet retracted his "study" that lead to the MMR panic that resulted in thousands of preventable cases of measles and mumps, and several dead children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, Andy and his henchmen had submitted that study to Journal of Neurotoxicology and were awaiting publication, which seemed to be delayed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, as Orac &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/02/wakefield_retracted_again.php"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, the editors of Neurotoxicology have snatched that paper out of the hopper.

Here, I want to address the media and let them see just how sloppy they are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And they are sloppy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was reading a newsgroup and came across a link to a &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;amp;q=http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DE1z7KSEnyxw%26feature%3Drelated&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEl0C9FYu1JvUnXboqdvL4iFI2WgQ"&gt;video &lt;/a&gt;of a news story aired on Fox News dealing with the H1N1 virus and, at that time, the soon to be released vaccine. They included the usual and customary "infectious disease expert".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After I viewed the video, and, as usual, I decided to check out the good doctor, Kent Holtorf. He demonstrated a truly impressive skill set that I have rarely seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since he is an MD, I like to check medical credentials. He is &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;amp;q=http://licenselookup.mbc.ca.gov/licenselookup/lookup.php%3FLicenseType%3DG%26LicenseNumber%3D74797&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGREI_XGIr_rX_Ax--IBsIWrI775A"&gt;licensed &lt;/a&gt;to practice medicine by the Medical Board of California: &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;License: G 74797&lt;br&gt;License Type: Physician and Surgeon&lt;br&gt;Licensee may be a U.S. or Canadian medical school graduate whose pathway to licensure was based on the NBME examination.&lt;br&gt;Name: KENT ALAN HOLTORF, M.D. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I redacted his address.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Address of Record County: LOS ANGELES&lt;br&gt;License Status: License Renewed &amp;amp; Current&lt;br&gt;Licensee meets requirements for the practice of medicine in California.&lt;br&gt;Public Record Action(s): No Public Record Actions available&lt;br&gt;Original Issue Date: July 28, 1992&lt;br&gt;Expiration Date: June 30, 2010&lt;br&gt;School Name: ST. LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE&lt;br&gt;Year Graduated: 1991 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;So far, so good. He is licensed and in good standing. No discipline. Next.... &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activities In Medicine: PATIENT CARE - 20 TO 29 HOURS&lt;br&gt;RESEARCH - 20 TO 29 HOURS&lt;br&gt;TEACHING - 10 TO 19 HOURS&lt;br&gt;ADMINISTRATION - 20 TO 29 HOURS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary Practice Location Zip Code: 90505&lt;br&gt;Board Certification(s): No board certifications identified&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I expect that any physician who has made the effort to secure board certification would list that with the licensing agency.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary Practice Area(s): FAMILY PRACTICE&lt;br&gt;Secondary Practice Area(s): ENDOCRINOLOGY&lt;br&gt;Post Graduate Training Years: 3 YEARS&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 years is an adequate period of post graduate training for someone to qualify for board certification. It seems to be getting stranger by the moment &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I do not answer these questions, either, and this really is not germane:)&lt;br&gt;Ethnic Background: Declined to Disclose&lt;br&gt;Foreign Language(s): Declined to Disclose&lt;br&gt;Gender: Declined to Disclose &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Since the video calls him an expert in infectious diseases. Well, that would usually mean he would be board certified in that discipline. Since he did not list board certification in his license (I know it is not required), I decided to check with the &lt;a href="http://www.abms.org/"&gt;American Board of Medical Specialties&lt;/a&gt;. You'll have to register, but, it is free and does not generate spam. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was shocked to find that Dr. Holtorf is not listed by the ABMS as being board certified. Didn't Fox News say he was in infectious disease &lt;strong&gt;EXPERT?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since he listed his main practice area as Family Practice, one the harder disciplines, and endocrinology as his secondary, I thought I would check to see whether he has any published research. His licensing information states that &lt;strong&gt;he spends 20 TO 29 HOURS a week engaged in research&lt;/strong&gt;, and this should generate a peer reviewed study or three . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I went to PubMed and, searching on "Holtorf K", which would give me the widest search parameters I found: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bioidentical hormone debate: are bioidentical hormones (estradiol, estriol, and progesterone) safer or more efficacious than commonly used synthetic versions in hormone replacement therapy? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holtorf K. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postgrad Med. 2009 Jan;121(1):73-85. Review.&lt;br&gt;PMID: 19179815 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmmm....this is not peer reviewed, and it is a review of other research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and then this one...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormones in wellness and disease prevention: common practices, current state of the evidence, and questions for the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz ET, Holtorf K.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prim Care. 2008 Dec;35(4):669-705.&lt;br&gt;PMID: 18928825 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am glad to see he is sharing his knowledge, but, neither are research articles. So, I then looked at his websites:. The &lt;a href="http://www.hormoneandlongevitycenter.com/hormonedoctor/&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHDTKSBWP8v7XUDcV38fhyYoFr-xw"&gt;first &lt;/a&gt;I looked at, led me to the &lt;a href="http://www.holtorfmed.com&amp;amp;usg=afqjcnepoxs54kgf6ltcw_l5fdyccswzmg/"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I looked high and low, every page, and found nothing showing that the good doctor has published any peer reviewed research on infectious diseases, not has he listed any training or other experience in that field. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I did find was interesting, thought. Using the search tool on the website, I did a search on vaccine and was referred to a page where his appearances on rush Limboob, Sean Insanity (Hannity), Glen Beck, et al, are referenced and linked. They all refer to him as an expert on infectious diseases. Thus, my search for proof that he is a true expert on infectious disease led to nothing. I was disappointed in that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not all was lost. The simple fact is, the good doctor has managed to demonstrate just how easy it is to bamboozle the media. Either they never bothered to check his credentials, or, because he was spouting their party line, it did not matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I did some additional Googling of his name and found that the NY Daily News, the newspaper of my youth, the one I delivered, the one which used to have the best sports section in the world, had several articles where he is referred to as a &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/health/2009/05/26/2009-05-26_estrogen_and_immunity_experts_explain_why_female_hormones_arent_a_quick_fix_for_.html"&gt;board certified endocrinologist&lt;/a&gt; in one article, and a specialist in &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2009/06/15/2009-06-15_women_who_gossip_can_live_a_happy_and_healthier_life_study_finds.html"&gt;women's health &lt;/a&gt;in another. (There is no board certification in women's health, unless they meant OB-GYN, and he is not board certified in that, either). In another &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/01/22/2010-01-22_how_did_some_haiti_earthquake_victims_survive_nearly_two_weeks_under_rubble_docs.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, concerning the Haitian tragedy that is still unfolding as I write, he comments on how high humidity could increase survival times while buried in the rubble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the good doctor has demonstrated just how lousy an idea it is to rely on the media for medical advice and information. Utterly sloppy of these august organs of the 4th Estate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that I was not surprised with my findings. I expected nothing more that this from Fox News, and those who bought the line. Their "research" seems to consist of determining whether a good story can hit the media, and whether it may be controversial. Having homeopathic like expertise is another criteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the Daily News, they have NO excuses. Their own internal archives demonstrate that there is a question regarding the doctor's "expertise". They should be ashamed of themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I have no doubt, confirmed over the months since then, they are the cesspool of ignorance. However, out of every cesspool grows something. The past few months have shown that the growth is truly worthy of being born in a cesspool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AoA has moved on from the mere &lt;a href="http://age-of-ignorance.blogspot.com/2008/11/welcome-blog.html"&gt;censorship&lt;/a&gt; that had initially concerned me. Granted, I wrote &lt;a href="http://age-of-ignorance.blogspot.com/2008/11/welcome-blog.html"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://age-of-ignorance.blogspot.com/2009/01/fully-loaded-10cc-syringe-award.html"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;about some of their more nefarious tactics, most specifically "outing". "Outing" occurs when a person who has chosen a degree of anonymity by using a pseudonym has their real name linked. I have been outed by some of the drones of the AoA collective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, outing, and their other old tactics, are merely annoyances in the scheme of things. What has happened recently is that the True Believers of the AoA collective have taken several quantum steps further.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back around Thanksgiving time 2009, the Collective posted an article which had a photoshopped image of several people sitting around what looked to be a Thanksgiving dinner table, preparing to eat a baby. Who were these people? The post includes a poorly photoshopped picture of prominent science-based medicine proponents feasting on a dead baby. The guests were journalist Alison Singer, the NIH's head honcho Tom Insel, journalist Trine Tsouderos, Science and Science Based Medicine Blogger and Editor Steve Novella, Amy Wallace and the "One They Fear The Most" bogeyman extraordinaire, vaccine developer, saver of the lives of thousand of children, Dr. Paul Offit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The blogosphere was in an uproar, and the intellectual cowards of the AoA Collective removed the offending post. The photo is available elsewhere. I will not link to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Did this event constitute a set-back for the Drones? Not at all. It appears to have energized them into perpetrating even more outrageous attacks on those who have the nerve to disagree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately, Trine Tsouderos and her editors at the courageous Chicago Tribune (I would live there if it were warmer in the winter) was not intimidated by the initial attack. Following the heritage of great journalists, the ones I learned about in my college course on the History of Journalism which was part of my minor in Journalism, they forged ahead, and continued to investigate and study the Evil Empire of the anti-vaccinationists masquerading as "pro-safe vaccines" advocates that infest the Autism community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On January 17, 2010, the Tribune published the &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/chi-autism-chemicaljan17,0,6466364.story"&gt;third article&lt;/a&gt; in Trine Tsouderos three part series. In this article she exposes Dr. Boyd Haley's probable illegal marketing of an industrial chemical agent as a supplement, to be administered to children with Autism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just who is Boyd Haley? Simple, he is the darling of the AoA Collective. However, a look at his record does show something interesting about this retired professor of chemistry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peter Bowditch of Ratbags asked Haley about "claim that mercury is 50% of thimerosal". Have you taken high school chemistry? If so, find your old text books and check out whether this has any meaning what-so-ever. While it is true that the one atom of Mercury comprises approximately 50% of the molecular weight of thimerosal, does this have any chemical or toxicological significance? Peter's &lt;a href="http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/haley.htm"&gt;exchange &lt;/a&gt;with Haley would lead anyone who has not taken high school chemistry to think so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now he is marketing this industrial chelator for human consumption, and IGNORING THE FDA's requests for information. Haley said, "... that the compound had been tested on rats and that a food safety study was conducted on 10 people[and himself, do the math = 11]". When she asked him to "...provide documentation of the studies, he stopped communicating with the Tribune."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, the Drones of the Collective took over and, AoA mercilessly hunted down Tsouderos' family and outed them. Read Orac's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/01/the_anti-vaccine_movement_strikes_back_a.php"&gt;excellent article&lt;/a&gt; and the one by Ken Reibel at &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/01/another-hit-job-from-aoa/"&gt;LeftBrain/RightBrain&lt;/a&gt;. I am sure there are more, and I invite links in the comments. Please.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There have been many other attacks, too numerous for me to compile here. Others have, and links in the comments would be appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, what does this all mean? Simple, and it truly is. We now know that the Drones of the AoA collective will stoop as low as they can go and stop at nothing to silence those with whom they disagree. Initially, their tactics reminded me of the response by Scientology to the Time Magazine article by &lt;a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Fishman/time-behar.html"&gt;Behar&lt;/a&gt;. Do your own search, and see how ugly that got.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orac mentioned in one of his articles (I cannot find it) that this also reminded him of Scientology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, we are both wrong. The tactics being used, and the overall strategy are pure terrorist based tactics that are being used to stifle and silence critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, that is why the Age of Autism is now most correctly referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Al-Qaeda of Autism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%"&gt;I truly hope that the Tribune, and other news sources, pick up on this story and begin a year long counterattack on the terrorism. The power of the press,  in Oliver Wendell Holmes' Free Market Place of Ideas, is the most potent weapon in the battle for truth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside: A lot of people said Jen’s idea was a bad one in the name of feminism.  (A day for women to make their opposition to the foolish cleric known, and a chance to band together in the name of Science (kind of)… and it involved showing off their boobs?!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greta Christina&lt;/strong&gt; doesn’t think Boobquake was anti-feminist at all.  Rather, &lt;a href="http://carnalnation.com/content/53861/486/feminist-defense-boobquake"&gt;she thinks the event empowered women&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A patriarchal, profoundly misogynist man used his position of religious authority to demonize and control women, and to irrelevantly blame the ills of the world on our vile, dangerous sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women responded by saying, “Screw you. Our sexuality is not responsible for earthquakes — snicker — or any other horrible ills. Our sexuality is amazing, and we will claim it and flaunt it any damn way we choose. Our bodies, our right to decide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How, exactly, is that not feminist?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a terrific piece and it does a nice job of debunking a lot of the anti-Boobquake-Feminist claims.&lt;br&gt;

Now, you need to find an adoption agency to get started on your journey. It’s very important that you take the time to research in order to ensure that the agency will be able to meet your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Online&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Use the Internet to research online for available adoption agencies in your area. Rule out any that do not provide the type of adoption you seek. Some agencies do only domestic adoption, while others place internationally. Some domestic agencies just do infant adoption, while others place only older children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go to an Informational Meeting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Most adoption agencies offer once a month informational meetings. Attend one of these meetings, but be prepared to be asked a lot of questions – and be prepared to ask questions of your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Should You Ask?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You initial questions for your agency may include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many placements they make per month (or year)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the average wait time for placement?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do they prepare parents for adoption?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What type of services do they provide?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much does it cost to adopt?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also check out The Adoption Guide’s list of &lt;a href="http://theadoptionguide.com/process/articles/agency-questions"&gt;Questions to Ask Before Choosing an Adoption Agency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network and Reference Check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If possible, talk to other parents who have adopted through the agency you are considering. They will be able to give you first-hand information about the experience. Also talk to friends and associates who have adopted and get recommendations to their adoption agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Sign Anything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Before you sign any agreement with an adoption agency, be sure that you understand the fees and other details involved. Some agencies require payment in advance with no (or only partial) refund for a failed placement. This is a shady practice. Most legitimate agencies will only ask for part of the fees up front. Before you sign the contract, ask an attorney to &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/topic/look/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=look&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; it over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A foster parent provides a safe, temporary home for children. However, it’s more than just food and shelter – foster parents provide the love, support and nurturing that these children need. They work with the child’s social worker to make sure that the child is receiving all the treatment and care that they need.  Foster children are in crisis and most often in state care due to neglect, abuse or other endangerment. They may have special needs in terms of developmental, physical, emotional or behavioral problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal for a foster child may be reunification with their biological parents, after the parents receive services and prove they can provide a stable, loving home. Or on the other hand, the goal may be the termination of the parents’ rights and the eventual adoption of the child. The court decides whether a child should be reunified with the biological family or be placed with an adoptive home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the goal, the foster parent is there to provide a temporary home for the child, whether it’s for a day or for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foster parent requirements vary by state, but here are some general guidelines. Keep in mind, these stipulations may vary in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be at least 21 years old&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to pass a criminal background check&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be physically, emotionally and financially stable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have enough room in your home for the child (there’s normally a square footage requirement)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a home that meets safety and fire standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be willing to complete a pre-placement training program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States provide subsidies or per diem to foster parents for the care of foster children. The amount varies by state and is determined by the child’s age and any special needs. &lt;a href="http://www.adopting.org/adoptions/foster-care-specialists-by-state.html"&gt;Adoption.org&lt;/a&gt; offers a list of foster care specialists by state.

&lt;p&gt;Some pediatricians recommend teaching children to swim when they are 3-4 years old, while others will say that infants as young as 6 months can and should take swimming lessons. Babies generally love playing in water and don’t usually have a fear of swimming. They’ll close their mouths instinctively and do motions (though not proper swimming strokes) to propel themselves through the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many public pools, health clubs and swim schools offer swimming lessons for infants. These classes are a great bonding experience, as parents take their &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/babies/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=babies&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;babies&lt;/a&gt; into the water during the lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babies should wears a special &lt;a href="http://www.littleswimmers.com/na/products/swimpants.asp?WT.mc_id=HGG&amp;amp;WT.srch=1"&gt;swim diaper&lt;/a&gt; that won’t bloat up with water. And be sure to use plenty of sunscreen to protect your baby’s delicate skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children that are one-year-old or older can use water wings or floaties to help them stay above water. However, most of these floation devices are not designed for babies younger than one. A swimsuit with a built-in floation vest might be a better option for your baby. Whether your child uses water wings or anything else, they still need to be supervised at all times in and around the water. These devices do not prevent drowning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people will argue that children who are taught to swim at a young age are more likely to drown because their parents are overconfident in their swimming skills and don’t keep a close eye on them. However, according to a study by the &lt;a href="http://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/releases/030209-Drowning-Risk.cfm"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; last year, swimming lessons do not increase drowning risk in children ages 1-4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Swimming lessons are appropriate for consideration as part of a comprehensive drowning prevention strategy,” said Duane Alexander, M.D., director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the NIH Institute at which the study was conducted. “Because even the best swimmers can drown, swimming lessons are only one component of a comprehensive drowning prevention strategy that should include pool fencing, adult supervision, and training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.”&lt;/p&gt;

On seeing another in pain, a mouse will act as if it itself is also hurting—but only if it knows the first mouse. Monkeys, too, will feel bad for another monkey, but only if they&amp;#39;re on friendly terms. People, too, feeling less for those they dislike. But our species adds another layer of complication: We empathize more with people who are &amp;quot;like us&amp;quot; than with &amp;quot;them.&amp;quot;   This study, published this month, suggests that this Us-Them divide is more general—that the brain responds differently to any action performed by &amp;quot;one of us,&amp;quot; not just to signs of trouble.

The study is part of a boom in research around the idea that people literally share feelings, at the physiological level: When I see you in pain, for example, neurons fire in my brain just as they would if I myself were in pain.  It&amp;#39;s an intriguing notion, not least because it offers a way to integrate aspects of human behavior that are usually looked at separately.  Empathy is a social fact, arising out of people&amp;#39;s relationships to each other; and it&amp;#39;s a psychological experience for each of us; and it&amp;#39;s a physiological phenomena in each empathizer&amp;#39;s body. A model that connects those different levels would offer a more complete explanation. It would also, of course, offer ways to corroborate theories: It&amp;#39;s great to be able to ask people if they feel empathy, but it&amp;#39;s even better if you can measure it as well.

In a study published last year, for instance, Xiaojing Xu of Peking University and his colleagues used an MRI scanner to measure activity in the anterior cingulate cortex region of 33 college students as they watched films of other people getting poked in the cheek with either a Q-tip or a nasty sharp needle.  A neural circuit involving the ACC is active when you feel pain in your own body, and when you see others being hurt (and, like a disgruntled monkey&amp;#39;s, your circuit will respond less if you have a low opinion of the person being hurt, at least if you&amp;#39;re male).  In addition, Xu et al. found, their subjects&amp;#39; pain circuit responded much more when the injured party was of the same race.  Chinese reacted more to photos of Chinese injury, and whites to white.

The new paper, by Jennifer Gutsell and Michael Inzlicht of the University of Toronto, didn&amp;#39;t address empathy directly. They showed 30 white students a video of a college-age person drinking a glass of water, and then asked each volunteer to do the same. The students were hooked up to an electroencephalograph, which measured activity in the motor cortex area of their brains.  Unsurprisingly, the motor cortex was most active when each volunteer performed his or her own act.  It was also active, though, when each watched another white person drink.  But if the drinker was black, South Asian or East Asian, the motor area didn&amp;#39;t activate much at all.

Interestingly, all the students, as part of an intro psychology class, had completed something called the Symbolic Racism Scale, which is supposed to measure degrees of prejudice.  When the researchers compared scores on that test with the EEG measures, they found a correlation: The more prejudiced a student appeared on the Racism Scale, the less motor activity was recorded when s/he watched non-whites.

Gutsell and Inzlicht theorize that there is indeed an Us-Them empathy gap, but that it&amp;#39;s part of a more general phenomenon.  People, they write, &amp;quot;mentally simulate&amp;quot; each other all the time, not just in pain and grief.  But we only simulate people like us. We don&amp;#39;t, they believe, &amp;quot;mentally simulate the actions of outgroups.&amp;quot;

Does this mean racial preferences are somehow hardwired into the brain? Highly unlikely, for two reasons.  First, there&amp;#39;s that earlier research I mentioned, in which men empathized less with others if they believed those others had been unfair.  That suggests that empathy is shaped by experience—that we learn who to &amp;quot;mentally simulate&amp;quot; and who not to.

Secondly, race figured in these studies because the investigators chose it, not because it&amp;#39;s the only possible Us-Them division.  Race is convenient for these experiments because everyone can see it, and most everyone can name his place on a racial map. It&amp;#39;s not 100 percent reliable (two students Gutsall and Inzlicht considered &amp;quot;white&amp;quot; had to be dropped from their experiment because they self-identified as non-white) but it poses fewer pitfalls than religion, class, nationality or other groupings (an experiment based on religion, for instance, could raise questions about how the experimenters knew that students could tell Christians from Muslims).

In other words, race is used in &amp;quot;neuroscience of prejudice&amp;quot; experiments because it&amp;#39;s handy, not because it&amp;#39;s special.  The real news here is the big impact of Us-Them divides on feelings we often assume are universal.

Ask the typical cognitive neuroscientist on the street and you will probably be pointed to the left inferior parietal lobe.  But this is incorrect.  First, the idea that there is a dedicated &amp;quot;phonological store&amp;quot; is probably incorrect.  Second, the system that supports the temporary maintenance of phonological information isn&amp;#39;t in the parietal lobe, but in the superior temporal region, i.e., the same general region that supports phonological processing during speech recognition. These claims have been made on the basis of functional imaging data (e.g., Hickok et al., 2003; Buchsbaum &amp;amp; D&amp;#39;Esposito, 2008).  But now there&amp;#39;s lesion evidence to back it up.  Leff et al. (2009) studied a whopping 210 stroke patients, testing them on a range of speech tasks and their measure of auditory STM, digit span.  Not surprisingly, damage to pretty much the whole left perisylvian cortex correlated with digit span measures (figure below, top row of images). But when the authors factored out processes such as speech production (naming measure) single word speech repetition (auditory word and nonword repetition) and higher-level functions (verbal fluency measure), the remaining correlate of digit span was a relatively small sector of the STG/STS (figure below, bottom row of images). This region was further shown to correlate with auditory (but not visual) sentence comprehension; it did not correlate with auditory word comprehension.   What this shows is that the left STG/STS is critical for auditory STM.  What is less clear, though, is how this region relates to systems involved in phonological processing during normal speech recognition.  The issue centers on whether short term maintenance of phonological information is achieved by activating the same phonological processing networks that are involved in speech recognition or whether there is a separate &amp;quot;store&amp;quot;.  The fact that the left STG/STS region identified by Leff et al. did not correlate with auditory word comprehension seems to suggest a separate phonological store.  However, this isn&amp;#39;t necessarily the case.  For example, if phonological maintenance involves only a sub-portion of the phonological recognition network -- e.g., if the recognition system were bilateral as we&amp;#39;ve argued -- then maintenance and recognition may dissociate, so the non-correlation with auditory word comprehension is not surprising.  Why does left but not right STG/STS damage cause STM deficits?  Because STM is dependent on connections with the motor speech system, which is strongly left dominant. What seems more puzzling though for a common network model is the fact that the left STG/STS region correlated with digit span even when nonword repetition was factored out. That is, nonword repetition requires accurate phonemic perception of the stimulus and interface with the motor speech system, which should implicate left phonological processing systems. So how can damage to left STG/STS affect digit span but not nonword repetition?   One possibility is that the damage to left STG/STS represents partial damage to the phonological system within the left hemisphere, perhaps specifically involving phonological sub-networks that represent larger phonological chunks or sequences; or maybe it produces just enough damage to affect the more difficult processes while leaving the easier tasks spared.  Generally, this finding provides fairly compelling evidence that the left STG/STS plays a critical role in auditory/phonological STM.ReferencesBuchsbaum, B.R., and D&amp;#39;Esposito, M. (2008).

&lt;p&gt;Several days ago, Frank Chance sent me the following note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ny-image0.etsy.com/il_fullxfull.39328508.jpg"&gt;Lao Zi Quote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;Hmmm…this doesn&amp;#39;t seem to correspond with any part of the Laozi I know…not that it matters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labelling it "Lao Zi Apocrypha," I sent the card around to some friends and colleagues.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Under the heading "Identification of the Logion," Russell Kirkland replied as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;With my decades of experience reading (albeit detesting) what I call in print the "pseudo-translations of fatuous dilettantes" (or some such phrase), I can decipher the words in this Hallmark card (or whatever) as someone's Romanticized Americanized colonialization of lines from DDJ [VHM:  Daode jing / Tao Te Ching] chapter 67, which I translate, more accurately, thus:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I constantly have three treasures:&lt;br&gt;
Hold onto them and treasure them.&lt;br&gt;
The first is called "compassion" (&lt;em&gt;zi&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
The second is called "restraint."[1]&lt;br&gt;
The third is "not daring to be at the forefront of the world."&lt;br&gt;
Now being compassionate, one can be courageous.&lt;br&gt;
Being restrained, one can be expansive.&lt;br&gt;
Not daring to be at the forefront of the world, one can be the leader of the things that are com­pleted.[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[1] Apparently based on [VHM:  the early commentator] Wang Bi's comment, virtually all translators render &lt;em&gt;jian&lt;/em&gt; here as "frugali­ty," which makes little sense:  it is hard to think of other passages that commend any behav­ior in eco­nom­ic terms, or of a sensible explanation of such a commenda­tion.  According to Karlgren (Grammata Serica Recensa #613e), &lt;em&gt;jian&lt;/em&gt; carried the original mean­ing of "re­strict" or "restricted," and in this passage such a usage can be readily explained.  It seems intriguing that the term ap­pears nowhere else in the text.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;[&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;2] This passage is not in the Guodian materials [VHM:  earliest manuscript finds for this text].  For the final line, I follow the Mawangdui texts, which have a &lt;em&gt;wei&lt;/em&gt; before &lt;em&gt;cheng&lt;/em&gt;, indicating that &lt;em&gt;cheng&lt;/em&gt; is not a verb ("to become"), but rather a modifier of &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt;.  Most translators insist on reading a politi­cal reference into this line, for no good reason that I can surmise, save that traditional commenta­tors liked to find such references.  We must remember that such commentators were from a tradition that could not read early Zhou folk songs without interpreting them as advice for the ruler.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Russ&lt;br&gt;
PS:  The translation and analysis above is from my chapter, "Self-Fulfillment through Selflessness:  The Moral Teachings of the Daode jing," in Michael Barnhart, ed., Varieties of Ethical Reflection: New Directions for Ethics in a Global Context  (New York: Lexington Books [Rowman and Littlefield], 2002), 21-48.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a moment later, after I asked Russ whether I could share his comments with others, he added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I would be glad for you to do so.  Of course, there is nothing in the text that could even remotely be construed as meaning &amp;quot;loving others deeply&amp;quot; AND &amp;quot;being loved by others deeply&amp;quot;:  there&amp;#39;s only one term, so it can only mean one or the other–not both!  And there&amp;#39;s nothing that can be construed as a reference to &amp;quot;strength&amp;quot;–much less strength that results from others&amp;#39; feelings about us.  In other words, its the kind of nonsense that one finds in the old &amp;quot;Buddha&amp;#39;s Little Instruction Book&amp;quot; — self-indulgent American &amp;quot;Liberal&amp;quot; (e.g., Emersonian) touchy-feelyism, fraudulently marketed as teachings of a person from another land in the distant past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Hey, I don&amp;#39;t care if Ursula LeGuin wants to pass along to her readers her ideals for how they should live their lives and be happier.  It&amp;#39;s (still, for a little while, at least) a free country.  But for her to publish &amp;quot;a translation&amp;quot; of a work that is written in a language that she cannot read — in order to propagate her ideals and values, while giving the impression that those ideals and values are in fact those of &amp;quot;Lao Tzu&amp;quot; is, necessarily, a fraud — like the new &amp;quot;Second Book of Tao&amp;quot; by Stephen Mitchell — another dilettante who cannot read a word of Chinese, and in 1989 told the New York Times that he was qualified to &amp;quot;translate&amp;quot; the DDJ because he had taken Zen lessons!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, just yesterday on the train home to Swarthmore, as I was reading an extremely long article by Janet Malcolm entitled "Iphigenia in Forest Hills" in the New Yorker, another ersatz quotation from a Chinese sage caught my eye.  In section / chapter 19, p. 61a, in pronouncing his decision, a judge is quoted as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;Miss Borukhova, you set out on a journey of revenge because a judge had the temerity to give the custody of your daughter to your estranged husband.  Another quote, Confucius this time, said:  "A person who sets out on a path of revenge should first dig two graves."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right away, my pseudo-Orientalism-detection antennae started to twitch and tingle.  Curious to see where Judge Hanophy may have dug up his gem, I came upon this &lt;a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quotes/Confucius/"&gt;dubious collection of Confucius quotations.&lt;/a&gt; I dare say that most of these were just made up out of thin air — figments of somebody&amp;#39;s imagination.  They remind me of the only Confucius quotation I knew before I went to college, taught to me by my brother Dave when I was six years old:  &amp;quot;Confucius say [sic]:  &amp;#39;He who cooks carrots and peas in the same pot is unsanitary.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the heading "Pseudo-Confucius," I sent the "two graves" quotation around to several correspondents.  June Teufel Dreyer replied at once:  "I heard that very quote a couple of days ago, on a TV program about FBI profilers called Criminal Minds."  Woe is us!  It looks as though this one is going viral and will soon be infecting the public consciousness the same way "crisis = danger + opportunity" has for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an afterthought, June opined, "Actually, I must admit I rather liked the quote, whoever said it.  Perhaps the person responsible for creating the little strips of paper inserted into fortune cookies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, just before I posted this, Russ Kirkland weighed in again with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I'd bet that most of what 20th-century Anglophones learned as "Confucius say" were actually from Hollywood scriptwriters doing Charlie Chan movies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;But thanks for that page!  By typing "Lao" (sic) into the search box, I came to a page of "Lao-tzu sayings."  Some are real quotes, but others are like this:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Seek not happiness too greedily, and be not fearful of happiness.&lt;br&gt;
Lao-tzu (604 BC - 531 BC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Not only can I think of no lines in the text than can be read that way; but I cannot think of any context in which &amp;quot;Lao-tzu&amp;quot; — or any of his &amp;quot;brothers in Asian wisdom&amp;quot; — might have said &amp;quot;be not fearful of happiness&amp;quot;!!  First, only an American would have uttered such words!  Secondly, I cannot think of any Asian thinker who would even, conceivably, agree that &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s good to try to be &amp;#39;happy&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;  To seek an emotional state that gives pleasure to the person feeling it is not only absent from Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, and Hinduism (etc.), but they all denounce such foolishness, on the same terms.  Frankly, if Emerson tried to sit at the Round Table of the League of Extraordinary Asian Gentlemen (to mix my Hollywood metaphors ;-) ), they would laugh him out of the room….  Well, actually not:  none of them would laugh at anyone, in public.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past Monday, April 26th, marked the first &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/04/24/boobquake-breasts-that-rock-the-world/"&gt;Boobquake&lt;/a&gt; – which was a light-hearted attempt to poke some fun at an Islamic cleric’s utterly hateful &amp;amp; stupid comments about promiscuous women somehow causing… earthquakes.  Let’s see how it went…&lt;/p&gt;

Or maybe insane.  I'm not sure which, but his latest article at the Huffington Post reveals such a severe defect in rational thought that it must be one or the other (charitably speaking).  He calls it "Lies, Damn Lies (sic), and Medical Research," and the point of it is quite clear:  Ullman calls himself an "expert in homeopathic medicine" (which is akin to being a unicorn veterinarian) and since he has never been able to show that his particular health religion has any validity, he lashes out futilely at reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His entire argument boils down to a profound ignorance of medical science and a series of rhetorical/logical fallacies.   His first straw man is a typical argument of alternative medicine gurus: that modern medicine only treats symptoms and not their causes.  His first claim in this regard is that clinical studies define efficacy wrong because we consider symptom relief to be "efficacy".  This is simply wrong.  End points of studies depend on what is being studied.  If, for example, we wish to know if a pain medication works, then pain relief is a reasonable end point.  If we want to know if a particular drug prevents heart attacks, then heart attack is a reasonable end point.  Ullman is either intentionally raising a straw man, or simply too ignorant to understand the barest basics of medical science:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The bottom line to scientific research is that a scientist can set up a study that shows the guise of efficacy. In other words, a drug may be effective for a very limited period of time and then cause various serious symptoms. For example, a very popular anti-anxiety drug called Xanax was shown to reduce panic attacks during a two-month experiment, but when individuals reduce or stop the medication, panic attacks can increase 300-400 percent (Consumer Reports, 1993). Would many patients take this drug if they knew this fact, and based on what standard can anyone honestly say that this drug is "effective"? &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The "bottom line" is that anyone can create a crappy study, but that the method we use approach prevention and treatment of disease depends on data.  In the case of alprazolam (Xanax), this drug is not generally used for the long-term treatment of anxiety.  For example, the package insert for Xanax XR states that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;XANAX XR Tablets are indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia...The longer-term efficacy of XANAX XR has not been systematically evaluated. Thus, the physician who elects to use this drug for periods longer than 8 weeks should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, the &lt;i&gt;data&lt;/i&gt; don't give us much guidance beyond short term usage.  There is, of course, no guarantee that a doctor will use this data, but that's what education is for.  Drugs such as alprazolam can be life-savers.  Alleviating symptoms of an illness is one of the most important things we do and in the case of panic and anxiety disorders, symptoms are often all we have to work with.  We don't know enough about these protean disorders to separate out "cause" from "symptom".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His next burning heap of stupid regards his understanding (sic) of how medicine works.  He claims that drugs are inherently dangerous, and that doctors just don't get this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;These problems are evidence of the limitations of a model of medicine that over-emphasizes a biochemical, biomechanical pharmacological approach to healing that ultimately seeks to "attack" disease, "combat" illness, and wage "war on cancer" or on the human body itself (Ullman, 2009) This paradigm can be invaluable in emergency medicine and help us survive certain infectious diseases, but for the large majority of people facing day-to-day chronic illnesses, it provides short-term results, serious side-effects, and stratospherically high costs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which "day-to-day chronic illnesses" does he think are inherently not amenable to a "biochemical, biomechanical pharmalogical approach?"  Is there some other way to approach human biology besides, you know, human biology?  Where is all this expensive inefficacy?  &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-ullman/medical-research-lies-dam_b_555525.html"&gt;For example&lt;/a&gt;, our current medical regimens for coronary heart disease, including life-style modification, prevent hundreds of thousands of heart attacks and deaths every year, with safe medications that cost a few dollars per month.    Reality is indifferent to Ullman's lack of interest and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ullman goes on to defend homeopathy as a legitimate alternative to real medicine. Right after railing against clinical trials, he defends homeopathy's failure in clinical trials:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The deniers of homeopathy love to say that homeopaths "cherry-pick" the positive studies and ignore the negative ones. They then incredulously assert that we should ignore ALL of the positive trials. Such statements and viewpoints are profoundly misguided and simply daft. Will these same people say that Thomas Edison "cherry-picked" his positive study and ignored all of his "negative" studies in his efforts to invent electric lights? The (il)logic of the deniers is that they would recommend ignoring Edison's discovery because the vast majority of his studies were not positive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't even a clever use of the &lt;a href="http://rationalwiki.com/wiki/Galileo_fallacy"&gt;Galileo Gambit&lt;/a&gt;.  The fact is, when you turn on an intact and properly functioning light bulb, it illuminates.  Every. Single. Time.  The magic potions of homeopathy do not even come close to this sort of success.    Ullman's tenacious support of magic does not make him a brave maverick---it makes him a pitiable unicorn cowboy, riding his fantasy into a unsung oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/7kg2SgmDqHM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272658616356"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=33435">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/73e8e2bc4b48e474</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Freakonomics podcast"/><title type="html">Freakonomics Radio: Special Sauce for Schools?</title><published>2010-04-30T20:08:55Z</published><updated>2010-04-30T20:08:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/AnzTJyf0Fuk/" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/audio/freakonomics/Freak_105_PROMO_v4.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="4723982"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/30/freakonomics-radio-special-sauce-for-schools/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">A preview of our next episode.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/AnzTJyf0Fuk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By STEPHEN J.

OK, so we’re not exactly dying to scrub the tub, but it’s time for some &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/spring-cleaning-fling-my-chemical-free-romance/"&gt;Spring Cleaning&lt;/a&gt;, and our dust allergies will thank us.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s here, we can see it, just outside our office window, and this weekend we’re going to get our daily dose of &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/daily-health-quiz-how-much-sun-exposure-do-you-need-to-get-enough-vitamin-d/"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

We’ve been eating healthily all week, so we deserve a little low-impact indulgence (and we have &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/eat/blisstrees-baker-chick-brings-you-25-healthy-cookie-recipes/"&gt;25 healthy cookie recipes&lt;/a&gt; to choose from).&lt;/p&gt;

Local, farm-fresh produce? Yes, please. (Find out which farmers’ markets are open near you with &lt;a href="http://www.localharvest.org/"&gt;Local Harvest&lt;/a&gt;’s finder.)&lt;/p&gt;

Who says you can’t go to the park if you’re not into frisbee? We like to read outside. (And this weekend, we want to read about &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/read-it-like-a-man-new-orleans-its-jazz-fest-yall/"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

Hell, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/ai-can-i-quote-you-on-that/comment-page-2/#comment-101393"&gt;someone even nominated an entire thread&lt;/a&gt;, but that doesn’t count because other people said all those comments first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, I went with the one that made me laugh the hardest when I first read it. Congratulations to &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/quiz-deepak-2pac-or-six-pack/comment-page-1/#comment-101431"&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt;, who commented upon our surprisingly difficult quiz &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/quiz-deepak-2pac-or-six-pack"&gt;Deepak, Tupac or a Six Pack?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damn, I could’ve sworn “Who’s for pancakes?” was from Chopra’s “The Seven Spiritual Laws of Breakfast”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And BTW yes, because you all seemed to really enjoy that, we will have more quizzes in the very near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runners-up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/to-do/comment-page-1/#comment-101208"&gt;AJIrving&lt;/a&gt; tells us what was missing from the littlest scientist’s to-do list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s missing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Explain to idiotic grown-ups how magnets work’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/do-boobs-cause-earthquakes/comment-page-1/#comment-100908"&gt;Pete Schultz&lt;/a&gt;, whose comment was actually posted last week in response to Boobquake but it made me laugh this week so it goes in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But watch out! If the subjects go in the water and then shake them, the water will remember the boobies after the subjects have left. Given the vastness of the oceans, the essence of the boobies will be so diluted that the resulting solution will be far too powerful, and the end of the world will come before its due date of 12/21/12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend Mark Gray from &lt;a href="http://www.spacecraftfilms.com"&gt;SpaceCraftFilms&lt;/a&gt; narrates this film, showing the Apollo 11 Saturn V liftoff using a high-speed camera. I’ve seen this clip about eight bazillion times over the years, but Mark gives the details of what’s happening, providing insight I wasn’t aware of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cool thing about this, to me, is the fact that it’s so familiar, but there’s still so much to know about it! And it goes to show you: sending rockets into space &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, well, rocket science. &lt;/p&gt;

We women – and our partners and gynos – jam a lot of stuff up into our lady orifice. Some of these devices hurt (curse you, speculum!), others don’t (hello, vibrator!); many are liberating (contraception), others completely life-changing. (Can you imagine how your poor grandmother survived without tampons?) Here’s our top 10 list of weird shit we shove into our vaginas (well, penises aren’t really &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;, but you get our meaning), proving just how strong, tolerant, resilient, and awe-inspiring we women are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Speculum&lt;/strong&gt; – High time for a re-design; this thing’s fucking  uncomfortable. (photo: Thinkstock)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/200274593-001.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="200274593-001" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/200274593-001-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. IUD (Intrauterine Device)&lt;/strong&gt; – T-shaped? Copper? Crazy! (photo: WebMD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/h9991285_008.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="h9991285_008" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/h9991285_008-300x195.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="195"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Tampons&lt;/strong&gt; – Thank you for these, dear inventor,&lt;span&gt; Dr. Earle Haas&lt;/span&gt;. (photo: Thinkstock)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. The Diaphragm&lt;/strong&gt; – For some reason it reminds us of Bonnie   Franklin on &lt;em&gt;One Day at a Time&lt;/em&gt;. (photo: Planned   Parenthood)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Female condoms&lt;/strong&gt; – Nice idea, but does anyone actually use them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/mnyC_v0-DQ4%26ap%3D%252526fmt%253D18&amp;amp;width=590&amp;amp;height=442" width="590" height="442"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Vaginal Spermicidal Suppositories, Sponges, Creams, Foams, Gels, and VCF (Vaginal Contraceptive Film)&lt;/strong&gt; – Better safe than sorry. (photo: Planned Parenthood)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Vibrators&lt;/strong&gt; – Women are always buzzing about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Two planes clash over France, 1944. One is victorious, and a defeated German fighter smashes into the field below. 50 years later, the pilot is still listed as "Missing In Action," and the field shows no sign of the conflict above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or does it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.aircrewremembrancesociety.com/BlochbergerArch.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, investigator Laurent d&amp;#39; Hondt used dowsing rods to find the plane. The field must have been giving off waves or rays or something that made the aluminum rods twitch. How would it have ever been found without this strange force? Let&amp;#39;s take a closer look and I suspect we&amp;#39;ll have an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll note that the article credits the dowsing for actually finding the plane. What other clues to the plane's location were there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurent had already established the field where the aircraft crashed, thanks to the help and co-operation of the landowner M. Leon Racine, and then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with only his two small aluminium divining rods, Laurent and his eyewitness discovered the approximate area where the aircraft came down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear who this eyewitness is. Is it the original eyewitness who told Laurent the story of the planes fighting overhead, or is it the field's owner? At any rate, the field owner knew there was a plane in the field. How could he know this unless he'd seen evidence of it himself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been a farmer, and managed a field of four acres in the foothills of Salt Lake City for a few years. After many cycles of plowing, discing and tilling, I understood the field intimately. I knew there was a line of gravel that cut the plot diagonally, that there was a soft spot in the southeast corner, and that metallic debris, mortars, and bullets lurked in the northern section (it used to be a firing range for the nearby Fort Douglas.) If a fighter plane had crashed in the field at a high rate of speed, I think I&amp;#39;d probably be able to give you an idea where to look for it. I imagine that, after the war was over, the field was returned to service and the damage caused to the field was filled with topsoil. That alone would make a difference in the topography of the field, even 50 years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note the words "approximate area" in the quote above. on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Approximate" can mean a wide range of distances, but it doesn't mean "exact," This leading me to believe that the dowser indicated a spot, and the metal detectors found the plane reasonably near that spot, but not exactly on it. Why not? If dowsing actually worked, how could it not be exactly on the plane? Imagine a metal detector indicating an "approximate" spot. We'd have to explain why the magnetic field was stronger in an area that wasn't actually where the metal was. If dowsing was detecting something, wouldn't it work the same way? And in fact, they did use a metal detector to "confirm" the findings of the dowsing rods. It seems even they didn't trust the rods, otherwise why bring in a back up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article isn&amp;#39;t detailed enough for us to know exactly what happened, but I believe this is yet another case of confirmation bias. Dowsing rods were used, something was found, therefore dowsing rods get the credit. Humans have evolved to have biases, and while those may have served us well in the Veldt, they often trip us up in modern life. Fortunately, we&amp;#39;re a tool-making species, and we can use those tools to improve on our naturally evolved state so long as we care to do so. Double-blinded testing is the best tool we have for overcoming our natural bias towards confirmation, and it has shown repeatedly that dowsing does not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem silly to poke holes in an otherwise interesting story, but that one mention of dowsing gives credence to the thought of "magic powers." None are needed to explain what happened here. Dedicated men used logic, evidence and modern technology to make an interesting discovery. I'd rather give them the credit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272648522525"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/catholic_priorities.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8978053b3f561ba9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Equality"/><title type="html">Catholic priorities</title><published>2010-04-30T17:29:21Z</published><updated>2010-04-30T17:29:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/YKQsaWYWxUg/catholic_priorities.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/catholic_priorities.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;John C. Nienstedt is the Archbishop of the &lt;a href="http://www.archspm.org/"&gt;Diocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;, which makes him the ranking Catholic god-botherer in the region, I guess. We&amp;#39;re supposed to call him &amp;quot;Most Reverend&amp;quot; — priests are really good at attaching laudatory titles to themselves — but I won&amp;#39;t be doing that, ever. &amp;quot;Most Intolerant,&amp;quot; maybe, or &amp;quot;Most Boneheaded&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href="http://www.startribune.com/opinion/commentary/92264669.html"&gt;he has an op-ed in the Star Tribune&lt;/a&gt;. The Catholic Church is facing some rough times right now, with declining attendance, a dearth of priests, and a scary percentage of the people willing to become priests being clearly socially and sexually dysfunctional, so you'd expect him to write something about the real problems the Catholics are grappling with right now, doing something to bolster the flagging reputation of the priesthood. And I guess he thought he did: he wrote about &lt;i&gt;gay marriage&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those gays, getting married—it just wrecks my thrillingly heterosexual marriage to think that two men or two women might be having fun out there, together. And now it&amp;#39;s wrecking the church, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, Nienstedt just makes the same boring and false arguments against gay marriage that they always do. This is probably more a matter of distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-left:32px"&gt;Citizen: "Hey, there's a priest raping a child, stop him!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-left:32px"&gt;Priest: "No, look over there: there are two adults trying to engage in  consensual sexual activities in the context of shared legal and social obligations! Stop them, quick, before they get insurance! It's an &lt;i&gt;EMERGENCY!!!&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And really, Nienstedt makes some pathetic arguments. He's promoting a Minnesota marriage amendment that would dictate that the only &lt;i&gt;true&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;valid&lt;/i&gt; long-term relationships to be recognized by the state involve strictly one (1) man and one (1) woman. Look at what he claims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We might learn caution from experience. Back in the early 1970s, the experts told us that no-fault divorce would liberate women from bad marriages without affecting anyone else. We now know that as many as one-third of women fall into poverty with their children as a result of divorce. Social science caught up late with the common-sense wisdom that children need a mom and a dad working together to protect them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…says &lt;i&gt;Father&lt;/i&gt; Nienstedt, high-ranking member of a blatantly patriarchal hierarchy. Why do women fall into poverty after a divorce? Because they are discriminated against in the workplace, because they get the bulk of the financial obligation in caring for any children, and because many men (and, I suspect, especially the men women want to divorce) fail to meet their responsibilities in contributing to child care. The problem isn't divorce, the problem is a patriarchal culture, which the church does nothing to reverse and actually promotes, and the male privilege that allows fathers to escape with diminished responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divorce is a good and reasonable solution to marital unhappiness, unless, of course, you're part of a culture that wants to keep women dependent on a mate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, maybe one tack we should take in promoting gay marriage is to instead play up gay &lt;i&gt;divorce&lt;/i&gt;: we have to give gay men and lesbians the ability to break their bonds with their partners. &lt;span style="font-size:12px"&gt;Oh, and by the way, we'll have to let them get married first before they can divorce.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, human beings in virtually every society have recognized that, to make a marriage, one needs a man and a woman. What is more, it has long been acknowledged that marriage is not just about the happiness of adults but concerns the well-being of society -- that is, the common good. Marriage exists in civil law primarily in order to provide communal support for bringing mothers and fathers together to care for their children. Same-sex unions cannot serve this public purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget the ignorant ahistorical argument in the first part — &lt;a href="http://www.colorq.org/articles/article.aspx?d=2004&amp;amp;x=ssmarriage"&gt;gay marriage hasn't been that unusual&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;#39;s particularly surprising that a Christian priest would fail to have noticed the frequency of polygamy in the Old Testament — and let&amp;#39;s consider his &amp;quot;common good&amp;quot; argument. I would actually concede that one essential function of a stable human society is that it provide a mechanism to care for our offspring, with their ridiculously long period of dependency. Marriage is one method for accomplishing that, by pairing two people together to share the burden of child-rearing. &lt;i&gt;One&lt;/i&gt; method…so does this priest support the idea of communes? That&amp;#39;s even more efficient, and I can tell you that just two people, separated from other family support by the demands of their jobs, really have to struggle to keep their sanity. This is hard work, not that a celibate bureaucrat would know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think that if you look back over history, most cultures have seen it as the responsibility of a whole tribe to help raise children, not just two people.  This convention of assigning all responsibility to just two and only two, who are necessarily in a heterosexual relationship, is new and &lt;i&gt;weird&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think also that if you actually look at civil law, most of the reasons for getting married are economic. Children are just one aspect of that law. If marriage just exists in the law to promote children, then what about all those marriages that are childless? Are they invalid? Maybe it's not obvious to a priest, but people do like to be together for reasons other than procreation. I'm done with having children, my youngest daughter graduates from college in two weeks, and no, my marriage will not be dissolving at that moment. Or ten years from that moment. It won't be over until I drop dead. And you know what? I like it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the claim that &amp;quot;same-sex unions cannot serve this public purpose&amp;quot;: why not? Lesbians have it easy, artificial insemination can get them pregnant; gay men don&amp;#39;t have that option yet (give the biologists a few more years, though…), but even so, adoption is possible, and sometimes, gay men even have children by previous relationships. Two men, two women, a man and a woman, a cooperative commune of many men and women…they can all serve that public purpose. Oh, and in all those cases, who is having sex with whom is pretty much irrelevant to the children, since these typically are not Catholic Sunday schools, so the children won&amp;#39;t be participating in the sex. This argument is a complete non-starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you believe Nienstedt's argument gets even worse?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What will happen to children growing up in a world where the law teaches them that moms and dads are interchangeable and therefore unnecessary, and that marriage has nothing intrinsically to do with the bearing and raising of children? Do we really want first-graders to be taught that gay marriage is OK, or that the influence of a mother and a father on the development of a child somehow doesn't matter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a world where moms and dads are interchangeable in their roles and responsibilities in child-raising would be a fine place to live. Aside from nursing (and again, biologists will fix that someday, too), men and women can change diapers, attend PTA meetings, play ball, give hugs, cook, and read bedtime stories equally well, with individual variation. Interchangeability does not imply that they are unnecessary. I grew up with a mom and dad who could &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; read to me; that did not imply to my mind that they were therefore both superfluous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already know that marriage is not intrinsically about having kids. People have them without getting married, married people stay married without having them. Children grow up just fine with that simple fact; I know I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And dear sweet jebus yes, I want first-graders to be taught that gay marriage is OK! Teach them that gay people are fine and normal and ordinary, that old limiting stereotypes are hateful and foolish, and that only beastly decrepit bigots sit around whining that someone else might be finding happiness in life.  Let's steer young kids away from the hypocritical joylessness so well represented in Catholicism at an early age!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, that last line…it&amp;#39;s a lie. No one is planning to teach that parents don&amp;#39;t matter, since they do — parents matter profoundly. I do think, though, that we can&amp;#39;t let repressed celibate jerks dictate who can be parents, and deprive people who might want to be parents of the privilege simply because a priest does not approve of their love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/catholic_priorities.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/YKQsaWYWxUg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272647931376"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=3244">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fa4cb6ec2bb264c3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogroll"/><category term="Challenges to Science"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Podcasting"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Technology"/><category term="skeptic zone"/><category term="Anti-Vaccination Network"/><category term="Australia"/><category term="Dave the Happy Singer"/><category term="Facebook"/><category term="Meryl Dorey"/><category term="Stop The Australian Vaccination Network"/><category term="Stop The Australian Vaccination Network EXPOSED"/><category term="vaccination"/><title type="html">FailyFailyFaily: Anti-Vaccination Network Fails To Know Who Meryl Dorey Is</title><published>2010-04-30T11:36:44Z</published><updated>2010-04-30T11:36:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/PGEBtbcZMAg/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/2010/04/failyfailyfaily-anti-vaccination-network-fails-to-know-who-meryl-dorey-is/"/><content xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry, but if you know of the Skeptic Zone podcast?

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, reader &lt;strong&gt;Amy&lt;/strong&gt; “won” one of the vests.  She does appreciate the gesture, but she thinks she can do something even better with the gift:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;amp;item=250623975794&amp;amp;ru=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.ebay.com%3A80%2F%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp3907.m570.l1313%26_nkw%3D250623975794%26_sacat%3DSee-All-Categories%26_fvi%3D1&amp;amp;_rdc=1"&gt;Auction it off an eBay&lt;/a&gt; and give most of the proceeds to &lt;a href="http://foundationbeyondbelief.org/"&gt;Foundation Beyond Belief&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;amp;item=250623975794&amp;amp;ru=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.ebay.com%3A80%2F%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp3907.m570.l1313%26_nkw%3D250623975794%26_sacat%3DSee-All-Categories%26_fvi%3D1&amp;amp;_rdc=1"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/ComfortVest.png" alt="" title="ComfortVest" width="373" height="496"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For your bidding pleasure… a brand-spankin’-new, genuine cowhide vest, handmade and signed by, that paragon of Christian thought, Ray Comfort at Living Waters Ministries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vest would fit women sizes 6/8. (I’m guessing here.  This is what I wear and it fits me.)  It has a super-soft outside, two pockets and four shiny, new snaps.  It smells great, actually (if you like cow-hide, and I do), and though it’s a bit crispy, would soften up with some wear.  Plus, did I mention, Ray Comfort signed it?! (on the inside)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, there’s more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;75% of the winning bid will go to the FOUNDATION BEYOND BELIEF! (www.foundationbeyondbelief.org)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They aren’t quite the fashion statement I would make… but others seem to *really* like Ray’s vests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And just how fine is this garment, you ask?  Another auction is offering a Ray Comfort-made vest right now, and it’s currently going for 1,007.00 — all of this to support Living Waters Ministry (omfsm!)  Can we wretched non-believers raise a similar amount for works that will make an actual positive difference in the world?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a wonderful, generous idea and I hope Amy’s new vest sells for a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in bidding, &lt;a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;amp;item=250623975794&amp;amp;ru=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.ebay.com%3A80%2F%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp3907.m570.l1313%26_nkw%3D250623975794%26_sacat%3DSee-All-Categories%26_fvi%3D1&amp;amp;_rdc=1"&gt;the auction can be found here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today’s Question:&lt;/strong&gt; ‘Tis the season for sun hats, Coppertone, and sun umbrellas. But in limited doses, we actually need to get a little sun; it’s a primary source of Vitamin D. Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption, it aids bone growth, and it helps support the immune system. You can get it in certain foods and supplements, but most people get it naturally through sun exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves an excuse to get out and play in the sun, but do you know how much shine time you really need to get sufficient vitamin D? Take our poll:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the stunning images and animations coming from the Cassini probe, it’s easy to forget that some pretty cool stuff can be seen from Earth, too. Amateur astronomer Emil Kraaikamp sent me &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzYQ92dqfW0"&gt;this animation&lt;/a&gt; he made of Saturn taken with his 25 cm (10″) telescope in The Netherlands. Keep your eyes on the upper half of Saturn, above the rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/xzYQ92dqfW0%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0xe1600f%26color2%3D0xfebd01%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
See the white spot? That’s actually a huge storm… and by &amp;quot;huge&amp;quot;, I mean &lt;em&gt;about the same size as the Earth!&lt;/em&gt; I usually think of Jupiter as the stormy planet, but &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/15/epic-lightning-storm-electrocuting-saturn-for-eight-months/"&gt;Saturn has its share as well&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of the time, these storms are discovered here on Earth by amateur astronomers, who spend more time looking at planets globally, as opposed to professional astronomers who aren’t always observing every planet all the time. Last year, a &amp;quot;storm&amp;quot; seen on Jupiter by an amateur &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/23/jupiter-bringing-the-hammer-down/"&gt;turned out to be the impact cloud&lt;/a&gt; from a collision by an asteroid or comet! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s one of the images Emil used in his animation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/saturn_EmilKraaikamp.jpg" alt="saturn_EmilKraaikamp" title="saturn_EmilKraaikamp" width="480" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see two moons, the rings (and the dark Cassini Division, a gap in the rings), banding on the planet itself, and of course the storm. Note that when he took these shots, Saturn was 1.3 billion km (almost 800 million miles) away! Astronomy is one of the very few sciences where amateurs — and by that, I mean people who aren’t paid to do it as a career — still  make an incredibly important, and even critical contribution. With observations like Emil’s, you can see why. &lt;/p&gt;

Also on the list of authors is Nancy Kanwisher, one of the feared fMRI  voodoo correlations posse.The paper describes a technique for mapping out the &amp;quot;language areas&amp;quot; of the brain in individual people, not for their own sake, but as a way of improving other fMRI studies of language. That&amp;#39;s  important because while everyone&amp;#39;s brain is organized roughly the same way, there are always  individual differences in the shape, size and location of the different regions.This is a problem for fMRI researchers. Suppose you scan 10 people and show them pictures of apples and pictures of pears. And suppose that apples activate the brain&amp;#39;s Fruit Cortex much more strongly than pears. But unfortunately, the Fruit Cortex is a small area, and its location varies between people. In fact, in your 10 subjects, no-one&amp;#39;s Fruit Cortex overlaps with anyone else&amp;#39;s, even though everyone has one and they all work exactly the same way.If you did this experiment you&amp;#39;d fail to find the effect of apples vs. pears, even though it&amp;#39;s a strong effect, because there will be no one place in the brain where apples reliably cause more activation. What you need is a way of finding the Fruit Cortex in each person beforehand. What you&amp;#39;d need to do is a functional localization scan - say, showing people a big bowl of fruit - as a preliminary step.Fedorenko et al scanned a bunch of people while doing a simple reading task, and compared that to a control condition, reading a random list of nonsense which makes no linguistic sense. As you can, see there&amp;#39;s a lot of variation between people, but there&amp;#39;s also clearly a basic pattern of activation: it looks a bit like a tilted &amp;quot;V&amp;quot; on the left side of the brain:These are the language areas of each person. (Incidentally, this is why fMRI, despite its limitations, is an amazing technology. There is no better way of measuring this activation. EEG is cheaper but nowhere near as good at localizing activity; PET is close, but it&amp;#39;s slow, expensive and involves injecting people with radioactivity.)Fedorenko et al then overlapped all the individual images to produce of map of the brain showing how many people got activation in each part:The most robust activations were on the left side of the brain, and they formed a nice &amp;quot;V&amp;quot; shape again. These are the areas which have long been known to be involved in language, so this is not surprising in itself.Here&amp;#39;s the clever bit: they then took the areas activated in a large % of people, and automatically divided them up into sub-regions; each of the &amp;quot;peaks&amp;quot; where an especially large proportion of subjects showed activation became a separate region.This is on the assumption that these peaks represent parts of the brain with distinct functions - separate &amp;quot;language modules&amp;quot; as it were. But each module will be in a slightly different place in each person (see the first picture). So they overlapped the subdivisions with the individual activation blobs to get a set of individual functional zones they call Group-constrained Subject-Specific functional Regions of Interest, or GcSSfROIs to their friends.Fedorenko et al claim various advantages to this technique, and present data showing that it produces nice results in independent subjects (i.e. not the ones they used to make the group map in the first place.)In particular, they argue that it should allow future fMRI studies to have a better chance of finding the specific functions of each region. So far, experiments using fMRI to investigate language have largely failed to find activations specific to particular aspects of language like grammar, word meaning, etc. which is unexpected because patients suffering lesions to specific areas often do show very selective language problems.Does this relate to the voodoo correlations issue? Indirectly, yes. The voodoo (non-independence error) problem arises when you do a large number of comparisons, and then focus on the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; results, because these are likely to be wholly, or partially, only that good by chance.Fedorenko et al&amp;#39;s method allows you to avoid doing lots of comparisons in the first place. Instead of looking all over the whole brain for something interesting, you can first do a preliminary scan to map out where in each person&amp;#39;s brain interesting stuff is likely to happen, and then focus on those bits in the real experiment.There&amp;#39;s still a multiple-comparisons problem: Fedorenko et al identified 16 candidate language areas per brain, and future studies could well provide more. But that&amp;#39;s nothing compared to the 40,000 voxels in a typical whole-brain analysis. We&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see if this technique proves useful in the real world, but it&amp;#39;s an interesting idea...Fedorenko, E., Hsieh, P., Nieto Castanon, A., Whitfield-Gabrieli, S., &amp;amp; Kanwisher, N.

It’s nice, everyone is friendly, but you don’t really get anything out of it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brendan Woods&lt;/strong&gt;, a student at Dartmouth, &lt;a href="http://thedartmouth.com/2010/04/28/opinion/woods"&gt;isn’t a fan of that approach&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’ve noticed the same phenomenon at the various “interfaith” discussion forums and dinners I’ve attended here. While the conversation starts down an interesting path, it soon devolves into the same platitudes and uninteresting discussion that we have heard time and again. &lt;strong&gt;At best, the participants leave with knowledge that they could have learned from 15 minutes on a few Wikipedia pages.&lt;/strong&gt; In the words of C.S. Lewis, religious conversations progress “so rightly, charitably, spiritually, sensitively, so anything but usefully.” As a result, talking about religion — a topic which should incite excitement and passion — is boring.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brendan’s a Catholic, but he’s in support of the newly formed “Atheists, Humanists and Agnostics” group at the college.  He’s also a fan of their &lt;a href="http://thedartmouth.com/2010/04/28/opinion/woods"&gt;new approach to interfaith discussions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Apologia [a Christian journal] and AHA are already planning on holding a sort of written debate, in which each group will write papers and then respond to the other’s points. The results will be published in a special edition of the Apologia.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very cool.  I can’t wait to see how that plays out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s one side issue to point out: The AHA (founded by student &lt;strong&gt;CiCi Liu&lt;/strong&gt;) was having trouble getting official recognition from the school:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Due to some administrative confusion at Tucker over whether they constitute a “religious” group or not, the organization cannot receive a Blitzmail account or any of the other benefits College-recognized clubs receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how Tucker should classify AHA. I do know, however, that honest religious discussion is sorely needed on campus. If there is a group that offers to contribute to positive and productive dialogue, I think Dartmouth should be all for it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth, I spoke with CiCi via email and she tells me their group should be getting recognition soon — it’s just a matter of some relatively quick paperwork now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s wonderful seeing secular students taking charge on campus and leading the way to facilitate these types of interfaith discussions.  It’s amazing how many people manage to avoid conversations which are critical of their beliefs during their college years and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brendan is right — AHA is sorely needed.  The faster they get recognized, the more they’ll be able to get done, even as this school year comes to a close.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://s.ngeo.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/196/cache/noahs-ark-mount-mt-ararat_19640_600x450.jpg" alt="noahs ark mt ararat"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, some deeper investigation past the headline shows  that this story is likely just another exaggerated claim, because – &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/livescience/20100428/sc_livescience/noahsarkrerediscovered"&gt;as  skeptic Ben Radford points out&lt;/a&gt; – we’ve been here before… numerous  times.  Yes, apparently, the mythical Noah’s Ark has been discovered  (and re-discovered) a number of times “with definitive proof” that it is  authentic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/livescience/20100428/sc_livescience/noahsarkrerediscovered"&gt;Noah’s  Ark Re-Rediscovered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chinese Christian filmmaker claims to have found the  final resting place of Noah’s  Ark on Turkey’s Mount Ararat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeung Wing-Cheung says he and a team from Noah’s Ark Ministries found  the remains of the Ark at an elevation of about  12,000 feet (3,658  meters). They filmed inside the structure and took wood samples that   were later analyzed in Iran. He claims the wood was carbon-dated to  around the  reputed time of Noah’s flood, which would be remarkable  since organic material  should have long since disintegrated in the last  5,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeung said that he is “99 percent certain that it is Noah’s Ark based  on historical accounts, including &lt;a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/livescience/sc_livescience/storytext/noahsarkrerediscovered/35971638/SIG=125ipc4uf/*http://www.livescience.com/history/earliest-hebrew-text-100115.html"&gt;the  Bible&lt;/a&gt; and local beliefs of the people in the area, as well as   carbon dating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While news of the find is making headlines around the world, there’s  one part of the story that Yeung is conspicuously silent about:  He is  only the latest in a long line of people who claim to have found Noah’s   Ark. In fact, there have been at least half a dozen others – all of  them funded  by Christian organizations – who have claimed final,  definitive proof of Noah’s Ark. So far none of the claims have proven  true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah’s Ark is routinely re-discovered, because there are many who  fervently want it to be found. Biblical literalists – those who believe  that proof of the Bible’s events remains to be found – have  spent their  lives and fortunes trying to &lt;a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/livescience/sc_livescience/storytext/noahsarkrerediscovered/35971638/SIG=123d7mc4n/*http://www.livescience.com/history/top10_intelligent_designs.html"&gt;scientifically  validate their religious beliefs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why the new claims should be treated with  skepticism. For example, Yeung refuses to disclose the  location of the  find and is instead keeping it a secret. This of course is  inherently  unscientific; for the claims to be proven, the evidence must be   presented to other scientists for peer-review. Nor has the alleged  5,000-year-old  wood been made available for independent testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… There is a long and rich history of Ark finds. Nearly 40 years  ago, Violet M. Cummings, author of “Noah’s Ark: Fable or Fact?”  (Creation-Science Research Center, 1973) claimed – without evidence –  that Noah’s Ark had been found on Mount Ararat. According to the 1976  book and film “In Search of Noah’s Ark,” (Scholastic Book Services)  “there is now actual photographic evidence that Noah’s Ark really does  exist…. Scientists have used satellites, computers, and powerful  cameras to pinpoint the Ark’s exact location on Mt. Ararat.” Yet again,  no real evidence was offered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In another ironic twist, it’s worth noting that one of the dating  methods employed by Yeung is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating"&gt;radiocarbon dating&lt;/a&gt;, which is a widely  accepted and well-proven dating method in the scientific community but  which is viewed with distrust by fundamentalist Christians because of  the &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Pseudoscience"&gt;pseudoscientific&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; dogmatic &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Young-Earth_Arguments"&gt;Young-Earth Creationist&lt;/a&gt; view that  the Earth is only 6000 years old.  This &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/04/100428-noahs-ark-found-in-turkey-science-religion-culture/"&gt;National  Geographic article has a good take down on this point…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skepticism of the new Noah’s ark claim  extends to at least one  scholar who interprets the Bible literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biologist  &lt;a href="http://www.bryancore.org/wood.html"&gt;Todd  Wood&lt;/a&gt; is director  of the Center for Origins Research at Bryan  College in Tennessee,  which pursues biology in a creationist framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a  creationist, Wood believes God created Earth and  its various life-forms  out of nothing roughly 6,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you accept a young  chronology for the Earth … then  radiocarbon dating has to be  reinterpreted,” because the method often  yields dates much older than  6,000 years, Wood said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiocarbon dating estimates the ages of  organic objects  by measuring the radioisotope carbon 14, which is known  to decay at a  set rate over time. The method is generally thought to  reach its limit  with objects about 60,000 years old. Earth is generally  thought to be  about four and a half billion years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across  the board, radiocarbon dates need to be  recalibrated, Wood believes, to  reflect shorter time frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this perceived overestimation  in radiocarbon dating, the wood  the Noah’s Ark Ministries International  team found should have a  “traditional” radiocarbon date of several  tens of thousands of years if  the wood is truly 4,800 years old, Wood  said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m really, really skeptical that this could possibly  be  Noah’s Ark,” he added. The wood date is “way, way, way too young.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not  only that, but there are many other problems with these most recent  claims that Yeung and his colleagues have discovered the “real” Noah’s  Ark…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason scholars are skeptical of the  latest  Noah’s ark discovery claim is that Genesis—the first book of the   Bible—never specifies which peak the vessel supposedly landed on in   Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The whole notion is odd, because the Bible tells you  the  ark landed somewhere in Urartu,”—an ancient kingdom in eastern   Turkey—”but it’s only later that people identified Mount Ararat with   Urartu,” said &lt;a href="http://people.vanderbilt.edu/%7Ejack.m.sasson/"&gt;Jack  Sasson&lt;/a&gt;,  a professor of Jewish and biblical studies at Vanderbilt  University in  Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stony Brook’s Zimansky agreed. “Nobody associated that  mountain with  the ark” until the tenth century B.C., he said, adding  that there’s no  geologic evidence for a mass flood in Turkey around  4,000 years ago.  (See &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090206-smaller-noah-flood.html"&gt;“‘Noah’s   Flood’ Not Rooted in Reality, After All?”&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Noah’s Ark  Ministries International explorers are  “playing in a very different  ballpark than the rest of us,” Zimansky  said. “They’re playing without  any concern for” the archaeological,  historical, and geological  records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are we to make of all this Ark  fuss?  Given the supposed “evidence” (actually, the lack thereof) I have  two words which sum it up nicely: &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/wishfulthinking.html"&gt;wishful thinking.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I will be delivering this little Skepchickadee on May 26. That day cannot come soon enough right now. See, Delaney (that’s her name) is breech. My OB says it’s pretty unlikely that she’s going to flip at this point. As far as delivery is concerned, this doesn’t really matter much because I was scheduled for a c-section anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what I didn’t realize is how really fucking painful it is to have a breech baby as a pregnancy approaches full-term. Normally, at 35 weeks, your baby is pretty well lodged, head down, into your pelvis. This gives them little opportunity to move around. They kick and squirm and you get a foot in the rib here or there. Mostly it’s annoying. Sometimes it’s sweet. But most off all, it’s super entertaining to poke them in the butt and feel them getting all pissy at you. When I was pregnant with my son, I would waste entire afternoons poking at him, shining flashlights in his face and blasting annoying music into my belly to make him move. I know &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/02/what-pregnant-women-wont-tell-you-ever/"&gt;my last post on pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; made it sound really awful, but seriously, it’s so worth it to get pregnant just to get to do that stuff. (It’s payback for all the other stuff.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when they don’t get their heads restrained, they become free range fetuses.&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/presentations/100193_2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/images/ency/fullsize/19157.jpg" alt="Breech presentation" width="240" height="192"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; So, like right now, I have one foot in my right hip, one foot feeling like its trying to kick my asshole out of place, a hand grabbing onto my ribs, and another hand occasionally using my stomach (not like various parts of the inside of my belly, but like the actual organ) as a squeezy stress ball. Meanwhile her head is moving around in ways that would scare the shit out of anyone who thought the Exorcist head-spinning scene was anatomically plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the majority of the day trying not to vomit and trying not to scream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m half tempted to go trolling the west side of Aurora to see if I can score a bag of &lt;a href="http://pregnancy.about.com/od/induction/f/pitocin.htm"&gt;pit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But given the unlikelihood that I’ll find a nice “street vendor” selling synthetic labor induction hormones, I’ve chosen to stay home and take a look at information about breech babies. What I’ve been looking for is information on the odds of this little ass-kicker flipping. Most of what I read says, “It can totally happen!” without any statistics or information beyond that. Occasionally I’ll read an anecdote from a doula who watched a baby flip during labor, but I tend to believe that when someone says they saw something happen once during their entire professional career, as inspiring as that anecdote was supposed to be, it gives me little hope of my ribs being used for something other than monkey bars for the next 3 weeks and 5 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.birthinternational.com/articles/andrea13.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mostly I’ve found sites offering various options for attempting to get your fetus to get in place. I imagine that anything aside from an actual &lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/baby/external-cephalic-version-version-for-breech-position"&gt;external version&lt;/a&gt; (that’s where your doctor manually turns your baby from the outside… which sounds like it’s probably the most painful thing any human can ever experience) there’s not much you can do. But most of it is harmless advice, probably worth it to ease discomfort for a while, like getting down on your knees and forearms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.birthinternational.com/articles/andrea13.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.birthinternational.com/articles/images/breech_2.gif" alt="" width="297" height="180"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The thought is that you should try to position yourself in ways that will help prevent your baby from engaging into your pelvis. Once engaged, they can’t reposition. Will it flip your baby? Probably not, I’m guessing. Does it feel fantastic to stretch your hips and have your belly facing down for a while? Oh hell yeah! I recommend this even if your baby isn’t breech… right now I think this pose is so wonderful, I can’t figure out why anyone wouldn’t become Muslim just to have an excuse to do this pose 5 times a day pregnant or not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the page where I found the drawing above, I also found &lt;a href="http://www.birthinternational.com/articles/andrea13.html"&gt;the most disturbing suggestion I’ve found yet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using moxibustion to encourage the baby to turn by itself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very successful “do it yourself” technique with a proven high success rate is to use locally applied heat treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heat from burning moxa sticks can also be used to stimulate the baby’s movements and encourage it to turn. These sticks, shaped like cigars, are available from herbalists, Chinese medicine stockists and some acupuncturists (who use moxa sticks for other purposes) and they contain tightly rolled dried leaves of the mugwort plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok… herbs… heat… yeah, it’s obviously pretty craptastic off the bat. And I can’t believe that an OB would suggest her patients start lighting shit on fire and putting said fire near their bellies while inevitably breathing in the smoke from these herbal cigar candle things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, yeah, that concept is pretty fucked up. No one is suggesting you put these sticks next to your belly to get your baby to turn. That would be irresponsible, stupid even! That is not how ancient Chinese herbalists do business. So the egg-drop soup is all over my face for thinking something so ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do I get my daughter to flip?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sit on a chair and place each foot on a book with your little toes hanging over the edge. Place each stick on another book with the tip in the gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.birthinternational.com/articles/images/breech_4.jpg" border="0" alt="[Place each foot on a book with your little toes hanging over the edge]" width="216" height="187"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light the sticks (they burn with no flame but an intense heat and pungent smell) and position the hot tip as close as possible to the outside of each little toe, with the heat directed at the point just above the toe nail. Leave in place for 20 minutes. Be careful not to touch the skin as you will burn yourself. The heat should be as strong as you can tolerate, for the best effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT… THE…?!?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m supposed to burn my fucking &lt;em&gt;feet&lt;/em&gt;? Using sticks that are so hot you can’t see the flame? Are you kidding me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every part of my body is either achy, sore, tired or being kicked and grabbed and your answer is to put fire next to my feet because this will help my baby move? And you’re not being an asshole? You’re actually trying to help? And enough people do this in real life that you are willing to suggest this with a totally straight face?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I just step out of some-random-blogger mode and talk to you as a medical professional*? Ok, as your doctor, I’m going to recommend that you NEVER EVER EVER do this. Do not put invisible, but not imaginary, fire next to your feet. Do not do this when you are pregnant. Do not do this when you are not pregnant. Do not do this unless you are already dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what happens when Big Reflexology gets into bed with Big Ear Candles… while Big Reason gets sent out on a beer run. Seriously… that’s the only explanation I can come up with for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;randomised controlled trial&lt;/strong&gt; indicates that at approximately 70% of breech babies will turn using this method. If the baby does not turn from its breech position, external cephalic version should be attempted just before labour begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone thought there was enough validity to putting cigars near your feet, in order to cure a butt down fetus, to actually do a study. Like someone got money to do this study? And I can’t find a job? Maybe I’m not coming up with stupid enough studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let’s, for the sake of why the hell not, take a look at this “&lt;strong&gt;randomised controlled trial&lt;/strong&gt;“. For the sake of brevity, I will just show you the stuff you need to know. More information is on the &lt;a href="http://www.birthinternational.com/articles/andrea13.html"&gt;toe burner page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Francesco Cardini MD; Huang Weixin, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association, November 11, 1998 – Vol 280, No 18, pp1580-1584.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Traditional Chinese medicine uses moxibustion (burning herbs to stimulate acupuncture points) of acupoint BL 67 (Zhiyin, located beside the outer corner of the fifth toenail), to promote version of fetuses in breech presentation. Its effect may be through increasing fetal activity. However, no randomised controlled trial has evaluated the efficacy of this therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Primigravidas in the 33rd week of gestation with normal pregnancy and an ultrasound diagnosis of breech presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most babies are head down (cephalic) by 32 weeks. The number of breech presentations ranges between 15 and 20% at this point. However, come delivery, only about 4% are breech. So 33 weeks isn’t any time to start panicking about having a breech baby, but it’s certainly something you want to be aware of. Of breech babies at 33 weeks, somewhere between 70-80% will end up cephalic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait… what did the article claim? 70% of women who try moxibustion will end up with head down babies? How… completely unremarkable and predictable. But what does the study say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interventions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The 130 subjects randomised to the intervention group received stimulation of acupoint BL 67 by moxa (Japanese term for Artemisia vulgaris) rolls for 7 days, with treatment for an additional 7 days if the fetus persisted in the breech position. The 130 subjects randomised to the control group received routine care but no interventions for breech position. Subjects with persistent breech presentation after 2 weeks of treatment could undergo external cephalic version anytime between 35 weeks of gestation and delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcome Measures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Fetal movements counted by the mother during 1 hour each day for 1 week; number of cephalic presentations during the 35th week and at delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The intervention group experienced a mean of 48.45 fetal movements vs 35.35 in the control group. (P&amp;lt;.001;95% confidence interval [C1] for difference, 10.56-15.60). During the 35th week of gestation 98 (75.4%) of 130 fetuses in the interventions group were cephalic vs 62 (47.7%) of 130 fetuses in the control group (P&amp;lt;.001; relative risk (RR), 1.58; 95% CI 1.29-1.94). Despite the fact that 24 subjects in the control group and one subject in the intervention group underwent external cephalic version, 98 (75.4%) of the 130 fetuses in the intervention group were cephalic at birth vs 81 (62.3%) of the fetuses in the control group (P=.02; RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.12-1.43).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Among primigravidas with breech presentation during the 33rd week of gestation, moxibustion for 1 to 2 weeks increased fetal activity during the treatment period and cephalic presentation after the treatment period and at delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blah blah blah. 75% of the babies whose moms willingly lit their feet on fire were cephalic at birth. 62% of the babies whose moms weren’t so stupid got flipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers and the article writer decided that this means foot cooking works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a research scientist, or a scientist, or a researcher, but what I see is that one group’s outcome (which happened to be the one with the intervention) being exactly the same as what you’d expect to see anywhere at any time with any large group of pregnant women, and not faring better… not even statistically insignificantly better… not better at all. Exactly where you’d expect them to be, between 70 and 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why did the control group have such low numbers? The only thing I can say about that is that they had… (wait for it)… cold feet! ZING!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly though, even if this study showed that sticking your feet in a bonfire would definitely flip your baby, 100% of the time, that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea. Pregnancy lowers your body’s ability to fight infection. Getting burnt increases your risk of infection. Therefore, my expert professional medical* opinion is that you do not, under any circumstances, put your skin within an inch of a burning cigar/candle/stick on purpose for any extended period of time. And I would define “extended” as “more than a second”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, since there is a small human being gnawing the hell out of my diaphragm, I’ll leave you with that so I can go cry… both in pain and for the sake of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: use condoms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the crush of the closing weeks of the semester, I found a little time to follow &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/seed/2010/04/dont_talk_to_strangers_stephen.php"&gt;the conversation&lt;/a&gt; about whether Earthicans ought to welcome a meeting with whatever extraterrestrial life might be out there to meet us, or whether we'd be better off hiding under the bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Free-Ride offspring have &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; followed the point and counterpoint on the best alien life action plan, they're generally more enthusiastic futurists than I am.  So, I asked them to dig deep into their imaginations and give us their visions of first contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should surprise no one that the elder and younger Free-Ride offspring have very different visions of this event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before they started drawing, they brainstormed a bit about what forms extraterrestrial life might take.  Maybe you'd find your classic Star Trek humanoids, or comic book little green men.  But why couldn't alien life be mostly plants, or fungi?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we'll be negotiating intergalactic treaties with microbes?  (I'm thinking people might be less cavalier about skipping vaccinations if that's how things play out.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, here are the pictures of first contact they came up with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2010/04/friday_sprog_blogging_first_co.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2010/04/friday_sprog_blogging_first_co.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/DPk92lHSQlc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272640997696"><id gr:original-id="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3023">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3525dc5648b72b85</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">The end of the Prince?s Foundation for Magic Medicine</title><published>2010-04-30T14:17:21Z</published><updated>2010-04-30T14:17:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3023" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Hot off the press

This is for several reasons.

One (1): They have covers like this:

(Seriously, I crack up just looking at these.  LOL!!!  Ooooh.  My new favorite.  Look at that bulging codpiece. *snort*  HAHAHAHAHAHA.)

Two (2): They are so predictable, particularly the period ones.  Sci could write one RIGHT NOW:

Lessee...

"Cerise Everett Longwood, the lovely and rebellious daughter of the Count of (Something-or-Other-which-sounds-terribly-rich-and-important), has never lived life by the rules.  Restricted by day by the iron bands of high society, by night she stretches her wings as (a thief/someone who avenges the helpless/an aspiring writer of romance novels/a journalist).  But when a (terrible secret/horrible murder/something else mildly chilling) is discovered, she finds the only man who can help her is the man she hates most.

Viscount Feathersly von Rothampton ne Gornesssbaum (or something else complicated and equally offensive to language which is usually shortened to something more romantic that his friends call him, like "Heath"), is not a man to be challenged.  Outwardly secure in his position and power, his years in (Her Majesty's  service/the army/the navy/Secret Service/something else military and daring) have marked him in more ways than one.  

When the delectable Cerise falls into his path, the Viscount's honor demands that he assist her, despite his rivalry and hatred for her brother.  But great events are afoot , and Cerise is in no mere danger.  And in the heat of the moment, passions arise..."

Coming soon to a bookstore near you!!!  Unfortunately, "Scicurious" is a terrible romance pen-name...

But yes, they're all like that.  She's lovely (she never ADMITS that she is, she always thinks she's TOTALLY ordinary, but she's of course long and lithe, or short and slim, or short and lushly curvaceous, etc).  They never like each other at first.  Then they kiss.  Then they screw.  Shenanigans ensue.   It will always end with a marriage and the birth of at least one of their children into a happy, adorable, obscenely rich family.

And Three (3): Sci has always found that these romance novels have the most hilarious representations of female anatomy.  The woman is always a virgin at the start (or had an extremely boring sex life before she became an untimely widow at the age of no more than 27), and yet never seems to have a problem with pain or orgasm during the first attempt at intercourse.  And what always gets Sci, these women appear to have INSANELY sensitive breasts.  Apparently, the guy touches them and the next line always reads something like "bolts of lightning shot through her thighs".  

Seriously?  I mean, seriously?!  Is this normal?

Sci asked her friends.  They all laughed, many of them uncomfortably (this happens a LOT when Sci is around...I wonder why...), and no one could give her a direct answer.  

Sci turned to the internet.

And her trusty Pubmed gave her NOTHING!!!!  NOTHING?!?!  Has my Pubmed-fu failed me?!  Is it really possible that no one has done a study on variations in nipple sensitivity in women as a variation of the menstrual cycle?!  Is this like when I wanted to know about vaginal sensitivity?  Why is no one STUDYING THIS?!  

/rant.

Sigh.  Someday.

Anyway.  Sci did turn up some interesting papers.  And it turns out that, while apparently no one cares (and by 'no one', I mean no one with scientific funding, because everyone else in the world apparently cares a heck of a lot) how sensitive women's nipples are and whether they vary as a function of the menstrual cycle (and I'll bet you a PILE of money they do, in fact, let's bet some funding and do this study already), a study has been done on MEN.  On men's nipples, and...everywhere else.

Let's get to it.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot off the press&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prince’s Foundation for Integrated Health (FIH) has been spreading misinformation about medicine since 1993.  It has featured often &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Prince%27s+Foundation"&gt;on this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it has closed its doors.
   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An announcement has appeared &lt;a href="http://www.fih.org.uk/media_centre/closure_of_fih.html"&gt;on the FIH website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;30 April 2010 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trustees of The  Prince’s Foundation for Integrated Health have decided to close the  charity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement goes on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Whilst the closure has been planned for many months and is part of an  agreed strategy, the Trustees have brought forward the closure timetable  as a result of a fraud investigation at the charity.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Trustees feel that The Foundation has achieved its key objective of  promoting the use of integrated health. Since The Foundation was set up  in 1993, integrated health has become part of the mainstream healthcare  agenda, with over half a million patients using complementary therapies  each year, alongside conventional medicine. . . &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the immediate precipitating cause may have been the fraud (see below), the idea that the Foundation &amp;quot;has achieved its key objective of  promoting the use of integrated health&amp;quot; seems like a ludicrous bit of make-believe. Well, make-believe is something with which the Foundation was quite familiar. At a time when university courses in quackery are vanishing like the snow in springtime, they can hardly believe that their aims have been achieved. But I guess one could not expect them to say &amp;quot;sorry folks, we were wrong all along&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 2010 Conference is cancelled too&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging by the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466"&gt;quality of the 2009 conference&lt;/a&gt;, which I analysed at length last year, the cancellation of the 2010 conference is very welcome news (except perhaps to a few sycophants looking for honours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What next?  A College?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rumour is that a “College of Integrated Medicine” may arise from the ashes of FIH.  Or even, heaven forbid. a &lt;em&gt;Royal&lt;/em&gt; College of Integrated baloney.  Since universities seem to be deciding that it isn’t sensible to teach myth as truth, i is not unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Prince Charles’s aide at homeopathy charity arrested on suspicion of fraud&lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This headline, of an article in the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, by Robert Booth, was not entirely unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parlous state of the accounts at the Prince’s Foundation for Integrated Health has been documented already &lt;a href="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2010/04/20/financial-irregularities-at-the-fih/"&gt;at&lt;br&gt;
Gimpy’s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An aide in Prince Charles’s campaign for wider use of complementary medicine in the NHS was arrested at dawn today on suspicion of fraud and money-laundering at the prince’s health charity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 49-year old man, understood to be a former senior official at the Prince’s Foundation for Integrated Health, was taken into custody at a police station in north London. He was arrested alongside a 54-year-old woman, who was being held at the same address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrests follow a police investigation into £300,000 unaccounted for in the books of the charity, of which the Prince is president.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More news will appear here, as it comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other posts on this topic appeared rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Followed by the rest of the mainstream media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edzard Ernst&lt;/strong&gt; 1 May 2010, in the Indepenndent.  Better than any journalist. &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/edzard-ernst-why-alternative-medicine-wins-from-the-foundations-demise-1959615.html"&gt;Why alternative medicine wins from the foundation’s demise&lt;/a&gt;.  Read it! Here are some quotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“I therefore think that the FIH has become a lobby group for unproven and disproven treatments populated by sycophants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The FIH has repeatedly been economical with the truth. For instance when it published a DoH-sponsored patient guide that was devoid of evidence. They claimed evidence was never meant to be included. But I had seen a draft where it was and friends have seen the contract with the DoH where “evidence” was an important element. “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hope that, after the demise of FIH, the discussion about alternative medicine in the UK can once more become rational. I also hope that Prince Charles has the greatness of selecting advisers who actually advise rather than “Yes Men” who are hoping to see their names on the next Honours List. “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 May 2010.&lt;/strong&gt;  According to Martin Delgado, &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1270327/The-ex-aide-held--300-000-fraud-shut-Charles-charity.html?ito=feeds-newsxml"&gt;in the Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;, the people who were arrested on suspicion of fraud were accountant George Gray and his wife.  Gray was Finance Director and acting Chief Executive of FIH. About as senior as you can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Gray spent two weeks (two weeks?) at Diabetes UK in 2004 before becoming finance director at the Leadership Foundation For Higher Education.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Colquhoun</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">DC&amp;#39;s Improbable Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272638449002"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4960">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/23d83bd66f8bb090</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="Vaccines"/><title type="html">Dr. Jay Gordon: Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing</title><published>2010-04-30T14:00:44Z</published><updated>2010-04-30T14:00:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4960" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a trend in the media when presenting a contentious topic to provide balance.  For topics not founded upon objective facts this serves the media well; provide both sides of the argument, and let the viewer decide.  The problem is that not every issue is evenly balanced, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=319"&gt;particularly in science&lt;/a&gt;.  Covering the discovery of a new extra-solar planet by giving equal airtime to astronomers and astrologers, for example, would be the height of absurdity, yet this is precisely how the media approaches scientific topics with frightening regularity.  You need look no further than the coverage of evolution, or 2012, or global climate change (that list should derail the comments nicely) for excellent examples of the same type of false balance in mainstream media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was with trepidation, then, that I waited to see how PBS’s &lt;em&gt;Frontline&lt;/em&gt; handled the topic of vaccination.  I was pleasantly surprised.  “&lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/vaccines/view/"&gt;The Vaccine War&lt;/a&gt;” introduced the most common concerns expressed about vaccination, and then presented the evidence addressing each concern in turn clearly and concisely.  It gave airtime to some rather prominent anti-vaccine personalities, but the bulk of the program was dedicated to the data, the science, the evidence, and where answers are available it did not hesitate to present them baldly and clearly. “The Vaccine War” was not a comprehensive review of every perspective, every theory, every vaccine and study, but it did provide a fair discussion balanced by the science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first clue that Frontline had acquitted itself well was when &lt;a href="http://drjaygordon.com/"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt;, pediatrician to Jenny McCarthy’s son, tweeted his opinion of the show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;PBS show about vaccines. Don’t bother to watch it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gordon wasted no time venting his outrage at the show’s message, its tone, and the fact that he was cut from the program at &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/pbs-frontline-show-about_b_554691.html"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;.  I encourage you to read the original at The Huffington Post, and to post your own comments.  I will discuss his points here in detail, providing the periodic reality check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Kate,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Frontline&lt;/em&gt; show was disgraceful. You didn’t even have the courtesy to put my interview or any part of the two hours we spent taping on your web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gordon was interviewed, and his contribution was not felt to provide value to the  program.  He was cut.  That is the prerogative of the producers, and they are under no obligation to include Dr. Gordon just because he was interviewed.  If he is unhappy with his treatment, he is more than welcome to decline the next interview.  In fact, I think that would be an excellent idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You created a pseudo-documentary with a preconceived set of conclusions: “Irresponsible moms against science” was an easy takeaway from the show.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gordon needs to review the definitions of “pseudo” and “documentary.”  Is a WWII program on the History channel a pseudo-documentary because it covers the war from the Allied perspective?  Of course not, it provides facts within a context, a narrative; this is essential in a documentary, and it is precisely what the producers of this program have done.  That the producers decided to provide a story based upon facts and science determined the conclusions they presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you happen to notice that Vanessa, the child critically ill with pertussis, was not intubated nor on a respirator in the ER? She had nasal “prongs” delivering oxygen. I’m sorry for her parents anxiety and very happy that she was cured of pertussis. But to use anecdotal reports like this as science is irresponsible and merely served the needs of the doctor you wanted to feature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This objection by Dr Gordon is petty, appalling, and hypocritical.  So what if she wasn’t intubated?  This is a suffering infant who is critically ill and will remain so for weeks.  Is her suffering not worth preventing just because she didn’t die?  Is that how low Dr. Gordon sets his threshold for a child warranting medical care?  This is appallingly callous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The segment that portrayed vaccine preventable diseases, including the segment with pertussis, was explicitly stated by the program to demonstrate what these diseases look like to a population that, on the whole, has never seen them.  How else would Dr. Gordon propose to provide this information to the public?  This is an entirely appropriate use of an anecdote, as an example of the evidence, rather than as the evidence itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, by Dr. Gordon’s own admission, the producers did not provide the worst-case scenarios of each of these diseases, all of which can be fatal, though they could easily have done so if their goal was purely emotional manipulation, rather than education of legitimate risks of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one pursued Dr. Offit’s response about becoming rich from the vaccine he invented. He was allowed to slide right by that question without any follow up. Dr. Paul Offit did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; go into vaccine research to get rich. He is a scientist motivated by his desire to help children. But his profiting tens of millions of dollars from the creation of this vaccine and the pursuit of sales of this and other vaccines is definitely not what he says it is. His many millions “don’t matter” he says. And you let it go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am glad to read Dr Gordon acknowledge that Dr Offit’s motivation to research and produce vaccines was not financial.  He is a professional who produced an excellent and &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/rotavirus_vaccines_20090605/en/"&gt;badly needed&lt;/a&gt; vaccine to prevent a &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/wer/2007/wer8232.pdf"&gt;nasty&lt;/a&gt; disease.  Excellence in our society is usually rewarded with financial compensation.  So what?  The research that led to Offit’s rotavirus vaccine, the data supporting its safety and efficacy &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/QuestionsaboutVaccines/ucm100242.htm"&gt;before licensure&lt;/a&gt;, and the volume of &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm142404.htm"&gt;post-licensure&lt;/a&gt; safety and efficacy data replicated by &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/362/4/289"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; researchers stands on its own whether Dr Offit is penniless or a billionaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenny McCarthy resumed being a “former Playboy” person and was not acknowledged as a successful author, actress and mother exploring every possible avenue to treating her own son and the children of tens of thousands of other families.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontline is not obliged to present a full CV on each person appearing in its program, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_McCarthy"&gt;Ms. McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;’s role as a former Playmate is both factual and the original source of her fame.  Dr. Gordon’s perspective heavily biases his description of her as a “mother exploring every possible avenue to treating her own son and the children of tens of thousands of other families”.  She could just as easily (and perhaps more accurately) be described as a mother who, in pursuing her own ill-founded beliefs, has undermined the care of her child, placed him at higher risk of preventable disease, subjected him to worthless therapies while ignoring known serious risks, used her celebrity to disseminate misinformation and fear to the public while simultaneously diverting research time, energy and funds away from fruitful avenues of study, and delaying the time when the tens of thousands of families can better understand autism and be provided with more viable therapies.  Oh, and &lt;em&gt;Frontline&lt;/em&gt; could have mentioned her foray into the embarrassing “&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061203045246/www.indigomoms.com/index2.html"&gt;Indigo Child&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/06/your_friday_dose_of_woo_generation_woo.php"&gt;nonsense&lt;/a&gt;.  Perhaps describing her as a “former Playboy” isn’t so bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I trusted you by giving you two or three hours of my time for an interview and multiple background discussions. I expressed my heartfelt reservations about both vaccines and the polarizing of this issue into “pro-vaccine” and “anti-vaccine” camps. I told you that there was at least a &lt;strong&gt;third “camp.”&lt;/strong&gt; There are many doctors and even more parents who would like a more judicious approach to immunization. Give vaccines later, slower and with an individualized approach as we do in &lt;em&gt;every other area of medicine.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href="http://www.fallacyfiles.org/strawman.html"&gt;straw man&lt;/a&gt;.  No one, even the most staunch vaccine advocates, advocate the identical vaccination regimen for every child.  There are uncommon but &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/should-not-vacc.htm"&gt;clear reasons&lt;/a&gt; to deviate from the vaccination schedule due to a child’s individual medical history.  However, these are based upon evidence, not the arbitrary judgment of individual physicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What evidence does Dr. Gordon provide that later, slower, individualized vaccination schedules do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; but reduce the herd immunity of a community, increase the number of doctor visits, decrease the likelihood that a child will be fully immunized, or increase the time for which a child is unprotected?  No such evidence exists, so one must wonder &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=512"&gt;on what he has based this recommendation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “individualized approach” to medicine warrants a series of posts all to its own. Suffice it to say that while there are uncommon times when a patient’s care must deviate from the usual approach, standardization of care is one of the most effective ways of improving patient outcomes, and is one of the pillars of evidence-based (and science-based) medicine.  “Every other area of medicine” is making its best advances through the standardization of medical care, not capricious, evidence-free judgment calls of individual physicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What did you create instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Vaccine War.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A war. Not a discussion or a disagreement over facts and opinions, but a &lt;em&gt;war&lt;/em&gt;. This show was unintelligent, dangerous and completely lacking in the balance that you promised me — and your viewers — when you produced and advertised this piece of biased unscientific journalism. “Tabloid journalism” I believe is the epithet often used. Even a good tabloid journalist could see through the screed you’ve presented.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I believe this is one of the better examples of “&lt;a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/478472/projection"&gt;projection&lt;/a&gt;” that I’ve come across.  I touched on the idea of “balance” in journalism at the beginning, and will not rehash it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You interviewed me, you spent hours with Dr. Robert Sears of the deservedly-illustrious Sears family and you spoke to other doctors who support parents in their desire to find out what went wrong and why it’s going wrong and what we might do to prevent this true epidemic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gordon sets up a false-dichotomy here.  He pretends that only physicians who believe vaccines cause autism support parents of autistic children, or want to find the root cause of autism, or to find viable treatments or ways to prevent it.  This is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How deserving Dr. Sears is of his popularity we have addressed on SBM in the past, and can be found &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=512"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a measles epidemic, not whooping cough. Autism. An epidemic caused by environmental triggers acting on genetic predisposition. The science is there and the evidence of harm is there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism diagnoses are &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1374"&gt;higher&lt;/a&gt; than they have been in the &lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20021231/cdc-autism-rates-higher-than-thought"&gt;past,&lt;/a&gt; and they are unsettlingly common, warranting a large-scale research, therapeutic, and support system that is currently lacking.  This is due in large part to increased &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=95"&gt;awareness and broadened definitions&lt;/a&gt; of what places someone on the autism spectrum, though the possibility of a smaller scale true increase in the incidence of autism has not yet been confirmed or ruled out.  To label this as a “true epidemic” is inaccurate on several fronts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gordon is correct that autism has an indisputable &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=528"&gt;genetic predisposition&lt;/a&gt;.  However, to what degree environmental triggers play a role, and which triggers these may be have not been established.  The science is there, but it does not come remotely close to supporting Dr. Gordon’s statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the evidence of harm, of vaccines causing autism, is not only not there, but the evidence &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/00_pdf/VSD_Chart_of_Autism_Studies-Updated_Aug_18_09.pdf"&gt;overwhelmingly demonstrates no correlation between vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proof will come over the next decade.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, so Dr. Gordon &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; have proof now.  Thank you for clarifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/Pages/default.aspx"&gt;National Children’s Study&lt;/a&gt; will, perhaps by accident, become a prospective look at many children with and without vaccines. But we &lt;strong&gt;don’t have time to wait&lt;/strong&gt; for the results of this twenty-one year research study:”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have time to wait” The same can be said of every single medical condition suffered by a human being.  This doesn’t minimize their suffering, it drives home the point that we must perform the highest quality science possible and &lt;em&gt;reject hypotheses that have been found to be without merit&lt;/em&gt;.  The proposed vaccine/autism link is one such hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that certain pesticides cause cancer and we know that flame retardants in children’s pajamas are dangerous. We are cleaning up our air and water slowly and parents know which paint to buy and which to leave on the shelves when they paint their babies’ bedrooms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where such statements are true they were found and confirmed by scientific inquiry, and when they are false they are refuted by the same method.  Belief and opinions are irrelevant when objective data is available, and the above paragraph is an irrelevant distraction to the topic of Dr. Gordon’s letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information parents and doctors &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;don’t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;have is contained in the huge question mark about the number of vaccines, the way we vaccinate and the dramatic increase in autism, ADD/ADHD, childhood depression and more. We pretend to have &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt; of harm or &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt; of no harm when what we really have is a large series of very important unanswered questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That we don’t have the answers to everything does not mean that we don’t have the answers to anything, nor does it give us license to ignore the evidence we do have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cased you were wondering, as I practice pediatrics every day of my career, I base &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; I do on Dr. Wakefield’s research or on Jenny McCarthy’s opinions. I respect what they both have done and respectfully disagree with them at times. I don’t think that Dr. Wakefield’s study proved anything except that we need to look harder at his hypothesis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case in point.  We have &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0003140"&gt;looked harder&lt;/a&gt; at Dr. Wakefield’s hypothesis, and it has failed catastrophically.  With no evidence in its favor and &lt;a href="http://sciencebasedmedicine.org/reference/vaccines-and-autism/#Key%20Research"&gt;much against&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Gordon has yet to reject Dr Wakefield’s hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of equal interest, is Dr. Gordon willing to acknowledge that the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9500320"&gt;original paper&lt;/a&gt; Dr &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3941"&gt;Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; published in The Lancet is &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3660"&gt;at best&lt;/a&gt; a scientific &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=370"&gt;embarrassment&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think that Jenny McCarthy has all the answers to treating or preventing autism but there are tens of thousands of parents who have long needed her strong high-profile voice to draw attention to their families’ needs: Most families with autism get inadequate reimbursement for their huge annual expenses and very little respect from the insurance industry, the government or the medical community. Jenny has demanded that a brighter light be shone on their circumstances, their frustration and their needs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually agree with Dr. Gordon here.  &lt;a href="http://www.aap.org/healthtopics/autism.cfm"&gt;Autism&lt;/a&gt; is indeed a widespread problem badly in need of high-quality research, and families are in dire need of support.  It is unfortunate that the advocate they have found was so badly misguided by her pediatrician.  Dr Gordon was in the position to guide her, to educate her, connected her with experts in childhood development and autism and enable her to use her enthusiasm and desire to help her son and the rest of the autistic community.  Unfortunately, Dr Gordon squandered this opportunity, to the detriment of us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I base &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;everything&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; I do on my reading of CDC and World Health Organization statistics about disease incidence in the United States and elsewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gordon claims that he bases his decisions on evidence.  Yet he has come to &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/Autism/Index.html"&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2004/Immunization-Safety-Review-Vaccines-and-Autism.aspx"&gt;conclusions&lt;/a&gt; from those who generated the evidence, and those who are &lt;a href="http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/autismparentfacts.htm"&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/topics/mmr/mmr_autism/en/index.html"&gt;field&lt;/a&gt;.  Only one group can be right, and neither the evidence nor the odds are in his favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I base &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;everything&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; I do on having spent the past thirty years in pediatric practice watching tens of thousands of children get vaccines, not get vaccines and the differences I see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience has value, but it is little more than a long series of anecdotes, and as such it can also be a trap.  Nearly every modern physician can make a similar statement, as can every homeopath, acupuncturist, phrenologist, faith healer and shaman.  Placing personal experience, no matter how vast, above solid objective data is a hallmark of someone practicing pseudoscience, and it is precisely this sin that Dr. Gordon commits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines change children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An assertion made without evidence can be rejected without evidence.  Dr. Gordon clearly feels he has discovered new information, a previously unidentified pattern, yet he has not even bothered to publish a simple case series to try to convince the medical community of his claim.  Making such a statement without evidence is irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most experts would argue that the changes are unequivocally good. My experience and three decades of observation and study tell me otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, Dr. Gordon feels his experience trumps evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are neither all good–as this biased, miserable PBS treacle would have you believe–nor all bad as the strident anti-vaccine camp argues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another straw-man by Dr. Gordon.  The program clearly acknowledges the presence of adverse events from vaccines, including extremely serious ones.  No one, including the producers of “The Vaccine War,” claim that vaccines are “all good.”  But the benefits do clearly outweigh the risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You say the decisions to edit 100% of my interview from your show (and omit my comments from your website) “were purely based on what’s best for the show, not personal or political, and the others who didn’t make it came from both sides of the vaccine debate.” You are not telling the truth. You had a point to prove and removed material from your show which made the narrative balanced. &lt;em&gt;“Distraught, confused moms against important, well-spoken calm doctors”&lt;/em&gt; was your narrative with a deep sure voice to, literally, narrate the entire artifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be ashamed of yourself, Kate. You knew what you put on the air was slanted and you cheated the viewers out of an opportunity for education and information. You cheated me out of hours of time, betrayed my trust and then you wasted an hour of PBS airtime. Shame on you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Gordon draws his rant to a close, he returns to telling a PBS producer how to do her job.  He does not, however, at any time provide any evidence to contradict a single pertinent point or piece of evidence made in the entire hour of “The Vaccine War.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way vaccines are manufactured and administered right now in 2010 makes vaccines and their ingredients part of the group of toxins which have led to a huge increase in childhood diseases including autism. Your show made parents’ decisions harder and did nothing except regurgitate old news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents and children deserve far better from PBS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can Dr. Gordon write the preceding paragraph and then claim to be anything other than anti-vaccine? PBS is not the one to be ashamed; our children deserve better stewardship than that of Dr. Jay Gordon.&lt;/p&gt;

The story is here: Genomes May One Day Be Medical Crystal Balls

And Steve had his sequence analyzed for medically deleterious mutations.  He took this to an MD friend, and together they went over the data.  It’s a pretty interesting story.  And raises a lot of issues.

Some of the mutations are not actionable. That’s clear–and they say that you need to mentally prepared to look at this data, because some of it is scary and you are helpless.

“You know, the chance of dying is 100 percent, it’s just a question of how and when, right?” Quake says. “I think this sort of points to an interesting thing about personal genomes. You have to have a bit of a strong stomach for it.”

Are people really going to be able to take this not only for themselves, but for their 3 kids?  I can’t imagine that kind of weight multiple times.

Other information may be helpful–seems like Quake will benefit from statins.

But the part I found most intriguing was their assessment of the doctor-patient interaction around the personal genome.  They talk about how if you have 100-120 genes of concern that arise in your sequence, and you want to spend 2-3 minutes talking about each (which seems pretty minimal for non-scientists/non-MDs, I think), that would be 5 hours of genetic counselling.  And who will do that?  And who will pay for that?  And is the public ready for the bad news?

Anyway–this is tied to a paper in The Lancet.  Figure 1 is very cool–it describes the workflow/steps they went through for looking at the mutations.  It included GVS, HGMD, OMIM, PubMed, PolyPhen, SIFT, and more. It’s interesting–I had talked recently about the steps I would take if I had my genome, and I think this is a very nice model for that.

They talk about PharmGKB. They show Steve’s pedigree, and his clinical assessment. You can look at his mutations. And Figure 3 is his clinical risks of things like Obesity, diabetes, Depression, various cancers, and more.

It’s an important paper in this arena. If you are looking at a personal genome in your future, check it out.  And think about the implications.  I think the conclusions way undersell the look at the future that this provides–but it’s a research paper, I get it.  But this is fascinating to think about.

&lt;p&gt;SDO has been in the works for a long, long time, and I’ve been anxiously awaiting data from it for years… so of course I was away from my computer when the images were released. Still, it was worth a few extra days to see something as back-of-the-neck-hair-raising as this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/img/firstlight/print/AIA_00136.tif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/sdo_prominence.jpg" alt="sdo_prominence" title="sdo_prominence" width="610" height="813"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy Haleakala! Click to emprominate.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As if on cue, just days after SDO’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) was switched on, the Sun threw an epic fit, blasting out an arcing prominence perfectly positioned for us to see. A prominence is a loop of gas that erupts from the surface of the Sun. This gas follows the Sun’s magnetic field lines; complicated interplay between the energy stored in the field lines versus their tension causes them to leap up from the Sun, anchored in two spots that represent where the north and south poles of the lines punch through the Sun’s surface. A prominence might have as much as a hundred billion tons of matter in it, and can be hundreds of thousands of kilometers across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea of this, here’s a video made from images from AIA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Lmm3J0WAres%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0xe1600f%26color2%3D0xfebd01%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaboom! Interestingly, the gas isn’t as hot as you might think, and can be cooler than the surface of the Sun. When we see a prominence edge-on, silhouetted against the surface of the Sun, it actually appears dark! When that happens, we call it a &lt;em&gt;filament&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a big fan of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (&lt;a href="http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/"&gt;SOHO&lt;/a&gt;) for a long time, and SDO is like the Son of SOHO. It has technology that is more current, and has very high resolution cameras. SDO can take spectra of the Sun to look in detail at its composition, temperature, motion, and magnetic strength. It can also measure the seismology of the surface of the Sun, the way waves travel across it and make it pulse; this tells us about the interior of the Sun that is otherwise totally invisible. Combining all this data together yields a vast amount of knowledge waiting to be learned about our nearest star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also produces stunning full-Sun imagery:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/img/firstlight/print/composite20100330st.tif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/sdo_composite_fullsun.jpg" alt="sdo_composite_fullsun" title="sdo_composite_fullsun" width="610" height="604"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image is amazing; it shows very hot helium and iron ranging in temperature from 60,000 Kelvin (100,000+° F) to well over a million Kelvins (1.8 million degrees F)! You can see the big prominence to the left, as well as several others around the disk. All the twisting and writhing on the surface is due to the bubbling convection of hot material from the Sun’s interior rising to the surface coupled with the fiercely complex solar magnetic field. The physics involved is incredibly complex, but with SDO’s help scientists will soon have a much firmer grasp on what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, they’ll also have a pile of new mysteries to ponder as well. The Sun is the closest star to the Earth, and closer than most planets. We know a lot about it, but there’s so much left to understand: what’s the root cause of the 5.5 year long  solar magnetic cycle? How is that tied to Earth’s climate? What effect do sunspots have on the Sun and Earth? How exactly does the Sun influence space weather; the flood of subatomic particles streaming from the solar surface and interacting with our own magnetic field, affecting satellites and even our power grid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science is like a tapestry with no edge, and with holes located here and there in the fabric. We can fill those holes ever more, and explore the edges, pushing them back with each new discovery. Along with many other observatories like it, SDO is our loom that helps us create and follow that weave.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, James has shut down Island of Doubt and started a new blog called "Class M."  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/classm/"&gt;That new blog is here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James is one of those people I've come to trust for information about environmental, climate, energy,  and related issues. Plus he's a genuinely nice guy.  I've had the fortune of spending a fair amount of time with him at the ScienceOnline conferences, and that has been very enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go check out &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/classm/"&gt;Class M. &lt;/a&gt; James intends for this new blog to be fairly specialized and focuses in certain key issues, to be very science oriented, and to mainly serve as a conduit between the peer reviewed literature and the interested citizen.  I expect Class M to be the go to place for journalists and policy makers interested in the topics he covers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/it_is_hard_to_find_a_class_m_b.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/dJHY-i0pWPQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272632452269"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/YsBw/~3/Kw3d4eki754/the_mirror_movement_mutation.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/de8f2179811fa3a1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">The mirror movement mutation</title><published>2010-04-30T08:00:29Z</published><updated>2010-04-30T08:00:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/lxEDmcm3WJA/the_mirror_movement_mutation.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/YsBw/~3/Kw3d4eki754/the_mirror_movement_mutation.php"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">MIRROR movements are involuntary movements that mimic, and occur simultaneously with, voluntary movements on the opposite side of the body. The movements are known to occur because of a failure in communication between the two sides of the nervous system. They are thought to be normal during infancy and early childhood, but usually diminish with age and disappear altogether by the age of 10, following maturation of the corpus callosum, the massive bundle of nerve fibres connecting the left and right hemispheres of the brain.

A large genetic study published online in the journal Science now shows that mirror movements are caused by a single genetic mutation. The mutation is located within a gene that encodes a well-known protein involved in guiding growing nerve fibres to their proper destination during development, and gives rise to mirror movements because the connections between the two brain hemispheres fail to form properly.

The case was hailed as a mystery and “medically unexplainable.”  The story spread mainly through those paper with less than a stellar journalistic reputation – but today that matters much less than it used to. Now stories get on the internet, regardless of their source, and become part of the seamless viral spread of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There actually isn’t a legitimate foreign language syndrome, and superficially the story is highly implausible. (Incidentally, there is a foreign accent syndrome, but this is really just a speech deficit that causes altered pronunciation that happens to superficially resemble a specific accent.) Croatian is a Slavic language, but has some German words mixed in due to  its history with the Hapsburg Monarchy. The reports indicate that the girl studied German in school – and so she could speak it before her coma. Not much of a mystery, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed the story on the SGU, prompting a listener from Croatia to write in with more details (local media always seems to have more detailed and accurate reporting). Ivan Osman wrote to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now  the interesting part is that after she woke up from the coma she could speak  German a lot more fluently than before and not a word in Croatian. My guess is  that Sepsis caused a brain damage in left temporal lobe. Probably mostly  in Broca’s Area, thus disabling her in speaking Croatian but not damaging her  knowledge of German language. At that point her brain probably switched to best  alternative and her passive knowledge of German sprang to life. Without  possibility to fall back to Croatian vocabulary there is no dilemma in which  words to choose and how to use them so her German must have sounded a lot better  to doctors and her parents. In my opinion the most unsettling thing about this  story is not mystical nonsense around it but a quote from a neuropsychiatrist  that was connected to this case. He said “This case is medically unexplainable”  – only a day after the whole incident. Seems to me that people like him should  not be even remotely connected to science. If he is capable of abandoning any  rational explanation only a day after girl woke up. I could understand if he  spent 50 years researching on that particular case and/or related cases and then  states he can’t explain it. But his reckless statement made this story a mockery  of journalism and his career instead of interesting medical case what it  probably is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new detail here I had not previously read is that she stopped speaking Croatian. The story was distorted in the English press so that the interesting point seemed to be that she was speaking German, which is not interesting because she already could speak German. They missed the really interesting point – not that she could speak German, but that she could not speak Croatian.  Ivan brings up an interesting question – can you neur0logically lose your primary language, and retain (and even improve) a secondary language?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation is called bilingual or&lt;a href="http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-125647885/nonparallel-recovery-bilingual-aphasia.html"&gt; polyglot aphasia&lt;/a&gt;. Aphasia is a language deficit due to brain injury. For some quick background – the major language areas include Broca’s area (posterior dominant frontal lobe), which is responsible for translating language into speech – essentially for the subtle and agile control of all the muscles of speech. Damage to the Broca’s area produces what we call non-fluent speech – it is broken, hesitating, and stuttering. But if this were the only area of the brain damaged comprehension would be intact, and the content of speech would be normal. A Broca’s lesion would also not discriminate among languages, and so Ivan’s hypothesis can be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other primary area is Wernicke’s area (posterior superior dominant temporal lobe) which is responsible for translating ideas into words and words into ideas – this is our dictionary. Damage here results in impaired comprehension of language. Speech is fluent, but the content is mixed up, and may contain neologisms (inventing new nonsense words), letter and word substitution, and generally nonsensical speech. There is also the arcuate fasciculus, which connects Wenicke’s to Broca’s. An isolated lesion here will impair repetition of words that are heard, but comprehension and fluency will be intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that when a second language is learned after around the age of four, then other parts of the brain are used for that language function in addition to the language cortex – but the primary language cortex is still required. It is currently not clear if languages learned together from infancy (compound bilinguals) are encoded in identical places in the brain or separate, although there is some evidence that they may not entirely overlap. This could allow for the differential damage of one language over another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, with aphasia (damage to any part of the language cortex) polyglot languages are lost and recovered together (in parallel). Also generally speaking, secondary languages (especially those learned after age four – called coordinate bilinguals) are more impaired and recover slower than primary languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various kinds of non-parallel polyglot aphasia reported. One language may be more severely lost, or recover later than another. There may also be involuntary switching between languages (inserting words from one language when trying to speak the other). And cases have been reported where a patient could only speak one language at a time, sometimes on alternating days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further complicate matters is the question of speech therapy. Most often speech therapy given in either language will improve speech in all languages. However, the primary language is usually chosen for therapy – the first language learned, or the dominant language currently used. There are cases, however, of differential recovery – recovery only in the language that is receiving speech therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists are still trying to make sense of all this. One proposal is that in polyglots, while speaking one language, the other language(s) have to be inhibited. If this ability to inhibit one language is impaired, then this will result in involuntary switching or mixing up the languages. It is further proposed that some patients with aphasia may have the inability to turn off the inhibition of one language – so the language may still be there, but permanently inhibited and unavailable. Such cases are rare but provide a window into the organization of multiple languages in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting back to our Crotian girl, as I stated above I doubt she has a Broca’s lesion. She also likely does not have a dense Wernicke’s lesion either, as this would impair comprehension in every language. But there is other cortex involved in language, so-called association cortex involved in processing input and output from the primary language cortex. And language memory is also more widely distributed, especially for secondary or multiple languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is – could she have an unusual form of aphasia that is impairing her ability to disinhibit her Croatian language, leaving her only able to speak German? This could theoretically have the effect of making her German seem more fluent, because she does not have to expend mental energy inhibiting her Croatian – that has become automatic. This would be doubly rare (perhaps unique) because Croatian is her primary language, and German her secondary language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story has suddenly become more interesting. I would like to hear more details about the case, like how old she was when she learned German. It is, of course, possible that her language change is more psychological and neurological. But in any case she deserves a detailed evaluation by a speech expert and the case should likely be reported in the technical literature (not just the lay press, who managed to mangle it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope her doctors do not persist in the silly notion that her case is “unexplainable” – there is actually a literature on this question and neuroscientists are making progress in sorting out how multiple languages are processed in the brain. This case, if properly explored, could provide a valuable addition to that literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case may also demonstrate, therefore, why the scientific and critical approach to anomalous cases is more valuable than the mystery-mongering (“unexplainable”) approach. It is better to assume that we can figure things out, if we are willing to try.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272631238403"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=11135">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/33805b65f9ccceb0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Articles"/><title type="html">Do chimps know death?</title><published>2010-04-30T12:40:24Z</published><updated>2010-04-30T12:40:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/30/do-chimps-know-death/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;I’ve always said that we are the only species whose members know they’re going to die.  I’m not sure that’s true, of course, but there have been suggestions that some mammals, even if they don’t grasp their own personal mortality, at least understand that death is something final and unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Two years ago, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/science/02angi.html"&gt;Natalie Angier of&lt;em&gt; The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/health/02iht-02angi.15827535.html"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;had a piece on this issue, prompted by the death of a baby gorilla in a German zoo whose mother continued to carry the corpse for days, refusing to surrender it to keepers.  Angier mentioned work by Karen McComb and her colleagues showing that &lt;a href="http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/2/1/26.full"&gt;African elephants preferentially fondle the bones of dead elephants&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to bones from other species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;The latest issue of &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt; has two thanatological notes (&lt;em&gt;thanatology&lt;/em&gt; is the scientific study of death) suggesting that chimps, our closest relatives, perceive death as something unique. The first, by Dora Biro et al., is straightforwardly called &lt;a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2810%2900218-6"&gt;“Chimpanzee mothers at Bossou, Guinea carry the mummified remains of their dead infants.”&lt;/a&gt; The authors report that, in 2003, a respiratory disease killed several chimps in a free-living colony in Bossou.  Two of the dead were infants, 1.2 and 2.6 years old.  In both cases the mothers continued to carry the dead babies around for several weeks, despite the putrefaction of the corpses.  Mothers continued to treat the bodies (which eventually mummified) with care, grooming them and chasing away flies, as well as carrying them in a unique way, gripping the arms of the dead infant between the mother’s head and shoulders (Fig. 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-11143" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/30/do-chimps-know-death/mother-dead-chimp/"&gt;&lt;img title="Mother dead chimp" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/mother-dead-chimp.jpg?w=521&amp;amp;h=192" alt="" width="521" height="192"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;Fig. 1.  A. Mother carries corpse of her baby who died 17 days earlier.  Notice the unique carrying posture.  B.  Head of mummified infant who  was carried for 68 days after death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors speculate that the mothers knew the babies were dead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An obvious and fascinating question concerns the extent  to which Jire  and Vuavua “understood” that their offspring were dead. In  many ways  they treated the corpses as live infants, particularly in the  initial  phase following death. Nevertheless they may well have been  aware that  the bodies were inanimate, consequently adopting carrying  techniques  never normally employed with healthy young (although mothers  of  handicapped young have also been known to respond appropriately).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure that carrying a corpse in a unique way betokens an understanding of death; maybe it’s just the best way to tote around a nonmoving infant who doesn’t smell too good.  But it is intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second report, “&lt;a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2810%2900145-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pan&lt;/em&gt; thanatology,&lt;/a&gt;” describes the behavior of a group of captive chimps when one of their members, a 50-year old female called Pansy, expired peacefully.  After describing the behaviors, the authors reiterate them, drawing parallels with human behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Pansy’s final days the others were quiet and attentive to her, and they altered their nesting arrangements (respect, care, anticipatory grief). When Pansy died they appeared to test for signs of life by closely inspecting her mouth and manipulating her limbs (test for pulse or breath). Shortly afterwards, the adult male attacked the dead female, possibly attempting to rouse her [7] (attempted resuscitation); attacks may also have expressed anger or frustration (denial, feelings of anger towards the deceased). The adult daughter remained near the mother’s corpse throughout the night (night-time vigil), while Blossom groomed Chippy [Blossom's son] for an extraordinary amount of time (consolation, social support). All three chimpanzees changed posture frequently during the night (disturbed sleep). They removed straw from Pansy’s body the next morning (cleaning the body). For weeks post-death, the survivors remained lethargic and quiet, and they ate less than normal (grief, mourning). They avoided sleeping on the deathbed platform for several days (leaving objects or places associated with the deceased untouched).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit anthropomorphic to me, but doesn’t exceed the bounds of informed speculation.  Indeed, the BBC News headline this description as &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8645283.stm"&gt;“Chimps ‘feel death like humans’”&lt;/a&gt;, and of course it shows nothing of the sort.  (The BBC link has a video of the death, which, unfortunately, you can’t access in the U.S.  If you do have access to &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;, you can see two videos &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6VRT-4YY8KWD-C&amp;amp;_user=5745&amp;amp;_coverDate=04%2F27%2F2010&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_acct=C000001358&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=5745&amp;amp;md5=0dc29c15377992cfa83b35c1bb3ac8a0#app2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, including a male attacking Pansy’s body.) UPDATE: The videos are now on YouTube and I’ve embedded them below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the BBC headline misses is the ineluctable fact that even if we observe behaviors in other species that are similar to our own, we cannot understand what is going on in the consciousness of chimps. Are they grieving? We won’t know until we can teach chimps to communicate in a sophisticated way with humans, or, more easily but less usefully, observe a similarity in brain activity between the two species evoked by the occurrence of a death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many atheists see our knowledge of death as a blessing, making us realize that life is ephemeral and we should live it to the fullest, I see it as a curse. It takes a certain amount of courage to face the fact that one day we will lose everything we have.  Few of us, I think, are enough like Socrates to accept our mortality with equanimity.  Yes, our consciousness is gone when we die, and yes, we don’t agonize about our absence from the scene &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; we were born, but I for one would choose immortality or, barring that, at least merciful ignorance of my finitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three chimps surround Pansy as she dies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discreetly hidden under the northern side of the eastern bridgehead of rural Täckhammar bridge is a spray-painted mural. I found it while checking for geocaches. It depicts an evil-looking male face accompanied by a really funny piece of Satanist prose poetry.&lt;blockquote&gt;"Dark vengeance of cryptic slaughter and Satanic suffering. The boundaries of Hell will brake [!] and humanity fall into frantic oblivion. Hatred and pain will forever rule the realm of Man."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dark Vengeance&lt;/i&gt; is a 1998 computer game. Cryptic Slaughter was an 80s thrash metal band. "Frantic oblivion", though an oxymoron, is actually a common expression with many google hits. The mural is protected from the elements down there, and my guess is that it was sprayed a decade ago (note the algae covering the left-hand margin) by some metal-head teen. I wonder if he still foresees the braking of the boundaries of Hell.&lt;/p&gt;

There are times when I'm incredibly depressed that pseudoscience and fear mongering are winning out, leaving our children vulnerable to infectious diseases not seen in decades and believing that it's only a matter of time before we start seeing really major outbreaks. This mood tends to strike me when I see actual stories about &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/when_the_outbreaks_begin_theyll_start_in.php"&gt;plummeting vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; and, well, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/more_disease_and_death_among_the_unvaccinated.php"&gt;small outbreaks of diseases&lt;/a&gt; associated with low vaccination rates and unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a condition in surgery known as a "sentinel"--or "herald"--bleed, which is generally associated with something called an aortoduodenal fistula, which is an abnormal communication between "big red" (the aorta) and the duodenum. One condition in which aortoduodenal fistulae occur is when there is synthetic graft material in the aorta behind the stomach, which is generally the case after an open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, they can also occur after pancreatic surgery, such as the Whipple pancreaticoduodenectomy. In both cases, scarring and chronic inflammation lead to the abnormal connection. In the context of such fistulae, a "sentinel" bleed is generally a relatively small, self-limited upper GI bleed. The patient bleeds, then stops. Everything appears to have settled down. Then, usually hours although sometimes days later, the patient suffers a massive exsanguinating hemorrhage from the fistulae. There are other examples of herald bleeds. One arguably more common example is the herald bleed that occurs with the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm. The patient will complain of a sudden onset of the worst headache he's ever had in his life, which will result in a workup. Often the CT will be negative, although a lumbar puncture will usually find blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Then, when things appear to have settled down, the patient can suffer a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage that kills him or leaves him with permanent neurologic disability. Basically, the aneurysm will start with a small leak that seals itself off sometime before it ruptures and bleeds profusely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relatively small outbreaks, such as the measles outbreak in San Diego, could be viewed as being similar to sentinel bleeds, relatively small and self-limited. I fear the real outbreak, as well we all should. Thanks to the anti-vaccine movement, it's a matter of time unless current trends reverse themselves. When I think about this, I become very depressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, though, I feel a bit at the manic end of the bipolar spectrum. These feelings tend to occur when very bad news, of which there's been more and more lately, strikes the anti-vaccine movement. Examples are much more common in the last year than before and include the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/02/the_martyrdom_of_st_andy.php"&gt;fall of Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;. Also, happily, the media have been less and less sympathetic to the anti-vaccine movement, turning the narrative from that of plucky parents fighing The Man and the uncaring system to people who reject science when they don't like it and whose irresponsibility endangers every children. We saw this in Chris Mooney's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/discover_why_does_the_vaccineautism_cont.php"&gt;Why Does the Vaccine/Autism Controversy Live On?&lt;/a&gt;, Amy Wallace's &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience"&gt;An Epidemic of Fear: How Panicked Parents Skipping Shots Endangers Us All&lt;/a&gt;, and excellent exposes by Trine Tsouderos and Pat Callahan on the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/the_anti-vaccine_biomed_movement_hijacking.php"&gt;autism biomed movement&lt;/a&gt; and how dubious autism "treatments" based on anti-vaccine beliefs &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/01/pumping_autistic_children_full_of_an_ind.php"&gt;refuse to die&lt;/a&gt;. The result is that, over the last year, I definitely get the feeling that the tide has turned. Reporters see a good story in the anti-vaccine movement, but anti-vaccine parents are no longer invariably the sympathetic figures in that story. This is a good thing indeed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, seeing their glowing press coverage evaporate, the anti-vaccine movement has gotten a bit...well, frustrated. Signs of that frustration are evident in anti-vaccine zealots' increasingly vicious attacks on those who have the temerity to point out that science is not on their side. Amy Wallace, for instance, was the victim of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_anti-vaccine_movement_strikes_back_u.php"&gt;misogynistic attacks by J.B. Handley&lt;/a&gt;, while Steve Novella was at the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=465"&gt;receiving end of one of J.B. Handley's rants&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the most spectacular meltdown came when the anti-vaccine crank blog Age of Autism &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/12/the_anti-vaccine_movement_shows_just_how.php"&gt;posted a crudely Photoshopped image&lt;/a&gt; of Trine Tsouderos, Steve Novella, Paul Offit, Amy Wallace, and Thomas Insel sitting around a Thanksgiving table preparing to feast on a baby. Meanwhile, a steady stream of invective likens those who stand up to science to Nazis, Stalin, and all manner of evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this background, I wondered what to expect after the airing of a FRONTLINE episode &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/vaccines/"&gt;The Vaccine War&lt;/a&gt;, which I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/the_vaccine_war_a_review.php"&gt;reviewed the other day&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't have long to wait. The chief spokescelebrity, Jenny McCarthy herself, weighed on--where else?--The Huffington Post with a little ditty called &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jenny-mccarthy/ifrontlineis-the-vaccine_b_555785.html"&gt;Frontline's "The Vaccine War" Misses Half the Story&lt;/a&gt;. Not to be outdone, on the very same day, that pediatrician to the stars, &lt;em&gt;consigliere&lt;/em&gt; to the anti-vaccine movement with serious anti-vaccine tendencies that he refuses to admit, Dr. Jay Gordon, weighed in with an outraged screed of his own entitled &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/pbs-frontline-show-about_b_554691.html"&gt;PBS Frontline on Autism Resorts to Pseudo-Documentary, Tabloid Journalism&lt;/a&gt;. Both are pathetic--woo-ful, if you will--whines, and the very fact that they were written suggests the impotence of the anti-vaccine movement in the face of science that passed them by at least five years ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/poor_poor_pitiful_me_jenny_mccarthy_and.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/poor_poor_pitiful_me_jenny_mccarthy_and.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/wm-W-aiBj5I" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272627703922"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=174915">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e1767ecdbe0e3986</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="bloom"/><category term="flower"/><category term="magnolia"/><title type="html">Magnolias in Bloom: Photo of the Day</title><published>2010-04-30T11:23:37Z</published><updated>2010-04-30T11:23:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/magnolia-in-bloom-photo-of-the-day/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We found this great magnolia photo in the Flickr commons, from user &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nosha/"&gt;nosha&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

He’s one of those people who can “talk to dead people” who have “crossed over.”  Just like &lt;strong&gt;John Edward&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to convince believers that it’s all a game of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_reading"&gt;cold reading&lt;/a&gt;, though, when their TV shows are edited down to 20 minutes from hours of taping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps this clip will help.  It’s a five-minute, unedited clip of Van Praagh on an Australian talk show getting guess after guess after guess wrong when talking to people who have lost their loved ones.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/t07UzTcApMI%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the following in just the first part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 0:40, he asks a lady if her deceased relative took medicine.  (An old person taking medicine?!  Never.)  He follows up by asking about arthritis, back problems, and legs… common problems for the elderly.  (The lady says no to everything, which is pretty amusing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Praagh then asks the (white, presumably Christian) woman if the mother was buried.  As if that’s breaking news.  &lt;em&gt;After getting confirmation&lt;/em&gt;, he goes on to say, “… cause she’s talking about getting buried and about a wake or a funeral…” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*facepalm*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after that, he asks for a Catherine/Cathy (also common names).  No luck.  Another lady &lt;em&gt;offers&lt;/em&gt; the name “Katie” and he runs with it as if that’s what he meant to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are just the first couple minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How anyone could be so gullible as to be taken in by this?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because they’re saddened by the loss of their loved ones.  They missed their deceased relatives. And they’re willing to believe what a con man says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s dishonest and Van Praagh doesn’t give a damn that he’s making all this up and toying with the audience’s emotions.  It’s all just a game for him — one in which he makes a lot of money off of his victims.&lt;/p&gt;

You all find the most delightful science geekery and I absolutely adore you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div style="TEXT-ALIGN:center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/jJvAL-iiLnQ%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x234900%26color2%3D0x4e9e00&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video 1: Delicious science geekery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I write this, I am on a plane attempting to return home from the Experimental Biology meeting in Anaheim. I had an absolutely lovely time. While I was there, I saw some delicious shoes...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="DISPLAY:block;MARGIN:0px auto 20px;TEXT-ALIGN:center" height="320" alt="orange shoes.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/orange%20shoes.jpg" width="319"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: How can your heart not be warmed by this guy's badass kicks? I saw him several times during the meeting, always in these sneakers. I kid you not, I was in love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...and I also had the profound honor of discreetly attending this year's David Bruce Awards ceremony. The David Bruce Awards really are the highlight of the meeting for me. While I certainly enjoyed talking science with my colleagues, it makes me so incredibly proud to see the work presented by these promising undergraduate scientists. I had the opportunity to look at many of the posters, talk with many of the students, and even meet some of their parents. I met a high school student who blew me away with a controlled feeding study she had done independently in rats. While I have still not worked out an agreement with the American Physiological Society to share their science with you, the Executive Director of the society, Dr. Martin Frank, was gracious enough to let me record the award ceremonies (Marty, notice that I called you "gracious" even though you called me "pushy." That's real PR skillz, brother physiologist). I wanted to share a few highlights with you so that you can see the incredible work we do here together. Watching them receive these awards, and then smile and beam with pride, really is one of the reasons I do what I do and I am grateful to you all for supporting this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video 2: The David Bruce Awardees.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, now on to shenanigans. When I travel to meetings, I very frequently travel with the head of my academic divison. He's a pretty hilarious dude with a robust knowledge of food and wine. So, the last several times we've traveled, we've sought out a place to have a nice dinner with a great bottle of wine. Having grown up in the City of Angels, I am pretty familiar with the area. One of my favorite places in Anaheim is a placed called The White House. There, I had my favorite Salmon Chocolat and we shared a bottle of 2006 Argyle Reserve Pinot Noir. Plus a vodka martini. Plus some after dinner drink I can't completely recall except to remember that it made my eyeballs burn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img style="DISPLAY:block;MARGIN:0px auto 20px;TEXT-ALIGN:center" height="298" alt="asleep.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/asleep.jpg" width="450"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: It seemed like a good idea at the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Ok, and maybe two Jamesons when we got back to the Marriott. But, really who's counting? I'm sure that's why, at midnight when the hotel bar was closing, it seemed like a tremendously good idea to seek out one more drink before bed. Luckily, I had my trusted iPhone with the Yelp application installed to help me locate every bar in a 2 mile radius that was open until 2 am.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fuck you, Steve Jobs. I blame this all on you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We ended up at a place on the Garden Walk called Bar Louie. And, what I mean when I say "ended up" is that we walked to the address my iPhone gave us. Then, when we couldn't find it, I used my iPhone to call the bar, get directions, and beg the bartender to hold one round of Jameson for us, even though they were in the middle of last call. Luckily they obliged or I might have been deprived of the opportunity to travel to the airport at 5 am this morning, still intoxicated. Again I say, "Fuck you, iPhone. You did this to me. If not for this technology, I might have gone to bed and gotten some sleep." We sat down at the bar at about 1:15 am and began chatting about science, and love, and life, and the next thing I knew it was 1:40 am the lights were embrightening. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, I mean really bright. It was as though the dudes at this place had somehow harnessed the power of the sun and found a way to shine it directly onto the alcohol center of my brain. That late night embrightening of the bar is more effective than confession at illuminating all of your shortcomings. Assholes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, as I rubbed my eyes and tried to refocus, I heard a loud, booming voice yell, "Get out of here, you fuckers. The place is closing. Everyone has to get the fuck out." I turned to find a gigantic, 6 foot tall, 300 pound, sweaty, tattooed, hairy Goliath of a man in a black shirt and beanie cap, stomping around and instilling fear into the hearts of all of the drunken patrons. Then he turned to place at the bar where I was sitting with my division head and yelled at him, "You, dude. Get the fuck out now."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, before I finish this story, I have to tell you something about myself that you may find hard to believe. I have very little internal editor sober. But, there's something about drinking hard alcohol that seems to suppress my ability to prevent the things that come into my mind from escaping my mouth. It is both a blessing, and a curse I tell you. I am also only about 5'4" if I stand up really tall and wear the Bump-Its. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, when this dude began to approach the bar, I turned to him, and outstretched my arms as if to say, "WTF, man?" And then I locked eyes with the beast. His jowl quivered and his eyes flashed momentarily red. I can't explain what happened next. It escaped my lips in a flash, before I could reign my own shit in. I found myself saying to this enormous mass of ass-kicking man, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dude, do you work here or are you just some loud-mouthed douche stomping around and acting like a total asshole? You're really pissing me off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;His eyes got wide. He stepped forward toward us and said, "Um, I'm the bouncer." To this I replied, "Well that's cool, but don't be a cockbisquit. We still have 12 minutes to finish our drinks." Thankfully, in response to this blatant act of defiance from all 5'4" me, he laughed. My further knowledge about his tattoos, the Adam Corrolla show, and having previously met the Maloofs from the Palms Casino in Vegas completely saved my ass. Another day, another near crisis avoided by the world famous Isis the Scientist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And while my division head thought my scrappiness was hilarious at the time, I'm just thankful it didn't get me punched in the nose. Getting punched in the nose is not hilarious. At least, I don't think it's hilarious. But, maybe when I am old tenured deadwood it would be a hilarious story to be able to tell. I can hear people at my retirement dinner saying, "Remember that time we were traveling with Isis and the bouncer punched her in the nose?" That has potential for future hilarity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, at least for today my nose remains intact.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/04/how_dr_isis_avoided_being_punc.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/IpOqidv4rU8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272603870543"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/?p=4718">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/de969b88e91a91d8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Miscellany"/><title type="html">Einstein Should Be Grateful He Didn’t Have Email</title><published>2010-04-29T20:50:26Z</published><updated>2010-04-29T20:50:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CosmicVarianceBlog/~3/lXAxtC-Ghjg/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/04/29/einstein-should-be-grateful-he-didnt-have-email/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m reading an interesting new book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bursts-Hidden-Pattern-Behind-Everything/dp/0525951601/"&gt;Bursts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi.  It’s just released today, but I scored an advance copy by virtue of sharing the same publisher.  The basic idea is simple: human behavior obeys power laws!  That is, things we occasionally do tend to be clustered together, rather than simply occurring with uniform probability.  I can’t vouch for either the truth or usefulness of the claims put forward in the book; we all know that &lt;a href="http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/491.html"&gt;power laws can be slippery things&lt;/a&gt;.  But the stories related along the way are pretty amusing.  (And there’s a very &lt;a href="http://brsts.com/"&gt;spiffy web page&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit that I jumped right to a chapter in the middle that relates the correspondence between Einstein and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Kaluza"&gt;Theodor Kaluza&lt;/a&gt; in the year 1919 and thereabouts.  Kaluza had just come up with the idea that electromagnetism could be unified with gravity by hypothesizing an extra dimension of space — a scenario now known as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza-Klein_theory"&gt;Kaluza-Klein theory&lt;/a&gt;, which underlies all the contemporary excitement about extra dimensions of space.  Many crackpots like to assert that our contemporary system of scientific publishing is overly ossified and hierarchical, and that a modern-day Einstein would never be appreciated; the truth is close to the opposite, as back in those days you really needed endorsement from someone established to get your papers published.  So Kaluza wrote to Einstein, who was originally enthusiastic about the idea, and they had a flurry of correspondence.  Eventually (as I now know) Einstein cooled on the idea, and Kaluza left physics to concentrate on pure mathematics.  A couple of years later, after getting nowhere with his own attempts to unify gravity and E&amp;amp;M, Einstein turned back to Kaluza’s approach, and wrote him again, offering to present his paper to the academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book’s interest is actually in the “burstiness” of the correspondence — a flurry of letters back and forth in 1919, then silence, then the conversation resumed in 1921.  I was struck by this paragraph, relating the growth of Einstein’s celebrity after the &lt;a href="http://www.simonsingh.net/1919_Eclipse.html"&gt;eclipse expedition of 1919&lt;/a&gt; provided evidence supporting general relativity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Einstein's] sudden fame had drastic consequences for his correspondence.  In 1919, he received 252 letters and wrote 239, his life still in its subcritical phase, allowing him to reply to most letters with little delay.  The next year he wrote many more letters than in any previous year.  To the flood of 519 he received, we have record of his having managed to respond to 331 of them, a pace, though formidable, insufficient to keeping on top of his vast correspondence.  By 1920 Einstein had moved into the supercritical regime, and he never recovered.  The peak came in 1953, two years before his death, when he received 832 letters and responded to 476 of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine what Einstein would have faced in the email era?  One thing is for sure:  he was a champion correspondent.  He composed approximately 14,500 letters, more than one per day over the course of his adult life.&lt;/p&gt;

A couple days ago I went to Cambridge, Mass. to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The occasion was a &lt;a href="http://www.getconference.org"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; called “Genome, Environments, and Traits,” or GET for short. The history of the meeting is in the upper ranks of my list of meetings with strange histories. In 2006, the Harvard geneticist George Church (arguably the smartest, most influential biologist you never heard of) decided to launch a new kind of human genome project. At the time, scientists had only published the sequence of a single human genome, at a cost of $3 billion. And for all that money, the genome was actually a gap-riddled patchwork from several individuals, and only included the DNA from one copy of each pair of chromosomes. Church declared that he would gather the sequenced genomes of 100,000 individuals, along with information about their health, and make all that information available for scientists to study in order to learn more about human biology. Church issued a manifesto of sorts in &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, called “Genomes for All,” which you can read &lt;a href="http://arep.med.harvard.edu/pdf/Church05s.pdf"&gt;here (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; and also talked to Emily Singer of &lt;em&gt;Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/BioTech-Therapeutics/wtr_16169,259,p1.html?a=f"&gt; here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.getconference.org/GET2010/images/George-Church.jpg" alt="" width="109" height="124"&gt;To kick off his Personal Genome Project, Church sequenced his own DNA, put it online, and promptly got a message from a doctor on the other side of the country, informing him that he should adjust his cholersterol medication. Church also persuaded &lt;a href="http://www.personalgenomes.org/pgp10.html"&gt;nine other people&lt;/a&gt; to volunteer to have their genomes sequenced and laid out online for all to see. One of those first ten, the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, helped spread the word with &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/11/magazine/11Genome-t.html"&gt;this article that  in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times Magazine&lt;/em&gt; in 2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those early sequencees got together from time to time to talk about the project and their own experiences contending with having a genome available for all to see. This genomic club was an intimate one at first, but its membership is now exploding. With each passing month, the cost of genome sequencing is crashing, companies are gearing up to sequence genomes on a commerical scale, and scientists are starting to think seriously about looking at complete genomes as a regular part of clinical practice. For this year’s meeting, Church decided to try to get as many people with sequenced genomes as possible altogether in one room. It would probably be the last time such an exercise would be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.getconference.org/GET2010/images/Robert-Krulwich.jpg" alt="" width="109" height="124"&gt;I got pulled into the fun when my phone rang a couple months ago. On the line was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Krulwich"&gt;Robert Krulwich&lt;/a&gt;. Krulwich is the co-host of the show Radiolab, covers science for NPR and ABC News, and is also the go-to guy for live–and lively–interviews with towering figures of science. (&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/6722418"&gt;Observe&lt;/a&gt; him handle both E.O. Wilson and James Watson at once–a bit like juggling torches while riding a unicycle. He doesn’t break a sweat.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church had asked Krulwich to come to the meeting and moderate a discussion of &lt;a href="http://www.getconference.org/GET2010/speakers.html"&gt;a dozen or so sequencees&lt;/a&gt; that would take up the first three hours of the meeting. Krulwich decided this was a two-person operation. Wise move. This was heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be absurd to have everyone one the stage the whole time, so we came up with a scheme to move people quickly from the front row of the audience to the stage, playing a genomic game of musical chairs. Making it even more challenging was the fact that we had such big subjects to talk about, from the development of next-generation sequencing to the application of genomics to genealogy to the issues of privacy that genome sequencing raises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.getconference.org/GET2010/images/Henry-Louis-Gates.jpg" alt="" width="109" height="124"&gt;And then there was the matter of the line-up. Any one of the speakers could have held the stage on his or her own for an hour. It felt very strange whisking Henry Louis Gates onto the stage and then whisking him off. This, after all, is a guy who can hold an &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/facesofamerica/"&gt;entire TV series&lt;/a&gt; together. At the meeting, he talked about getting his father’s genome sequenced as well as his own–becoming the first father-son team to do so. A comparison of the two genomes allowed him to see fifty percent of the genome of his deceased mother–an experience that felt like seeing her come back to life. Gates talked about the experience of seeing so much European DNA in his genome. If you look at my lab results, he said, I’m a white man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–Well, we’d love to hear all about it, Professor Gates, but we’ve got to move on! A round of applause everyone, and let’s move those chairs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krulwich and I also struggled with the challenge of talking about genomics with people who are so uniformly gung-ho about it that they’ve had their genomes sequenced–and of talking to those sequencees in front of an audience made up of genome scientists, people from the biotech sector, venture capital folks, and other assorted people who are, shall we say, already in the genomic tank. Neither Krulwich or I received a fee for our involvement in the meeting, and we were not about to join the ranks &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=33w3XnI0QNM"&gt;those miserable fake journalists you see on infomercials late at night&lt;/a&gt;, pitching pre-scripted softballs like, “So tell me again how your company is going to become a raging success in the personal genome business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krulwich and I therefore tried, politely, to nudge the sequencees out of their comfort zone. How on Earth, I wondered, could the sophisticated analysis of genomes become a regular part of everyday medicine when most doctors have office full of old paper records? Was it fair to children to get their genomes sequences when there was nothing immediately wrong with them? What good is getting your genome sequenced if all you get is a laundry list of genetic variations that have obscure relationships to all sorts of diseases that you may or may not get? How can there be a business in genomes if, as Church predicts, the cost of genome sequencing will be dropping to, essentially, free?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, questioners and answerers ended up talking past each other. Krulwich asked James Watson what he thought about the ethical concerns about genome sequencing. His answer: “Crap.” The other sequencees were more polite when we asked questions that seemed irrelevant to them. When Krulwich asked sequencee Esther Dyson about the potential risks of getting her genome sequenced, Novocell CEO John West pointed out that she was preparing to go to the Space Station. Why were we obsessing about the risks of Dyson’s genome, with no apparent concern that she was about to have herself shot into space on the tip of a rocket?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the best answers were deconstructions. Consider this: Widespread genome sequencing will make it possible to test babies for &lt;a href="http://carlzimmer.com/articles/2008.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1221839513&amp;amp;archive=&amp;amp;start_from=&amp;amp;ucat=11&amp;amp;"&gt;genes associated with intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. Isn’t that a horrible thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, Church pointed out that we already test for intelligence genes, and nobody gets outraged at all. Babies are routinely tested for a genetic disorder known as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;PKU&lt;/a&gt;, in which children are born unable to break down an amino acid called phenylalanine. Phenylalanine builds up to toxic levels in the body, leading to mental retardation. But the mutation that causes PKU does not &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; cause PKU. Genes are not destiny. If children keep a diet low in phenylaline, they end up with normal intelligence. Knowledge of our genome is not sinister in this case. Ignoring the facts of PKU would be the sinister thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church is right, but the story of PKU only carries you so far into the future of genomic medicine. PKU is a rare disorder, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=hsnihcdc&amp;amp;part=A20932#A20940"&gt;affecting&lt;/a&gt; an estimated 1 child out of every 13,500 to 19,000 births. It’s also unusual in that it’s caused by the failure of a single enzyme. A single mutation to a single gene is enough to cause it. And the fact that it can be so readily treated is also unusual. Cystic fibrosis, for example, is another single-gene disease. Despite the discovery of its genetic basis 20 years ago, doctors have &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/324/5934/1504"&gt;no cure&lt;/a&gt; to offer CF patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genetic roots of common disorders, like high blood pressure and Alzheimer’s disease, have &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/204328"&gt;proven&lt;/a&gt; to be a lot more complex. It’s possible that the risk for some common diseases may be the result of variations on hundreds of genes, with each variation contributing a tiny fraction of the risk, and different combinations able to cause just as much of the disease. It’s also possible that the risk for some diseases is due to very rare mutations, each of which has very strong effects. There may be a lot of these rare mutations in the world’s population, making it hard to find them all and figure out what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.getconference.org/GET2010/images/James-Lupski.jpg" alt="" width="109" height="124"&gt;The sequencees at GET didn’t avoid this messy reality. In fact, one of them embodied it. James Lupski, a Baylor College of Medicine geneticist, suffers from a hereditary disease called &lt;a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/charcot_marie_tooth/detail_charcot_marie_tooth.htm"&gt;Charcot Marie Tooth Disease&lt;/a&gt;, in which the coating of the long nerves in the limbs starts to fray. He has had to have operation after operation on his feet to treat the symptoms. Lupski studies the cause of the disease, and &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/362/13/1181"&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt; he had his genome sequenced to find its source. He turned out to have some mutations that have been linked to Charcot Marie Tooth Disease before, but he and his colleagues also found a new gene, with a different mutation in his mother’s and father’s copy. The discovery did not point immediately to a cure; instead, it added to the complexity of the disease. Lupski explained his own disease and his difficult research on it in unsentimental detail. Science is hard, Lupski said, and anybody who thinks it isn’t is fooling themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.getconference.org/GET2010/images/Stephen-Quake.jpg" alt="" width="109" height="124"&gt;It was too bad that the meeting didn’t take place next week instead of this week. Today, the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; published a genome &lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)60452-7/abstract"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that included among its co-authors two of the sequencees we spoke with: George Church and Steven Quake of Stanford. At the meeting, Quake explained how he and his colleagues had sequenced his genome last year in a matter of days. That was the easy part, he said. The hard part was analyzing it and interpreting what it meant for Quake’s health. He was referring obliquely to the new paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the paper, Quake, Church, and their colleagues made a close study of Quake’s family (who have suffered from various sorts of heart disease), and then scoured the scientific literature for every mention of the variants they found in Quake’s genome. They considered the risks these variants posed to Quake for various conditions, but they also took into consideration other sorts of complexity. For example, diseases don’t happen in isolation from each other. If you get obese, for example, you increase your risk of type 2 diabetes. The scientists published a marvelous diagram of the diseases they studied in Quake, with the size of each name corresponding to the size of his risk for each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/04/quake-circle600.png"&gt;&lt;img title="quake circle600" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/04/quake-circle600.png" alt="quake circle600" width="600" height="579"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geneticist Daniel Macarthur &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/04/what_can_you_learn_from_a_whol.php"&gt;wrote tonight&lt;/a&gt; about this new paper on his blog Genetic Future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;…there are the variants that simply can’t be interpreted. This includes virtually everything seen outside protein-coding regions, and the majority of even those variants found inside coding regions. We simply don’t understand the biology of most genes well enough yet to be able to predict with confidence whether a novel variant will have a major impact on how that gene operates; and we have an even less complete picture of how genes work together to affect the risk of disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Lupski said, science is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wiped out by the end of the morning session. I thought we did a pretty good job, although I still felt ambivalent. I scarfed some lunch and then happily settled into the audience for the afternoon. Most of the talks I heard dealt not with humans but with microbes. The genome of a microbe like &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; is about a thousandth the size of a human genome. As a result, microbiologists can sequence genomes like mad without busting their budgets. Ian Lipkin of Columbia has hunted for the causes of new outbreaks, such as colony collapse disorder in bees, by fishing out new kinds of microbial DNA from sick hosts. Boom, boom, boom, one slide after another documented the discovery of yet another pathogen. The benefits of DNA sequencing were blindingly obvious in Lipkin’s talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even microbes turn out to have fantastic genomic complexity. There may not be a lot of genes in each microbe, but together they can hold a staggering amount of genetic diversity. Rob Knight of the University of Colorado spoke about the surveys he and his colleagues have made of the human microbiome. He described some of the work I’ve &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2010/03/04/i-for-one-welcome-our-microbial-overlords/"&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2010/02/03/your-inner-amazon/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on the Loom, along with other results. He described, for example, how children become coated with the bacteria that live in their mother’s birth canal as they are born. Women who have a caesarian section give their children the bacteria living on their own skin. Knight is investigating whether the birth canal germs provide any special protection to children. Different people develop different menageries of microbes as they get older, and their experiences–from gaining weight to taking antibiotics–can shift the ecosystem inside their bodies. There’s much left to discover about the thousands of species that share our bodies with us, but Knight raised the prospect of a different kind of personalized medicine: using genomics to survey the microbes in our bodies and then manipulating them for our own benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, maybe you shouldn’t trust me on this score. Everyone knows I’m in the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMicrocosm-coli-New-Science-Life%2Fdp%2F037542430X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1190687076%26sr%3D8-1&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325"&gt;microbial tank&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day ended with a talk by Anne West, the 17-year-old daughter of John West. The &lt;em&gt;Times of London&lt;/em&gt; recently broke &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/genetics/article7100159.ece"&gt;the story&lt;/a&gt; of how the Wests became the first healthy family to get their genome sequenced. I expected warm and fuzzy blather about what her genome meant to her, but instead, she delivered a hard-core talk that would have fit right into a genetics conference. She analyzed one of her genes involved in blood clotting and determined that she had a few harmless mutations from her mother and one harmful one from her father. Facing an audience full of past and future Nobel-prize winners, biotech barons, and other intimidating grown-ups, she remained impressively poised and calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience was rightly impressed. One scientist joked that she should drop out of 11th grade and get a job–finishing school would be a waste of her time. But I also had to remind myself of the hothouse atmosphere in which she had done this work, and in which she was delivering her results. Her father had spent upwards of $200,000 on the family’s genomes, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. This was not your standard science fair project. And as West spoke, I thought about the kids from a local public high school who had come for the morning session. When Krulwich and I asked the audience for questions, a girl stood up and asked how she could get her mother to have their family’s genomes sequenced, when her mother wasn’t even sure what a gene is. Two girls: two very different experiences with genomes. It’s not all about the DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Passengers on a train that was passing through the area said a big white cloud of smoke came right at them, choking them and burning their eyes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etc.  It seems to&amp;#39;ve been an electrical fire at Downtown Crossing around 22 o&amp;#39;clock, which tallies with the time the Green Line train I was on pulled into Park Street to the wailing of fire alarms.  A couple hundred people, by my guesstimate, ended up milling around that corner of the Boston Common, watching the smoke billow up from the T entrance across the street and wondering what to do next.  (Lots of flashing lights — maybe have a party?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, the status displays at Lechmere were calling it a "power failure".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All kidding aside:  even if nobody ended up seriously injured, I can only imagine the poor preparedness which this kind of incident could reveal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScienceAfterSunclipse/~4/Rfv0ro2yIxU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/index.xml</id><title type="html">Science After Sunclipse</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272596778467"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Marmorkrebs/~3/0BoVqSOxEI8/celebrate-diversity-parthenogensis-in.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3ca6ca8c0fc15893</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Celebrate diversity: Parthenogenesis in white tipped bamboo shark</title><published>2010-04-29T22:31:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-29T22:31:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/tVyHPHzBNx8/celebrate-diversity-parthenogensis-in.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Marmorkrebs/~3/0BoVqSOxEI8/celebrate-diversity-parthenogensis-in.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">&lt;span style="float:left;padding:10px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0pt none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A few years ago, a bonnethead shark made the news because one had given birth. Giving birth is not unusual for sharks... except that the female in question had grown up in isolation. Good evidence for parthenogenesis. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Shortly after that, another shark species (blacktip) was autopsied and found to have an embryo that was genetically identical to the mother. Clearly, parthenogenesis in sharks was not happenstance. But in both cases, the parthenogenetic offspring didn’t live long. Are the offspring able to make it to adulthood?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/S9o4V2amfpI/AAAAAAAADD4/kGygx5WPcbE/s1600/Chiloscyllium_plagiosum.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="232" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/S9o4V2amfpI/AAAAAAAADD4/kGygx5WPcbE/s320/Chiloscyllium_plagiosum.jpg" width="320"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A new paper examined this in white spotted bamboo shark (&lt;i&gt;Chiloscyllium plagiosum&lt;/i&gt;). It came to an aquarium as a juvenile, and kept laying eggs that were discarded as nonviable... until word got out about the bonnethead shark, and one of the savvy keepers decided to start keeping the cases. Out of seven eggs, four hatched. One died young, one “committed suicide” (jumped out of the tank), and the other two grew up to be find, upstanding bamboo shark ladies.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
DNA testing confirmed that the offspring had the same genetic make-up as the mother. &lt;i&gt;Definitely&lt;/i&gt; parthenogenesis going on here.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Feldheim and colleagues also note that the bamboo sharks they tested in aquaria seemed to be quite inbred. They seem to be hinting that this inbreeding may be facilitating parthenogenetic reproduction. With so few individuals to work with at this point, it’s too early to tell.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/S9o3tcgKnvI/AAAAAAAADDw/oh0wdy3M7vE/s1600/Chiloscyllium_plagiosum_eggs.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/S9o3tcgKnvI/AAAAAAAADDw/oh0wdy3M7vE/s320/Chiloscyllium_plagiosum_eggs.jpg" width="320"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What is particularly cool and exciting about this finding is not just the evidence that these shark clones are perfectly viable and can live to adulthood, but this particular species is in a completely different &lt;b&gt;order&lt;/b&gt; of sharks compared to the previous two species. That means the capability is either very widespread, or has evolved multiple times. Either way, the ecological and evolutionary importance of parthenogenesis in this group is larger than expected.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the Indian military is studying him because, obviously, soldiers who don&amp;#39;t need to be provisioned would be rather useful…which assumes that this nonsense is even worth studying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two cameras have been set up in his room, while a mobile camera films him when he goes outside, guaranteeing round-the-clock observation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
His body will be scanned and his brain and heart activity measured with electrodes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"The observation from this study may throw light on human survival without food and water," said Dr G. Ilavazahagan, who is directing the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That short description already tells me they're going at this all wrong. He &lt;i&gt;goes outside&lt;/i&gt;? Where? How secure is this test?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they're plugging him into electrodes and recording EMGs and EEGs? &lt;i&gt;Why?&lt;/i&gt; That's not interesting at all. The interesting claim is the idea that he doesn't eat or drink. Those don't test that in the slightest, but do lend a pseudo-sciencey air to the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They claim he has been observed closely for a week, and hasn't ingested or excreted anything at all. I don't believe it. I suspect that there have been some very sloppy procedures going on, or that the guy has an accomplice or assistant, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they really need is a James Randi. If I were in charge, I&amp;#39;d give the yogi a very nice single room with books and a meditation mat and whatever non-edible, non-drinkable luxury items he wanted…and I&amp;#39;d put him in there for four weeks, monitored by video cameras, and &lt;i&gt;lock the door&lt;/i&gt;.

You might look on this sort of outcome as a much faster burn through the normal process of immune system use and degeneration with age, and it has consequences in terms of health and life expectancy. For example: Study links liver transplantation to accelerated cellular aging The University of Cambridge research team investigated whether the chronic immune stress of liver disease and organ transplantation accelerates aging of the immune system, which in turn contributes to excess morbidity and mortality in established liver graft recipients. Study leader Dr. Graeme Alexander explains, "There is a marked increase in the prevalence of cardiac disease, malignancy, cerebrovascular disease and infections in patients with established liver grafts, affecting a majority of cases eventually and which in the past have been attributed to agents used to suppress immune responses. However, an alternative (and not exclusive) hypothesis is that liver transplant recipients develop premature immune senescence which is also associated with these same pathologies, perhaps consequent to chronic [immune system activation]."

of bad math. One of Orac's big interest is vaccination and
anti-vaccinationists. The piece is &lt;a href="http://www.soundchoice.org/Images/SCPINewsletter_April_2010.pdf"&gt;a newsletter&lt;/a&gt; by a group calling itself the "Sound Choice
Pharmaceutical Institute" (SCPI), which purports to show a link
between vaccinations and autism. But instead of the usual anti-vac rubbish about
thimerosol,  they claim that "residual human DNA contamintants from aborted human fetal cells" 
causes autism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Among others, Orac &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/when_right_wing_nuts_try_to_do_science.php#more"&gt;already covered the nonsense&lt;/a&gt;
of that from a biological/medical
perspective. What he didn't do, and why he forwarded this newsletter to me, is because
the basis of their argument is that they discovered key change points in the 
autism rate that correlate perfectly with the introduction of various vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In fact, they claim to have discovered three different inflection points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; 1979, the year that the MMR 2 vaccine was approved in the US;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; 1988, the year that a 2nd dose of the MMR 2 was added to the recommended vaccination
  schedule; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; 1995, the year that the chickenpox vaccine was approved in the US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; They claim to have discovered these inflection points using "iterative hockey stick analysis".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2010/04/iterative_hockey_stick_analysi.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2010/04/iterative_hockey_stick_analysi.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/z99vSXVp50g" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272590324206"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=5270">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6a044ae29cfef81e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Autistic child belted to chair at school</title><published>2010-04-29T23:54:33Z</published><updated>2010-04-29T23:54:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/rFrh17kENNI/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Left Brain/Right Brain</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272589849902"><id gr:original-id="http://sciblogs.co.nz/skepticon/2010/04/30/i-know-what-i-mean-but-only-see-how-you-act/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e3678e34fdd76418</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">I Know What I Mean but Only See How You Act</title><published>2010-04-29T18:09:55Z</published><updated>2010-04-29T18:09:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/oVK8IP9YWfM/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://sciblogs.co.nz/skepticon/2010/04/30/i-know-what-i-mean-but-only-see-how-you-act/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">When I’m writing one of these posts it is difficult to edit them in such a way as to convey my meaning clearly to those without the background I share.

The balloon dragged the payload across the ground, destroying it, and in the meantime not doing any good to an SUV parked nearby:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/ieyD1FfQOIg%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0xe1600f%26color2%3D0xfebd01%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=580&amp;amp;height=360" width="580" height="360"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happened yesterday, in Australia. No one was hurt, but the payload apparently was totaled. It looks to me that the balloon got caught by some wind before they were quite ready to launch, and it pulled the payload off the crane. Seeing what it did to that SUV… yikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balloon was carrying gamma-ray detectors as a testbed for a future NASA observatory. Gamma rays don’t penetrate the Earth’s atmosphere, so observatories have to be launched into space. The detectors on-board can be tested on the ground, but at some point need to get up above as much of the atmosphere as possible to see how they do in those conditions and observing actual astronomical sources. Balloons are the easiest and cheapest way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some folks who have done balloon launches like this, and they’ve told me it can be a little hairy. I trusted them, but until I saw that payload smash into and flip over that truck, I didn’t fully realize what they meant. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a setback for NASA and the team building the observatory. I don’t know how much, exactly, but I’m sure it will be months or even years to rebuild this. I can’t imagine much will be salvaged off this disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I saw this earlier today, but no video was available to embed. So thanks to &lt;a href="http://tomsastroblog.com/?p=5768"&gt;Tom’s Astronomy blog&lt;/a&gt; where I saw this, and &lt;a href="http://news.discovery.com/space/giant-nasa-balloon-crashes-destroys-telescope.html"&gt;Discovery News&lt;/a&gt; where I first heard about it. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are very few scientifically literate, evidence-based and openly secular MPs in parliament. Dr Evan Harris has been the LibDem MP for Oxford West and Abingdon since May 1997 and is standing again at this election. I've never voted LibDem but I do support him for his work on scientific research, medicine, free speech, equality and secularism. He backed Simon Singh in his libel case and has actively supported Skeptics in the Pub, a group I belong to - most recently in our 1023 homeopathy campaign. He is the LibDem spokesman for science and serves on Parliament's Human Rights Select Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what’s disturbing.  Someone claimed just that.  Some &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8644637.stm"&gt;women fell for it&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Nissim Aharon, a former employee at the Israeli defence ministry, was convicted of rape, sodomy, indecent acts and aggravated fraudulent acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women paid him large sums of money, believing he was a holy rabbi who could heal body and soul, the court said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would claim to be a rabbi, and impersonate figures in authority who would then refer women and teenage girls to himself, the ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“He would give these people different explanations: among others, that a holy scent comes from him, and that his semen is a holy fluid, which by contact could heal body and soul,” the statement said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would also claim that his “holiness” could be passed to those who touched him physically, cleansing their bodies, it said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least Aharon is going to jail now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder how they caught him… did a woman finally realize the semen-bandage wasn’t working and decide to tell officials?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is no different from how the rapists in the Catholic Church operate. They gain your trust, manipulate you, and then take advantage of you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to ask how these women could’ve fallen for such an obvious lie, but when you’re convinced the person you’re with is not just trustworthy but powerful and connected to god, you’re more likely to believe what they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Recently, one of our posts caused quite a stir by misusing the phrase (to mean “raises the question”), and many discussions ensued, the result of which was that we all realized that even though we (kind of) understand the phrase in the Latin, we really don’t understand, etymologically, the English translation—either “begs the question” or “petitions for the principle,” though the latter makes more sense. And we all wondered whether the Latin was used only in the context of formalized debate  or argument. It seems like a fairly complex concept, with a complex definition—it makes me wonder why we use or misuse it at all, since the need to use it in everyday speech (or blogging) would seem not very great.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(FWIW, the offending post was apparently &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2010/04/there-was-a-moocow-coming-down-along-the-road.html"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, with the original &amp;quot;this begs questions like …&amp;quot; quickly amended to &amp;quot;this raises questions like…&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four related issues here. First, how  did "begging the question" come to be a technical term for (a certain kind of) circular reasoning? Second, do people  really need a way to talk about circular reasoning, anyway? Third, why did "begging the question" get re-purposed in common usage to mean  "dodging the question" or "raising the question", rather than simply subsiding, along with the rest of the terminology of medieval logic, into the midden heap of obsolete  idioms? And fourth, should you go with the flow and use "beg the question" to mean "raise the question", or should you fight for the traditional usage, or what? I'll take up these issues one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;/strong&gt;The history of &amp;quot;beg the question&amp;quot; — a cavalcade of misleading translations — starts with Aristotle&amp;#39;s  straightforward presentation of a simple idea. In &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Sophistical_Refutations"&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Sophistical Refutations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he specified thirteen fallacies, one of which (in the &lt;a href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/sophistical/"&gt;translation by W.A. Pickard-Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;) is "assuming the original conclusion". This amounts to arguing that "P, therefore P"; and Aristotle gives various simple examples of how such arguments can be disguised so as to appear persuasive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some subtle  logical and epistemological questions lurking in the background here, but the basic idea is not exactly deep or difficult. So how did Aristotle's simple "assuming the conclusion" turn into the opaque phrase "begging the question"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wrong turns started with the translation from Greek to Latin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to  Scott Gregory Schreiber, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=AICfsOKXhJIC"&gt;Aristotle on false reasoning&lt;/a&gt;, SUNY Press, 2003 (p. 214)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;Aristotle uses as labels for this fallacy τὸ ἐν ἀρχῇ αἰτεῖσθαι and  τὸ ἐν ἀρχῇ λαμβάνειν. Literally these would be rendered as "asking the original point" and "assuming the original point." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liddell and Scott gloss &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dai%29te%2Fw"&gt;αἰτ-έω&lt;/a&gt; as "A. 1. &lt;em&gt;ask, beg&lt;/em&gt;; 2. &lt;em&gt;ask for, demand&lt;/em&gt;; 3. &lt;em&gt;ask one to do&lt;/em&gt;; 4. &lt;em&gt;beg of&lt;/em&gt;; 5. in Logic, &lt;em&gt;postulate, assume&lt;/em&gt;", suggesting that "postulating" might be a better translation than "asking". And for &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlamba%2Fnw"&gt;λαμβάνω&lt;/a&gt; they have "I. &lt;em&gt;take&lt;/em&gt;, 1. &lt;em&gt;take hold of, grasp, seize&lt;/em&gt;; … II. &lt;em&gt;receive&lt;/em&gt;, 1. &lt;em&gt;have given one&lt;/em&gt;", which in Aristotle's use seems to be like the English &lt;em&gt;take&lt;/em&gt; of &amp;quot;I take it that …&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in both forms of the phrase, Aristotle was talking about arguments that assume or postulate the original point to be proved,  in some indirect or disguised form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some medieval translator (does anyone know who?) decided to translate Aristotle's "assuming the conclusion"  into &lt;em&gt;petitio principii&lt;/em&gt;.  In classical Latin, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry=petitio"&gt;petitio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; meant "an attack, a blow; a requesting, beseeching; a request, petition". But in post-classical Latin &lt;em&gt;petitio&lt;/em&gt; was also used to mean "a postulate", in the logical sense of "a fundamental principle to be used as a basis for reasoning", and in particular, it was used as a translation of Aristotle's αἰτεσθαι, to mean something like "postulating". And &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=principium&amp;amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059"&gt;principium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; meant &amp;quot;a beginning, commencement, origin&amp;quot; — here translating Aristotle&amp;#39;s ἐν ἀρχῇ, and means something like &amp;quot;the start of the argument&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;the original point&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 14th century onwards, many writers in English  used the Latin term to discuss this rhetorical technique, which remained a very simple and straightforward idea behind its Latin label. Thus Sir Thomas Browne, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kSjH4tiEhGUC&amp;amp;dq=%22petitio%20principii%22&amp;amp;lr&amp;amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;amp;as_miny_is=1500&amp;amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;amp;as_maxy_is=1750&amp;amp;as_brr=3&amp;amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22petitio%20principii%22&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;Pseudodoxia epidemica&lt;/a&gt; (1658):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Other waies there are of deceit, which consist not in false apprehension of words, that is, verbal expressions of sentential significations, but fraudulent deductions, or inconsequent illations, from a false conception of things. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The first is &lt;em&gt;Petitio principii&lt;/em&gt;. Which fallacie is commited, when a question is made a medium, or we assume a medium as granted, whereof we remain as unsatisfied as of the question. Briefly, where that is assumed as a principle, to prove another thing, which is not conceded as true it self.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or from T. H. Green's General Introduction to Vol. I of Hume's &lt;em&gt;Treatise of Human Nature:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;68. The relation of cause and effect, according to Locke&amp;#39;s general statement as to relation, must be something &amp;#39;not contained in the real existence of things, but extraneous and superinduced.&amp;#39;  […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Thus not only does the &lt;em&gt;datum&lt;/em&gt; of the process of 'invention' in question, i.e. the observation of change in a thing, involved a derived idea, but a derived idea which presupposes just this process of invention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Here again it is necessary to guard against the notion that Locke's obvious &lt;em&gt;petitio principii&lt;/em&gt; might be avoided by a better statement without essential change in his doctrine of ideas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But starting  in the late 16th century, the English phrase "to beg the question" began to sneak into use as an vulgar alternative to &lt;em&gt;petitio principii&lt;/em&gt;. The OED's citation list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1581&lt;/strong&gt; W. CLARKE in &lt;em&gt;Confer.&lt;/em&gt; IV. (1584) Ffiij, I say this is still to begge the question. &lt;strong&gt;1687&lt;/strong&gt; SETTLE &lt;em&gt;Refl. Dryden &lt;/em&gt;13 Here hee's at his old way of Begging the meaning. &lt;strong&gt;1680&lt;/strong&gt; BURNET &lt;em&gt;Rochester &lt;/em&gt;(1692) 82 This was to assert or beg the thing in Question. &lt;strong&gt;1788&lt;/strong&gt; REID &lt;em&gt;Aristotle's Log.&lt;/em&gt; v. §3. 118 Begging the question is when the thing to be proved is assumed in the premises. &lt;strong&gt;1852&lt;/strong&gt; ROGERS &lt;em&gt;Ecl. Faith&lt;/em&gt; 251 Many say it is begging the point in dispute. &lt;strong&gt;1870&lt;/strong&gt; BOWEN &lt;em&gt;Logic&lt;/em&gt; ix. 294 The vulgar equivalent for petitio principii is begging the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;begging &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;the question? Well, &lt;em&gt;petitio&lt;/em&gt; (from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry=peto"&gt;peto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) in this context means "assuming" or "postulating", but it has other (and older) meanings, from which the notion of logical postulate or assumption arose: "requesting, beseeching". So rather than use some fancy Latinate term like &lt;em&gt;postulate&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;assume&lt;/em&gt;, people decided to use the plain English word &lt;em&gt;beg[ging]&lt;/em&gt; as a sort of calque for the "requesting" sense of &lt;em&gt;petitio&lt;/em&gt;.   But even in the 16th century, I think, it was a bit odd to warn people against presupposing the end-point of their argument by telling them not to &lt;em&gt;beg&lt;/em&gt; their conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why begging the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;? The OED's first glosses for &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt; are "A point or topic to be investigated or discussed; a problem, or a matter forming the basis of a problem", and "A subject or proposal to be debated, decided, or voted on in a meeting or deliberative assembly". With these meanings, &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt; more or less fits into Aristotle&amp;#39;s warning — it&amp;#39;s wrong to &amp;quot;assume the question&amp;quot;, i.e. to make an argument that presupposes (our conclusion about) the proposal to be decided. But these days, the word &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt; is much more likely to mean "A sentence worded or expressed so as to elicit information from a person; a query, an enquiry." And in this sense, warning someone not to assume the question either means something quite different (say, not to jump to conclusions about what is being asked), or else it makes no sense at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;/strong&gt;OK, "begging the the question" is a piss-poor way to say "assuming the conclusion"; But  should we continue to care enough about circular arguments to have a shorthand way to refer to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, an aside: circular arguments are not necessarily false arguments. The proposition "A → A" is always true, though not very interesting. And a proposition like "A → B → C → A" may be a perfectly valid and useful argument, for example as a way to show that A, B, and C are all equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So "assuming the conclusion" is not a fallacy in the sense that the form of argument involved is invalid. The cases that are condemned as &lt;em&gt;petitio principii &lt;/em&gt; pretend to reason from accepted premises to a novel conclusion, while actually smuggling a disguised form of the conclusion into the argument's assumptions. Does this actually happen in real life, as opposed to mathematical logic or formal debating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, people certainly think it does. Here's &lt;a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/austrian-followup/"&gt;Paul Krugman&lt;/a&gt;, a couple of weeks ago, writing about "assuming the conclusion":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;As predicted, many of the comments to my &lt;a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/martin-and-the-austrians/"&gt;Austrian economics post&lt;/a&gt; are of the form “Well, of course employment rises when investment is expanding, and falls when the investment is falling — in the first case the economy is booming while in the second it’s slumping.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;As I tried to explain, however, that’s assuming the conclusion; there’s no “of course” about it. Why do periods when the economy is investing more correspond to booms, while periods when it’s investing less correspond to slumps? That’s easy to understand in Keynesian terms — but the whole Austrian claim is that they’re an alternative to Keynesianism. Yet I have never seen a clear explanation of this central point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the phrase "&lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&amp;amp;pz=1&amp;amp;cf=all&amp;amp;ned=us&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22circular+argument%22"&gt;circular argument&lt;/a&gt;" is fairly common in the news, e.g. in this piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I’ve come to call this thoroughly circular argument for Easter’s significance the “Presence Principle.” It implies, in a way that my intellect resists but my heart is willing to entertain, that the terrific annual to-do involving lilies, hymns and dexterous rabbits is, just by virtue of its continued existence, not an absurd, unwarranted phenomenon. A celebration, by my old priest’s reasoning, means that its celebrants must have something to celebrate, and the bigger the celebration, the bigger the something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By a similar form of logic, the concept of a circular argument must be worth writing about, since people often write about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Of course, it's tricky to reconstruct any natural-language argument in fully explicit logical terms, and even trickier to do so in a way that validates an accusation of circularity. But that doesn't stop people from wanting to make the claim.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;/strong&gt; Even if "assuming the conclusion" is something that people often want to say, "begging the question" is such a confusing way to say it that only a few pedants understand the phrase in this sense any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that this is true by looking at how the phrase is used, even in well-edited sources. For example, if we search the NYT index for &lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=%22beg+the+question%22&amp;amp;d=&amp;amp;o=&amp;amp;v=&amp;amp;c=&amp;amp;n=10&amp;amp;dp=0&amp;amp;daterange=full&amp;amp;sort=newest"&gt;recent uses of "beg the question"&lt;/a&gt;, we find that out of the first 20 hits, 15 use &amp;quot;beg the question&amp;quot; to mean &amp;quot;raise the question&amp;quot; — and of the five that don&amp;#39;t, four are usage articles berating people for misusing the phrase!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning to the broader and more erratically edited range of material indexed by Google News, a check of the first 50 of the 127 current hits for &amp;quot;beg the question&amp;quot; turns up 49 instances meaning &amp;quot;raise the question&amp;quot; — and one lonely usage column (June Casagrande, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.kilgorenewsherald.com/news/2010-04-10/Lifestyles/A_Word_Please.html"&gt;A Word Please&lt;/a&gt;", Kilgore New Herald 4/10/2010), which makes this amazing assertion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;But for me, all this raises a more important question. You see, for all the people I’ve heard bemoaning others’ misuse of “beg the question,” I’ve never actually heard someone misuse it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;So all the friends who told me I should do a column on “begs the question” because the term is so widely misused — well, it looks like those people were begging the beg-the-question question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, however, using "beg the question" to mean "raise the question" is only one notch less weird than using it to mean "assume the conclusions". We don't use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;beg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in other contexts with this meaning: "??I'd like to beg the topic of what to have for dinner". So why isn't "begging the question" languishing on a dusty shelf of lexicographical off-site storage,  along with other renaissance translations of medieval latin rhetorical terminology like "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent"&gt;affirming the consequent&lt;/a&gt;" (which has no current Google News hits at all?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to striking a note of dignity or formality, "beg the question" sounds as though it ought to be a slightly old-fashioned way to say something that you could get it to mean by extending the meaning of &lt;em&gt;beg&lt;/em&gt; just a bit, as often happens in archaic expressions. There's no similarly simple move that turns "affirming the consequent" into something that people are likely to want to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; OK, those of you who are still with me, what should we do? Should we join the herd and use "beg the question" to mean "raise the question"? Or should we join the few, proud hold-outs who still use it in the old "assume the conclusion" sense, while complaining about the ignorant rabble who etc.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, those are both bad choices. If you use the phrase to mean "raise the question", some pedants will silently dismiss you as a dunce, while others will complain loudly, thus distracting everyone else from whatever you wanted to say. If you complain  about others' "misuse", you come across as an annoying pedant. And if you use the phrase to mean "assume the conclusion", almost no one will understand you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My recommendation: Never use the phrase yourself — use &amp;quot;assume the conclusion&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;raise the question&amp;quot;, depending on what you mean — and cultivate an attitude of serene detachment in the face of its use by others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272581027822"><id gr:original-id="http://mattmaroon.com/2010/04/29/my-rebuttal-to-steve-os-rebuttal-its-all-about-the-gtdmc/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f280581868bd2f81</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">My Rebuttal to Steve-o’s Rebuttal: It’s All About The GTDMC</title><published>2010-04-29T22:43:35Z</published><updated>2010-04-29T22:43:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com/2010/04/29/my-rebuttal-to-steve-os-rebuttal-its-all-about-the-gtdmc/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://mattmaroon.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs published a note called &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/"&gt;Thoughts on Flash&lt;/a&gt; today, almost certainly as a direct result of my previous post, &lt;a href="http://mattmaroon.com/2010/04/20/html-5-not-any-time-soon/"&gt;HTML 5: Not any Time Soon&lt;/a&gt;, in which I pointed out that I think Apple is making a mistake by not supporting Flash on the iPhone and iPad.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve’s rebuttal contained a few points. Number one is that Flash isn’t open, it’s a proprietary standard (obviously true) and that for some reason Apple has decided that while everything else they produce should be a proprietary standard, web-based ones need to be open. It’s a double-standard with no clear reason as to why that one proprietary works everywhere but there, but it is what it is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically he then goes on to tout the performance benefits of using h.264, a proprietary video encoding standard that Apple relies on heavily. You can argue the finer points of video compression (whether Ogg Theora is sufficiently high quality at given bitrates, or potentially subject to potential IP problems) until you’re blue in the face, but you just cannot reconcile the fact that Apple feels that animated graphics and interactive interfaces need to be created in an open standard like HTML 5 but video in a proprietary one like h.264. Apple could create both a video compression standard (and open source it like they have with Webkit) and hardware encoder/decoders for it if they wanted, but they do not. Of course, they’re a member of the proprietary licensing group that collects h.264 licensing fees, so once again we’re left with Apple just wanting to use their &lt;em&gt;proprietary&lt;/em&gt; standards.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really what it comes down to is Apple is winning the latest version of the Great Technological Dick-Measuring Contest (heretofore abbreviated GTDMC): the app count. Apple can boast 180,00 apps or however many, a multiple of the number for Android and everyone else. Just like previous GTDMCs, including megapixels in digital cameras and clock speed on processors, the app store GTDMC is not at all meaningful by itself but sells product to the uninformed. Ask anyone who has sold electronics (I did back in the days of MP and GHz). Average Joe Sixpack doesn’t know or care about anything but the number.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the real reason Apple is banning anything not programmed in their developer tools from their devices. Really, who cares if later versions of the iPhone OS make your fart apps stop farting? Not Apple certainly. Probably not users either, they’ll just upgrade the ones that the developers felt valuable enough to upgrade and simply replace the rest. The average lifespan of any given app on a particular device is about that of the common houselfy, so I can’t imagine breaking compatibility is a concern to anyone involved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Apple doesn’t want, and Steve Jobs neglected to mention, is to let the App Store become a cheap commodity. If Adobe can make their Creative Suite export your flash program to an iPhone app, what’s to stop them from letting it export to an Android one, and a WebOS one, and a Blackberry one as well? The answer is nothing, in fact it’s almost certain they’d do this given that Adobe’s mission from day one, when they were doing this with printable documents, is to make it so that developers can write their code once and run it anywhere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then what happens to all of the exclusive “Made for iPhone apps”? Just as gaming console makers love games made solely for their platform, Apple wants your location sharing service to only run on iPhone. This is the real reason why they’re cramming Xcode down your throats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another point Steve-o (that’s what we call him at the poker table) makes is battery life. To me this is a fallacious argument. The device supporting Flash does not have to equal the device not supporting h.264. Battery life could be maintained, such as it is now, when viewing YouTube or any other site with h.264 files ready to go. And for sites that still have their content in only Flash for whatever reason (Hulu being the most notable by far) the customer can simply choose.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if there’s one thing that Apple products have been notorious for it’s poor battery life. Apple was the first OEM, way back in the early days of the iPod, a line of products which has had worse battery life than every major competitor ever since its inception, to realize that people don’t really care about it that much. They just need enough to get through the day. The iPhone (like most smartphones with large screens) gets abysmal battery life compared to the clamshells everyone had before, and guess what, nobody cares. You just plug it in every night and you’re happy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole though, all of his points illustrate exactly why all of us web developers want Flash to die. Though most of the ones I’ve talked to tend to agree with my statement that it won’t happen soon, we’re all hoping it does. But that doesn’t mean it’s sensible to not support it now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were younger, we worried about gross apartments, ex-girlfriend baggage, and just finding a guy mature enough to tie his own two shoes. But suddenly they’re all grown up, and some of them have kids. There are worse things a guy could tell you, but then again, kids are more than just baggage. There are all sorts of intimidating considerations – Are you down with play dates? Will the kid hate you? Will you ever be as important to your beau as his kid? Is it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; over between him and baby momma?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Liz Lemon says, some things are deal breakers. Most of us are hip to the fact that not everyone is perfect, but what do you think? Is a baby (and a baby momma) a fatal flaw, or just another fact of life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Which is exactly the wrong reason to agree with it, of course, but it's a start, and with some significant reservations, is an interesting foundation to argue over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the abstract. It's a paper describing general strategies for winning over participants in public debates about science, which basically says, in terms more familiar to us, that waffling accommodationists are losers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public debates driven by incomplete scientific data where nobody can claim absolute certainty, due to current state of scientific knowledge, are studied. The cases of evolution theory, global warming and H1N1 pandemic influenza are investigated. The first two are of controversial impact while the third is more neutral and resolved. To adopt a cautious balanced attitude based on clear but inconclusive data appears to be a lose-out strategy. In contrast overstating arguments with wrong claims which cannot be scientifically refuted appear to be necessary but not sufficient to eventually win a public debate. The underlying key mechanism of these puzzling and unfortunate conclusions are identified using the Galam sequential probabilistic model of opinion dynamics. It reveals that the existence of inflexible agents and their respective proportions are the instrumental parameters to determine the faith of incomplete scientific data public debates. Acting on one's own inflexible proportion modifies the topology of the flow diagram, which in turn can make irrelevant initial supports. On the contrary focusing on open-minded agents may be useless given some topologies. When the evidence is not as strong as claimed, the inflexibles rather than the data are found to drive the opinion of the population. The results shed a new but disturbing light on designing adequate strategies to win a public debate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you&amp;#39;ve got an argument going, and one side has the evidence but the other side has an inflexible certainty that the evidence is wrong, the inflexibles tend to distort the normal process of weighing the evidence and drawing reasonable conclusions — they suck in more uncommitted participants (called &amp;#39;floaters&amp;#39;) to their way of thinking, generating more inflexibles, strengthing the position of the anti-science side, leading to greater attraction to being wrong. The counter-strategy, suggested later in the paper, is to &amp;#39;get more inflexibles&amp;#39; — winning over floaters so they drift over to your side has little long-term impact, it&amp;#39;s far better to build a larger army of forceful advocates for your position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the reservations, though. This isn't real social science: dig into the paper deeper and you discover it is entirely theoretical, based on a mathematical model of human behavior. Hmmm. It's all well and good to say that a population of autonomous agents with properties X, Y, and Z will behave in a particular way in a simulation, but, well, people tend to be very messy beings. I don't have a background in this field to be able to say whether the model has good empirical support or not, so I'm not going to be able to say that the Pharyngula model for arguing over evolution, that is, by unreserved and loud advocacy that steamrollers the opposition as much as possible, has been proven to be correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that's what this paper says I should do anyway! If I want to persuade, it's best to avoid those fuzzy little tentative words, go gung ho for the answer you want. Which in a lot of ways is undesirable, actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results shed a new but disturbing light on Designing adequate strategies to eventually win public debates. To produce inflexibles in one's own side is thus critical to win a public argument whatever the rigor cost and the associated epistemological paradoxes. At odds, to focus on convincing open-minded agents is useless. In summary, when the scientific evidence is not as strong as claimed, the inflexibles rather than the data are found to drive the collective opinion of the population. Consequences on Designing adequate strategies to win a public debate are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK. We need more positive inflexibles. Got it. (Oh, and by the way, the paper has an annoying trait of capitalizing "Design" wherever it occurs. Don't know why, it may just be grep run amuck.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I have another reservation. What's this "when the scientific evidence is not as strong as claimed" business? The author has his own peculiar blindspot, where he thinks biologists have been overstating the evidence for evolution. That isn't true at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the major outcome of our modeling is to confirm the rightness in overstating the validity of Darwin theory to oppose Intelligent Design in terms of success in the public debate. Afterwards our results suggest that in case opponents to Intelligent Design had been more circumspect about the "status" of Darwin theory, they would have lost the public debate. It is a somehow disturbing hypothesis with an embarrassing result for an honest scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except, no, we have not been insufficienctly circumspect at all. The evidence for evolution really is overwhelmingly in its favor. It isn't proven in a mathematical sense, there is no illusion that we have accounted for every single possible mechanism, and there is still active exploration of all the details, but there is no doubt anywhere sensible that evolution, that populations change over time driven by natural processes, and that all life on earth shares a common ancestry, is a fact, amply confirmed and tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing to be embarrassed about open advocacy of a well-demonstrated scientific position at all, and no one is hiding the interesting controversies within the boundaries of that truth. What this really is about is good debating strategies. You do not open a discussion by saying, &amp;quot;Well, we aren&amp;#39;t certain about the relative contributions of chance and selection, and maybe chemical properties dictate some of the outcomes of biological processes, but we&amp;#39;re pretty certain evolution happens.&amp;quot; That puts all the emphasis on doubt. No, you start by saying positively that &amp;quot;Evolution happens, period.&amp;quot; Then you can discuss, if necessary, the ragged edges of the science. The important point, though, is the reality of that core idea, and you have to realize that in many arguments with creationists, it&amp;#39;s not the ragged edges they&amp;#39;re talking about — it&amp;#39;s precisely that scientifically indisputable central fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No compromise of the science is required, only a recognition of the actual point being discussed. Where scientists are often handicapped is that they don't recognized the depth of the denial on the other side, and that their opponents really are happily butting their heads against the rock hard foundation of the science. We tend to assume the creationists can't really be &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; stupid, and figure they must have some legitimate complaint about some aspect of evolution with which we can sympathize. They don't. They really are that nuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true! It&amp;#39;s true! Tidenes happening før Skepsikonferansen 2010! En ravende, sinna, og nysgjerrig teddybjørn av en ateist og skeptiker kommer til vårt fagre land i noen dager før Ateistkonferansen i København 18-20. juni. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Han skal være her 16. juni, og skal holde en talk på Litteraturhuset 15.30 -17; om noe om Science Communication. Skal dele link til info når den kommer opp. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dessuten overleveres han til mine klamme hender når han er ferdig med å skravle med UiO-pampene, og da skal vi finne på noe trivelig. Forvent moro. Hold av kvelden. Dere som liker ham da. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vi takker CEES for at de inviterte ham, og nyopprettede Studentenes Skeptikerlag Oslo for å dele  ham med folket etter foredraget. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what she said…but wait, did she call me a &amp;quot;teddybjørn&amp;quot;? Somebody will have to translate the rest for me, or since only Norwegians are going to care, maybe you don&amp;#39;t have to translate at all. Just let me know if there are secret plans in there to have me publicly crucified when I arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barring any Christian berserkers assaulting me when I arrive (not likely, given Norway&amp;#39;s godlesås socialist reputation), it should be fun. The Trophy Wife™ is joining me on this trip, no doubt drawn by the call of the Motherland — her maiden name is good ol&amp;#39; Norse, Gjerness, and while I&amp;#39;m mongrel American with my maternal Swedish/Norwegian roots muddled with a father who was just about everything else European, she&amp;#39;s one of those purebred Scandinavians. She may also be coming along to keep an eye on me, because she knows from experience that I&amp;#39;ve got a thing for Scandinavian goddesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be getting out for some social time while we're there, too. I fear, though, a visit to a nation where beer may be replaced with akevitt. I don't know if I'll have the stamina.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not interested right now in fucking scriptural debate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other fucking songs and there are other fucking ways&lt;br&gt;
I’ll be a religious apologist on other fucking days&lt;br&gt;
But the fact remains, if you protect a single kiddie fucker&lt;br&gt;
Then Pope or prince or plumber, you’re a fucking motherfucker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see I don’t give a fuck what any other motherfucker&lt;br&gt;
Believes about Jesus and his motherfucking mother&lt;br&gt;
And I’ve no problem with the spiritual beliefs of all these fuckers&lt;br&gt;
While those beliefs don’t impact on the happiness of others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you build a church on claims of fucking moral authority&lt;br&gt;
And with threats of hell impose it on others in society&lt;br&gt;
Then you, you motherfuckers, could expect some fucking wrath&lt;br&gt;
When it turns out you’ve been fucking us in our motherfucking asses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So fuck the motherfucker&lt;br&gt;
And fuck you, motherfucker if you’re still a motherfucking papist&lt;br&gt;
If he covered for a single motherfucker who’s a kiddie fucker&lt;br&gt;
Fuck the motherfucker, he’s as evil as the rapist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you look into your motherfucking heart and tell me true&lt;br&gt;
If this motherfucking stupid fucking song offended you&lt;br&gt;
With its filthy fucking language and it’s fucking disrespect&lt;br&gt;
If it made you feel angry, go ahead and write a letter&lt;br&gt;
But if you find me more offensive than the fucking possibility&lt;br&gt;
That the Pope protected priests when they were getting fucking fiddly&lt;br&gt;
Then listen to me, motherfucker, this here is a fact:&lt;br&gt;
You are just as morally misguided as that motherfucking&lt;br&gt;
Power-hungry, self-aggrandized bigot in the stupid fucking hat&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca Watson</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272578601597"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=14667">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/440bc3623f68074f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Geekery"/><category term="SciFi"/><category term="TV/Movies"/><title type="html">Monsters from the Id!</title><published>2010-04-29T21:41:23Z</published><updated>2010-04-29T21:41:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/P9BF9ddf2VQ/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/29/monsters-from-the-id/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’re in LA this weekend, and you love SciFi and mad scientists — and c’mon, who doesn’t? — then you’ll want to attend the screening of &lt;a href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2010/04/monsters-from-id-converge-on-la.html"&gt;&amp;quot;Monsters from the Id&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, a documentary on mad scientists, 1950s movies, and the future of science in the US.

&lt;p&gt;There will be a panel after the screening, talking about these topics as well.

&lt;p&gt;Surely, most if not all of our devoted Language Log readers have by now noticed the recent &lt;i&gt;NYT&lt;/i&gt; story "&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/nyregion/29lost.html"&gt;Listening to (and Saving) the World's Languages&lt;/a&gt;", about some of the work being done by the &lt;a href="http://endangeredlanguagealliance.org/main/"&gt;Endangered Language Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to document and preserve endangered languages spoken in New York City. (And in case you hadn't noticed it, there it is. Check it out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no comments on the article directly, but there's a link to "&lt;a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/land-of-lonely-tongues/?ref=nyregion"&gt;Land of Lonely Tongues&lt;/a&gt;", an &lt;i&gt;NYT&lt;/i&gt; City Room blog post (with a video clip and survey-based identification of "the least-spoken languages in New York") and there are &lt;strike&gt;27&lt;/strike&gt; 32 comments there as of this &lt;strike&gt;writing&lt;/strike&gt; update. Several of them are friendly to endangered language research, but one early commenter (&amp;quot;155 in 55″) calls the work &amp;quot;nonsense&amp;quot;, wonders whether &amp;quot;the rest of the world [should] care&amp;quot;, and claims that &amp;quot;[the] whole thing sounds like academia making work for themselves and justifying their existence.&amp;quot; (Other commenters respond, and 155 in 55 engages again; read for yourself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have our own views on the value of endangered language research, and 155 in 55 is of course entitled to his or her own views on the matter. However, the claim that this is all just a ruse to give linguists something to do is spectacularly uninformed. Until very, very recently, documentation and preservation work on endangered languages has been some of the most underfunded and academically thankless work that a linguist can do; even now, with the relatively positive attention this work gets in the media and with a few more dedicated (but still relatively small) sources of funding available, the good folks who do this vital research find themselves struggling to justify the worth of many of the products of their work to their colleagues. The problem is acute enough to have prompted the Linguistic Society of America to propose the &lt;a href="http://www.lsadc.org/info/lsa-res-lang-doc.cfm"&gt;Resolution Recognizing the Scholarly Merit of Language Documentation&lt;/a&gt;, right now on the ballot for LSA members to vote on. (Note to LSA members: don't forget to vote before June 1.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the linguists responsible for the positive attention that language documentation research has received lately is of course &lt;a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/dharris2/"&gt;K. David Harrison&lt;/a&gt;, and there are two bits of news to share about his work. First, his 2008 book "&lt;a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/dharris2/endangered.php"&gt;When Languages Die&lt;/a&gt;" was &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sci;328/5977/431-a?maxtoshow=&amp;amp;hits=10&amp;amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;amp;fulltext=what%27s+lost+when+languages+are&amp;amp;searchid=1&amp;amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;amp;resourcetype=HWCIT"&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; this week (apologies if you can't access it). Second, he has a new book to appear in September: "&lt;a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781426204616"&gt;The Last Speakers: The Quest to Save the World's Most Endangered Languages&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; — pre-order your copy now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I ever went on vacation with a boyfriend we couldn’t even agree on a destination. We had settled on Italy, but I wanted south and he wanted north, and that wasn’t a war I won. I had a hard time getting my way at just about every turn. Mike got it in his head that Naples was dangerous, which was not only lame, but insulting. My family was from there and I had visited the city many times. Sure, Naples has street crime and the cab drivers say inappropriate things. But Vesuvius hasn’t erupted since 79 A.D., and in that volcano’s shadow is some of the best pizza on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend, a Detroit native and 15-year resident of New York City, was afraid of a little Italian city on the Mediterranean, and there was nothing I could do to dissuade him. I tried. I bought books, I had him talk to other people who had been there and loved it. But he refused to venture below Rome, so we started there and made our way up the peninsula. I even had to beg him to go to &lt;em&gt;Florence&lt;/em&gt;, because his father told him that parking was difficult in the city of Dante. I fought that battle harder and found us a hotel with a garage. He thanked me for it because Florence is, of course, spectacular. But Naples would have been an impossibility for him. It’s a good thing that relationship ended – I hope he and my replacement are enjoying a Carnival Cruise together right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traveling with your boyfriend is sort of like reality TV – call it compatibility survivor. You have to spend a solid block of time together to see if you can stand each other, while fate and the TSA throw all kinds of crazy obstacles in your path. So much is out of your control when you travel – flights are delayed, your hotel room doesn’t &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/topic/look/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=look&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; like the website photos, restaurants can be disappointing, and little derelict children are lurking around the Coliseum – and one seems to be heading in the direction of your handbag. It’s good to know how your significant other adapts to being a stranger in a strange land; this is critical information to have if you plan to be in it for the long haul. The future is stranger than Naples in the thick of a trash crisis, and when problems arise, the two of you probably won’t be looking at them from the balcony of the Excelsior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike’s wrongness for me was apparent before we even left the ground. Yet we went on a few more trips together, including an excursion to Florida where we changed hotels three times because Mike wasn’t satisfied with the room décor in the first two. I was his accomplice – always ready to drag my suitcase down Collins Avenue, never resting until we could find a hotel room that was just right to contain a couple that was all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week I’m going on my first vacation with a new boyfriend who I suspect is less sensitive to scooter noise and brightly patterned suzanis. I don’t know what lessons from my past experience I can take along with me this time. I don’t suspect I’ll see anything like Mike’s fear and stubbornness again, and I hope you never have to endure a similar drag. I do have some ideas about where we may clash. I sleep late, he sleeps even later; I like to walk everywhere, he is less energetic. I cannot change him, I can only work on how I react to our differences. Can I take that bike ride solo when he’s too tired, or visit that museum on my own if he’s not interested?  This is more akin to reality, anyway. We’re not pinned to each others’ sides in our home life, so why should things be any different on the road? After all, we need to put our “survivor” skills to the test sometime. Travel is a great opportunity to get to know him, but it also gives us a chance to get to know ourselves. Hopefully we’ll come out of it liking everyone better.&lt;/p&gt;

So, why don’t females have masculinised brains?  They should have loads of estrogen, shouldn’t they?  In fact female rodents have very low levels of circulating estrogen at this early postnatal stage, coinciding with the critical period.  The surprising findings implicating aromatase and estrogen receptors have left a mystery surrounding the role of the androgen receptor – the protein traditionally associated with direct responses to testosterone.  Mice with mutations in the gene for the androgen receptor also show feminised behaviours, suggesting it is also important in the process of masculinisation.  However, this interpretation is complicated by the fact that these mutants also show testicular atrophy (sorry again) and consequently have very low levels of circulating testosterone.  A new study by Nirao Shah and colleagues has now resolved the role of the androgen receptor in controlling sexual behaviour.  By knocking out this gene just in the brain, they managed to get around the requirements for testicular function and so cleanly address the possible functions in the brain.  They clearly show that the brains of these conditional mutants are still masculinised, morphologically.  These mice also generally show a male pattern of behaviour.  However, they do not express all of these behaviours to the same extent as wild-type males.  In particular, the frequency of mating behaviours in the presence of an estrus female is reduced,  though when they do engage in the behaviour the routine is effectively normal.  The mutant males also mark their territory less than wild-types and spend less time fighting with other “intruder” males.  Thus, while the developmental effects of testosterone appear to be fully explained by its conversion to estrogen, the activational effects in adults which are required for the full expression of male behaviours depend at least in part on its direct action through the androgen receptor.       Wu, M., Manoli, D., Fraser, E., Coats, J., Tollkuhn, J., Honda, S., Harada, N., &amp;amp; Shah, N.

Although scrubby and arid today, between 46-42 million years ago what is now the northeastern part of the state was a lush forest which was home to a variety of peculiar fossil primates. Called omomyids, these relatives of living tarsiers are primarily known from teeth and associated bits and pieces of bone, but newly discovered postcranial remains may provide paleontologists with a better idea of how some of these ancient primates moved.

On it, back in 2006, he placed a &lt;a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/10/how-to-write-well.html"&gt;guide to good economics writing&lt;/a&gt;.  And I fear that you may already have guessed what, with sinking heart, I correctly foresaw that I would find therein.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;#39;s a mixed bag of recommendations that he provides, in a thoroughly random order that I will not follow.  He has some anodyne recommendations about avoiding wordiness and blather — in fact he is rather repetitive and wordy on the topic of wordiness: in separate points (which I abbreviate and paraphrase here) he insists you should &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;stay focused and cut anything irrelevant, &lt;li&gt;keep sentences short and use short words, &lt;li&gt;avoid unnecessary words, &lt;li&gt;keep it simple, &lt;li&gt;avoid jargon, &lt;li&gt;use metaphors and anecdotes, and &lt;li&gt;keep your writing personal. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; There is surely some overlap in the first three or four of those.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also has some genuine style-sheet proposals that I have no quarrel with because they are nothing to do with sentence construction: he wants his students to keep their writing self-contained (i.e., avoid forward as-I-will-show-later references, and references to other works; he recommends avoiding footnotes; and he warns against inventing new acronyms.  This is fine with me: Greg is within his rights to dictate such formal aspects of his students' papers, just as a publisher will tell you whether or not to put journal titles in italics.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cites three highly specific word peeves that he thinks are especially important (&lt;i&gt;long&lt;/i&gt; run is a noun but &lt;i&gt;long-run&lt;/i&gt; is an adjective; the same holds for &lt;i&gt;short&lt;/i&gt;(-)&lt;i&gt;run&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;saving&lt;/i&gt; is a flow but &lt;i&gt;savings&lt;/i&gt; is a stock).  This too seems like reasonable advice.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he also gives some specific instructions (of a disappointingly familiar kind) to avoid certain perfectly ordinary constructions or devices.  He says you should "Use adverbs sparingly" (everyone does; adverbs are not at all common compared to nouns and verbs), and then unwittingly repeats himself by warning against &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; (which is, of course, an adverb, so that has been covered), and repeats himself some more in a recommendation against certain modal adjuncts (he cites &lt;i&gt;of course&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;clearly&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;obviously&lt;/i&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says "Positive statements are more persuasive than normative statements" without defining either positivity or normativity, and I admit I am not sure what he means; possibly he means you should try to say what is the case rather than what ought to be or can be the case, in which case he is advising against modal auxiliaries.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart began to sink when I found he advises against using the passive voice (expressing that instruction by saying &amp;quot;The passive voice is avoided by good writers&amp;#39; — I am assuming this is economist humor) — a long-standing, indeed tired, old theme (&lt;a href="http://ling.ed.ac.uk/~gpullum/grammar/passives.html"&gt;see here for discussion&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And ultimately (perhaps you guessed this was coming), he says: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt; Buy a copy of Strunk and White&amp;#39;s Elements of Style. Also, William Zinsser&amp;#39;s On Writing Well. Read them—again and again and again. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, dear.  Again and again and again, American professors with absolutely no background in English grammar insist that their 21st-century college students should study this unpleasantly dogmatic little work, written by men born in the 19th century.  But the dictats given in &lt;i&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/i&gt; range from the redundant to the insane.  Anyone who read the book again and again and again, and took its edicts literally, would do disastrous damage to their writing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of those who dip into it come out with some signs of a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1357"&gt;nervous cluelessness&lt;/a&gt; about grammar: they get edgy around adverbs and prepositions and instances of the verb &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, without exactly knowing why they feel like that, or what they should do about it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am quite convinced that &lt;i&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/i&gt; harms students more than it helps them.  Yet the Google search term {&lt;tt&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;q=Strunk+White+%22Elements+of+Style%22+site%3Aharvard.edu&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;gs_rfai=&amp;amp;fp=ccfc95fdfe6a3d73"&gt;Strunk White "Elements of Style" site:harvard.edu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;} calls up nearly ninety hits.  Replacing &lt;b&gt;harvard.edu&lt;/b&gt; by &lt;b&gt;mit.edu&lt;/b&gt; yields more, about 140.  At Princeton it's 23.  At Stanford it's about 95.  The finest universities in America continue to insist that this awful little compilation of century-old peevery is an important accessory for today's literate student.  It isn't.  The difference between carrying around &lt;i&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/i&gt; in your backpack and carrying around a slide rule is that slide rules gave accurate answers.  (I actually don't know much about Zinsser's book; I'm trying to obtain a copy, but it is apparently not published in the UK.  What I do know is that he makes the outrageous claim that &lt;b&gt;most&lt;/b&gt; adjectives are unnecessary.  So I have my doubts about Zinsser too.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvard econ students, rise up: ignore everything Greg Mankiw says about grammar and throw your copy of &lt;i&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/i&gt; away. I don't mean you should write wordy waffle or violate his style requirements; but I am saying that this nonsense about avoid the passive construction and staying away from adverbs is junk. Check out Greg's own writing if you don't believe me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't summon enough interest or time to do more research than download the first paper on his Harvard website (a presidential address called "Spreading the Wealth Around: Reflections Inspired by Joe the Plumber"), and check for passives and adverbs.  The first passive clause is in the second half of his title; the second is in the third sentence of the abstract ("how the tax system should &lt;u&gt;be designed&lt;/u&gt;); the third paragraph of the main text has the next passive clause ("tax cuts &lt;u&gt;signed into law by President Bush&lt;/u&gt;"); I won't go on.  His third paragraph has the first adverb ("I &lt;u&gt;fully&lt;/u&gt; expect the issue to remain at the center of political debate"), and the fourth paragraph brings a bunch more ("&lt;u&gt;perhaps&lt;/u&gt; more important"; "&lt;u&gt;slowly&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;steadily&lt;/u&gt; continue to rise"; "&lt;u&gt;suddenly&lt;/u&gt; read Milton Friedman&amp;#39;s book&amp;quot;)…  It is pointless to spend more time on this.  Greg Mankiw can&amp;#39;t tell how many passives or adverbs he is using.  He uses them whenever he thinks they feel right.  So should you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitpic.com/1hhv8d"&gt;&lt;img alt="banner_MURDOCH.jpg" src="http://www.dcscience.net/banner_MURDOCH2.jpg" width="350" height="82" border="0" title="Decision time!"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Don’t Get Fooled Again “&lt;a href="http://richardwilsonauthor.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/vote-cameron-get-murdoch/"&gt;I agree with Rupert&lt;/a&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2001"&gt;2001 election&lt;/a&gt;, I had been forced to the conclusion that Tony Blair had views that were well to the right of Margaret Thatcher’s, in many areas that mattered to me. so I voted Lib Dem. That was before 9/11 After that event, all doubt was gone, so the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005"&gt;2005 election&lt;/a&gt; it was Lib Dem again.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t even consider the Conservative party much.  I have never understood how anyone could vote for them, ever. The only choice for me is Lib Dem versus Labour.  Let’s try to be fair.  Labour has done some good things (though most of them would probably have been done by Lib Dems too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum Wage Act 1998  was a great innovation &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Freedom of Information Act (2000) was a major step forward for openness and democracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nursery school places have increased&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heating allowances for pensioners (though not sure that I should have got it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The funding for the NHS was increased considerably and it has been very good for me (see &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2073"&gt;Why I love the NHS&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Funding for science increased considerably&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against the big increases for the NHS must be set the huge increase in the number of highly-paid managers, relative to the number of nurses and doctors, that has occurred under Labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bad things that labour has done&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was obvious from an early stage that Labour were in favour of  selective schools (but were not honest about).  They certainly favoured religious selective schools, and still do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explicit support of Tony Blair for creationist schools and his implicit support for homeopathy are distasteful, but not in themselves sufficient reason for voting against him. The decisive thing for me is the Labour government’s careless attitude to human rights and free speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing made that clearer than the Iraq war and its aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saddam Hussein was a wicked dictator, Sadly the world has many wicked dictators. One wishes they would all go away. But only one of the world’s wicked dictators was singled out to be invaded. It was already clear before 1997that Iraq had been picked out by American neoconservatives as a ‘special case’. They didn’t get far until the election of George Bush in 2001, and the tragedy of the twin towers, 9/11, gave them the chance they sought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Bush was perhaps the most extreme right wing president in US History (as well as one of the most stupid). As someone who seemed to have difficulty in distinguishing between real life and a B-movie, his behaviour may not be surprising, but it brought shame on his country. His regime’s legitimisation of torture is, to my mind, the greatest disgrace that has happened during my adult lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was with increasing incredulity that I watched Tony Blair’s poodle-like behaviour to Bush. It seemed incredible that any normal human. let alone a Labour prime minister could behave like that. The sight of two such men, both believing that god was on their side was scary in the extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things are in danger of being forgotten with the passing of time.  All these and much more were documented on my &lt;a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dc-bits/corrie.html"&gt;politics blog&lt;/a&gt;, up to the point when Blair left office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember the US governments legalisation of torture. That caused no wavering in Blair’s support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember the plagiarised dossier? Any student would have been fired for that, but Blair shrugged it off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember how the attorney general &lt;a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dc-bits/corrie.html#gold"&gt;mysteriously changed his mind&lt;/a&gt; about the legality of the war?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember Abu Ghraib?  If not, read &lt;a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dc-bits/corrie.html#lof4"&gt;Seymour Hersh&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;Remember the ex-aide to Blair &lt;a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dc-bits/corrie.html#blair3"&gt;who said&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        “I couldn’t help feeling TB was rather relishing his first blooding as PM, sending the boys into action. Despite all the necessary stuff about taking action ‘with a heavy heart’, I think he feels&lt;br&gt;
        it is part of his coming of age as a leader.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    and how the &lt;a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dc-bits/corrie.html#blair3"&gt;government tried to tone down&lt;/a&gt; his remarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kelly_%28weapons_expert%29"&gt;David Kelly?&lt;/a&gt; The death of a good man must be largely the fault of Blair’s government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember how, eventually, generals and even &lt;a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dc-bits/corrie.html#perle1"&gt;neocons turned on Bush, but&lt;/a&gt; Blair would still not admit any  mistake?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember the Hutton report, and the vicious attacks on the BBC’s independence that followed it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember the attempts to conceal ‘rendition’ (&lt;em&gt;i.e. &lt;/em&gt;.torture by proxy).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember the wonderful efforts of UCL lawyer, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Sands"&gt;Phillipe Sands&lt;/a&gt;, to expose illegal activities by both US and UK governments.   He is someone of whom UCL can be very proud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good done by the Freedom of Information Act has to be set against their sloppy attitude to human rights, as evidenced by their constant attempts to extended detention without charge or trial. In 2004 I made the following poster, based on a dramatic front page of the &lt;em&gt;Independent&lt;/em&gt;, 18th Dec. 2004. It is still relevant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/magna-carta.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/magna-carta-s.jpg" alt="magna carta"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Click to enlarge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This followed the ruling pf the Law Lords that the government’s detention policy was illegal  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people  living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values,  comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these. That is the true  measure of what terrorism may achieve. It is for Parliament to decide  whether to give the terrorists such a victory.” &lt;em&gt; Lord Justice  Hoffmann, in the 8-1 ruling of the Law Lords that the UK government’s  policy of detention without charge is illegal.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3934-2004Dec16.html"&gt; [Washington Post] &lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldjudgmt/jd041216/a&amp;amp;oth-6.htm"&gt; [Original report]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sight of Blair acquiescing to the wish of the most right-wing neoconservative government in the western world sickened me unspeakably, and still does, The happy days of 1997 seemed to be a long way away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was Blair, but Gordon Brown and most of the Labour cabinet looked on and did nothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Miliband said “You’ve punished us enough about Iraq”. Well no, you haven’t been punished at all, Yet. As someone said on twitter, resuscitate the 100,000 dead and we’ll forgive you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I’m still baffled about why the crowd that gathered in UCL’s quad for the start of the second great march on 20th March 2003, were able to predict the outcome of the invasion so much more accurately than the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;UCL  quadrangle 20 March 2003&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      &lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/picday-quad-s.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/ucl-quad1-200303.jpg"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to download high resolution &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Apart from the war&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown is guilty not only of supporting the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has supported segregated religious schools and the reintroduction of &amp;quot;academy&amp;quot; schools, both being ways of surreptitiously re-introducing selection into the education system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He and Blair presided over an endless multiplication of box-ticking quangos. The intention was, no doubt to increase quality, but the effect has been exactly the opposite. Just look, for example, at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=215"&gt;Skills for Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485"&gt;QAA, the QCA&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=454"&gt;multitude of others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some of the reasons that I cannot vote &amp;quot;Labour&amp;quot; this time. They have become. in many ways, a party of the right, barely distinguishable from the Conservative party (and in some respects, further to the right). Remember that the Conservatives supported Blair in his love affair with George Bush, they support selective schools, they support religious schools. And they are even more likely that Labour to sell their soul to Rupert Murdoch. Imagine Fox &amp;quot;News&amp;quot; coming to the UK and be afraid, very afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Liberal Democrats?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I find it impossible to vote Labour this time. they are the only option. But I think one can be a bit more positive than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the reasons why are listed &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/apr/28/lib-dems-party-of-progress"&gt;in a letter&lt;/a&gt; in today’s Guardian (the list of signatories is remarkable). &lt;a href="http://network.libdems.org.uk/manifesto2010/libdem_manifesto_2010.pdf"&gt;The Lib Dem manifesto is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Lib Dems are more likely than the other parties to roll back New Labour’s attack on civil liberties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lib Dems tax and green policies look pretty good to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/sep/18/trident-replacement-hidden-cost-revealed"&gt;replacing Trident missiles&lt;/a&gt; could be around £100 &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt;, and if that were spent it is doubtful whether what you get is useful under present conditions. Only Lib Dems would rethink this ghastly waste of money. Brown and Cameron prefer macho posturing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brown’s judgment about banks was wrong, yet he still won’t separate the casino banks and the savings banks.  Lib Dem’s would.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lib Dems have been more open about how cuts would be made than other parties (if not 100%).  Vince Cable for Chancellor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nick Clegg’s &lt;a href="http://blog.sciencecampaign.org.uk/?p=1114"&gt;response to the letter&lt;/a&gt; sent party leaders by the Campaign for Science &amp;amp; Engineering CaSE) was clearly better than the others,in many respects. See also Lib Dems &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/apr/26/liberal-democrats-science-policy"&gt;science policy test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you imagine a better science minister than Dr Evan Harris?.  I can’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Einstein’s idea was used in the 1950s to make powerful microwaves with a device called a maser, for “microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.” When Maiman similarly made visible light, his device became the laser, with “light” replacing “microwave.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fDeqkC0PEtg/S9nhCCiseVI/AAAAAAAAAC0/LNJQWe0dZJI/s1600/649099-buck_rogers_super.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;width:130px;height:160px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fDeqkC0PEtg/S9nhCCiseVI/AAAAAAAAAC0/LNJQWe0dZJI/s320/649099-buck_rogers_super.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Science fiction was right on top of this new development and even foresaw it. In 1898, H. G. Wells introduced an invisible but powerful heat ray as the weapon of choice for invading Martians in his story The War of the Worlds. Today, that would be an infrared CO2 laser. In the 1930s, space swashbucklers Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon used hand-held ray weapons in their movie serials. In the 1950s, The Day the Earth Stood Still and the film version of The War of the Worlds also featured weapons that used beams of light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the laser was invented, films were even quicker to use its dramatic possibilities and sometimes predicted its potential. In 1964, a scene in Goldfinger showed James Bond (Sean Connery) tied to a table as a laser beam threatens to bisect him, starting at his groin. Bond manages to escape, but not before audiences see the laser beam slicing through the solid gold tabletop.  This anticipated the widespread industrial uses of lasers that began in  the 1970s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/7wyp909mQPM%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=240&amp;amp;height=190" width="240" height="190"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Naturally enough for a device initially called a “death ray,” however, most science fiction lasers appear as weapons. Probably the biggest laser ever imagined on screen is the gargantuan Death Star with which the evil galactic Empire destroys a whole planet in Star Wars: Episode IV, a New Hope (1977). Other imaginary weapons, though not exactly beneficial to society, are less horrific. These include various laser hand weapons and cannons, and in the film Real Genius (1985), a small, lethal laser designed to be mounted on an aircraft and used to assassinate selected targets with surgical precision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/S2rtmoSuoL4%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=240&amp;amp;height=190" width="240" height="190"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fDeqkC0PEtg/S9nlTmLkTrI/AAAAAAAAAC8/ZpsjQ1YiKZE/s1600/robocop.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;width:100px;height:160px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fDeqkC0PEtg/S9nlTmLkTrI/AAAAAAAAAC8/ZpsjQ1YiKZE/s320/robocop.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sometimes fictional and real laser science become so interconnected that you can hardly tell them apart. When President Ronald Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) in 1983, which would use lasers to shoot down hostile nuclear-tipped missiles, the program instantly became known as “Star Wars.” Reality turned back into science fiction when director Paul Verhoeven satirized SDI in his film RoboCop (1987), in which a space-based SDI laser goes badly awry and takes out acreage near Santa Barbara, California – probably not coincidentally, the area where President Reagan owned a ranch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fDeqkC0PEtg/S9nnwaCzFFI/AAAAAAAAADE/lfW9pjZ6IWY/s1600/spidey2b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;width:320px;height:181px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fDeqkC0PEtg/S9nnwaCzFFI/AAAAAAAAADE/lfW9pjZ6IWY/s320/spidey2b.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A few on-screen lasers are benign, contributing to the goal of generating clean non-polluting energy by fusing hydrogen nuclei into helium, as happens in the Sun. The latest attempt to do this on Earth is to bombard hydrogen with terawatts of ultraviolet light from the world’s most powerful lasers, located at the National Ignition Facility, Livermore National Laboratory, California. The same idea shows up, though confusedly, in Chain Reaction (1996), where a laser somehow extracts energy from the hydrogen in water. And in Spider-Man 2 (2004), physicist Dr. Octavius (Alfred Molina) initiates fusion with lasers. But the film can’t resist throwing in a touch of disaster. Instead of helping humanity, the reaction runs amok and wrecks Octavius’ lab.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Science fiction films thrive on disaster and we probably won’t be seeing many on-screen examples of beneficial uses such as laser fusion and laser surgery, though these dominate the history of lasers  (development of laser weapons continues, however). But we won’t miss them as long as we can hear that destructive but satisfying, or should I say electrifying, science fictionish “zap” – even though real lasers are generally silent; and even though nothing, laser or not, can be heard in space.                             &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/TGMvadAFqLQ%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-3028578712441666674?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Early in my blogging "career" I wasted thousands of words expressing my incredulity at his horrible health advice, his paranoid rants, and his shameless hucksterism.  Then I saw something shiny and forgot about him for a while.  But now blog bud &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence"&gt;Orac &lt;/a&gt;has ruined my reverie.  He informs me that &lt;a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/health_guru_nearly_killed_eating_hGIit27zRFN0UP3eMLWgKL"&gt;Gary Null took a dose of his own medicine---and nearly died.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a compassionate human being, I can only hope he recovers quickly with no serious sequelae.   As a physician, educator, and writer, I hope we can use this as an object lesson in the dangers of idiotic medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happened?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the news reports, it appears that Null suffered the toxic effects of too much vitamin D, a condition known as "hypervitaminosis D".  Vitamin D has multiple, complex effects on our physiology.  One of the primary affects of vitamin D is on blood concentrations of calcium and phosphorus.  Excessive amounts of vitamin D cause calcium to be released from bone into the blood, which can lead to constipation, kidney stones, and other more serious problems.  When the both phosphorus and calcium levels are sufficiently elevated, they can precipitate in the skin leading to a condition called "calciphylaxis" which looks and behaves like a serious (often deadly) burn injury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;Gary Null, the famous guru of fake medicine&lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/04/28/2010-04-28_my_health_mix_almost_killed_me_supplement_nearly_fatal_sez_suit_vs_manufacturer.html" style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;, said that after starting a supplement called "Gary Null's Ultimate Power Meal"&lt;/a&gt; he developed extreme fatigue, pain, blood in the urine, and was in pretty bad shape. A work up revealed him to have vitamin D toxicity. Apparently, &lt;a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/health_guru_nearly_killed_eating_hGIit27zRFN0UP3eMLWgKL" style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;he wasn't the only one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;Hypervitaminosis D does not occur naturally. Most cases in the literature are due to errors in food manufacturing. A study in the 1950&amp;#39;s followed a group of monkeys who received feed accidentally over-supplemented with vitamin D. &lt;a href="http://ajph.aphapublications.org/cgi/reprint/85/5/656" style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;An outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/326/18/1173" style="text-decoration:underline"&gt; in humans&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990s was linked to a dairy which accidentally over-fortified its milk. The new outbreak that nearly did in Mr. Null seems to follow the same pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did this happen?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.garynull.com/home/my-response-to-recent-media-reports.html" style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Gary Null's Ultimate Power Meal&lt;/a&gt; was apparently manufactured and distributed with an erroneously high vitamin D content.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/us/26expat.html"&gt;mounting frustration&lt;/a&gt; over taxation and banking problems, small but growing numbers of overseas Americans are taking the weighty step of renouncing their citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for today, let’s talk about you and what you would do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of what country(ies) are you a citizen? Would you ever consider renouncing your citizenship? Or would you be more prone to try to resolve the problems at home? What issues would have to arise for you to renounce? Taxation? Banking problems? Libel issues? Cookie prohibition?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green isn’t the first color that comes to mind when you think of your period, but should it be? The average woman trashes 300 pounds of feminine hygiene products in her lifetime. That’s a lot of (gross) garbage. According to &lt;a href="http://www.thegreengirls.com/blog/post/2010/04/The-Environmental-Impact-of-Everyday-Things.aspx"&gt;The Green Girls&lt;/a&gt;, the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm studied the environmental impact of pads and tampons from start to ugly finish, and found that the greatest impact was caused in the production phase. Specifically, the processing of raw materials and production of plastics used on the back of pads and in tampon applicators seemed to be the most damaging Even though it seems like there is more plastic in tampons, pads actually have more of an environmental impact because of their plastic components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, not surprisingly, the worst part of a tampon is the plastic applicator. Though the cotton used in tampons requires lots of water, fertilizers and pesticides, the fossil fuel use in production is still more harmful to the environment. Moreover, it can take applicators 25 years to break down in the ocean, and once they are broken down, they can kill ocean wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what to do? Even environmentally conscious women get their periods. If you don’t want to get too radical, you can stick with tampons and use organic, applicator-free versions. If you’re willing to go a little further, you can check out a menstrual cup, or a reusable cloth pad.&lt;/p&gt;

Adenosine receptors are emerging as relevant drug targets for a variety of disorders including Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease, and there is interest in discovering new ligands that bind to them. Among adenosine receptor subtypes, the A2A receptor is one of the few GPCRs whose crystal structure is available. Thus the A2A is amenable to structure-based design efforts, and virtual screening is an especially attractive endeavor in this regard.In the present report, a team of researchers from NIH and UCSF led by Brian Shoichet, John Irwin and Kenneth Jacobson use virtual screening to discover new ligands for the A2A. There are several points to note here. The authors use the ZINC library of drug like molecules to dock about a million and a half compounds into the binding pocket of the A2A crystal structure. They pick the best-scored 500 (0.035% of the total) ligands and investigate their fit in the binding site. Using criteria like electrostatic and VdW complementarity and novelty of chemotype, they finally select 20 of these 500 hits and test them in assays. Out of these 20, 7 inhibited binding by more than 40% at 20 μM concentration, thus constituting a hit rate of 35%. While the compounds formed the same kinds of interactions as some other A2A ligands, they were also relatively diverse in structure. The ligands were also tested in aggregation-based screens to determine that their activity was not a spurious artifact of aggregation-based inhibition.This is a pretty good hit rate. Generally virtual screening campaigns are lucky to have a hit rate of a few percent. Curiously, the authors also found a similarly high hit rate during a past VS campaign against the well-known β2 adrenergic receptor. What could be responsible for this high hit rate against GPCRs? The reasons are interesting. One reason could be that GPCRs are very well adapted to bind small molecules in compact pockets, enclosing them and forming many kinds of productive interactions. But more intriguingly, as the authors have noted earlier, there is &amp;quot;biogenic bias&amp;quot; in favor of certain target-specific chemotypes in commercial libraries that are screened, both during VS as well as HTS. This in turn reflects the biases of medicinal chemists in picking and synthesizing certain kinds of chemotypes based on the importance of drug targets and past successes in hitting these targets. GPCRs clearly are enormously important, and GPCR-friendly ligand chemotypes thus constitute a large part of screening libraries. These chemotypes are much more prevalent than those for kinases or ion channels for instance.This observation has both positive and negative implications. The positive implication is that one is likely to keep finding high hit rates for GPCRs using VS. However, the negative implication is that one is also going to be constrained by biogenic bias, and this might preclude finding more diverse and entirely novel subtypes. Thus, while VS campaigns for GPCRs might find a good number of hits, the novelty of these hits might not always be satisfying. One other quite intriguing point emerging in this study is that the kind of hits found (agonist, inverse agonist, antagonist etc.) reflects the ligand which the target structure used for VS is co-crystallized with. Thus the A2A houses an antagonist in the binding site, leading to a preponderance of antagonists in the top docking hits. Indeed, agonists ranked abysmally low in the list.GPCR ligand discovery is one of the most important goals in drug discovery. This and other similar studies demonstrate that, with all its caveats, VS can be productively used to mine for new GPCR drugs.Carlsson, J., Yoo, L., Gao, Z., Irwin, J., Shoichet, B., &amp;amp; Jacobson, K.

Functional metagenomics is one approach to solving this problem; however, screening methods are limited by their dependence on a host organism to facilitate the expression of genes from environmental DNA (eDNA).  To overcome the limitations of relying on a single host organism, Craig et al.* examined six unique Proteobacteria hosts for functional metagenomic screening. To construct  soil eDNA libraries, they blunt-ended the isolated DNA with the End-It™ DNA End-Repair Kit, ligated it into a cosmid vector, packaged the DNA using MaxPlax™ Lambda Packaging Extracts, and transformed TransforMax™ EC100 Electrocompetent E. coli. The eDNA libraries were then used to transform each of the six hosts being studied, and the resulting libraries were screened for antibacterial activity, or altered pigment or morphology. Cosmid DNA from selected colonies was electroporated into TransforMax™ EPI300 Electrocompetent E. coli, and each cosmid clone was analyzed by 454 sequencing.From this initial broad-host-range functional metagenomic study, Craig et al. demonstrate that some surrogate expression hosts will be better suited to using foreign genetic material than others. They conclude that continued exploration of phylogenetically diverse bacteria as hosts for functional metagenomic screening is likely to identify additional strains that will be suitable for eDNA functional metagenomics.*Craig, J. et al.

&lt;p&gt;They’re declaring May 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2010 a citywide Day of Reason:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/NOSHA-Day-of-Reason-May-2010.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/NOSHA-Day-of-Reason-May-2010.jpg" alt="" title="NOSHA Day of Reason May 2010" width="550" height="791"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Whereas&lt;/strong&gt;, the City of New Orleans is renowned for its food, festivals, famous citizens and foreign visitors; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whereas&lt;/strong&gt;, the City Council takes great pride in paying tribute to events and activities; now, therefore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be IT PROCLAIMED BY THE CITY OF NEW ORLEANS that the Council recognizes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a citywide DAY OF REASON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the name of and by the authority vested in the Council of the City of New Orleans
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all possible because of the efforts of the &lt;a href="http://www.nosha.info/"&gt;New Orleans Secular Humanist Association&lt;/a&gt; and their president, &lt;strong&gt;Harry Greenberger&lt;/strong&gt;.  It’s really amazing the response they’re getting from the local government.  This &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/05/05/new-orleans-declares-this-thursday-citywide-day-of-reason/"&gt;isn’t the first time&lt;/a&gt; they’ve gotten a citywide Day of Reason approved, either!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the proclamation and the day, NOSHA is invited local supporters to party it up (for free!) that night at The Monkey Hill Bar.  There will be games, a fun quiz, and prizes.  All &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/National-Day-of-Reason-Flyer.pdf"&gt;the details are here&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;In front, a boulder upon which I found cupmarks. Behind, a Bronze Age burnt mound consisting of fire-cracked stones.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to study the landscape situation of something you need to know precisely where it is. This poses a problem when it comes to Bronze Age sacrificial finds, because they are almost never made by someone who can document the find spot. They used to be found by farmers and workers before anybody owned a map and before there was a national grid, and they are no longer found much at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sacrificial finds, or "deposits", are defined by two negatives: they are not in graves and not at settlements. Typically they are in a bog or river, or rarely by the side of a large boulder, or even more rarely just sitting on a dry ridge somewhere. In order to find them you need to dredge, ditch, reclaim, plough and dig enormous amounts of random earth and sediment. Do that in temperate Europe, and sooner or later you will find a Bronze Age deposit - provided you're using a spade, not a mechanical excavator, or walking behind a horse-drawn plough, not riding a tractor in front. And archaeologists have never had the inclination or resources to dig randomly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody reclaims land in Sweden any more, no rivers are dredged for transportation purposes, nobody digs with a spade (unless they're archaeologists) and nobody walks behind the plough. And so we don't find these deposits any more. For most of the ones in the museum collections, we know only which hamlet in which parish produced each of them, but not which part of the hamlet's land. And that sort of information is difficult to use on a landscape scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a great time today checking up on five finds in Södermanland where we're lucky enough to know pretty well where they came from. Three are in the upper reaches of River Nyköpingsån between Lake Långhalsen and Christineholm manor. Two are on ridge tops east of Lake Sillen in Vårdinge parish. I've walked around, looked at sites, gotten to know the lay of the land, searched in the plough soil ("fieldwalking") and taken a lot of photographs. I found some knapped quartz, a grindstone and a piece of slate whetstone (as usual). But I left them where they were since they didn't really tell me anything useful and I didn't feel like contributing to the collective amassing of humdrum data today. I did make one really nice find though: checking a boulder on a known Bronze Age settlement site with burnt mounds I discovered eight cupmarks, and that was without removing any moss. Strange that the surveyor didn't find them back in the day. Judging from the dearth of known cupmarks in Vårdinge, I guess s/he was probably not very aware of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2010/04/landscape_archaeology_muddy_bo/P1010905lores.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="P1010905lores.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encountered an elk, a lizard or slow worm, a flock of deer, sundry birds and a disgruntled gentleman farmer who didn't like my walking on his sprouting wheat. I found a tree-house ruin, a satanic graffiti mural, many beaver-gnawed trees and a morel. It was a good day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are very few scientifically literate, evidence-based and openly secular MPs in parliament. Dr Evan Harris has been the LibDem MP for Oxford West and Abingdon since May 1997 and is standing again at this election. I've never voted LibDem but I do support him for his work on scientific research, medicine, free speech, equality and secularism. He backed Simon Singh in his libel case and has actively supported Skeptics in the Pub, a group I belong to - most recently in our 1023 homeopathy campaign. He is the LibDem spokesman for science and serves on Parliament's Human Rights Select Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;False balance is the scourge of science reporting, and in &lt;em&gt;The Vaccine Wars&lt;/em&gt;, we see how it’s possible to represent both sides without misleading viewers. The &lt;em&gt;Frontline&lt;/em&gt; documentary, which first aired Tuesday, devotes about 60% of its time to the researchers and experts who are best qualified to speak. That leaves about 22 minutes for vaccine rejectionists to convince viewers how misguided and poorly informed they truly are. It was more than enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what the reality-based community sees as a virtue is also the biggest complaint that anti-vaccine activists have about the show – that writer/producer Jon Palfreman ignored their “experts”, and falsely portrayed the story as scientists versus parents. “Where are the doctors and scientists who support our community and support the idea that vaccines may be a trigger for autism?” &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jenny-mccarthy/ifrontlineis-the-vaccine_b_555785.html"&gt;opined Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; the very next day in Huffington Post, “In Frontline’s world, they don’t exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy’s science adviser, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/pbs-frontline-show-about_b_554691.html"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon chimed in&lt;/a&gt;: “You interviewed me, you spent hours with &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/123/1/e164"&gt;Dr. Robert Sears&lt;/a&gt; of the deservedly-illustrious Sears family and you spoke to other doctors who support parents in their desire to find out what went wrong and why it’s going wrong and what we might do to prevent &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1576829-1,00.html"&gt;this true epidemic&lt;/a&gt;.” Gordon reportedly sat at McCarthy’s side during her interview, slightly out of frame. His absence was both poignant and illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the breathless complaints from McCarthy and others of her angry mob reminded me of something that &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Birth-Cool-Miles-Davis/dp/B00005614M/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1272565056&amp;amp;sr=8-3-spell"&gt;jazz great Miles Davis&lt;/a&gt; once said:  “Don’t play what’s there. Play what’s not there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With enough practice, most of us can keep a beat or carry a tune, but it takes an artist to play what isn’t there. The silence that bookends a note reveals as much, if not more, than the sound that you hear, the difference between noise and music. For a writer, recognizing what does and does not belong is the difference between stenography and journalism. Only a flack cares about including every voice in equal measure, with no regards for what is being said. To truly inform, some voices are best unheard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not always about what you put in. It’s also about what you leave out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had, until quite recently, always held &lt;em&gt;The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe&lt;/em&gt; podcast in high esteem. It was usually entertaining, frequently skeptical, and the information presented was often correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, that reliability has now all but crumbled completely away. I first noted this disintegration when I was listening to an episode a few weeks ago. They were, as they often do, discussing fake foreign accents — a topic of grave concern, and far reaching implications. They were unified in their disdain for “Brian Dunning’s terrible German accent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received a number of reports that they repeated this charge during the recent live recording during the NECSS conference. Suspiciously, this specific line was edited out of their broadcast version. The point at which the edit was made can be heard during their obligatory “fake German accent” segment of &lt;a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/skepticsguide/skepticast2010-04-17.mp3"&gt;that show&lt;/a&gt;, which begins at approximately 47:30.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that I did not recall ever attempting a German accent in any public forum; except once, seventeen years ago, which can be heard in the last five seconds of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3g_4r8Z0fo"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious to know the source of this bizarre claim, I turned Skeptoid’s impressive resources loose. And, with such a powerful weapon brought to bear, the true facts were soon uncovered. Does Brian Dunning indeed have a terrible German accent? Read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some months ago, I was contacted by Richard Saunders of &lt;em&gt;The Skeptic Zone&lt;/em&gt; podcast for a small favor. He was doing a piece on Samuel Hahnemann, the inventor of homeopathy. The piece was to be in the form of “The Diary of Samuel Hahnemann”. Richard asked me to record a short introduction, which I did, in which a fanciful tale was told: That Hahnemann’s diary had recently been discovered. This introduction was presented in my normal Skeptoid speaking voice, and can be heard at 27:30 in &lt;a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/skepticzone/the_skeptic_zone_71_100226.mp3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Skeptic Zone&lt;/em&gt; #71&lt;/a&gt;. I sent the introduction to Richard, and then thought no more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the show was completed and came out, my introduction was followed by a satirical, comical German-accented voice of Hahnemann reading from his diary. I heard one listener describe the voice as similar to that of Dr. Strangelove. Clearly, this was what had so rocked &lt;em&gt;The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe&lt;/em&gt; and sent them into their insane, self-destructive spiral of obsession with fake German accents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:210px"&gt;&lt;img title="richard_saunders_theone" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/richard_saunders_theone.jpg" alt="Richard Saunders, the actual perpetrator" width="200" height="200"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Saunders, the actual perpetrator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who had recorded that voice? I made some inquiries, and it became clear that a misinformation campaign was afoot. I was pointed down a number of false trails by &lt;em&gt;Skeptic Zone&lt;/em&gt; contributor Kylie Sturgess: &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-pseudo-scientists/id300912635"&gt;The Pseudo Scientists&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.youngausskeptics.com"&gt;Young Australian Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;em&gt;Skeptic Zone&lt;/em&gt; presenter Dr. Rachael Dunlop. Finally, I went straight to the source, and asked Richard directly who had performed Hahnemann’s voice. I give here his emailed reply in its entirety:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ummm…. me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mystery was thus solved, and SGU’s claim was rent asunder. In that same moment, I was exonerated, and resumed my place as a shining beacon of unerring infallibility, tolerance, and sensitivity to all foreign accents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repercussions have been staggering. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Bandershot#p/u/5/mDxQ272yPvs"&gt;A YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; reveals that SGU host Dr. Steven Novella does not practice medicine, and has been both disbarred and defrocked. Listeners are reeling from the controversy, and it’s now widely acknowledged that &lt;em&gt;The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe&lt;/em&gt; can no longer be trusted to provide unbiased or well-researched information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, rest in peace, SGU. You had a good run, but failed to recognize the need for at least rudimentary quality control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.S. for the uninitiated reader – This post is all in fun. &lt;em&gt;The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe&lt;/em&gt; is awesome. The basic facts of this case are true, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.P.S. – In another &lt;em&gt;Skeptic Zone&lt;/em&gt; episode I recorded an announcement of Richard Saunders’ upcoming visit to California, in a burlesque Australian accent that purported to be Richard’s own voice. This was widely panned as a horrible Australian accent. However, in my own defense, it was not actually intended as an impersonation of Richard or of any real Australian accent, but rather as a parody of the popular American stereotype of what we think Australians sound like. And, in that context, I still maintain that it was impeccable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Brian Dunning</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272562369419"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=14838">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c0c4d6dc8b2868b0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="DeathfromtheSkies!"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><category term="2005YU55"/><category term="Arecibo"/><title type="html">Armageddon delayed by at least a century… this time</title><published>2010-04-29T16:51:06Z</published><updated>2010-04-29T16:51:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/WiRSFliXiwQ/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/29/armageddon-delayed-by-at-least-a-century-this-time/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;What does a one-in-ten-million chance of apocalypse look like? Well, it &lt;strong&gt;used&lt;/strong&gt; to look &lt;a href="http://www.naic.edu/~pradar/asteroids/2005YU55/"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.naic.edu/~pradar/asteroids/2005YU55/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/2005yu55.jpg" alt="2005yu55" title="2005yu55" width="552" height="248"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is asteroid 2005 YU55, a near-Earth object (or NEO) that also happens to be a PHA, or potentially hazardous asteroid. It has an orbit which intersects the Earth, which means that someday it could possibly hit us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now before you panic — and I’ll make this clear: &lt;strong&gt;DON’T PANIC&lt;/strong&gt; — that doesn’t mean you’ll wake up tomorrow to see flaming death streaking across the sky. Think of it this way: when you walk to the local convenience store to get a squishy, you have to cross the street. The path you take intersects the street, but as long as you don’t try to occupy the same spot as a moving car, you won’t get hit. Same with PHAs: their orbits cross the Earth’s orbit, but space is big. As long as the Earth and the asteroid aren’t at the same place at the same time, we’re OK.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Since we don’t know the orbits of these objects perfectly, we assign a probability they will hit us over some period of time. Up until recently, YU55’s chance of hitting us over the next century was calculated to be about 1 in 10,000,000, which is reasonably close enough to 0 for me. However, it’s always good to get better data. In this case, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good: new observations have eliminated the chance that YU55 will ruin our day for at least a century to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YU55 was observed with the monster 300 meter (1000 foot) Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. Arecibo can send little radar pings into space, aimed at an asteroid. The pings reflect off the rock, come back to Earth, and the timing of each one can be logged. This tells us how far away the asteroid is, how big it is, and even (by carefully measuring the different arrival times of the pings back on Earth) the shape of the asteroid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds familiar, that’s because this is how dolphins and bats sense their environment. They use sound, not light, but the principle is the same. So what did Arecibo tell us when it dolphinated YU55?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the orbit of the asteroid was nailed down better, and that 1 in 10,000,000 chance of an impact in the next century dropped to 0. Nada. Nil. And astronomers are so confident of that they removed YU55 from their Risk Page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’re safe from YU55 ruining our day for quite some time at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s good, because, as it turns out, YU55 is bigger than expected: about 400 meters (a quarter mile) across, twice as large as previous estimates showed! Something that big hitting us at orbital speeds would explode with the force of a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of nuclear weapons — a few thousand megatons, or a &lt;em&gt;hundred&lt;/em&gt; times the yield of the largest bomb ever detonated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, yay! It won’t hit us, and that’s by any definition &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the middlin’ bad news is that this also means is that it’s tough to get good size estimates for asteroids without this technique. Usually, the size of a rock is determined by measuring how bright it is. A bigger asteroid reflects more light, and by measuring how well it reflects sunlight we can estimate the size. But that doesn’t always work so well, as YU55 is telling us. Clearly, we need to use multiple methods to get the sizes of these guys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arecibo’s funding is constantly under attack, yet it’s the best machine we have to get the sizes of and, more importantly, accurate orbits for these potentially life-threatening objects. YU55 is off the list now, but there’s a long line of rocks ready and waiting to take its place there.&lt;/p&gt;

Direct evolution of new tRNAs able to carry &amp;#39;new&amp;#39; amino-acids, combined with codon extension to the 4th base has provided us with the ability to expand the chemical functionality of proteins by introducing new chemical moieties into their backbone. More importantly, we can do this in a genetically-heritable fashion. This new variety of protein opens several avenues for synthetic biology. Here, I spotlight two new non-natural reporter proteins.

a reporter for infrared spectroscopy

The non-natural amino-acid p-azido-l-phenylalanine (azF) vibrates in a window which is free from other protein vibration, this feature has been exploited to create a new infrared protein probe by incorporating azF into a G-coupled Protein Receptor (Rhodopsin). This allow to study GPCR&amp;#39;s conformational changes by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. Upon the receptor activation, early conformational changes were observed.

non-natural red bioluminescence

The non-natural amino-acid 4-methoxy-phenylalanine has been incorporated into the position F82 of the reporter aequorin, resulting in a significant (44 nm) red-shift of the aequorin bioluminescence.

Conceptualizing nature: The ecosystem services concept (in particular, the stock-flow framework) is only one of many ways to understand the functioning of ecosystems. By simplifying our understanding in this way, we under-appreciate the complexity of natural systems, and therefore under-value the effort and costs of effectively managing them.2. Partial equilibrium vs. general equilibrium: Valuation of and payments for ecosystem services have been framed in a partial-equilibrium framework that assumes all “others things are equal,” which ignores the cumulative impacts of global economic activity: “the more significant one thinks our environmental problems are, the more inappropriate has been the partial equilibrium and project-by-project approach for utilizing the concept of ecosystem services.”3. The concept of achieving conservation through payments for ecosystem services arose during a “period of faith in markets with little public guidance weakened regulation.” The author argues that the recent economic crisis should cause us to revisit the tenets of environmental governance, including this reliance on markets. Citing research by such luminaries as Coase and Ostrom, Norgaard argues that the economics community “should be focusing on the combination of markets and institutions that best reach social goals given transaction costs.”Norgaard acknowledges the earnest efforts of those who promote ecosystem services, none of whom argues that “our environmental problems are few, small and local, [or] that the global institutions needed for sustainability are largely in place.” Projects based on ecosystem services can help move the needle, but they also must recognize the ultimate importance of the big-picture view, and the governance institutions that are needed.Norgaard, R.

He left this lengthy comment as a response to my recent post on this comment by McClellan and King in Cell, and I felt it warranted promotion to a full post (with Kai&amp;#39;s permission). For more discussion of the M&amp;amp;K review see also two recent posts by Steve Turner at Getting Genetics Done, and an excellent post from p-ter at Gene Expression. A similar version of this comment is also published at Getting Genetics Done. I&amp;#39;ve done some mild editing here for clarity, added some sub-headings and links, and deleted two statements that could be regarded as ad hominem arguments. None of these changes affect the substance of Kai&amp;#39;s argument.Citation: McClellan, J., &amp;amp; King, M. (2010). Genetic Heterogeneity in Human Disease Cell, 141 (2), 210-217 DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2010.03.032Quite a few people mentioned to me about the McClellan et al paper and the related Internet posts about it (including those in Genetic Future). Discussion on at least three diseases in the paper (hearing loss, SCA and autism) cited some of my published papers, and I therefore decided to post my comments on the Internet, to set the records straight. Although I whole-heartedly agree that rare variants play a substantial role in human diseases, I also think that the section on GWAS reflects misunderstandings of the concept of GWAS, ignorance of standard practices in GWAS, misinterpretation of published primary research data, and as a result, is misinforming the general readership of Cell. These issues need to be rectified for the good of the scientific community, and for the healthy development of methodology and practice of human genetic research.  For impatient readers, these are the major points: GWAS interrogate disease loci through linkage disequilibrium, so the lack of known biological function on GWAS SNPs does not justify the attack against GWAS by McClellan et al; Methods for adjusting population stratification are well established in the GWAS community; it is not a valid argument to explain most GWAS signals (with odds ratio less than 2) by stratification, especially if family-based study design is used (including the autism GWAS); McClellan et al used rs4307059 (from autism GWAS) as a &amp;quot;particularly dramatic&amp;quot; example of stratification because its frequency varies across Europe and it is monoallelic in Africa, which is not scientifically and statistically justified. In fact, it is the nature of SNPs to have differing allele frequencies across populations, and almost half of the SNPs in Illumina array have higher Fst population divergence values than rs4307059 (that is, half the SNPs are more variable than rs4307059 across human populations). Below I elaborate these points more specifically for interested readers.  Read the rest of this post... | Read the comments on this post......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Happy Thursday.

Very pleased to be filling in for Sheril this month. These are big shoes to fill, to say the least.  During my  time with you, I hope my writings provide a bit of inspiration, provocation, or, failing that, some entertainment to brighten your day. All I ask in return is that you keep doing what you do so well here: share your ideas and comments.

Some of you (two, three?) may know me as the Science Cheerleader, a persona who advocates--and creates  mechanisms--for public participation in science and science policy.  These are broad terms with multiple definitions, depending on the author's intention. Let's dive right into one of this author's intentions: to create a way for citizens and experts to participate in assessments of emerging technologies.

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve been feeling like I’m in danger of becoming depressed again. I recognized the signs early and decided to try to prevent it by forcing myself to get out of the house more often. I told one of my best friends about it, and she is extremely religious. She offered to take me to church with her, and I accepted, partially because I was in desperate need of social interaction and partially because I’ve never actually been to a church service before and was curious as to what it would be like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past Sunday, the sermon concluded by telling church members to do more to “spread the word of God,” to “pray for their neighbors who hadn’t accepted Christ as their savior,” and to “bring their non-Christian friends to church.” I was extremely offended by this and, after looking back on the previous week, began to suspect that my friend might have invited me solely to convert me (we had briefly touched on her religious devotion and my atheism before). When she asked me why I was upset later, I explained to her that I felt that praying for people to become Christian was very condescending and that attempting to convert people interfered with their freedom of religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She then began to quote the Bible at me and told me that she just wanted other people to feel the love and acceptance of Christ. When I asked if she had considered that some people might feel they get this love and acceptance from a different god or that some people might not even need or want that love and affection, she basically told me that she wouldn’t tolerate any other religious beliefs. She was so closed-minded and intolerant about it that it scared me. Before she became this religious, she was one of the most open-minded, logical people I knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dilemma is this:  I don’t know whether I should go back to church with her or not this Sunday. On the one hand, I am still in desperate need of social interaction, and she is willing to help me in whatever way she can. I also know that she’ll ask why I don’t want to go, and I don’t want to risk upsetting her by explaining it.  On the other hand, this new religious side of her scares me, and if she’s trying to convert me, I don’t want to continue to go to church. I’m also offended by some of the content discussed in church and don’t know if it’s worth the social interaction. And if I decide not to go to church, what should I tell her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a Loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear At a Loss,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I’m impressed that you’re intervening to prevent another episode of depression. It is something to take seriously, and having an assertive attitude about taking care of it is a good predictor that you will succeed.  Yes, getting out and being more social is one of the healthy habits that can help, along with good eating habits, good sleeping habits, regular mild exercise, avoiding alcohol and drugs, and having some kind of expressive recreation like a hobby.  If these habits are not sufficient, be open to consulting a doctor for possible medication and &lt;em&gt;secular&lt;/em&gt; counseling. With the willingness and determination to do whatever it takes, depression can be managed; if you don’t manage it, it manages you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression can make you vulnerable to the manipulations of others. Subtle thoughts of having little or no self worth can cause you to think that you’re lucky to have any friends at all, so you put up with friends who aren’t necessarily good for you. They can also reduce your ability to be assertive and to say no to doing things you’d rather not do.  Subtle, pessimistic thoughts about how various solutions probably won’t work can cause you to desperately reach for solutions that are very unlikely to work or have lots of strings attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that your initial suspicions were right.  Your friend’s main motive for urging you to attend her church was revealed by the marching orders given to the congregation at the end of the sermon. There is most likely continuous pressure to bring in new converts, and plenty of praise for doing so.  Later, during your quite skillful discussion of your objections, she disclosed her intolerance for differing beliefs, her tunnel vision focus on evangelizing, and her disregard of  the actual problem that you have.  She “just wanted other people to feel the love and acceptance of Christ.” Yes, and I suspect that she also really wants that to happen through &lt;em&gt;her efforts.&lt;/em&gt; You’re a trophy to win for ego and prestige.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think your depression is whispering lies to you. It’s telling you that you have few options for social relations when you probably have several that you haven’t considered. It’s telling you that friends with ulterior motives are the best you’re going to get. It’s telling you to not risk upsetting your friend by clearly explaining what you need and what you &lt;em&gt;definitely don’t need.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You say “she is willing to help me in whatever way she can.” Okay, then ask her to help you in ways that have nothing even remotely to do with religion or the church, and you’ll either get the help, or you’ll see that her willingness is much more conditional than she admits. If she comes through, great. Then I am wrong in my assessment of her, and I’m glad. If not, move on.  Either way, it is absurd for you to even consider going back to that church, since you found the content to be so inappropriate and offensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should you tell her? “Thank you, but that’s not for me.” Tell her briefly exactly what you think and how you feel. Don’t make it sweet or bitter, just straight forward, honest and succinct. Tell her politely but not apologetically. You need not make any apologies for not believing that stuff or for not wanting to go. If she takes offence from what you say so simply and honestly, then you’re not offending her, she’s &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; the offence inside of her.  She’ll have to handle that; it’s not yours to fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a Loss, begin by changing your name to Winner. You deserve a great deal better than having to settle for life size standup cardboard cutout friends and acquaintances at a church where you don’t even believe the first belief.  You deserve to be treated as a friend genuinely, without hidden agendas offering blanket cure-alls that benefit the salesmen rather than you. Yes, you need social interaction, but not the kind that will end up depressing you worse.  Avoid churches and bars.  Not good for atheists with a tendency toward depression.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use that clever mind of yours.  You formed incisive arguments to challenge your friend’s evangelizing and her narrow-mindedness. In the same way, challenge your own assumptions about the scarcity of your local resources, and come up with creative solutions for your social needs. Join some kind of secular group, a walking club, a naturalist club, a book club, a group working for a secular cause.  Look into a Unitarian Universalist Congregation in your area.  Their “churchyness” can vary, but many of them have large numbers of atheists and agnostics who are looking for a positive social forum just like you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have an awareness that warns you of the oncoming depression. That is a huge advantage that many don’t have. You have a bright, sensitive and articulate intellect.  &lt;em&gt;Use it&lt;/em&gt; to avoid getting stuck in the mood mud by doing all those healthy habits I mentioned at the beginning, and to debunk the defeatist thoughts that tell you that you have very few choices.  You have a much wider range of opportunities for friends and socializing than that. Find them! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are around 24,000 priests in France today, down from 42,000 in 1975. The number of Catholics entering the diocese has declined as well, from 116 ordainments in 1999 to 89 in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While 64 percent of the French population, or 41.6 million of the country's 65 million inhabitants, identifies itself as Catholic, only a little more than 2 million attend church each week, said Jacques Carton, a representative from the Bishops Conference in France. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How desperate are they? Most of the story is about how they're putting up posters and advertising on Facebook to convince young men to give up sex and commit their lives to sitting in churches and prancing through rituals. Yeah, that'll work. Why not go all the way and put personals on Craigslist? That would at least sucker a lot of people into contacting them, because they'd all assume it must be something really perverse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/lets_not_give_england_all_our.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/6bNhvXBLhfA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272554169840"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/wait_maybe_britain_needs_to_ke.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b72efd2fdb66e1d3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Wait!

The Guardian has been using a stellar pro-science panel (Goldacre and Singh, to name two members) to quiz representatives of various political parties on their science stance. They just &lt;a href="http://www.tomfooleryblog.com/2010/04/ukip-science-fail/"&gt;interviewed the United Kingdom Independence Party&lt;/a&gt;, whose representative was…Viscount Monckton of Brenchley. You have got to be kidding; that man is a raving loon. So the UKIP rejects the science of global warming, but advocates for homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite part, though, was their &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/apr/27/ukip-science-policy-general-election"&gt;position on stem cell research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wherever stem cells can be obtained by means other than the killing of very small children, it is ethical only to obtain the stem cells by means that do not involve the loss of little lives. On this basis, there is no reason why Britain should not play a leading part in stem cell research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's completely batty. Why, how can science proceed if we are not free to charge into schoolyards, butchering little tykes so we can harvest a few grams of cells from their guts? The &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/apr/27/ukip-science-policy-election"&gt;summary of their science policy&lt;/a&gt; is damning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukip is the only significant party to support homeopathy, and the only party apart from the BNP still in denial over climate change. The appointment of Viscount Monckton as a science spokesman adds to the air of a party of old British eccentrics.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Woeful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one sad bit of this lunatic party is that &lt;a href="http://www.ukip.org/content/video-zone/1572-vote-small-think-big-says-pat-condell"&gt;Pat Condell supports them&lt;/a&gt;. Say it ain&amp;#39;t so, Pat — how can anyone defend a party run by refugees from the looney bin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Justice Laws said legislation for the protection of views held purely on religious grounds cannot be justified.

This study used a cross-sectional design and a self-report measure of nutritional intake--the Fred Hutchinson Food Frequency Questionnaire.Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D).  Subjects were stratified into three groups: CES-D score of 16 or less (non-depressed), CES-D score of 16-22 (positive depression screen) and CES-D score of 22 or above (probable major depression).  No formal diagnostic interview was completed to confirm that a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depression was present. Monthly frequency of chocolate for the three groups were:non-depressed: 5.4 servings per monthpositive depression screen: 8.4 servings per monthprobable depression: 11.8 servings per monthChocolate consumption was not explained by a relative consumption of other nutrients.  However, the CES-D group with scores of 16 or more consumed higher amounts of fat, calories, carbohydrate and caffeine.  These amounts were not statistically significant compared to the non-depressed group.  The authors did note that body mass index was not different between groups: 27.7 BMI vs 27.8 BMI.The authors caution that cross-sectional studies have limited ability to explain correlations and are open to spurious findings.  They note there findings are compatible with several possibilities:Depression drives craving for chocolate as a self-treatmentDepression drives craving  for chocolate for other reasonsChocolate may contribute to depressive symptomsA physiological factor could drive both depressive symptoms and chocolate consumptionA more complex undefined relationship could existI&amp;#39;d vote for the last option.Increased chocolate consumption has been noted in other disorders.  A German study found that patients with Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease had increased chocolate consumption.  The authors of this study noted chocolate has a high content of biogenic amines and caffeine like compounds that may have potential antiparkinsonian effects. To be balanced, it must be noted that other studies found positive health associations with chocolate intake.  In an older sample of Finnish men, chocolate preference as a sweet was linked to better overall health, optimism and better psychological well-being. So it seems like it is too soon to label chocolate as a major contributor to depression.  If you like chocolate, depressed or not, enjoy in moderation.  Simple pleasures are valuable and should not be abandoned. Photo of Albert Pujols Tossing Ball to Fans Behind Dugout Courtesy of Yates PhotographyRose N, Koperski S, &amp;amp; Golomb BA (2010).

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of FRONTLINE's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/the_vaccine_war_a_review.php"&gt;The Vaccine War&lt;/a&gt;, I was going to have a bit of fun with the reactions of the anti-vaccine fringe. After all, the spokescelebrity of the anti-vaccine movement, Jenny McCarthy, has posted yet another brain dead screed at--where else?--&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jenny-mccarthy/ifrontlineis-the-vaccine_b_555785.html"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;. So has everybody's favorite pediatrician to the stars and apologist for the anti-vaccine movement, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/pbs-frontline-show-about_b_554691.html"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt;. Both are incredibly target-rich environments, each worthy of its very own heapin', helpin' of not-so-Respectful Insolence. Truly, we have an embarrassment of riches here as far as blogging material goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/04/28/2010-04-28_my_health_mix_almost_killed_me_supplement_nearly_fatal_sez_suit_vs_manufacturer.html"&gt;saw something even better&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A controversial alternative health guru is suing after a taste of his own medicine nearly killed him.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.garynull.com"&gt;Gary Null&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/null.html"&gt;described on quackwatch.org&lt;/a&gt; as "one of the nation's leading promoters of dubious treatment for serious disease" - claims the manufacturer of Gary Null's Ultimate Power Meal overloaded the supplements with Vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The buff "Joy of Juicing" author, whose products include Red Stuff Powder and Gary Null's Heavenly Hair Cleaner, claims he suffered kidney damage and was left bloodied and in intense pain from two daily servings of the supplement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Null continued to take the Ultimate Power Meal, all the while thinking that it would help him, and relieve his condition; instead, it made him worse," the suit says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, I think Jenny and her likable but unscientific pediatrician with anti-vaccine tendencies, Dr. Jay Gordon, can wait. However, I haven't forgotten that he recently told a mother of a child with autism &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/JayGordonMDFAAP/status/12994340328"&gt;not to vaccinate her child's sibling&lt;/a&gt; who doesn't have autism. Either here or on my other blog, this can't go uncommented upon. In the meantime, though, the &lt;em&gt;schadenfreude&lt;/em&gt; of seeing Gary Null fall ill from his own supplements is just too rich to pass up. Part of the reason is that, thanks to his own product, Null apparently overdosed on vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't resist repeating it. &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/04/28/2010-04-28_my_health_mix_almost_killed_me_supplement_nearly_fatal_sez_suit_vs_manufacturer.html"&gt;Gary Null's own supplement apparently almost killed him&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;schadenfreude&lt;/em&gt; is just too rich.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/too_deliciously_ironic_for_words_gary_nu.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/too_deliciously_ironic_for_words_gary_nu.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/r_BQuQJvdH0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272549387622"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-1425219686907811948">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/83a60bc29159c965</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Has Noah&amp;#39;s Ark Been Found?</title><published>2010-04-29T12:31:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-29T12:33:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/AGzxPJCKmWY/has-noahs-ark-been-found.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/1425219686907811948/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=1425219686907811948" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2010/04/has-noahs-ark-been-found.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;Nope, I don't think so.

I can't tell if &lt;a href="http://restorestephenbaldwin.org/"&gt;Restore Stephen Baldwin&lt;/a&gt;, a web site dedicated to raising money for the evangelical Christian actor, is sincere or not. It&amp;#39;s just too crazy — it&amp;#39;s comparing Baldwin to Job, and shilling for donations so Baldwin can continue to preach about Jesus, despite the fact that he&amp;#39;s a hack actor whose sole affliction is that no one wants to hire him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes me most suspicious is that the guy pushing it doesn't seem to have read Job, or he wouldn't be making the comparison. Job lost everything he owned, had all of his children exterminated, and was afflicted with ghastly disfiguring diseases. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/10/science_educatorevangelist_nee.php"&gt;Baldwin was more of a joke than a charismatic evangelist&lt;/a&gt;; Job was righteous, but not a preacher on a skateboard hanging with the cool kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then…that&amp;#39;s no obstacle to believability. Most Christians ignore 99% of the Bible, anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/stephen_baldwin_is_a_modern-da.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/x9O1fF9CcOs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272548193425"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2287">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2784a6369317eb53</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Peeving"/><title type="html">Twetiquette</title><published>2010-04-29T13:20:17Z</published><updated>2010-04-29T13:20:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2287" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;According to John Metcalfe, "&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/fashion/29twitter.html?th&amp;amp;emc=th"&gt;The Self-appointed Twitter Scolds&lt;/a&gt;", NYT 4/29/2010:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;A small but vocal subculture has emerged on &lt;span&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt; of grammar and taste vigilantes who spend their time policing other people’s tweets — celebrities and nobodies alike. These are people who build their own algorithms to sniff out Twitter messages that are distasteful to them — tweets with typos or flawed grammar, or written in ALLCAPS — and then send scolding notes to the offenders. They see themselves as the guardians of an emerging behavior code: Twetiquette.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;What strikes me about this article is that complaints about spelling, grammar, and capitalization are merged — at least by Metcalfe and perhaps by the community of Twitter Scolds at large — with a wide range of other individual, cultural, and political criticisms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Among the laughers and pointers is Jacob Morse, a 27-year-old user interface designer from Richardson, Tex. Last year, he and some friends started a Web site — Tweeting Too Hard — devoted to mocking self-important Twitter users. There, people can discuss fake-humble tweets like, “I gave my cleaning lady a raise today, even though she didn’t ask, as my own little contribution to fighting the recession.” Wrote one commenter: “Let’s hope she was grateful enough to overlook the bionic condescension.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is consistent with my general take on the &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004244.html"&gt;social psychology of the new-media Gotcha Gang&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't had the time or energy in this case to watch the watchmen, to see whether their judgments are as &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000437.html"&gt;randomly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001461.html"&gt;flawed&lt;/a&gt;, from a merely factual point of view, as such interventions usually are. If you'd like to take up the task, some of the "twitter scolds" mentioned in the article are &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/grammarcop"&gt;GrammarCop&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/twenglishpolice"&gt;Twenglish Police&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a title="Twitter: Grammar Fail" href="http://twitter.com/grammar_fail"&gt;Grammar Fail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Twitter: Grammar Hero" href="http://twitter.com/grammarhero"&gt;Grammar Hero&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tweetingtoohard.com/"&gt;Tweeting Too Hard&lt;/a&gt;, and  &lt;a href="http://twitter-fail.com/"&gt; Twitter Fail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently there are many others as well. Some enterprising scholar of Peevology could no doubt get a few research publications out of this phenomenon, thus raising the process another meta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[By the way, current Google hit counts are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Fs4KYxOCvMQ%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0xe1600f%26color2%3D0xfebd01%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=580&amp;amp;height=360" width="580" height="360"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy Haleakala! If you watch carefully, you can see little hot spots flash as the gas hits the Sun again. At about 31 seconds, a thin streamer comes screaming back down; look carefully where it hits and you’ll see those spots. This animation is actually about four hours worth of images strung together.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Note the scale of this scene: it shows a region about &lt;em&gt;100,000 km (60,000 miles) across!&lt;/em&gt; The Earth would easily fit under the arch of this rising gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh– before you ask, that dark hair-like thing is a piece of dust or some other detritus in the SDO camera. That’s aggravating, but I’m hoping the engineers will figure out a way of getting rid of it or at least minimizing its influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prominences like this have been seen for decades, but never in this much detail. And even though SDO has only been flying for a few weeks, it’s already solved one mystery: why the rain of gas moves more slowly than expected as it rains back down. You can’t see it in this video (but you can &lt;a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/27apr10_plasmarain/"&gt;on this page about SDO&lt;/a&gt;) but there is a layer of much hotter gas near the surface of the Sun. This gas, at about 1,000,000 Kelvin (1.7 million° F) cushions the fall of the rain, slowing it down. SDO’s high resolution and ability to measure the temperature of the gas allows astronomers to understand this phenomenon for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SDO is extremely cool, and will be providing solar astronomers with more data than they can possibly handle for decades. But that’s good! It’s always nice to have more data than less. The Sun is fiendishly complex and difficult to understand in detail, so SDO will be an incredibly useful tool to help astronomers figure out what’s what. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all: there not be anything new under the Sun, but there are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; new ways of looking at it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad news about the fight for workplace equality. Only 15 of this year’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Fortune 500 companies have woman CEOs – the same percentage as last year. Robin Marty of &lt;a href="http://www.care2.com/causes/womens-rights/blog/women-ceos-gain-no-ground-this-year/"&gt;Care2&lt;/a&gt; points out that most of the companies women lead are “women focused” companies – your food and cosmetic businesses. But Marty also points out that there are a few positive points about this year’s list. Xerox replaced one woman CEO with another – a first for the Fortune 500 companies. And almost half of the companies with female CEOs are in the top 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marty also questions what’s keeping women from succeeding to the extent that men do in business, especially since now, two women earn a business degree for every man who does. And women are steadily reaching positions of power in other sectors, including government. The answer lies in the fact that men determine who gets those CEO jobs. They occupy other high-ranking executive positions and serve on boards of directors. Marty concludes that as women continue to climb the business ladder, they will occupy more high-ranking positions, and in turn, there will be more female CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are other problems. According to &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/04/26/walmart.suit/index.html?iref=allsearch"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, employees of Wal-Mart are filing the biggest class-action employment suit in U.S. history, claiming that the retail giant paid women employees less than male employees, and offered women fewer chances for promotion. Employees also claim that women make up 70% percent of Wal-Mart’s hourly staff, but occupy less than one-third of the management positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know about you, but this just makes us more fired up to get those high-ranking positions. When imagining the board of directors that deems women unfit for CEO jobs, it’s hard to avoid the image of a lodge meeting, complete with men in thick black-rimmed glasses (the unhip kind) wondering who would cook their dinners if they started letting women into their secret club.&lt;/p&gt;

Some calls might reflect the internal emotional state of the animal, like fear or anxiety, or they can refer to an external object, agent, or event, like the presence of a predator. Rhesus monkeys, lemurs, baboons, and guinea pigs, for example, will produce calls when separated from their conspecifics or in the presence of a stranger. Howler monkeys produce specific alarm calls for avian predators, even when they have never encountered an avian predator for several generations. Vervet monkeys produce different calls in response to leopards and eagles, suggesting that the acoustic signals carry information like "predator from the ground" or "predator from the sky." The yellow-bellied marmot's alarm calls are not predator specific, but increase in rate along with the level of perceived risk. Acoustically, typical features of alarm calls include changes in tempo (rate and duration), source feature (frequency and amplitude), or filter features (vocal tract modulations).

Figure 1: Sometimes, certain calls announce the birth of the new lion prince.

Unlike other mammals, African elephants have few predators that pose significant risk to their survival. In Kenya's Amboseli National Park, elephants have been observed retreating and posturing defensively in the presence of Masaai tribesmen, who have been known to kill elephants. However, they display the same response to auditory playback of unfamiliar conspecifics, suggesting that this behavioral response may be a more general response to strangers instead of a specific response to threat.

His claim is that the manufacturer overloaded the supplement with too much vitamin D, which Null then overdosed on, causing kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Null’s career is similar to many other health guru’s, like Mercola and Kevin Trudeau – the pattern is now fairly well established. In each case we have individuals who have dubious scientific or health credentials. Null has a business degree, and then higher degrees in nutrition from “non-traditional” schools of questionable value. He has made a career selling two thing – dubious products and conspiracies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse than just selling vitamins with over-hyped claims, Null has promoted such treatments for serious illnesses. He seems to like any treatment which is rejected by mainstream medicine, justifying this by claiming that scientific medicine is all a scam – what he has called “medical genocide.” Of course, this leads him to accept and promote treatments that are rejected because they are not safe and/or do not work – the usual reason that treatments are rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, he has promoted chelation therapy for heart disease, nutritional therapy for AIDS, and many dangerous and useless cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially he tells people not to believe the medical establishment, because they are just trying to sell you something. Instead, believe his miraculous health claims and allow him to sell you something. Null, Trudeau and others have fostered as much distrust of the medical establishment as they could, just to bolster their own sales. It is even hard for me to tell how much people like Null believe their own hype. In my opinion, Trudeau is at one end of the spectrum – a con artist who sees health products and information as lucrative, and nothing else. The others are somewhere along that spectrum from true believer to huckster, but it hardly matters. They foment distrust, conspiracy theories, and bizarre ideas of health, which plays off of and reinforces the “alternative” medicine culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Null also uses the marketing ploy of claiming that his treatments are “natural”, implying that they are therefore magically safe and effective. This is the most ironic aspect of his lawsuit – that he claims serious organ damage due to one of his own natural products. He has even &lt;a href="http://www.gnhealth.com/newsletters/2.php"&gt;advised megadoses of vitamins in the past&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antioxidants A, C, and E are good for inflammation and free radical damage:&lt;br&gt;
Dosages for C may range from 2,000 to 20,000 mg per day and can be taken in divided amounts throughout the day (according to bowel tolerance)&lt;br&gt;
Orally, 400IU of E and 25,000IU of A (or beta carotene) may be taken to ease arthritis. In severe cases, however, megadoses may be taken intravenously (See your doctor for dosages).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intravenous megadoses of vitamin A – that’s even more dangerous than vitamin D. I like the disclaimer – “see your doctor for dosages.” Even the oral doses he lists are not safe – perhaps he should have taken his own advice. But wait – I thought all doctors were just committing “medical genocide,” but I guess they are still useful for creating legal deniability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is, you can overdose on vitamins. There is no proven benefit to megadosing any vitamin, and there are known risks – in fact we are learning more about the risks of megadosing thanks to gurus like Gary Null.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a story I hope spreads far and wide, and hopefully it will have the impact that it should have – making people question the legitimacy of self-promoting health gurus selling outrageous claims and railing against the very medical scientists who can see them for what they are.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272545020302"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=13708">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/907996aafc6093be</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Stuff You'll Like"/><category term="YouTube"/><category term="astronomy"/><category term="CASSINI"/><category term="JPL"/><category term="NASA"/><category term="Saturn"/><title type="html">Keep Your Day Job: Cassini Tour Designer</title><published>2010-04-29T12:00:32Z</published><updated>2010-04-29T12:00:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/keep-your-day-job-cassini-tour-designer/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f059cab8f4e2267933e937b2ca89070&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the first edition of a series of videos and interviews with people who have fascinating jobs in science fields.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it we go nowhere.” ~ Carl Sagan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently heard from an acquaintance that they worry that science and skepticism lacks visionaries and that science is too rigid to allow for creativity. I would happily argue that art, science and the creative process has and will continue to be tightly intertwined. Thinking outside the realms of what we know to be real is often how a hypothesis is formed. Science itself is built upon hundreds of years of people asking the question, “what if” and then using the scientific method to find the answer to that question. Much in the same way an artist would use available materials and creatively assemble those materials to create a new never-before-seen piece of art, a scientist rearranges materials and the knowledge available to him or her to find some new truth or element or create something new and fantastic in a lab. Science, though rigorous in its collection of evidence is inspired by the unbridled creative thoughts of humankind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent example of this type of creative thinking and rigorous science working together in harmony is in the exploration of outer space. Our collective imaginations are inspired when we think of the wonders of potential discoveries in the vast uncharted territories of outer space and within the newly discovered worlds light-years away from our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to run into a man who has first hand experience with the important role of creativity within the realm of scientific discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Smith is a Cassini Mission Planner at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and has been involved with the Cassini mission to Saturn and Titan since 1990. John has designed missions to explore the planets for more than two decades.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I'll talk about how in comparison with the old media, the Internet fragments and narrows the audience for science information, even as there aren't really any norms for responsible conduct--and thus, misinformation, innuendo, and general nastiness abound.

I'm sure, however, that others will have a different view. Perhaps Joe Romm will; he has just joined our roster for the event. Certainly, his blog has been a major success and demonstrates many of the upsides of science blogging.

Such debate is all to the good; it's why we're having the event in the first place. Indeed, I myself will point out some clear positives when it comes to blogging about science (I'm sure you can guess many of them).

But taken as a whole, are blogs broadening the conversation about science by reaching new audiences, replacing what has been lost in terms of science coverage in the old media, or elevating our general science discourse?

I have to say, I'm skeptical. There is no going back from this new world, but ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/4s14o3slbqnbbtt5h00bhpgldc/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fintersection%2F2010%2F04%2F29%2Funruly-democracy-what-is-wrong-or-right-with-science-blogs%2F" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272544750383"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2286">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/48b60ccf40e7d5d0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Sociolinguistics"/><title type="html">Perception test</title><published>2010-04-29T12:34:31Z</published><updated>2010-04-29T12:34:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2286" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LaborX1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="13791"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LaborX0.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="77739"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;What's the word this came from?&lt;/p&gt;

Let me ask you, where do you stand on public transportation with insufficient seating?    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unfortunate, really, because right next to it was the tree of knowledge of whether to take advice from talking snakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the number of sea shells that are freely available by the sea shore, I don’t think that’s a viable business model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked up “dictionary”, “definition”, and “alphabetical”. I think I finally understand how it works now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pal’s gas law: the closeness of two pals is proportional to the proximity to each other’s heads at which they will attempt to pass gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classic campaign slogan, updated for today’s youth: “It’s like, I like Ike, but I don’t, like, like-like Ike”.&lt;br&gt;
(&lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.ca/signusup/6408398"&gt;Get the shirt!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That guy comes across as really phony, but I bet it’s just an act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine told me he doesn’t drink beer. I wonder what he does with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the shoe fits, wear it. But only if you can find the other one as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real question is, why did they put a road through the middle of a chicken pen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that using phrases from other languages make you seem sophisticated.&lt;em&gt; Au contraire&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switched my GPS to the male voice. Got tired of it announcing turns after we’d passed them and telling me to stop and ask for directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correction: women are excellent navigators and moreover my wife is very smart and pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The air in my car is too hot whenever I get in. I guess even after all that conditioning last summer, it didn’t learn a damn thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention, skeptics: I will soon have enough evidence to prove, once a for all, that there is indeed such a thing as stupid questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey you, Avogadro. Yeah, I got your number, buddy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this order of preference: Reduce. Reuse. Recycle. Regret. Repent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Statistics” is not the plural of “anecdote”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man cannot live by bread alone. Bread, pasta sauce, and cheese, however, can sustain a bachelor indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At what point, exactly, does a question about semantics become a linguistic conundrum?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go big or go small, I always say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out the green eyed monster is only wearing expensive custom contact lenses. Rich bastard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to succeed: 1) don’t rock the boat, 2) only set goals you know you can achieve, 3) ignore 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It offends me when people describe my sense of humor as absurdist. I have absolutely nothing against the absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snoring is just the body’s way of making annoying noises while you sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you suppose it means when you dream that you haven’t finished a report that’s due at the end of the week? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever have one of those dreams where you’re running up a never-ending flight of stairs and bats keep swooping at your head? Me neither. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m only photogenic in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I have tried to carve an accurate representation of someone’s head and torso, it’s been a bust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I was wrong once. But I was mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New word: “shmorange”, which refers to a word with which no other word rhymes. For example, “orange” used to be a “shmorange”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dictionary is worth 200,000 words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casinos have a word for people with a gambling “system”. “Welcome!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: “close enough” may indeed count in both horseshoes and hand grenades, but that does not make them interchangeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As unpleasant as the sound of your own voice may be, it’s not nearly as bad as the sight of your own eyeball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/12/school-cancels-prom-instead-of-allowing-lesbian-to-attend/"&gt;administrators canceled prom&lt;/a&gt; so that lesbian student &lt;strong&gt;Constance McMillen&lt;/strong&gt; couldn’t attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, to make it worse, many of the adults and students were in on a prank against Constance in which they sent her to a &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/04/07/constance-mcmillens-fake-prom/"&gt;fake alternative prom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now comes a dilemma for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fred Phelps&lt;/strong&gt;‘ Westboro Baptist Church is &lt;a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/04/26/god-hates-fags-church-will-picket-lesbian-students-prom/"&gt;coming to town to protest&lt;/a&gt; the school’s graduation ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“[We] will picket the graduation of Itawamba Agricultural High School to remind the parents, teachers and students of this nation that God said ‘Thou shall not lie with mankind, as with womankind, it is abomination’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This generation has been raised to believe that they can live for the devil and still go to heaven, that God has no standards and the biggest lie of all — that God loves everyone.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what will the students and administrators do…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support Westboro?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; couldn’t stoop that low, could they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counter-protest Westboro, implicitly supporting Constance?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That goes against their already pathetic morality.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re caught between a rock and a hard place… do they continue fighting gay people?  Or do they fight against the people fighting gay people, even though they’ve shown they’re not that much better than the Phelps clan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I hope they take the latter route.  Amidst all the shit they’ve flung onto themselves during this whole debacle, this could be at least a slight attempt at making things right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait.  Update.  Just when you were hoping Mississippi could get its head back on straight, they fuck it up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ceara Sturgis&lt;/strong&gt; is a lesbian high school senior at &lt;a href="http://www2.mde.k12.ms.us/1500/WAC/wac.htm"&gt;Wesson Attendance Center&lt;/a&gt; who was &lt;a href="http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/index.php/site/comments/school_cuts_gay_student_photo_from_yearbook/"&gt;cut from her yearbook&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“It’s like she’s nobody there, even though she’s gone to school there for 12 years,” [mother Veronica] Rodriguez said. “They mentioned none of her accolades, even though she’s one of the smartest students there with wonderful grades. They’ve got kids in the book that have been busted for drugs. There’s even a picture of one of the seniors who dropped out of school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t get it. Ceara is a top student. Why would they do this to her?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For her senior picture, she wore a tuxedo instead of a dress.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is the petty way they’re getting back at her — by expunging her from the yearbook.  These “adults” are acting petty, immature, and homophobic.  And they’re pretending this is all for the best.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the superintendent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“We have had our legal counsel research the validity of the position of the School District on this matter,” Copiah County Superintendent Ricky Clopton said in the statement. “We are informed by counsel that this exact issue has been litigated in federal court. The decisions of the federal courts completely support the policy of the district in this regard. It is the desire of the Copiah County School District to inform, first, the patrons of the district, and second, all other interested parties, that its position is not arbitrary, capricious or unlawful, but is &lt;strong&gt;based upon sound educational policy&lt;/strong&gt; and legal precedent.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sound educational policy”?  To ostracize a student because she wears different clothing from what you expect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the kinds of lessons the administrators in that district want to pass on to students?  If the students are smart, they’ll find a way to honor Ceara in their own way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ll also do what they can to ignore the pathetic, immature “wisdom” of the officials in that district.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s a timely moment to ask: why, when it costs a country billions of pounds to host a major international sporting event, do they bother?The usual argument is that it&amp;#39;s all about the legacy - the lasting economic benefit. But according to two economists, Georgios Kavetsos and Stefan Szymanski, the evidence for this simply isn&amp;#39;t there. For example, there&amp;#39;s research showing that the economic benefit of sports-related investment is lower than for other types of investment. And the newly-created employment opportunities associated with sport are most often low-skilled and casual. Now Kavetsos and Syzmanski have tested an alternative explanation for the political appeal of big sports events: perhaps they make the population happier.Increasingly, governments are also choosing to invest huge quantities of public money in training athletes so as to boost their country&amp;#39;s chances of sporting success. The usual justification is that sports success is good for a country&amp;#39;s well being and national pride. Kavestsos and Syzmanski also tested this claim. The researchers mined the Eurobarometer Survey series, involving 12 European nations, including the UK, between the years 1974 to 2004. Twice a year, a random selection of 1000 people per country were interviewed and one of the questions was about their life satisfaction. Kavestsos and Syzmanski looked for any changes in average life satisfaction scores in surveys that took place in the Autumn following the Olympics, Football World Cup or European Cup. Specifically, they wanted to know if a country doing better than expected in a competition had any benefial effect on average life satisfaction and/or whether hosting a competition had any benefits (the data available meant the latter question was restricted to the hosting of football events).There was very little evidence that performing better than expected at a sports event had any positive benefit for the average life satisfaction scores of a country&amp;#39;s citizens. The data moved in the right direction but with one exception the effects were not statistically significant. By contrast, there was strong evidence that hosting a major international football event boosted the life satisfaction of a host nation&amp;#39;s citizens. Good news for South Africa.Just how large was the life satisfaction increase for a typical citizen in a host nation? Kavetsos and Syzmanski said it was pretty big: three times the size of the happiness boost associated with gaining a higher education; one and half times the happiness boost associated with getting married; and nearly large enough to offset the misery triggered by divorce.Is there a catch? Unfortunately, yes. By one year after the event, the benefits had gone, so the effects on people&amp;#39;s happiness were extremely short-lived (the effects of marriage on happiness, by contrast, are long-lasting).

&lt;p&gt;Questioning something that even I find rather palatable upon first reading isn’t unusual, particularly if it involves education claims. I guess I like to question even my own fervent hope that an introduction to sleight-of-hand and an understanding of ‘why illusions work’ will naturally benefit educational and health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is such a thing really a science lesson? Is it really a critical thinking lesson? Where do we find support for such claims? Perhaps I’ve just had too many promises made to me as a teacher in regards to activities or videos being cure-alls or quick-solutions – to everything from literacy levels to an understanding of science and critical thinking concepts, to even engagement in classes. Maybe it’s more of a skeptical-outlook after having Jamy Ian Swiss admit to being that ‘honest liar’ so often! &lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, just look at what Teller does here, showing his skills! Wouldn’t it be wonderful to think that attending classes by the likes of him could make young people smarter, more savvy, more self-assured and boost self-esteem? Particularly if they’re of ill-health?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docid%3D8946203098815744181%26hl%3Den%26fs%3Dtrue&amp;amp;width=358&amp;amp;height=292" width="358" height="292"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as always, it’s most likely going to take more than that, especially when you’re drawing on the scientific evidence that is replicable, rather than the hits on a video, even if it is the fantastic Teller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the ever-topical and savvy Heidi Anderson, via her blog &lt;a href="http://fatoneinthemiddle.com/2010/04/26/but-but-but-surely-you-support-boobquake-right/"&gt;‘Fat One in The Middle’&lt;/a&gt;, she has also begun an inadvertent (yet still highly relevant) discussion on communication of science concepts via  magic, in the comments of her blog-post &lt;strong&gt;‘&lt;a href="http://fatoneinthemiddle.com/2010/04/26/but-but-but-surely-you-support-boobquake-right/"&gt;But, But, But . . .  Surely YOU Support Boobquake!!! Right??&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;‘ -  as discussed by science communicator ‘TribalScientist’:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m honestly baffled as to how Wiseman’s card tricks [referring to the YouTube video of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;oi=video_result&amp;amp;cad=13727015331971142401&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CAYQtwIwAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DvoAntzB7EwE&amp;amp;ei=-T3ZS4rqAs-TkAXYgMWKDg&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEYh1wNAHN5mLULxFAxjp-RYKzybg&amp;amp;sig2=AvcpunHldD09cu3KtrzOHQ"&gt;The Colour-Changing Card Trick&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;em&gt;can be compared with Boobquake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.quirkology.com/USA/Video_ColourChangingTrick.shtml"&gt;The goal of Wiseman’s card trick clips were (I assume) to demonstrate in practical terms some simple tricks of psychology&lt;/a&gt;. They were popular because the self-evident results were fascinating and the format was useful for people to access. You’re equating the value of the opinion of a sole psychologist who claimed this was dumbing down psychology with equivalent criticisms here of a stunt that aims to promote a preformed conclusion – the tools themselves aren’t at all comparable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;…It is possible that more people will feel less intimidated by the concept of science because it’s associated with boobs. I’d hate to break it to you all, but this isn’t a big problem in the world. It’s been known for a while that the majority of people ‘like’ the concept of science. What is an issue is the level science literacy and ability to judge worthwhile science from flippant, dodgy or poorly conducted science. And it is just possible that stunts like Boobquake don’t really help in that regard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to note that even though a recent article in the &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/skepticism_via_youtube"&gt;Skeptical Inquirer seemed to equate popularity of a video as being equal to &lt;em&gt;‘&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/skepticism_via_youtube"&gt;fantastic educational resources’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;- there’s a lot not being proven by same cheering skeptics about the efficacy of this, that I’ve found?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Of course, as a blog-post that EbertChicago ‘Twittered’ recently shows, you’re hardly going to find the &lt;a href="http://www.ericmead.org/MeadWeb/Blog/Entries/2010/4/26_Dying_Art.html"&gt;dying art of cigarette magic&lt;/a&gt; being passed around as a learning tool to the kids, either! It reminded me of another study, reported on Radio National two years ago, that I still keep on my iPod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a title="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2008/2375533.htm" href="http://search.abc.net.au/search/click.cgi?url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2008/2375533.htm&amp;amp;rank=3&amp;amp;collection=abcall"&gt;Magic helps children’s confidence – Science Show – 27-September-2008&lt;/a&gt;” – in this episode, Professor Richard Wiseman discussed a pilot study – you can read the transcript for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robyn Williams:&lt;/strong&gt; You took 60 kids, 30 of both groups. What was the point?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Wiseman:&lt;/strong&gt; We were comparing the changes in self-esteem and confidence and social abilities learning magic tricks and a kind of standard self-esteem lesson they would receive in British schools. What we could see is that taking them to magic school, teaching them these tricks, getting them to perform for their friends and family was actually a very effective way…in fact more effective than a standard lesson enhancing self-esteem… I think there’s all sorts of things we can do. First of all a larger number of children, we can take our measures over a longer period of time, but also roll this out across schools and say to teachers that there’s a really interesting idea here, let’s take kids to magic school.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/web/PressOffice/PressReleases/_BAPressRelease-Wiseman.htm"&gt;The British Science Association&lt;/a&gt; has more detail on exactly which tricks were used (in fact, it even details which &lt;em&gt;‘&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three quick and simple tricks that will help boost self-esteem’&lt;/em&gt;). Of course, a &lt;a href="http://magicgizmo.com/home/General/magic-lessons-boosts-childrens-confidence.html"&gt;few media reports covered the pilot study as if it was a foregone conclusion&lt;/a&gt;. Although then I found that the sample-size kept changing, from the radio-interview’s 60 to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;em&gt;50 pupils aged between 10 and 12 at two schools in Hertfordshire&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a pilot study? Very interesting. But some of the questions I had were also reflected in this new paper I found today that is on a not-too-dissimilar topic – &lt;em&gt;“&lt;a href="http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CA8QFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpubmed%2F20361440&amp;amp;ei=1z7ZS9XgOpGTkAWB-7TzDQ&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEwoGseV_1T4IQnR8GTe54mK5iAqA&amp;amp;sig2=PyXjCbU3OBUQvDYq4Iv4cw"&gt;Magic as a Thereputic Intervention to Promote Coping in Hospitalised Pediatric Patients&lt;/a&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;‘Magic as a therapeutic intervention is used in an innovative, hospital-based program to address the psychosocial issues children and adolescents often experience as a result of illness and hospitalisation. A child life specialist and a magician with an MBA collaborated… 1) magicians using interactive, close-up magic and humor as a technique to promote socialisation, enhance self-esteem, and increase opportunities for choice and control and 2) magicians providing the personal instruction and materials that enabel chronically ill and long-term patients to learn and perform magic to promote a sense of empowerment and feeling of mastery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;While there is a lot of really enthusiastic anecdotal evidence being shown in Hart and Walton’s paper, there’s also a very strong case (particularly after looking up the examples of the use of magic in therapeutic cases via non-peer reviewed papers mentioned in the bibi&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;lography)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt; for more research on the matter. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The implications for further research at the end are encouraging for those who want to know whether practitioners are putting their ‘rabbits where their hats are’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Despite the existing anecdotal and tangential evidence that exists supporting the theraputic benefits of magic, much more quantitative and qualitative evidence is needed. Valid and reliable measurement tools must be developed to quantify the subjective quality of magic. Similarly, the role of humor in the theraputic magic interaction… the potential benefits of learning magic tricks related to self-esteem and locus of control could also prove to be an important area of exploration.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the conclusion also mentions the ‘dwindling financial resources’ for such projects and perhaps it will be a matter of such labor-intensive ventures being sidelined unless there is more support for the claims. This isn’t unusual for a great many educational and health-based practices, however, that have popular support but are struggling to get researchers, venues, facilities and funding to find whether or not they really do live up to the promises made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, considering the interaction between magic practitioners and keen skeptics out there ( many of whom are indeed invested in finding good research that supports such evidence-based claims), I’d be very happy to learn of more investigations that, as the paper says too, are scientifically rigorous.&lt;/p&gt;

The psychiatrist had recommended testing samples of saliva and urine for hormone and neurotransmitter levels, the results of which would likely indicate a need for supplements to correct deficiencies or imbalances. According to the psychiatrist, who had an academic appointment at a medical school in New York City, “I have been using these supplements with a great deal of success.” My friend is not medically or scientifically sophisticated, but this made her a little uncomfortable. In that, she was entirely justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our recent panel discussion at the &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1864"&gt;NECSS&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the audience identified himself as a clinical pathologist at a major medical center, and wondered what he might do to become involved in the good fight against encroaching pseudoscience in medical schools. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_pathology"&gt;Clinical pathology&lt;/a&gt; is the medical specialty that concerns itself, in summary, with laboratory tests—their development, their validity, their interpretation, their usefulness and, by implication, their misuse. A topic that we haven’t much featured on SBM (we touched upon it &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=76"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2815"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=272"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and probably elsewhere) is that of bogus laboratory or other diagnostic tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in my own education in modern quackery, I found it particularly distasteful not merely that quacks misuse laboratory tests, but that several commercial laboratories market misleading tests. To the untrained eye these laboratories appear to be legitimate, even to the point of their being approved by apparently legitimate certifying bodies. We’ll discuss that below, but first let’s look more closely at the psychiatrist’s recommendations to my friend’s daughter and at other examples of bogus tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Full Service Company&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my friend’s daughter had followed her psychiatrist’s recommendation, she would have sent her saliva and urine samples to a company called &lt;a href="https://www.neurorelief.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=section&amp;amp;id=12&amp;amp;Itemid=46"&gt;NeuroScience&lt;/a&gt;, which would have had them tested for certain &lt;a href="https://www.neurorelief.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=category&amp;amp;sectionid=12&amp;amp;id=41&amp;amp;Itemid=46"&gt;hormones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.neurorelief.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=category&amp;amp;sectionid=12&amp;amp;id=40&amp;amp;Itemid=46"&gt;neurotransmitters&lt;/a&gt;. The psychiatrist would have chosen those tests based on &lt;a href="https://www.neurorelief.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=310&amp;amp;Itemid=46"&gt;prompting&lt;/a&gt; by NeuroScience itself. Here’s what would have happened next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the laboratory results, NeuroScience, Inc. works with healthcare providers to develop Targeted Amino Acid Therapy (TAAT™) protocols designed to address the spectrum of neurotransmitter and hormone imbalances. Addressing neurotransmitter and hormone imbalances through TAAT™ can lead to significantly improved patient outcomes for a number of today’s most challenging conditions. Why wait? Get Started with NeuroScience, Inc. today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NeuroScience will even &lt;a href="https://www.neurorelief.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=22&amp;amp;Itemid=50"&gt;help providers&lt;/a&gt; convince insurance companies to &lt;a href="https://www.neurorelief.com/images/Physicians/cpt.pdf"&gt;pay for the tests&lt;/a&gt;. And there’s no extra waiting time, because NeuroScience sells not only the tests, but the &lt;a href="https://www.neurorelief.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=category&amp;amp;sectionid=5&amp;amp;id=67&amp;amp;Itemid=47"&gt;remedies&lt;/a&gt;. But it sells them exclusively to practitioners, who are then expected to resell them to their patients &lt;a href="https://www.neurorelief.com/images/Products/internet_product_sales_policy.pdf"&gt;for a markup&lt;/a&gt; (look &lt;a href="http://www.pnf.org/Frank_Cook_Neurotransmitters_NeuroScience_050920.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for an example of the report that the practitioner will receive). If all goes &lt;a href="https://www.neurorelief.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=133&amp;amp;Itemid=48"&gt;according to plan&lt;/a&gt;, that sweet deal will last quite a while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible to decrease chances of excitatory overload by introducing inhibitory support for one to two weeks prior to the addition of excitatory support. This 1st phase strengthens just the inhibitory system, allowing it to regain control over the excessive excitatory activity during the night. This often leads to improvements in the quality of sleep in many patients. Excitatory support is then introduced in the second phase to enhance excitatory neurotransmission throughout the day, to increase motivation and reduce fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second phase of therapy is structured in a way that mimics the body’s natural circadian rhythms. Excitatory neurotransmitter support, if needed, is typically recommended earlier in the day, when the body requires the energetic and cognitive effects of the excitatory transmitters. Likewise, inhibitory support is typically suggested in the latter half of the day, to calm the body and set the stage for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though specific amino acids can change single neurotransmitter levels rapidly, it is difficult to predict when a patient will experience symptomatic improvement. Many report improvement within the first week, whereas others may require several months of continued therapy to note significant changes. It is our experience that 3-6 months is the average amount of time it takes to optimize neurotransmitters overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition to the final phase of therapy is recommended when the patient has reached their health goals and their neurotransmitter levels have been optimized, as determined through follow-up lab tests. This phase serves as a maintenance phase, whereby the dosing of products is reduced to the minimum level that maintains the symptom resolution. The unfortunate reality of any approach to neurotransmitter imbalances is that the effects of the intervention may not be maintained with discontinuation. Due to ongoing factors that influence neurotransmitter levels, including stress, diet, and genetics, some individuals will require long-term neurotransmitter support. Hence &lt;strong&gt;the focus of the third phase is to maintain optimal neurotransmitter levels long-term to offset factors contributing to their imbalance and in the interest of preventing a recurrence of symptoms. &lt;/strong&gt;(emphasis added)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! Not only can “addressing neurotransmitter and hormone imbalances through TAAT™ lead to significantly improved patient outcomes,” it can also lead to significantly improved practitioner incomes! What a company! What doc, squeezed by diminishing 3rd-party reimbursements, wouldn’t be tempted to &lt;a href="https://www.neurorelief.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=257&amp;amp;Itemid=50"&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only a couple of problems. Hormone levels measured in saliva are almost &lt;a href="http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/600_699/0608.html"&gt;never legitimate&lt;/a&gt;. There is no physiologic reason to measure most salivary hormone levels and no generally published ranges of normal levels of hormones measured in saliva. Hormones are typically measured in blood, which makes physiologic sense; some hormones and their metabolites can usefully be measured in urine, but not for the purposes that NeuroScience claims. On the other hand, it is likely easier for NeuroScience to solicit samples when blood-drawing is not involved, and easier for the company to make assertions about “test results” that are unfamiliar to most physicians or labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even if the test results are technically accurate, I’m aware of no science that links them to non-optimal levels of hormones or neurotransmitters, other than in extreme cases such as pan-hypopituitarism or &lt;a href="https://health.google.com/health/ref/Pheochromocytoma"&gt;pheochromocytoma&lt;/a&gt; (which are quite different from what NeuroScience is claiming). Nor, even if the tests were entirely legitimate, is there any evidence that the proposed treatments will “optimize” neurotransmitter or hormone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the conflicts of interest among the seller of the tests, the wholesaler of the supplements, and the retailer of the supplements (i.e., the physician) are obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When Bogus Tests fall into the Wrong Hands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, an autistic 5 year-old boy &lt;a href="http://hcrenewal.blogspot.com/2006/11/death-of-autistic-child-chelation.html"&gt;died in the office&lt;/a&gt; of Dr. Roy Kerry in Butler County, PA, after receiving an intravenous injection of disodium EDTA, the same chelating agent that is being used in the NIH-sponsored Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=547"&gt;TACT&lt;/a&gt;). Kerry, a member of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mother of all &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=247"&gt;PPOs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the American College for Advancement in Medicine (&lt;a href="http://www.acamnet.org/site/c.ltJWJ4MPIwE/b.5420171/k.BD4C/Home.htm"&gt;ACAM&lt;/a&gt;), had given this agent to the boy ostensibly to treat “heavy metal toxicity” involving aluminum, mercury, and lead, among other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the PA medical board’s &lt;a href="http://www.circare.org/pd/kerry_ordertoshowcause_20060908.pdf"&gt;Factual Allegations&lt;/a&gt;, Kerry had used at least two bogus tests to make these purported diagnoses. The nature of the first is unclear, because in the written record Kerry described it only as “testing for the deficiency indicator.” Such vague language suggests not a legitimate blood test but, perhaps, a quack &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/electro.html"&gt;“electrodiagnostic” device&lt;/a&gt; such as the “&lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/vegatest.html"&gt;Vegatest&lt;/a&gt;” or “Electroacupuncture according to Voll.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second bogus test was a “post-provocative urine sample” collected a few hours after the first chelation treatment. This yielded an “elevated” urine lead level, but that is exactly what would &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1905148?dopt=Abstract"&gt;be expected&lt;/a&gt; for anyone who has just been treated with such a chelating agent, and is thus not indicative of true lead toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerry had also diagnosed the boy with “&lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/candida.html"&gt;candidiasis&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/allergytests.html"&gt;multiple food allergies&lt;/a&gt;,” two highly unlikely possibilities that suggest other bogus tests, such as “&lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/cyto.html"&gt;cytotoxic testing&lt;/a&gt;” or the paranormally-based &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/ak.html"&gt;applied kinesiology&lt;/a&gt;. He may or may not have used these tests, but such “diagnoses” are &lt;a href="http://www.circare.org/tact/tact_tableindex.htm"&gt;common among quacks&lt;/a&gt; who preach “detoxification” or who belong to the ACAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Commercial Laboratory Hall of Shame&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not told the name of the laboratory that Kerry used for the “&lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/urine_toxic.html"&gt;provocative urine test&lt;/a&gt;,” but it was likely &lt;a href="http://www.doctorsdata.com/home.asp"&gt;Doctor’s Data, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; (DDI), a company with a &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/doctors_data.html"&gt;long history&lt;/a&gt; of dubious offerings. DDI and another company, &lt;a href="http://www.genovadiagnostics.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;amp;Itemid=1"&gt;Genova Diagnostics&lt;/a&gt; (GDX), formerly the Great Smokies Diagnostic Laboratory, sell such bogus tests as &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/hair.html"&gt;hair analysis&lt;/a&gt;, urinary amino acids, “intestinal permeability,” “&lt;a href="http://www.doctorsdata.com/test_info.asp?id=127"&gt;DNA oxidative damage assay&lt;/a&gt;,” and various “comprehensive panels” that generate &lt;a href="http://www.doctorsdata.com/repository.asp?id=1713"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; explicitly or implicitly calling for “detoxification” schemes, “supplements,” “nutriceuticals,” or “&lt;a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bioidentical-hormones/AN01133"&gt;bioidentical hormones&lt;/a&gt;,” which participating practitioners are only too happy to provide. Doctor’s Data is proud of its close ties with such PPOs as the &lt;a href="http://www.doctorsdata.com/whats_new.asp?releaseid=59"&gt;ACAM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.doctorsdata.com/whats_new.asp?releaseid=45"&gt;DAN!&lt;/a&gt;, and like GDX is a “&lt;a href="http://www.acamnet.org/site/c.ltJWJ4MPIwE/b.5513571/k.59DA/Resources_for_Physicians.htm#diagnosticlabs"&gt;supporter&lt;/a&gt;” of the ACAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genova also has a cozy relationship with naturopath &lt;a href="http://www.doctormurray.com/"&gt;Michael Murray&lt;/a&gt;, a long-time &lt;a href="http://www.ncahf.org/nl/1991/3-4.html"&gt;shill&lt;/a&gt; for “natural remedies” and co-editor of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.us.elsevierhealth.com/ISBN/9780443073007/Textbook-of-Natural-Medicine-2Volume-Set"&gt;Textbook of Natural Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, previously discussed &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=151"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. One of Genova’s former divisions was &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/bodybalance.html"&gt;BodyBalance&lt;/a&gt;, which peddles “test kits” directly to consumers ostensibly to measure minerals, hormones, “antioxidant reserves,” and “the body’s natural safeguard for optimal sleep, mood and cell function — melatonin” in saliva, hair, or urine. According to the current BodyBalance &lt;a href="http://www.bodybalance.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;BodyBalance is a division of Dr. Murray Natural Living, Inc., that specializes in direct to consumer health screening products. Dr. Murray is one of the world’s leading authorities on natural medicine and the author of over 30 books on natural healing. Dr. Murray and James Kammann, the General Manager of the BodyBalance Division, played key roles in the initial launching of the BodyBalance product line in 1999 when it was launched by Great Smokies Diagnostic Laboratory. BodyBalance was acquired by Dr. Murray Natural Living, Inc. in January 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal at BodyBalance is to help empower consumers to take charge of their health by providing them access to the world’s leading functional medicine laboratory — Genova Diagnostics (see www.GDX.net). Established in 1986 as Great Smokies Diagnostic Laboratory, Genova Diagnostics today serves over 8000 primary/specialty physicians and healthcare providers, offering over 125 specialized diagnostic assessments. BodyBalance has the exclusive rights to direct-to-consumer testing with Genova Diagnostics’ innovative tests — a lab that has achieved the highest national and certain state certification standards including CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) and the College of American Pathologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is it that commercial laboratories can so easily flout the standards of their field? Don’t the “certifications” just mentioned mean anything? Well, yes and no. The Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) regulates laboratories through the program identified above, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (&lt;a href="http://www.cms.gov/CLIA/"&gt;CLIA&lt;/a&gt;). There are other certifying bodies and various state requirements. These initiatives have made it &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/clia.html"&gt;more difficult&lt;/a&gt; for laboratories to peddle some dubious tests, but clearly there is still ample opportunity for what amounts to diagnostic testing fraud. Doctor’s Data, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.doctorsdata.com/home.asp"&gt;calls itself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;a licensed CLIA laboratory with appropriate state certifications and participates in numerous quality assurance/proficiency testing programs including the College of American Pathology, New York State DOH and Le Centre de Toxicologie du Quebec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company offers numerous other “&lt;a href="http://www.doctorsdata.com/about_qualifications.asp"&gt;Qualifications&lt;/a&gt;,” including “Chinese Certified Hair Standard GBW 09101.” Genova Diagnostics, as previewed above, is &lt;a href="http://www.genovadiagnostics.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=1&amp;amp;Itemid=3"&gt;just as confident&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;a fully accredited medical laboratory, certified in the areas of clinical chemistry, bacteriology, mycology, parasitology, virology, microbiology, non-syphilis serology, general immunology, hematology, toxicology, as well as molecular genetics by six separate health agencies including the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services which oversees clinical labs in the United States under the federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NeuroScience &lt;a href="https://www.neurorelief.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=487&amp;amp;Itemid=50"&gt;also boasts&lt;/a&gt; of the legitimacy of its laboratory tests. It outsources these to a convenient “independent” lab, &lt;a href="https://id408.van.ca.siteprotect.com/thehormoneshop1/newlab/aboutpharmasanlabs.htm"&gt;Pharmasan&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to be right next door and which shares its founder with NeuroScience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gold Standard Laboratory Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
NeuroScience, Inc. uses an independent, CLIA certified testing lab that is licensed in every state–including New York, which holds the highest level of qualification standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quackwatch&lt;/em&gt;: Your Guide to Bogus Diagnostic Tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t help but have noticed that many of the links in this post are to articles on &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/index.html"&gt;Quackwatch&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because the site is chock full of useful information about bogus tests, far more than can be found elsewhere. There you will find a more comprehensive &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/tests.html"&gt;list of bogus tests&lt;/a&gt; than I’ve mentioned here, and a larger &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/nonstandard.html"&gt;list of laboratories&lt;/a&gt; peddling them. You’ll also find an article on “&lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/genomics.html"&gt;Dubious Genetic Testing&lt;/a&gt;” co-authored by the Quackwatch founder, Stephen Barrett, and our own Harriet Hall, and &lt;a href="http://www.autism-watch.org/reports/casd/overview.shtml"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; about bogus “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=257"&gt;biomedical treatments&lt;/a&gt;” for autism showing that—surprise!—Doctor’s Data and Genova Diagnostics are major players there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One place where you will find nothing at all about bogus diagnostic tests is the NCCAM &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/health/atoz.htm"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. This is unfortunate, because the site is widely touted as providing information necessary to “&lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/health/decisions/"&gt;be an informed consumer&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the clinical pathologist who asked the question at NECSS, if you’re reading this, and to any others who may be out there: There is a real need for those with expertise in lab tests to get involved in the effort to expose pseudomedicine. This is especially true for any of you who are involved with CLIA. Let’s hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gary Null, who’s been described on quackwatch.org as “one of the nation’s leading promoters of  dubious treatment for serious disease, ” &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/04/28/2010-04-28_my_health_mix_almost_killed_me_supplement_nearly_fatal_sez_suit_vs_manufacturer.html"&gt;has overdosed on his own shitty health product&lt;/a&gt;. He’s literally had a taste of his own medicine and it didn’t agree with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s now suing the manufacturer of his own product, a product that literally has his name on it because taking Gary Null’s Ultimate Power Meal led to a Vitamin D overdose from the supplements it contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The buff “Joy of Juicing” author, whose products include Red Stuff  Powder and Gary Null’s Heavenly Hair Cleaner, claims he suffered kidney  damage and was left bloodied and in intense pain from two daily servings  of the supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Null continued to take the Ultimate Power Meal, all the while thinking  that it would help him, and relieve his condition; instead, it made him  worse,” the suit says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/04/28/2010-04-28_my_health_mix_almost_killed_me_supplement_nearly_fatal_sez_suit_vs_manufacturer.html#ixzz0mTEgxKDZ"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, seriously. He really has products called Red Stuff Powder and Gary Null’s Heavenly Hair Cleaner, and people never suspected they were buying potentially dangerous crap. Of course, it will be fun to see how this all plays out because just about every quack on Earth touts the miraculous healing properties of Vitamin D. It’s been said to cure everything from AIDS to cancer to autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well what can I say? It couldn’t have happened to a more deserving individual. Of course Null’s claiming that the manufacturer botched the supplements, and so he’s filed a suit in Manhattan Supreme Court against the manufacturer, Triarco Industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Null would later be told that if he had not flown back to New York and  seen his doctor, then he could have died within a short period of time,”  the suit says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If only.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The suit says Null, 65, is still suffering the effects of too much  Vitamin D.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;. . .&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;“Even now, Null’s condition is questionable as he continues to  occasionally urinate blood,” the suit says.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Well at least there’s that to smile about. Also, a bunch of people have declared that they’d never buy any of Null’s shitty quack products again:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;“Null, in the midst of all this, while he was suffering in bed, had  dozens of his customers calling him, along with condemning and  threatening him,” the suit says. “In fact, they threatened that they  would never buy any product of his ever again.”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;That may be the single best decision they ever make.&lt;/div&gt;

This is a case where consuming excessive amounts of a vitamin supplement can do more than help you make expensive urine, and can lead to crippling illness and death. Gary Null is a &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/null.html"&gt;thorough quack&lt;/a&gt; who has been raking in the dough with — you guessed it — nearly worthless vitamin supplements. Now this would simply be a tragic story of one of his poor deluded &lt;s&gt;suckers&lt;/s&gt; clients had come to harm from his magic &lt;s&gt;crap&lt;/s&gt; food, but it's &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; funny that &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/04/28/2010-04-28_my_health_mix_almost_killed_me_supplement_nearly_fatal_sez_suit_vs_manufacturer.html"&gt;Null nearly killed himself by eating his own supplements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not his fault, of course: he's suing the contractor who made his Ultimate Power Meal, claiming it was all their fault for putting too much vitamin D in one batch. The stuff has been &lt;a href="http://www.gnhealthyliving.com/scripts/prodView.asp?idproduct=841"&gt;yanked from their catalog&lt;/a&gt;, but have no fear, there are still plenty of other overpriced, overhyped, random collections of herbs and other gunk still on the shelves. Go ahead, buy one of his &lt;a href="https://www.gnhealthyliving.com/scripts/prodView.asp?idproduct=249"&gt;magnetic bras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gnhealthyliving.com/scripts/prodView.asp?idproduct=69"&gt;Prostate Pro&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.gnhealthyliving.com/scripts/prodView.asp?idProduct=125"&gt;cellulose pills&lt;/a&gt;. They &lt;i&gt;probably&lt;/i&gt; won't kill you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Null is also now claiming that it was nothing too serious, that &lt;a href="https://www.gnhealthyliving.com/Scripts/default.asp"&gt;vitamin D "dissipates quickly in the body"&lt;/a&gt;, and that he has returned to complete health. I guess that means we are free to laugh at him, then!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless he's lying. But a quack wouldn't lie to us, would he?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/quack_gets_dose_of_his_own_med.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/oc0y15S__lQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272520854966"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=5635">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ba2057bcad3dcf0e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="anti-vaccine lunacy"/><category term="autism"/><category term="Barbara Loe Fisher"/><category term="Frontline"/><category term="J.B.

And while not perfect, the show did a fairly good job of objectively and accurately reporting the facts. So of course the anti-vaxxers ain’t pleased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/04/huffpo-dr-jay-gordon-responds-to-frontline-vaccine-war-editing.html"&gt;Jay Gordon ain’t happy&lt;/a&gt;. How dare they not include any of his interview in the final edit? It must be a conspiracy!!!! A conspiracy, I tell you!!! Whoa there, Jay. Welcome to the world of television media, where producers have to find a way to fit many hours of content into a coherent one hour narrative. Did I bitch and complain when I never heard back from the Newsweek.com documentarian I gave a preliminary 10-15 minute phone interview to about the Stop &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; site? No. I’ve logged and edited hundreds of hours of footage myself, so I realize how fucking difficult it is to figure who you want to devote time to interviewing on camera and which footage you have to unfortunately leave on the cutting room floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the best hissy fit of course goes to Queen Anti-Vax herself, &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;. The Huffington Post, with its non-existent journalistic standards, happily posted &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jenny-mccarthy/ifrontlineis-the-vaccine_b_555785.html"&gt;her unstructured rant&lt;/a&gt;. Her main point (and I use the term “point” loosely here) seems to be that Frontline promised that they’d conduct a fair investigation and she’s interpreted this to mean that they promised her they’d interview all those actual scientists on her side of the issue instead of making it a scientists versus parents story as they did. And of course it’s an unfair stereotype, though not for the reason Jenny thinks. It’s unfair because Jenny and her anti-vaxxer cult don’t speak for all parents. In fact most parents still believe in vaccinating their children. Jenny doesn’t even speak for parents of autistic kids, as most of them hate her guts to for repeatedly describing autistic kids as soulless, broken pieces of shit. Sadly, that side of the story didn’t make it on the show either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as for all those “scientists” who actively support the anti-vaxxer agenda? I can pretty much count them on two hands:  Wakefield, Gordon, Tenpenny, Blaylock, Sears, Mercola. And a couple who  slip mind mind at the moment. And while not interviewed, Wakefield was  represented in the show. The fact is that this is a war between those on the side of  science and an hysterical cult of well-meaning scientific illiterates  and ideologues. The science is squarely against Jenny and the show did an  fairly accurate job of showing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also worth noting  is that Jenny didn’t point out a single demonstrable fact that the  show got wrong. No, instead she whined about how unfairly she felt she was  treated by I guess not having the whole show devoted to her interview even though anyone can watch her interview and J.B. Handley’s  interview in their entirety online and even though fairness would have  excluded them and Barbara Loe Fisher as interview subjects entirely given their lack  of expertise.&lt;br&gt;
And that brings me to another amusing element of Jenny’s rant. She’s insisting that Frontline should have interviewed scientists on her side because she, Handley, and Fisher are just parents of autistic kids turned activists. Her point is that she, Handley, and Fisher are not qualified. Funny how their lack of credentials is only an issue to vaccine  deniers when the cameras are rolling.&lt;br&gt;
And Jenny further shows her contempt for her readers by bringing up the whole Paul Thorsen case, insinuating the outside activities of some minor player in just one of many  studies that disproves her position is somehow relevant. What does Poul Thorsen allegedly  stealing money from the CDC have to do with the science that shows you’re wrong, Jenny? This is nothing but a disgraceful dodge to avoid  addressing the real issue, the science. But of course Jenny doesn’t understand the science, so she’s got to resort to red herrings and ad hominems. Again, she couldn’t find a single fact presented in the show that was demonstrably wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the show pointed out serious holes in the anti-vaxxers’ claims. Anti-vaxxers fail to consider that autism is just as prevalent among the unvaccinated as it is the vaccinated, that there are at least as many cases where early autism symptoms had no timing coincidence with vaccines at all, and that boys are four times more likely to develop autism despite both genders receiving equal numbers of vaccines. According to the anti-vaxxer position, all three of these facts are IMPOSSIBLE!&lt;/p&gt;

When I first heard that this show was going to air, I was a bit concerned. My concern, of course is what I’m always concerned about when journalists do a story about pseudoscience, be it the anti-vaccine movement, “intelligent design” creationism, various “alternative medicine” modalities, or whatever. We’ve written about such things right here on SBM on more than one occasion, be it &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=319"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon on The Doctors&lt;/a&gt; or Andrew Wakefield being &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1222"&gt;interviewed by Matt Lauer&lt;/a&gt;. Although FRONTLINE has done a pretty good, science-based job on controversial topics, I felt some trepidation, particularly after seeing some of the promos for the show, even though it featured Dr. Paul Offit, and other physicians and scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I needn’t have worried. The Vaccine War is not perfect. There are some definite flaws, but by and large it is a rare thing on TV: A science-based discussion of a pseudoscientific movement. True, the opening montage did bring back a bit of that anxiety that this was going to be a “tell both sides” bit of false balance in that it included &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/vaccines/interviews/handley.html"&gt;J.B. Handley blathering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/vaccines/interviews/mccarthy.html"&gt;Jenny McCarthy spewing&lt;/a&gt; her same false dilemma of measles versus autism. (She’d choose the measles, of course.) I was able to forgive that, because it’s very clear that the producers were just setting up the story. The show then launched straight into a birth and a list of the vaccines that children get, with Melinda Wharton of the CDC and Paul Offit pointing out how much good vaccines do, how we no longer see diseases that once killed thousands or even milions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was straight to Ashland, OR and the woo, personified by a mother named Jennifer Margulis, a writer for that “natural” repository of woo &lt;em&gt;Mothering Magazine&lt;/em&gt;. She wasted no time spewing nonsense about “natural immunity” versus vaccines, claiming that it is better than vaccine-induced immunity. (Yes, it may be more long-lasting, but it comes without the risk of actually getting the diesease.) Dr. Donna Bradshaw-Walters was then introduced, and she described how 28% of Ashland’s children are missing some or all of their vaccines, pointing out that it is only a matter of time before there is an outbreak there. (I wonder how far Ashland is from Portland. Our intrepid fellow SBM blogger Mark Crislip is in the Portland area somewhere.) It was refreshing to note that there are actual pro-vaccine parents in Ashland, one of whom predicted that it would get ugly if there were an outbreak in which vaccinated children started to get sick because of unvaccinated children forming a repository for disease that can spread to vaccinated children whose vaccines didn’t “take,” for whatever reason. The show then described the San Diego measles outbreak and how unvaccinated children are a vector for infection, even to the vaccinated, who are less likely to be infected but not immune, as no vaccine is 100% effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, there was a segment at Pfizer. This may not have been the best idea strategically, given how it feeds into the distrust of big pharma exhibited by the vaccine fearful, although the scientist interviewed, Dr. Emilio Emini, did a good job of pointing out how vaccines prevent disease. Still, right there, I could envision doubting parents becoming suspicous. Then, of course, there was Dr. Paul Offit, who, although he is the Dark Lord of Vaccination to the antivaccine movement, is nonetheless the one of the most effective provaccine voices. Happily, Offit makes no apologies for having gotten rich from a vaccine. He is enormously proud of it, as he should be. But what he’s proud of is not having gotten rich, but have invented a product that has saved thousands upon thousands of children’s lives. That is truly something to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing &lt;em&gt;The Vaccine War&lt;/em&gt; revealed that I didn’t know was that bioethicist Arthur Caplan had actually contracted polio in his youth. No wonder he is so effective when he argues for vaccines. Equally effective is a scene in which paramedics are being trained, part of their training being to watch videos of children with pertussis and rotavirus. The video of the child with pertussis is horrifying; the suffering of such children is incredible. This class even pointed out that chickenpox can actually be fatal, showing a child with staph sepsis in the pox lesions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, at this point the aforementioned Margulis demonstrates her extreme ignorance by asking why we are still vaccinating for polio as polio has become more rare. This woman was truly irritating in her arrogance of ignorance. Worse, she kept popping up throughout the show, sadly enough. But that wasn’t enough. There had to be Barbara Loe Fisher, too, spewing her usual anti-vaccine line. Unfortunately, here’s where FRONTLINE fell down on the job. The show actually described BLF not just once, but multiple times, using terms like “vaccine watchdog” or “vaccine safety” advocate, rather than what she is, an anti-vaccine propagandist. Bad FRONTLINE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the interview with Jenny McCarthy was infuriating, as usual. I suppose I should be used to her smug anti-science attitude. Buried in McCarthy’s assault on science and reason, though, there was a rather interesting tidbit. However, you have to go to her &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/vaccines/interviews/mccarthy.html"&gt;complete online interview&lt;/a&gt; to find it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long after the MMR was that first seizure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, a lot of people think, and probably from me saying in some interviews, that it was after the MMR I noticed changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it was just the MMR shot that caused any kind of trigger with autism. I think it was a compilation of so many shots to a kid that obviously had some autoimmune disorders. So I would say maybe a couple of months, a month or so after the MMR, I started to notice some physical ailments such as constipation, rashes, eczema. That was like the first little sign. And then the train just kind of descended from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very different from the stories McCarthy was telling around the time she released her first book, and she even seems to be acknowledging it as she dances around a very simple question. Indeed, I remember McCarthy saying in interview after interview how she saw the “light go out of Evan’s eyes” soon after the shot. That’s why her story resonated with the anti-vaccine movement so strongly, as shown when anti-vaccination activist &lt;a href="http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/09/jenny-mccarthy-on-oprah-vaccine-injury.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ginger Taylor&lt;/a&gt; cited what Jenny McCarthy said in her 2007 interview with Oprah:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenny says even before Evan received his vaccines, she tried to talk to her pediatrician about it. “Right before his MMR shot, I said to the doctor, “I have a very bad feeling about this shot. This is the autism shot, isn’t it?’ And he said, ‘No, that is ridiculous. It is a mother’s desperate attempt to blame something,’ and he swore at me, and then the nurse gave [Evan] the shot,” she says. “And I remember going, ‘Oh, God, I hope he’s right.’ And soon thereafter-boom-the soul’s gone from his eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how Jenny appears to have changed her story from its being the MMR to its being a gradual process due to too many vaccines. Truly, her story shifts more than the sands of the Sahara, or the waves of the ocean, or your favorite metaphor for something shifty and lacking substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of shifty and lacking substance, the first Jenny McCarthy segment ran right into an interview with J.B. Handley. There was really nothing new there in that J.B. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4621"&gt;claims that “tens of thousands” of parents&lt;/a&gt; tell him that their children were “never the same” after vaccines, combined with his simplistic mantra: Vaccines cause brain damage and autism is brain injury. Ergo, to him, vaccines cause autism. Of course, it is not really true that autism is “brain injury.” It is a difference in the brain, but there’s no good evidence that autism is primarily due to “brain injury,” although there’s all sorts of quackery out there that purports to treat “vaccine injury” to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another point where the FRONTLINE special dropped the ball a bit. The show immediately went into the MMR fear mongering provoked by Andre Wakefield. The problem is that J.B. Handley wasn’t really about MMR, at least not until recently. He was about mercury and thimerosal. Indeed, Generation Rescue until a couple of years ago proclaimed on its website that autism is a “misdiagnosis for mercury poisoning.” (And guess where that mercury exposure came from? That’s right, vaccines.) But the MMR has never had mercury in it, ever. In conflating these issues, FRONTLINE confused two related issues that are not really the same thing, particularly when it started showing a speech by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. at the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=139"&gt;Green Our Vaccines&lt;/a&gt; rally from two years ago. As someone who knows about the anti-vaccine movement and its history, this was irritating, and it is more than just a nit to pick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I do like how, right after a segment in which Jenny McCarthy claims that scientists won’t study whether vaccines cause autism, the show immediately launched into a segment that demonstrated conclusively that that she is either mistaken or lying (take your pick). The issue &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; been studied extensively in multiple countries, and no link between vaccines and autism has been found. Thus, right after McCarthy made a claim, the claim was demolished totally. Moreover, FRONTLINE did a good job of explaining how correlation does not necessarily mean causation. Just because a diagnosis of autism is made soon after a vaccine does not necessarily mean the vaccine caused autism. It finished this middle part of the documentary by documenting the fall of Andrew Wakefield, in particular pointing out how some of the children in his studies had been referred through lawyers suing vaccine manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this segment is how FRONTLINE showed that, no matter how much evidence, with J.B. Handley saying, “I don’t give a fuck about what the MMR study said.” (Yes, he did use the F-word, although it was bleeped out and turned to “crap” in the &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/vaccines/interviews/handley.html"&gt;online transcript&lt;/a&gt;. Stay classy, J.B.) This was rapidly followed by a demonstration of Barbara Loe Fisher shifting the goalposts asking for more epidemiological studies and basic science studies. It is, as Dr. Offit put it, a classic shifting of goalposts, with Jenny McCarthy blathering about her “mommy warriors” and how “Evan is her science.” In fact, I particularly liked how Dr. Offit explained exactly how the anti-vaccine movement is constantly shifting the goalposts in a way that a lay peson could understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this segment depressed me, because it showed just how much science doesn’t matter in trying to persuade these parents and how the web perpetuates not just the old vaccine myths, but facilitate the spread of new ones. It demonstrates just how much the Internet’s “democratization” of knowledge devalues knowledge, expertise, and science. The forces of pseudoscience proliferate and infiltrate, and, quite frankly, those of us who promote science-based medicine are way behind the eight ball in trying to counter these messages. One thing I had no idea about was just how effective the Desiree Jennings story had influenced high school students not to vaccinate. Roughly half of one class who hadn’t taken the H1N1 vaccine said that the reason they didn’t take the vaccine was because they saw &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1558"&gt;Desiree Jennings&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube. This makes me think, more than ever, that blogs such as this one and others are essential in tearing apart such bad information. The result of this information is people like the mothers in Ashland that I discussed last time who ask, “If vaccines work, who am I hurting by not vaccinating?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was shown in the story of a baby who came down with pertussis and almost died. Her situtation was so bad that a chaplain was brought in for possible last rites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the show, there was presented a focus group of people who discussed vaccination. What was interesting is how much vaccination is viewed as a parental choice rather than a societal duty. This in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing. It’s completely consistent with the psyche many people in the U.S. and the principles of limited goverment and self-reliance. The problem is that this choice is being increasingly undermined by misinformation on the Internet and elsewhere in the media. The message of the anti-vaccine movement that the days of “paternalism” are over echoes very strongly with the whole “health freedom” movement. The problem with this “freedom” is that refusing vaccination endangers more than just the child of the parent making the choice. It endangers other children, vaccinated or unvaccinated. It’s very difficult for anyone to make a well-informed choice when most of the information that pops up when you search the Internet is from the anti-vaccine side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I was mostly relieved by &lt;em&gt;The Vaccine War&lt;/em&gt;. It was science-based, and it pulled no punches in asserting that there is no good scientific evidence that vaccines cause autism. True, it did confuse the issue of the MMR vaccine and thimerosal-containing vaccines, and that’s more than a minor mistake. It also failed to address the valid reasons why we vaccinated for hepatitis B to neonates. Worse, it was far too kind in its treatment of Barbara Loe Fisher, calling her organization, the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1723"&gt;National Vaccine Information Center&lt;/a&gt; a “vaccine safety” advocacy organization, when it is an anti-vaccine organization, plain and simple. It did a little better with Generation Rescue, showing a bit of the sheer insanity behind the organization and how, no matter how much evidence there is against its position, it never loses sight of its founding principle, namely that it’s absolutely, positively always the vaccines. Always. Those complaints aside, FRONTLINE did a far better job than I expected in deconstructing the anti-vaccine movement. It didn’t compromise on the science, although it may have compromised a bit in how it describes, for example, the NVIC and Generation Rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will &lt;em&gt;The Vaccine War&lt;/em&gt; change minds? Maybe. There’s no way it’s going to change the minds of hard core antivaccinationists of J.B. Handley’s ilk. Almost nothing I can think of can. But it might–just might–reassure parents on the fence that all that horrible stuff they’re hearing on the radio, seeing on TV, and, above all, reading on the Internet about the evils of vaccines are not based in science. That’s actually quite an achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADDENDUM:&lt;/strong&gt; There was a segment in which a pro-vaccination parent in Ashland was profiled. In a shot in which she was surfing the ‘net, guess what blog showed up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep:&lt;/p&gt;

This commenter thinks that being harsh in my assessment of anti-vaccinationists will never reach anyone and only turn off the undecided. This commenter &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/the_vaccine_war_a_review.php#comment-2469668"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Anti-vacciners' view is in many cases just as strongly held as yours, and their data is just as compelling to them as yours is to you. Tell me, how many idiots yelling at you that you are stupid for thinking what you think would it take for you to change your mind? Any? Or would you be more likely to change it if someone came along and showed you the flaws in your reasoning/'data'?

&lt;p&gt;Now it seems to me that the constructive way through this, if anyone wants to try it, would be to try to show anti-vacciners where the data they lean on is a) plain false, b) incomplete and c) faulty (misunderstanding of the way statistics works plays a HUGE part here). And I get that that is what lots of people are trying to do, but since they do nothing but focus on the autism "question" (which is actually only one really tiny part of the anti-vaccine concern) they are often completely missing the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/the_vaccine_war_a_review.php#comment-2469828"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;You're either a concern troll or an incredibly naive newbie.

&lt;p&gt;What makes you think that I and others haven't tried to show these people the flaws in their data, "science" (I hate to use that word to describe the pseudoscience they use), and "reasoning" (such as it is). I have. Paul Offit has. The CDC and AAP have. Virtually every public health governmental agency and private institution has. Hell, Dr. Jim Shames on the FRONTLINE special itself was portrayed trying to reason with antivax mothers using a very cuddly, quiet, respectful tone. How far did he get? Not very. How far is he getting? Judging from the frustration in his voice during some interviews, not very.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I've written a couple of posts about this very issue. Here's one where I challenge those who tell us to "make nice" on other scientific issues (like creationism, for example) in order to "persuade" the unpersuadable to come up with a technique to persuade antivaxers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I pointed out a couple of posts, one in which I challenged the promoters of making nice with pseudoscientists to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/a_real_challenge_for_science_communication.php"&gt;put up or shut up when it comes to the anti-vaccine movement&lt;/a&gt;, and one in which I criticized a friend for a very misguided idea of "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/02/building_bridges_to_the_leaders_of_the_a.php"&gt;building bridges&lt;/a&gt;" to the leaders of the anti-vaccine movement. Of course, I was a bit puzzled because, if anything, my review was less "insolent" than my usual broadsides at the anti-vaccine movement, but maybe this is the first time this commenter has ever encountered this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one thing I noticed is that J.B. Handley himself in the &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/vaccines/interviews/handley.html"&gt;extended interview provided on the FRONTLINE website&lt;/a&gt; has provided me with an excellent example (thanks, J.B.!) of exactly what I'm talking about:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/why_antivaccinationists_will_never_be.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/why_antivaccinationists_will_never_be.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/mvoUdpDl_5w" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272511458441"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=176428">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ff8a0970cb65f3e8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="childhood obesity"/><category term="eating healthy foods"/><category term="family garden Michelle Obama"/><category term="healthy eating"/><category term="kids healthy eating"/><category term="Let's Move"/><category term="michelle obama"/><category term="organic"/><category term="organic food"/><category term="pesticides"/><category term="Salon.com"/><title type="html">Michelle Obama's White House Garden Is Not Organic!</title><published>2010-04-28T22:00:01Z</published><updated>2010-04-28T22:00:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/michelle-obamas-white-house-garden-is-not-organic/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/wenn2794529.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="news first lady garden 010410" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/wenn2794529-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;photo: WENN.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/michelle-obama/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=michelle%20obama&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;Michelle Obama&lt;/a&gt;, it’s hard not to picture her in the White House garden. She talks about it interviews; we’ve read about it everywhere; and she even did some mulching with &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/garden-with-michelle-obama-on-sesame-street/?utm_source=blisstree&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=b5hubs_migration"&gt;The Muppets&lt;/a&gt;. With all the recent national emphasis on the benefits of &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/healthy-eating/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=healthy%20eating&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;healthy eating&lt;/a&gt;, (including the First Lady’s “&lt;a href="http://www.letsmove.gov/"&gt;Let’s Move&lt;/a&gt;” campaign), no one would blame you for assuming that the White House garden is organic. But it’s not. The world’s most important gardeners actually use fertilizers and pesticides – though they’re natural, and not synthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the garden produced 55 different kinds of fruits and vegetables, and more than 1,000 pounds of food. Half of the yield went to local charities, and the other half was used right there at home. White House Assistant Chef says that the garden is meant to benefit the Washington, D.C. children who get to visit and help plant or harvest the crop as part of &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/childhood-obesity-should-you-put-your-kid-on-a-diet/"&gt;Mrs. Obama’s crusade against childhood obesity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if Michelle Obama and the White House are trying to set an example for the nation about how to &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/topic/eat/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=eat&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;eat&lt;/a&gt; healthily, should organic food be a part of that mission, or is it not necessary? It’s tough to see why Mrs. Obama and her team wouldn’t just go the extra mile and make the garden organic (budget cuts?) – especially if they’re giving the food away to needy charities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think – Should the White House garden be certified organic? Let us know in the comments section, below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent episode of NPR’s &lt;a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/406/true-urban-legends"&gt;This American Life&lt;/a&gt; focused on true urban legends – one of which is the idea that radiation from cell phones causes &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/cancer/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=cancer&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The segment was an interview with Christopher Ketcham, who wrote an article in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gq.com/cars-gear/gear-and-gadgets/201002/warning-cell-phone-radiation"&gt;GQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in February about the controversial issue, and how no one in the U.S. seems to care about it. The article highlights startling facts about cell phone usage and tumors, early onset Alzheimer’s, brain-aging, and other not-so-super-fun effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another article, in the current &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2010/04/hbc-90006937"&gt;Harper’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, looks at results of studies of cell phone radiation side effects, and the findings are anything but consistent: “Cell-phone radiation slows one’s cognitive reaction time” or “It makes one think faster” or “It has no effect on cognitive ability.” With all the conflicting opinions out there, is it better to play it safe, or assume that all the fuss is an overreaction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, there are some ways to reduce the radiation you get from your phone. You can purchase a headset, many of which are inexpensive and easy to find. (Amazon carries a large selection.) Another option is only for you lucky &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/iphone/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=iphone&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; and Blackberry Curve users, at least for now. &lt;a href="https://www.pongresearch.com/Default.aspx"&gt;Pong Research Company&lt;/a&gt; has released special cases for these phones that divert radiation. Specifically, the cases decrease the absorbed radiation from iPhones by 60-85%.

Grothe’s lecture from &lt;a href="http://www.necsscon.org/"&gt;NECSS 2010 &lt;/a&gt;has made the leap to the interwebz, and you may view it below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D.J.’s subject, “Skepticism Is a Humanism,” is an affirmation of a principle that some of us think goes without saying, and which the rest of us hardly think about. It raises some interesting questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk begins with definitions. D.J. asks: Is skepticism “saying no to nonsensical beliefs”? I don’t think so. The pejorative “nonsense” almost automatically implies a degree of solipsism; an unwarranted trust in one’s ability to distinguish nonsense from truth. &lt;em&gt;Everybody&lt;/em&gt;, Tom Cruise to Fred Phelps, thinks s/he says “no” to nonsense. It doesn’t make them skeptical. (Though it does reveal an innate, unformed &lt;em&gt;inclination&lt;/em&gt; toward skepticism, which makes me hopeful.) A meaningful definition of skepticism would have to encapsulate the process by which we identify nonsense, rather than note the mere fact that we disparage it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another definition D.J. proffers is “ordinary common sense.” This isn’t any better, and may be worse, as it rips “ordinary” and “common” from their ordinary, common definitions. Skepticism is neither. It is an historical and cultural rarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, D.J. settles on a simpler and more dynamic definition: Skepticism is a “method of finding things out” that is consonant with “the methods of science.” This is inarguable, and I like it. I especially like it because to accept it is to quietly acknowledge that skepticism‘s primary business &lt;em&gt;isn‘t &lt;/em&gt;investigating “things that go bump in the night,” as D.J. calls them. Its jurisdiction isn’t the paranormal: It’s the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  



&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id%3D11192558%26server%3Dvimeo.com%26show_title%3D1%26show_byline%3D1%26show_portrait%3D0%26color%3D%26fullscreen%3D1&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=225" width="400" height="225"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/11192558"&gt;NECSS 2010 - Keynote - D. J. Grothe&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/user805370"&gt;Maggie McFee&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As D.J. says repeatedly in his talk, it is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;the JREF’s business to apply skepticism to economic theories, literary criticism, the merits of pop music, the ethics of diamond mining, or French cooking. (Or Global Warming.) Those are worthy pursuits, but they are not ours. We operate in the field of extraordinary claims, where deceptions tend toward the dramatic, and where there is a thick line separating truth from bullpocky. Ours is a tiny slice of skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should we so limit ourselves? The question isn’t central to D.J.’s talk, but I think it’s one worth asking. The best answer I can come up with is “practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JREF’s targets are almost always blatantly, inarguably wrong. With a very few exceptions, their claims fall apart upon even cursory examination. And yet their audiences — those who truly feel they have a friend in Sylvia Browne, Kevin Trudeau, Rhonda Byrne — believe them wholeheartedly. The JREF’s tiny slice of skepticism, therefore, is the place where we may witness deceit at its wacky extreme; where we may study its methods and catalogue its weapons. If we know them, and if we understand them, we may begin to note how the faulty reasoning that ensures John Edward an audience can infect, or at least inflect, a novel or a political speech; how it can spin an election or sabotage a philosophy.

Buono&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the decision was announced and it was a disappointing one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/08/salazar-v-buono-oral-arguments/"&gt;wrote about this before&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ll paraphrase a part of what I wrote then.  Then, we’ll get to what happened today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background: In the 1930s, the Veterans of Foreign Wars put up a cross in the Mojave National Preserve in California as a war memorial.  No other religious group is allowed to put up symbols in the area.  Ten years ago, a former employee of the National Park Service, &lt;strong&gt;Frank Buono&lt;/strong&gt;, sued, saying this was a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/us/08scotus.html"&gt;violation of the establishment clause&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In the intervening decade, Congress and the courts have engaged in a legal tug of war. Congress passed measures forbidding removal of the cross, designating it as a national memorial and, finally, ordering the land under the cross to be transferred to private hands. Federal courts in California have insisted that the cross may not be displayed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters of church/state separation were on the side of Mr. Buono.  If he won the case, then it could lead to removals of other religious symbols on public property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/opinion/07wed1.html?_r=1"&gt;supported Mr. Buono as well&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
On the merits, the appeals court was right that the cross must come down. By allowing a Christian cross, and not symbols of other faiths, on federal land, the government was favoring one religion over others. Also, Congress has designated the cross as a national memorial, which means that it continues to have official government endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also sends a message that state and church are intertwined. A single cross does not, by itself, mean America has an established religion, but if the Supreme Court stops caring that the government is promoting a particular religion, we will be down the path toward having one.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Supreme Court hearing, Justice &lt;strong&gt;Antonin Scalia&lt;/strong&gt; expressed the absurd notion that the cross is not a symbol of Christianity.  Seriously.  Check out a &lt;a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-472.pdf"&gt;portion of his exchange&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) with ACLU attorney &lt;strong&gt;Peter Eliasberg&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MR. ELIASBERG&lt;/strong&gt;: … I think it would be very odd indeed for the VFW to feel that it was free to take down the cross and put up, for example, a statues of a soldier which would honor all of the people who fought for America in World War I, not just Christians, and say: Well, we were free to do that because even though there’s the sign that says, this cross is designated to honor all the — &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUSTICE SCALIA&lt;/strong&gt;: The cross doesn’t honor non-Christians who fought in the war? Is that — is that — &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MR. ELIASBERG&lt;/strong&gt;: I believe that’s actually correct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUSTICE SCALIA&lt;/strong&gt;: Where does it say that? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MR. ELIASBERG&lt;/strong&gt;: It doesn’t say that, but a cross is the predominant symbol of Christianity and it signifies that Jesus is the son of God and died to redeem mankind for our sins, and I believe that’s why the Jewish war veterans — &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUSTICE SCALIA&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s erected as a war memorial. I assume it is erected in honor of all of the war dead. It’s the — the cross is the — is the most common symbol of — of — of the resting place of the dead, and it doesn’t seem to me — what would you have them erect? A cross — some conglomerate of a cross, a Star of David, and you know, a Moslem half moon and star? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MR. ELIASBERG&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, Justice Scalia, if I may go to your first point. The cross is the most common symbol of the resting place of Christians. I have been in Jewish cemeteries. There is never a cross on a tombstone of a Jew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Laughter&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MR. ELIASBERG&lt;/strong&gt;: So it is the most common symbol to honor Christians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUSTICE SCALIA&lt;/strong&gt;: I don’t think you can leap from that to the conclusion that the only war dead that that cross honors are the Christian war dead. I think that’s an outrageous conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MR. ELIASBERG&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, my — the point of my — point here is to say that there is a reason the Jewish war veterans came in and said we don’t feel honored by this cross. This cross can’t honor us because it is a religious symbol of another religion.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what was the result of all this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the Supreme Court &lt;a href="http://www.au.org/media/press-releases/archives/2010/04/salazar-v-buono-supreme-court.pdf"&gt;decided &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; Mr. Buono&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).  It was a 5-4 vote with Justice &lt;strong&gt;Anthony Kennedy&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/us/29cross.html"&gt;siding with the court’s religious conservatives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“A Latin cross is not merely a reaffirmation of Christian beliefs,” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote in a plurality opinion joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. “It evokes thousands of small crosses in foreign fields marking the graves of Americans who fell in battles, battles whose tragedies would be compounded if the fallen are forgotten.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church/state separation advocates are not happy about this, with good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.au.org/media/press-releases/archives/2010/04/supreme-court-decision-in.html"&gt;Here’s Rev. &lt;strong&gt;Barry W. Lynn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“I’m very disappointed,” said the Rev. &lt;strong&gt;Barry W. Lynn&lt;/strong&gt;, Americans United [for Separation of Church and State] executive director. “The court majority was clearly determined to find any bogus reason to keep this religious symbol in a public park.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added Lynn, “It’s alarming that the high court continues to undermine the separation of church and state. Nothing good can come from this trend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This decision lets Congress bypass the Constitution and devise a convoluted scheme to keep a cross on display in a federal park,” Lynn remarked. “That’s bad law and bad public policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The court majority seems to think the cross is not always a Christian symbol,” Lynn continued. “I think all Americans know better than that.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Humanist Association &lt;a href="http://www.americanhumanist.org/news/details/2010-04-mojave-cross-doesnt-represent-all-americans-humanists"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Predictably, five conservative justices on the Supreme Court today saw no evil in letting a Christian cross represent all Americans, notwithstanding the fact that the cross is the preeminent symbol of but one religion — Christianity,” said Bob Ritter, the legal coordinator of the Appignani Humanist Legal Center, legal arm of the AHA. “If this is not ‘an establishment of religion’ I don’t know what is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s clear the government was willing to do anything it took in order to keep the cross in the middle of federal land,” said Roy Speckhardt, executive director of the American Humanist Association. “And now we’ll almost certainly see such shady tactics put to use again.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy&lt;/strong&gt;, president of the Interfaith Alliance, sees &lt;a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/news/367-statement-of-rev-dr-c-welton-gaddy-on-supreme-courts-decision-on-salazar-v-buono"&gt;a downside in this ruling for Christians&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Our public parks are a sanctuary for people of all faiths and belief systems as well as none. These government-owned-and-run public places should not be used to endorse any one religion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two sad ironies stand out here.  First, for Christians to celebrate this decision requires a will to allow the government to reject the distinct religious value the cross has traditionally held in Christianity.  Second, those who have fallen in battle for our country often have done so protecting the rights that are the defining characteristics of our democracy and, specifically, our First Amendment.  Central to this are our religious liberties — the ones jeopardized in this ruling by the Supreme Court.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a bad decision with bad implications when it comes to setting a precedent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also underscores the need to at least maintain the current political makeup of the Supreme Court through &lt;strong&gt;President Obama&lt;/strong&gt;’s next appointment.

We've been going through the history of the Universe -- from inflation to the present day -- and you can read parts &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/01/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-.php"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/01/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_1.php"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/02/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_2.php"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/02/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_3.php"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_4.php"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_5.php"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_6.php"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_7.php"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_8.php"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; here.  The last thing that happened was we had a Universe filled with neutral atoms -- mostly hydrogen with some helium and a negligible amount of everything else -- that had begun to collapse under its own gravity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/sim3dnew.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/sim3dnew-thumb-500x324-47018.png" width="500" height="324" alt="sim3dnew.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a few regions of space got dense enough, about 50 million years into the story, we made the first stars!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/140510main_WMAP_first_stars_lgweb.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/140510main_WMAP_first_stars_lgweb-thumb-500x281-47030.jpeg" width="500" height="281" alt="140510main_WMAP_first_stars_lgweb.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a problem when you make stars surrounded by neutral atoms that you may not be aware of: neutral atoms &lt;b&gt;block&lt;/b&gt; light!  If we look around in our own galaxy, it's pretty easy to find where neutral atoms are, because the light doesn't get through!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/bhr71_vlt.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/bhr71_vlt-thumb-500x501-47935.jpeg" width="500" height="501" alt="bhr71_vlt.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomers call this phenomenon &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_(astronomy)"&gt;extinction&lt;/a&gt;.  So, what does this mean for these first stars?  It means that, as long as this neutral gas is around, the Universe is &lt;i&gt;opaque&lt;/i&gt; to starlight, and we can't see it!  At least, not until this gas gets ionized.  What ionizes gas?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/ngc7822.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/ngc7822-thumb-500x500-47933.jpeg" width="500" height="500" alt="ngc7822.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These very same hot, young stars that form from gravitational collapse!  Most of a Sun-like star's energy comes out in visible light, but a hotter, more massive star emits more Ultraviolet (UV) light.  What's special about UV light?  It smacks these neutral atoms and knocks electrons out, ionizing them!  This means that, once enough stars form, more and more of the Universe becomes transparent to visible light!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/reionization.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/reionization-thumb-500x169-47931.jpeg" width="500" height="169" alt="reionization.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, when the Universe has had enough stars on for long enough, these so-called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Big_Bang#Dark_ages"&gt;Dark Ages&lt;/a&gt; end, and you can actually observe the light!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/Reion_diagram.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/Reion_diagram-thumb-500x625-47929.jpeg" width="500" height="625" alt="Reion_diagram.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, again, this is a &lt;i&gt;prediction&lt;/i&gt; of the Big Bang.  Sometime, if we look back far enough, these atoms that are ionized in between galaxies today should be neutral, and should absorb the light!  So what happens when we confront this prediction (made in 1985, by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunn-Peterson_trough"&gt;Jim Gunn&lt;/a&gt;) with the observations?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/gp.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/gp-thumb-500x428-47927.jpeg" width="500" height="428" alt="gp.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find that once things are far enough away (and hence, young enough), we &lt;b&gt;can't see any light&lt;/b&gt;, which is why there are no features to the left of the more distant (higher redshift) object!  In fact, if we take a slew of these distant objects, you'll see very clearly that the highest redshift ones (most distant) are totally muted to the left of the big hydrogen emission line!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/qso.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/qso-thumb-500x593-47925.png" width="500" height="593" alt="qso.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So making the first stars isn't enough, we need to give them time to work their nuclear fusion engines to ionize all the gas in the Universe in order to &lt;b&gt;see&lt;/b&gt;!  And this wonderful prediction was only confirmed in 2001, and has since been confirmed by many subsequent observations, &lt;i&gt;including&lt;/i&gt; measurements of ionization by the WMAP satellite!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this brings us all the way up to the Universe being &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;one billion years old&lt;/b&gt;!  Come back next time, and we'll find out what else has been going on, and for some gorgeous &lt;i&gt;early&lt;/i&gt; pictures of our Universe!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_9.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272503241789"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.nature.com/amch/2010/04/29/saving-face-salamanders-show-why-its-important-to-know-thy-enemies">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8f5901113ba54224</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Saving face: Salamanders show why it&amp;#39;s important to know thy enemies</title><published>2010-04-28T20:05:45Z</published><updated>2010-04-28T20:05:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/cHGnCzuk9Qw/saving-face-salamanders-show-why-its-important-to-know-thy-enemies" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.nature.com/amch/2010/04/29/saving-face-salamanders-show-why-its-important-to-know-thy-enemies"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">In the past I have focused on reviewing newly published literature, but I have decided to periodically take a look back at some "classic" zoology papers.

According to this paper, anyway, gestures and small movements are enough to give people a clear impression of a candidate&amp;#39;s overall health—and he who seems healthiest will get their vote.

It&amp;#39;s another blow to the notion that we know what we are doing when we vote, which has taken a pounding in recent research.  In 2008, for instance, Jonah Berger and his colleagues reported that where people vote affects how they vote.  In 2009 John Antonakis and Olaf Dalgas recounted experiments in which both adults and children could predict who would win an election just by looking at photographs and saying which person&amp;#39;s face looked most competent. Now Robin Kramer, Isabel Arend and Robert Ward, neuroscientists at Bangor University in the U.K., have found that people&amp;#39;s impressions of politicians&amp;#39; health is the best predictor of a their vote.

One of the most striking things about their paper is how little information people need to form such an impression.  Kramer and colleagues ran two experiments, one comparing Barack Obama and John McCain, the other Brown and Cameron.  In both cases, the researchers created simple stick-figure cartoons from video  of the politicians, and they didn&amp;#39;t tell their volunteers whom they had used to create the clips. To see how much they pared down, take a look at the Obama stick-figure, or the Gordon Brown.  (Their Cameron film provided the thumbnail for this post.) They look like diagrams of constellations.  Yet none of the 73 student volunteers appears to have said &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t decide how healthy this guy is, he looks like a praying mantis&amp;quot; or anything in that vein.  The sight of dots and lines that looked like eyes and a torso was enough information for a human brain to decide how healthy, depressed, anxious, trustworthy and leaderly was the man used to create the cartoon.

After rating the figures on these traits and a number of others (including overall health) the volunteers were asked which constellation they would vote for. Only then did they find out whom they had been watching.  They weren&amp;#39;t told which was which, though, because the researchers wanted to see if they could guess. (Not surprisingly, people could tell who was Obama and who was McCain, but many couldn&amp;#39;t distinguish the constellation Cameron from Brown, who are closer in age and height than the two Americans.)  A statistical comparison of all this information about the subjects—from political affiliation to general news-awareness to their judgments on traits including leadership and trustworthiness—found that only their sense of each candidate&amp;#39;s health predicted their voting preference.

The authors want to make an evolutionary-psychology parable out of this finding. They argue that people have an innate preference for fit mates and strong friends, and that explains the connection between healthiness and votes.  But there&amp;#39;s a problem with this conclusion: People&amp;#39;s judgments about health varied from individual to individual. In other words, while each &amp;quot;voter&amp;quot; in the experiment preferred the candidate who seemed healthiest, opinions differed about who that candidate was.  Sane minds can disagree about whether the Gordon Brown stick-figure seems healthier than the Cameron. But these people split on whether the healthier man was a tall guy in his 40&amp;#39;s or a smaller, well-dented character in his mid-70s.  Obviously, their experimental protocol has found something interesting about how people perceive &amp;quot;healthiness,&amp;quot; and how that affects their behavior.  But it sure isn&amp;#39;t actual health.

What, then, might it be?  What explains the variation in judgment from one person to another? Is it culture-bound (do gestures that say &amp;quot;health&amp;quot; to some Britons say something else in Singapore)? Beats me, so I hope they do a lot more experiments.  Meanwhile, it&amp;#39;s time we started figuring out what to do with the mounting evidence that we, as voters, have no idea what we&amp;#39;re doing.

Want to know more?  Here are the papers I&amp;#39;ve mentioned on &amp;quot;non-rational&amp;quot; behavior in voters.

Last Saturday, I’d say it took its first steps, and like any toddler, will soon be running.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot shows what we call “integrated luminosity” which is simply a measure of the number of collisions of protons in the interaction regions at the four experiments.  In this case, it’s my own experiment, CMS, the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment.  CMS and ATLAS are the two large general-purpose detectors, each with thousands of physicists eager for real physics data.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/04/integrated_lumi_2010_up_to_run_133885.gif" alt="integrated_lumi_2010_up_to_run_133885" title="integrated_lumi_2010_up_to_run_133885" width="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the vertical axis of the plot is labelled in units of “nb&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;” or inverse nanobarns.  The unit “barn” is a unit of area, a kind of joke from Enrico Fermi and friends who, despite the tiny size of a nucleus, said it was “as big as a barn” even though in cross sectional area it’s on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;-28&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (which is in fact the definition of one barn).  If we think about the cross sectional area of the protons colliding in the LHC, they have a cross sectional area (or simply a total collision cross section) of about 0.12 barns.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s an inverse nanobarn?  Well, if we try to collide lots of protons, we might ask “how many collisions per barn or cross sectional area did we make?”  It’s like throwing little paint blobs at a wall, one at a time.  Eventually the wall is covered, and then covered again, and then covered many times over.  We can ask “how many paint blobs per unit area of the wall did we cover?”   The nano in nanobarns means one billionth of a barn, and so, now, the LHC has managed to produce its first inverse nanobarn: one collision per every billionth of a barn of cross section.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just a unit – all that matters is “how many collision events of my favorite kind should have been produced?”  To get this, you multiply the number of inverse nanobarns by the production cross section for that kind of event, and also by the probability that you actually detect it.   So for Z boson production, for example, the cross section is about 30 nanobarns, so we should have a few by now.  (I am not at liberty to say whether we do or not…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot has stair steps – the horizontal axis is real time, and the LHC machine is filled with protons, then brought to full energy, then collimators put in, then the experiment turns on and records data for some time until the accelerator folks decide to dump the beam out and refill.  As you can see this cycle has been going like clockwork, with fill after fill of the machine.  And the experiment has been recording a very large fraction of the delivered collisions, the losses being quite normal and due to end effects and the occasional glitch.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then came the LHC baby’s first real step last weekend: squeezing the beam.  By raising the quadrupole beam focusing magnets to high field, the transverse size of proton bunches in the machine shrinks down and the probability of collisions goes up.  In this case, the luminosity went up by an order of magnitude – it was a stunning success.  Any imperfection in the focusing fields can send the beam right out of the machine, and, clearly, that did not happen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal in the next year is to get to one inverse femtobarn – a million times more data.  In the next week or so the plan, if all goes well, is to achieve another couple orders of magnitude in luminosity.  Shit’s about to get real, folks…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010396" title=""&gt;A Dominance Hierarchy of Auditory Spatial Cues in Barn Owls&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Barn owls integrate spatial information across frequency channels to localize sounds in space. We presented barn owls with synchronous sounds that contained different bands of frequencies (3-5 kHz and 7-9 kHz) from different locations in space. When the owls were confronted with the conflicting localization cues from two synchronous sounds of equal level, their orienting responses were dominated by one of the sounds: they oriented toward the location of the low frequency sound when the sources were separated in azimuth; in contrast, they oriented toward the location of the high frequency sound when the sources were separated in elevation. We identified neural correlates of this behavioral effect in the optic tectum (OT, superior colliculus in mammals), which contains a map of auditory space and is involved in generating orienting movements to sounds. We found that low frequency cues dominate the representation of sound azimuth in the OT space map, whereas high frequency cues dominate the representation of sound elevation. We argue that the dominance hierarchy of localization cues reflects several factors: 1) the relative amplitude of the sound providing the cue, 2) the resolution with which the auditory system measures the value of a cue, and 3) the spatial ambiguity in interpreting the cue. These same factors may contribute to the relative weighting of sound localization cues in other species, including humans.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010257" title=""&gt;Human Direct Actions May Alter Animal Welfare, a Study on Horses (Equus caballus)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Back pain is the cause of bad welfare in humans and animals. Although vertebral problems are regularly reported on riding horses, these problems are not always identified nor noticed enough to prevent these horses to be used for work. Nineteen horses from two riding centres were submitted to chiropractic examinations performed by an experienced chiropractor and both horses' and riders' postures were observed during a riding lesson. The results show that 74% of horses were severely affected by vertebral problems, while only 26% were mildly or not affected. The degree of vertebral problems identified at rest was statistically correlated with horses' attitudes at work (neck height and curve), and horses' attitudes at work were clearly correlated with riders' positions. Clear differences appeared between schools concerning both riders' and horses' postures, and the analysis of the teachers' speech content and duration highlighted differences in the attention devoted to the riders' position. These findings are to our knowledge the first to underline the impact of riding on horses' back problems and the importance of teaching proper balance to beginner riders in order to increase animals' welfare.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010339" title=""&gt;A Currency for Offsetting Energy Development Impacts: Horse-Trading Sage-Grouse on the Open Market&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Biodiversity offsets provide a mechanism to compensate for unavoidable damages from new energy development as the U.S. increases its domestic production. Proponents argue that offsets provide a partial solution for funding conservation while opponents contend the practice is flawed because offsets are negotiated without the science necessary to backup resulting decisions. Missing in negotiations is a biologically-based currency for estimating sufficiency of offsets and a framework for applying proceeds to maximize conservation benefits. Here we quantify a common currency for offsets for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) by estimating number of impacted birds at 4 levels of development commonly permitted. Impacts were indiscernible at 1-12 wells per 32.2 km2. Above this threshold lek losses were 2-5 times greater inside than outside of development and bird abundance at remaining leks declined by −32 to −77%. Findings reiterated the importance of time-lags as evidenced by greater impacts 4 years after initial development. Clustering well locations enabled a few small leks to remain active inside of developments. Documented impacts relative to development intensity can be used to forecast biological trade-offs of newly proposed or ongoing developments, and when drilling is approved, anticipated bird declines form the biological currency for negotiating offsets. Monetary costs for offsets will be determined by true conservation cost to mitigate risks such as sagebrush tillage to other populations of equal or greater number. If this information is blended with landscape level conservation planning, the mitigation hierarchy can be improved by steering planned developments away from conservation priorities, ensuring compensatory mitigation projects deliver a higher return for conservation that equate to an equal number of birds in the highest priority areas, provide on-site mitigation recommendations, and provide a biologically based cost for mitigating unavoidable impacts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010379" title=""&gt;Characterisation of Nitric Oxide Synthase in Three Cnidarian-Dinoflagellate Symbioses&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is an enzyme catalysing the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline and nitric oxide (NO), the latter being an essential messenger molecule for a range of biological processes. Whilst its role in higher vertebrates is well understood little is known about the role of this enzyme in early metazoan groups. For instance, NOS-mediated signalling has been associated with Cnidaria-algal symbioses, however controversy remains about the contribution of enzyme activities by the individual partners of these mutualistic relationships. Using a modified citrulline assay we successfully measured NOS activity in three cnidarian-algal symbioses: the sea anemone Aiptasia pallida, the hard coral Acropora millepora, and the soft coral Lobophytum pauciflorum, so demonstrating a wide distribution of this enzyme in the phylum Cnidaria. Further biochemical (citrulline assay) and histochemical (NADPH-diaphorase) investigations of NOS in the host tissue of L. pauciflorum revealed the cytosolic and calcium dependent nature of this enzyme and its in situ localisation within the coral's gastrodermal tissue, the innermost layer of the body wall bearing the symbiotic algae. Interestingly, enzyme activity could not be detected in symbionts freshly isolated from the cnidarians, or in cultured algal symbionts. These results suggest that NOS-mediated NO release may be host-derived, a finding that has the potential to further refine our understanding of signalling events in cnidarian-algal symbioses.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_274.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_274.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/MM4k9rfQcxc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272489157807"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=14791">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ef0c1e9d626ea3a5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Huffington Post"/><category term="Larry Dossey"/><category term="Steve Newton"/><title type="html">Defending Science on HuffPo</title><published>2010-04-28T20:39:29Z</published><updated>2010-04-28T20:39:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/dxGTthL4wK8/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/28/defending-science-on-huffpo/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I used to write for the Huffington Post, before it became overrun with antiscience alt-med antivax garbage so thick I could smell it through my monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case in point would be &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-larry-dossey/the-scientific-method-an_b_550004.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;a somewhat targetless essay by Dr. Larry Dossey&lt;/a&gt;, who seems to be trying to say that because science is portrayed as an individual effort, but is actually usually a team effort, students get confused and marginalized. Or something. His point is difficult to determine. But in any case, he’s quite wrong; the idea of science being done by groups of people collaboratively is everywhere, from astronomy to zoology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need not go into details, because, happily, Steve Newton from the NCSE &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-newton/in-defense-of-scientific-_b_552602.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;has posted a rebuttal on HuffPo&lt;/a&gt; that tears Dossey to shreds. My favorite part was when Dossey says Nobel Prizes are only given to individuals, and my first thought was &amp;quot;Wow, I wonder if the &lt;a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2007/press.html"&gt;IPCC&lt;/a&gt; knows about this?&amp;quot;… in his essay, Newton says almost exactly the same thing. Great minds, yadda yadda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I suggest you read Dossey’s screed, and then read Newton’s slamdunking of it. It’s a wonderful exercise in muddied and clear thinking, in that order. With people like Newton writing for HuffPo, it makes me feel a bit better that I don’t need to as much.&lt;/p&gt;

Our goal as an organization is to bring science, skepticism and critical thinking to the women of the Midwest. We’re planning some great events, campaigns and outreach programs to help provide women with the tools to fight pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re taking the skeptical community offline, and giving people a reason to care about our message!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your donation will help us bring in great speakers for our lecture series, fund our educational and outreach campaigns, and bring some fun and fantastic science and skepticism events to Chicago and expand to the rest of the Midwest!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inaugural event is one I’m very excited about! (Even though I’ll be out of town for it — very sad about this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;strong&gt;Jen McCreight&lt;/strong&gt;, fresh off of #boobquake!&lt;/p&gt;

Confusion Second

Relief Third, Hopefully

Large rocks hurtle towards our heads. What happens? We duck. The process, however, is complex.

It involves answering two questions: what is that? and how do I behave? This anthropomorphic perspective is backwards and flawed. It suggests searching (for what, that and how) and then behaving. 

The whole process (what, that and how) can be instinctive, like ducking the rock: body-as-it-was, object, body-as-it-is.1 Usually, the process is complex: We encounter conflict (confusion) and unfamiliarity (doubt). 

We automatically (and largely unconsciously) inhibit the primed behavior and resolve the confusion and doubt. Resolution disinhibits and unleashes automatic action, much like a baseball player swinging at a pitch. In fact, a baseball player swings well before he is even aware he has swung or has chosen to swing.2

OUTLINING AN ENCOUNTER

The details of an encounter with an emotionally salient object are body-based. The event and its resolution are expressed in the form: body-as-it-was, object, body-as-it-is. An emotion is simply the change in the body evoked by the object.

If the presence of an object exceed some threshold, our brain is triggered and pays attention. It creates a sensory-representation [s-rep] and contextual-representation [c-rep] of the object.

  Chris Brewin et al. (2010), describing his dual memory model:3

  Evidence from cognitive psychology and neuroscience implies distinct neural bases to abstract, flexible, contextualized representations (C-reps) and to inflexible, sensory-bound representations (S-reps)... [Our] model is used to explain how the different types of distressing visual intrusions associated with clinical disorders arise, in terms of the need for correct interaction between the neural systems supporting S-reps and C-reps.

To account for an s-rep, and a c-rep, I use a red triangle to represent an s-rep and a green triangle to represent a c-rep. Red suggests concern: unforeseen data viewed as a threat. Green suggests comfort: presumption substituted for genuine insight.

Together, these representations form our general understanding of an object. This understanding has three parts: c-rep unsupported by s-rep [green], s-rep unsupported by c-rep [red], and c-rep supported by s-rep [a more neutral color which reflects the relative strength of green and red].

Our general understanding reflects what we comprehend and what we apprehend. We comprehend data supported by context. Our comprehension usually reflects multiple core-understandings.

A core understanding is a familiar emotion which keys an understood behavior in response to the object. Favorable outcomes and positive affect typically arise from core understanding. However positive the outcome, we often first experience conflict among possible behaviors. Such conflict is central feature of our general understanding. Conflict evokes confusion.

What we don’t comprehend, we apprehend. Apprehension reflects two qualities of partial understanding: presumption (context unsupported by data) and observation (data unsupported by context).

Observation evokes anxiety. Presumption evokes assurance. Too much presumption causes denial, for example.

In general, we view unforeseen data as a threat. Because of these bias, our apprehensions evoke more anxiety than assurance. Apprehension evokes doubt. (Here, conflict, presumption, observation and apprehension describe attributes of the overlap of s- and c-reps. Confusion, anxiety, assurance and doubt are the emotions evoked by conflict, observation, presumption and apprehension.)

Our general understanding of an object does not evoke confusion, anxiety, curiosity and doubt. Rather, confusion, anxiety, curiosity and doubt are features of our general understanding.

At the very onset of an encounter, the emotionality can be quiet complex. When confusion and doubt exceed a threshold, our brain inhibits the primed behavior and seeks resolution.

Our brain resolves. Our body behaves. (An emotion is a body change, a behavior. When I use the word ‘behavior’ rather than ‘emotion,’ I intend to indicate a complex sequence of body changes. Colloquially, behaviors are complex, sequenced emotions.)

From general understanding comes behavior. This outcome reflects the combination of our dual memories (sensory and contextual), and our behavior-inhibition and -activation systems (BIS and BAS). A clear analytic framework for these memory systems and behavior systems shows how automatic the process is. It strips away the pathetic fallacy.

If events are things which happen to us, our behavior is driven by our own unique context - the combination of nature and nurture which catalogs possible behaviors. The more nuanced our context for a given event, the more our best-possible-behavior resembles the best-behavior-possible.

Context is essential to the efficiency and effectiveness of our behavior. Trauma causes damage to context. Any event which does not completely endorse the enacted behavior causes trauma - an opportunity for learning. Some trauma is so severe, it stifles the process of learning and rebuilding context.

Context, Trauma and Best-Behavior-Possible

Sensory representations are just that. Contextual representations are the applicable elements of our context. Contextual representations are assumptions. Together, s-reps and c-reps form a moment of remembered presence within our assumptive world. This statement characterizes individual moments of experience rather than some quality of the self.

Context is any quality of understanding: our innate tendencies, instincts and reflexes - our nature - and our somatic markers, biases, scripts, schemas, personalized mind-blindness, unchallengeable doubts and certainties, internal working models, and values - our nurture. Context is nothing less than our model of both the world and also how we most effectively respond to it.

Context is the means to efficiently identify the best-behavior-possible. Trauma is the means to creating best-behaviors-possible.

A defining quality of best-behavior-possible is that the event’s outcome unequivocally endorses the behavior. A lesser behavior, a best-possible-behavior, will give rise to an outcome which denigrates the enacted behavior, perhaps to the point of extinction. 

Trauma violates context and impairs efficiency (here, context and efficiency are tautological). Trauma breaks down core understandings, increases apprehension and causes greater doubt. (In the case of heightened sensitivity to presumption, trauma might cause greater assurance - denials, confabulations, etc.)

As Tedeshi and Calhoun note: the "seismic" set of circumstances severely challenges, contradicts, or may even nullify the way the individual understands why things happen.4 As Brewin notes: trauma generally involves a violation of basic assumptions connected with survival as a member of a social group.5

We struggle with the consequences of a traumatic event. We seek to resolve lingering doubt. Most often, we adapt. We assemble a better sequence of emotions to create a closer approximation of best-behavior-possible. The school of hard rocks is the best teacher and is the primary source of nurture.

  Tedeschi and Calhoun:6

  Posttraumatic growth refers to a change in people that goes beyond an ability to resist and not be damaged by highly stressful circumstances; it involves a movement beyond pretrauma levels of a adaption. Posttraumatic growth, then, has a quality of transformation, or a qualitative change in functioning, unlike the apparently similar concepts of resilience, sense of coherence, optimism, and hardiness.

The struggle with trauma generates much of our learned (rather than innate) efficiency and effectiveness. If posttraumatic growth [PTG] involve “movement beyond pretrauma levels,” then we adapt, understand more clearly (efficiency) and behave more effectively. PTG creates comprehension.

General Understanding And Memory

Our general understanding is the composition of an s- and c-rep. The correspondence these representations gives rise to three distinct qualities. Observation is the experience of an s-rep without a consonant c-rep. Presumption is the experience of a c-rep unsupported by available sensory data. Core understanding is the combination of known information consonant with accurate context....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

This week, Tristan Zimmerman of &lt;a href="http://evoedu.com"&gt;EvoEdu&lt;/a&gt; gives you some tips on how not to be a dick and why you might want to avoid being one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this was planned when I posted Brian’s rant. Yes, it was lazy. No, I don’t feel bad. No, I didn’t delete your rant if you submitted one to me this week. Yes, I still love you. No, I didn’t check on when the insurance autopayment is supposed to hit the account. (That last one was for my husband in case he’s reading.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I don’t really have much to lead into this with because I’ve never been an asshole to anyone in my life… ever. So I don’t know what it’s like. But I know you act like one all the time, so please read on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Attack People&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tristan Zimmerman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very few new pseudosciences out there. UFOs go back 60 years, homeopathy two hundred, and God only knows how old astrology is. Practitioners have been using the same tired arguments all this time, and we’ve been boring ourselves listening to them. Because of this, it’s easy to forget those we talk to are flesh-and-blood people, not collections of the same old faulty ideas and misconceptions. We can slip into a pattern. We simply attack ideas and strip bare what we see as stupidity without realizing that we are attacking the person, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to remember that people you talk to often have good reasons for believing what they do. While many just saw it on TV and won’t really mind being corrected, a good number are deeply invested in a pseudoscience for highly personal reasons. Attacking these people’s opinions is an attack upon the person himself. Consider that an attack on the idea is an attack on the motivations. An attack on the motivations is an attack on the person. It sounds ludicrous, but it’s true. Consider these two examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To many who advocate creationism, it’s only one facet of a broad and deep faith in Christ. To some extent, they filter everything in life through this faith. Attacking creationism is attacking their faith, which may be at the core of their self-identity. In this case, an attack on creationism (different from a discussion of the merits of evolution) is an attack on the person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man committed to homeopathic treatments likely thinks he has very good evidence for homeopathy. Attacking his beliefs as worthless anecdotal evidence and confirmation bias (different from explaining why anecdotal evidence has little merit and how confirmation bias works) will make him think along the following lines: “If what he says is true, I’m an idiot for using this stuff. But I know I’m no idiot, so he must be wrong.” It’s not logical, but forget logic. It makes sense for a human to respond negatively to what they see as a personal attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your goal then, must be to to expose people to new ideas. Don’t simply tear down their ideas – that’s just not going to work. Support the scientific alternatives, and then, with respect and empathy, explain why the support for their idea does not hold up. Do not attack the support. Certainly do not attack the idea itself. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terrible: “Homeopathy is a ridiculous idea thought of in an era where medicine was just as likely to kill you as make you stronger and based on the truly inane concepts that whatever sickened you can cure you and that diluting a chemical makes its effect more powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad: “Homeopathy’s support comes from people tricked by the placebo effect, terribly-designed studies, and a childish fear of big corporations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good: “Anecdotal evidence is unreliable for [&lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/testimon.html"&gt;these reasons&lt;/a&gt;]. The scientific studies that support homeopathy are flawed because of [&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/06/15/homeopathy-awareness-week/"&gt;these reasons&lt;/a&gt;]. Most homeopathic remedies are manufactured by the same parent companies that advocates of CAM are trying to avoid. When you consider that the large, well-designed studies do not support homeopathy, there’s not much good evidence supporting the idea it works. I can completely understand why you want it to be true – I’ve gotten obscene medical bills too. But it’s just not true.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond exposing people to new ideas, there’s not much you can do. They have to come to their own conclusions. Attacking their ideas will not get you any further, and will, in fact, drive them deeper into their convictions. You must not forget that folks will often see a personal attack in a volley on their cherished beliefs. Whether you think this is childish, ridiculous, or perfectly understandable changes nothing. Forgetting that these ideas you’re arguing against have actual flesh-and-blood people behind them will lead you to simply attack the idea, and that will accomplish nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing – other than &lt;em&gt;Esquire&lt;/em&gt;’s hat-tip to Giulia, we’re kind of pissed about the piece. It features portraits of women in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s, but frankly, the magazine doesn’t make the prospect of female aging &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/topic/look/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=look&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; so hot. Their photos of women in their 20s are taken from flattering angles at the perfect moment, when their smile, eyes, and hair are just right. But the older the women get, the more the photos resemble mugshots: Unsmiling, squinting old crones stare straight into the camera in far less flattering poses. Just what are you hinting at, dear &lt;em&gt;Esquire&lt;/em&gt;? (And we wonder why so many men date younger women.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To right this wrong, we created our own portrait of women through the ages. Hot celebs in their 30s, 40s, and 50s who are aging gracefully and beautifully. (Sandra Bullock, Claire Danes, Kate Winslet, Michelle Obama, Sharon Stone, and Kim Cattrall, to name a few.) They prove that if you’re given a fair shake at a good photo, turning 35, 45, or 55 doesn’t have to look like the day you get sent to prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the letters page of this week’s issue of the &lt;em&gt;Times Literary Supplement&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article7110598.ece"&gt;Fodor and Piatelli-Palmarini reply&lt;/a&gt; to the trashing of their book by Samir Okasha. Surprise, surprise, Okasha didn’t understand what they were saying – “an egregious misreading”. For most of us, if someone doesn’t understand the point we’re making, it’s because we haven’t expressed ourselves in the right way… Some philosophers seem to think that any misunderstandings are inevitably the fault of the reader. Who finds their riposte convincing? I hope Okasha comes out fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir, – Samir Okasha’s review of What Darwin Got Wrong (March 26) contains a number of serious criticisms of a line of argument the conclusion of which is that there is something radically wrong with Darwin’s Theory of Natural Selection (TNS). Since we do think that there is something radically wrong with TNS, this would worry us a lot if the argument that Okasha deconstructs were even remotely like the one to which our book is committed. But it’s not. Okasha’s review is a really egregious misreading of the book; we don’t hold (and didn’t publish) the views that Okasha says we do. In fact, we explicitly don’t hold these views, and we devote a lot of the book to explaining why no one should. We know from experience that reviewing is hard work and that it conduces to fast reading. But still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the most flagrant example: “. . . Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini insist that . . . there is no basis on which to distinguish the selected-for traits from the free-riders. This distinction could only be drawn, they argue, by invoking an intelligent designer . . .”. If words were the kinds of things that can be false, every one of those would qualify. In particular, we think (as does Okasha) that the selected-for traits are the ones that causally contribute to fitness. We take this to be common ground for everybody involved in the present conversation, Darwin included. For present purposes, it’s OK with us if you take that to be true by definition. (This does not, of course, commit us to accepting that any traits are selected-for; only that, if any are, then they are causes, not just correlates, of fitness.) Nor do we think that the distinction between causes and correlates can only be made by invoking an intelligent designer. To the contrary, we devote a whole chapter (Chapter Seven) to discussing some of the ways in which causes and correlates are routinely deconfounded, both in science and in everyday life. Running control experiments, formal or informal, is the standard technique; and there are many, many others. But (so we argue) only things with minds can run experiments; and since it is also common ground that Natural Selection hasn’t got a mind, distinguishing causes from confounds by running experiments isn’t among its options. Likewise for all the other ways of distinguishing among confounded variables that we could think of. If we’re right about that, then the conclusion isn’t that there is an intelligent designer; it’s that there is something wrong with TNS. So, then, our view is not that it is impossible to deconfound causes of fitness from freeriders. Still less is it that there is no such distinction. What we do think (and what we do think our book shows) is that Darwin’s theory can’t specify a mechanism by which selection could reliably distinguish causes of fitness from correlates of causes of fitness. This is not, to repeat, because there is no such distinction; it’s because TNS recognizes only exogenous variables as selectors, and the only (relevant) fact to which such variables are sensitive, according to TNS, is the strength of the correlations between phenotypic changes and changes of fitness. And, of course, correlation doesn’t imply causation. It patently doesn’t in the kind of cases we discuss, where phenotypic traits are linked, so that the correlation with fitness is identical for both of the candidate causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our difficulty with Darwin is very like our difficulty with our stockbroker. He says the way to succeed on the market is to buy low and sell high, and we believe him. But since he won’t tell us how to buy low and sell high, his advice does us no good. Likewise, Darwin thinks that the traits that are selected-for are the ones that cause fitness; but he doesn’t say how the kinds of variables that his theory envisages as selectors could interact with phenotypes in ways that distinguish causes of fitness from their confounds. This problem can’t be solved by just stipulating that the traits that are selected for are the fitness-enhancing traits; that, as one said in the 1960s, isn’t the solution; it’s the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have other complaints as well. Three examples: we do not hold a “covering law” view of scientific theories; we are explicit that we don’t. What we hold is that if there were laws of selection, that would solve the problem of reconciling TNS with the intensionality of “select-for”. But we don’t think there are such laws in biology, and Okasha doesn’t either. Also: we disapprove of Okasha’s appealing to the “paradigm” explanatory power of mathematical models of natural selection to rebut our objections to TNS. Models don’t even purport to reveal the mechanisms that underlie the phenomena they’re models of; and our claim is that no mechanism could do what TNS says natural selection does. Also: Okasha summarizes several recent discoveries in biology that our book recounts. He sets them aside saying (correctly) that “they simply concern aspects of biology about which traditional neo-Darwinism didn’t have much to say”. But our point about these discoveries is not that neo-Darwinists ignore them; it’s the marginalization of TNS that they imply; it seems the action is mostly in a different part of town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, one place where we admit to a fair cop. Samir Okasha chides us for not telling our readers about the distinction between “random” variation and “undirected” variation. Guilty as charged. But that isn’t because, as Okasha graciously suggests, we don’t understand the difference; it’s because we try not to make readers attend to distinctions which, though perfectly valid, aren’t germane to the topic being discussed. Insisting that readers should is just the sort of thing that gives pedantry a bad name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/religion-244206-people-behave.html"&gt;Does religion make us better people?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinion 1: Religion makes people behave better. 32 %&lt;br&gt;

Opinion 2: Being religious has no effect on your behavior. 25 %&lt;br&gt;

Opinon 3: Religion makes us behave worse. 43 % &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's actually a fairly even-handed article by a rabbi starting a new weekly religion column. He even gives reasons for each of the three possibilities. For #1, he cites Rick Warren and Tom Coburn. For #3, he cites Gregory Paul, a scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A statistical study by Gregory Paul shows an even more astonishing result. He reports that, in general, higher levels of religion correlate with higher rates of homicide, teen pregnancy, and abortion in the prosperous democracies. While this does not prove religion is the cause, the link between religion and bad behavior indicates that, on average, religion makes us behave worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, even if I didn't have a prior bias, the article would have convinced me that the evidence favors the third option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/religion-245679-people-better.html"&gt;follow-up article&lt;/a&gt;, the rabbi is surprised at the result so far. I think it&amp;#39;s about to get a little more surprising…for him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/an_orange_county_poll.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/iHYe7han4Mw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272475485570"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/euchems2010/~3/VoWzVfeI8ns/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/23202c5a67e82d86</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Mapping the wetting</title><published>2010-04-28T10:51:09Z</published><updated>2010-04-28T10:51:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/DtBjCKBJZ0w/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/euchems2010/~3/VoWzVfeI8ns/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">When it comes to chemistry, surfaces are the places to be.

&lt;p&gt;If there’s any quantitative reasoning behind the question (or claim), it comes from comparing the amount of matter within the observable universe to the radius of the observable universe, and noticing that it looks a lot like the relationship between the mass of a black hole and its &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius"&gt;Schwarzschild radius&lt;/a&gt;.  That is:  if you imagine taking all the stuff in the universe and putting it into one place, it would make a black hole the size of the universe.  Slightly more formally, it looks like the the universe satisfies the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoop_conjecture"&gt;hoop conjecture&lt;/a&gt;, so shouldn’t it form a black hole?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/04/blackhole_44-300x288.gif" alt="blackhole_44" title="blackhole_44" width="300" height="288"&gt;  But a black hole is not “a place where a lot of mass has been squeezed inside its own Schwarzschild radius.”  It is, as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; is happy to tell you, “a region of space from which nothing, including light, can escape.”  The implication being that there is a region &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the black hole from which things could at least imagine escaping &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;.  For the universe, there is no such outside region.  So at a pretty trivial level, the universe is not a black hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might say that this is picking nits, and the existence of an outside region is beside the point if the inside of our universe resembles a black hole.  That’s fine, except:  it doesn’t.  You may have noticed that the universe is actually expanding, rather than contracting as you might expect the interior of a black hole to be.  That’s because, if anything, our universe bears a passing resemblance to a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hole"&gt;white hole&lt;/a&gt;.  Our universe (according to conventional general relativity) has a singularity in the past, out of which everything emerged, not a singularity in the future into which everything is crashing.  We call that singularity the Big Bang, but it’s very similar to what we would expect from a white hole, which is just a time-reversed version of a black hole.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That insight, plus four dollars or so, will get you a grande latte at Starbucks.  The spacetime solution to Einstein’s equation that describes a universe expanding from the Big Bang is very similar to the time-reversal of a black hole, but you don’t really learn much from making that statement, especially because there is no outside; everything you wanted to know was already there in the original cosmological language.  Our universe is not going to collapse to a future singularity, even though the mass is enough to allow that to happen, simply because it’s expanding; the singularity you’re anticipating already happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, some folks will stubbornly insist, there has to be something deep and interesting about the fact that the radius of the observable universe is comparable to the Schwarzschild radius of an equally-sized black hole.  And there is!  It means the universe is spatially flat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can figure this out by looking at the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations"&gt;Friedmann equation&lt;/a&gt;, which relates the Hubble parameter to the energy density and the spatial curvature of the universe.   The radius of our observable universe is basically the Hubble length, which is the speed of light divided by the Hubble parameter.  It’s a straightforward exercise to calculate the amount of mass inside a sphere whose radius is the Hubble length (&lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; = 4π &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;/3), and then calculate the corresponding Schwarzschild radius (&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; = 2&lt;em&gt;GM&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  You will find that the radius equals the Hubble length, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the universe is spatially flat.  Voila!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that a spatially flat universe remains spatially flat forever, so this isn’t telling us anything about the universe &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;; it always has been true, and will remain always true.  It’s a nice fact, but it doesn’t reveal anything about the universe that we didn’t already know by thinking about cosmology.  Who wants to live inside a black hole, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… I put in a request that they add it to their collection, and in the meantime asked them to try to get it on inter-library loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They got it in, and today I went to pick it up.  Taking a look to see what library they borrowed it from — the label said “Liberty University”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I took a closer look.  The book was absolutely pristine.  It’s a paperback, and it looked as if it was straight off the bookstore shelf, as if it had never been opened.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/LibertyBook.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/LibertyBook.jpg" alt="" title="LibertyBook" width="479" height="731"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liberty University has my book&lt;/em&gt;.  That’s surprising. I know it’s a book for the Christian market, but still… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No one there has ever read it&lt;/em&gt;.  That doesn’t surprise me.  It does criticize some churches… and it’s written by an atheist.  How &lt;em&gt;dare&lt;/em&gt; anyone get close to that piece of blasphemy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they’re not going to read it, can’t they at least humor me and just ban the book?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be awesome.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NATURAL DISASTERS - UNNATURAL ACTS&lt;br&gt;
Are Natural Disasters Caused by Unnatural Acts?&lt;br&gt;
June 27, 2001&lt;br&gt;
Janis Walworth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition, once warned Orlando, Florida, that it was courting natural disaster by allowing gay pride flags to be flown along its streets. "A condition like this will bring about ... earthquakes, tornadoes, and possibly a meteor," Robertson said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently he was referring to his belief that the presence of openly gay people incurs divine wrath and that God acts through geological and meteorological events to destroy municipalities that permit gay people the same civil liberties as others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Pat and his Christian cronies get too carried away promulgating the idea that natural disasters are prompted by people who displease God, they should take a hard look at the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tornadoes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take tornadoes. Every state (except Alaska) has them — some only one or two a year, dozens in others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gay people are in every state (even Alaska). According to Pat's hypothesis, there should be more gay people in states that have more tornadoes. But are there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope. In fact, there's no correlation at all between the number of gay folks (as estimated by the number of gay political organizations, support groups, bookstores, radio programs, and circuit parties) and the annual tornado count (r = .04, p = .78 for you statisticians).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much for the "God hates gays" theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God seems almost neutral on the subject of sexual orientation. I say "almost" because if we look at the density of gay groups relative to the population as a whole, there is a small but statistically significant (p = .05) correlation with the occurrence of tornadoes. And it's a negative correlation (r= -.28).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who haven't used statistics since 1973, that means that a high concentration of gay organizations actually protects against tornadoes. A state with the population of, say, Alabama could avert two tornadoes a year, merely by doubling the number of gay organizations in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although God may not care about sexual orientation, the same cannot be said for religious affiliation. If the underlying tenet of Pat&amp;#39;s postulate is true — that God wipes out offensive folks via natural disasters — then perhaps we can find some evidence of who&amp;#39;s on God&amp;#39;s hit list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jews are off the hook here: there's no correlation between numbers of Jews and frequency of tornadoes. Ditto for Catholics. But when it comes to Protestants, there's a highly significant correlation of .71.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that fully half the state-to-state variation in tornado frequency can be accounted for by the presence of Protestants. And the chance that this association is merely coincidental is only one in 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tornados Drawn to Baptists&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protestants, of course, come in many flavors — we were able to find statistics for Lutherans, Methodists, Baptists, and others. Lutherans don&amp;#39;t seem to be a problem — no correlation with tornadoes. There&amp;#39;s a modest correlation (r = .52, p= .0001) between Methodists and tornadoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Baptists and others share the prize: both groups show a definite correlation with tornado frequency (r = .68, p = .0001). This means that Texas could cut its average of 139 tornadoes per year in half by sending a few hundred thousand Baptists elsewhere (Alaska maybe?). What, you are probably asking yourself, about gay Protestants? An examination of the numbers of gay religious groups (mostly Protestant) reveals no significant relationship with tornadoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps even Protestants are less repugnant to God if they're gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that brings up another point — the futility of trying to save the world by getting gay people to accept Jesus. It looks from our numbers as if the frequency of natural disasters might be more effectively reduced by encouraging Protestants to be gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gay people have been falsely blamed for disasters ever since Sodom was destroyed by fire and brimstone. (We have been unable to find any statistics on disasters involving brimstone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a reliable source, the destruction of Sodom was indeed an act of God (see Genesis 19:13). Its destruction was perpetrated because the citizens thereof were, according to the same source (see Ezekiel 16:49-50) &amp;quot;arrogant, overfed and unconcerned [and] did not help the poor and needy&amp;quot; — not because they were gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Pat would have us believe that gays are the cause of tornadoes (as well as earthquakes, meteors, and even terrorist bombs) in utter disregard for evidence showing that Baptists are much more likely to cause them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As any statistician will tell you, of course, correlation doesn't prove causation. Protestants causing tornadoes by angering God isn't the only explanation for these data. It could be that Baptists and other Protestants purposely flock to states that have lots of tornadoes (no, we haven't checked for a correlation between IQ and religious affiliation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if Pat and his Christian crew insist that natural disasters are brought on by people who offend God, let the data show who those people are.&lt;/p&gt;

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Hilary Maybaum from &lt;a href="http://www.iescience.com/" title=""&gt;i.e.science&lt;/a&gt; to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm an East Coaster from the U.S., originally and ultimately a New Yorker, but I spent 14 years of my life in Hawaii.  Those years shaped most of  scientific approach to the world, for it was there that I earned my Master of Science degree in oceanography. I staged my early training as a scientist at the other side of the world -- Woods Hole, Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figure I&amp;#39;m on career #9 or 10 at this stage.  My wayward trajectory has been: Teaching Assistant --&amp;gt; Bartender --&amp;gt; Instructor --&amp;gt; Author --&amp;gt; Oceanographer --&amp;gt;  Environmental Consultant --&amp;gt; Science Editor --&amp;gt; Grant Director --&amp;gt; Business Owner (Science Writer)&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running my business, &lt;a href="http://www.iescience.com/" title=""&gt;www.iescience.com&lt;/a&gt;.  I provide science writing and editing services, mostly for educational publishers.  I write a lot of textbook material (print) and I develop online activities for publishers' companion Web sites.  Tweeting and blogging are also part of my current career.  I still hope I'll get paid by someone like Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to manage their social media networks and Web content, but I'm happiest working for myself.  I've yet to write a business plan, though.  After three successful years, it would probably be a good idea. But I'm so good at procrastinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of science communication interests me immensely.  I've seen a lot of changes over the past 20+ years, and I like what I'm seeing now. For example, the other day I was visiting the new &lt;a href="http://www.alaskahumpbacks.org/" title=""&gt;online catalog of whale flukes for Southeast Alaska&lt;/a&gt; and noticed that full PDFs were attached to each scholarly article referenced on the site.  How cool is that!  I wish more people would think to include full article citations in their science writing and online journalism, because that's the best way for people to educate themselves on topics of scientific interest.  I know, Bora, that you are an advocate of this and I praise you for your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned these earlier, so yes, they are a net positive and, I feel, a necessity in the sense that blogging and tweeting stretch my outreach and networking abilities.  I'll tell you what, though. The &lt;a href="http://www.nasw.org/" title=""&gt;National Association of Science Writers&lt;/a&gt; doesn't agree with me.  I sent them blog clips from my site, &lt;a href="http://www.iescience.com/blog" title=""&gt;Wet&lt;/a&gt; to support my membership application, but NASW promptly rejected them. According to NASW's director, "self-published or personal blogs do not fit the criteria for clips."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this official rejection, I have found social networking to be very helpful in non-writing endeavors, such as finding editorial assistants, discovering workshops and conferences (I'm looking at you, ScienceOnline 2010), and even job searching. But the best part for me about social networking is the ability to connect and reconnect with scientists -- my favorite group of people!&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any cool &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Participants_Blogroll/" title=""&gt;science blogs by the participants&lt;/a&gt; at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm an old fan of Seed Magazine; hence, I found ScienceBlogs many years ago.  I have recently (in the past 6 months) discovered a plethora of cool science blogs (yours among them, of course!) as a result of my connections on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I liked best about ScienceOnline 2010 were the physical/mental/spiritual aspects of being among like-minded people of all ages and sizes.  I found it to be highly energizing. I think, too, that it was so well organized, with lots of play time and technological opportunities, it was as if every minute was a gift.  And to top it all off, I got to sit among an entire table of marine scientists at dinner!  That hasn't happened to me in decades!!  So thanks again, Bora and Anton, for a job well done and with heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you in person and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

First some flunky came out to make this declaration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last couple of months have been very difficult, he went on, with so many questions being raised about things that happened long ago. But he said, &lt;span&gt;"This is the time for truth, transparency and credibility. Secrecy and discretion are not values that are in fashion at the moment. We must be in a condition of having nothing to hide."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, now it's all in the distant past. Once again, they are not going to take responsibility, but push it off. That is not promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Pope himself spoke, it was no better. No mention of the sex abuse scandals, just another slow swivel to another target in the blame game: &lt;i&gt;the internet&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The times in which we living knows a huge widening of the frontiers of communication,"&lt;/span&gt; he said (according to our Italian fixer/producer) and the new media of this new age points to a more &lt;span&gt;"egalitarian and pluralistic"&lt;/span&gt; forum. But, he went on to say, it also opens a new hole, the &lt;span&gt;"digital divide"&lt;/span&gt; between haves and have-nots. Even more ominous, he said, it exacerbates tensions between nations and within nations themselves. And it increases the &lt;span&gt;"dangers of ... intellectual and moral relativism,"&lt;/span&gt; which can lead to &lt;span&gt;"multiple forms of degradation and humiliation"&lt;/span&gt; of the essence of a person, and to the &lt;span&gt;"pollution of the spirit."&lt;/span&gt; All in all, it seemed a pretty grim view of the wide open communication parameters being demanded by the Internet age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rejection of modernity is not just the provenance of yokel creationists, I guess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/its_all_my_fault.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/0p1kFvhKFIA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272465856740"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/latest_ark_finding_is_a_fake.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f824c3251cd732c7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Latest Ark finding is a fake</title><published>2010-04-28T12:56:19Z</published><updated>2010-04-28T12:56:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/i8wcTIde_YM/latest_ark_finding_is_a_fake.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/latest_ark_finding_is_a_fake.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is completely unsurprising. An &lt;a href="http://michaelsheiser.com/PaleoBabble/2010/04/noahs-ark-paleobabble-update"&gt;account from Randall Price&lt;/a&gt; has emerged; Price is a notorious Ark-hunter, young earth creationist, and professor at Liberty University, so he has good kook credentials and is the kind of guy who desperately wants the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/if_fox_news_and_wing_nut_daily.php"&gt;recent claims of the discovery of Noah's Ark&lt;/a&gt; to be true, making this an admission contrary to his biases…of course, it turns out he also has a money motive to begrudge the Chinese evangelicals their &amp;#39;discovery&amp;#39;. But this is also a familiar story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was the archaeologist with the Chinese expedition in the summer of 2008 and was given photos of what they now are reporting to be the inside of the Ark. I and my partners invested $100,000 in this expedition (described below) which they have retained, despite their promise and our requests to return it, since it was not used for the expedition. The information given below is my opinion based on what I have seen and heard (from others who claim to have been eyewitnesses or know the exact details).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To make a long story short: this is all reported to be a fake. The photos were reputed to have been taken off site near the Black Sea, but the film footage the Chinese now have was shot on location on Mt. Ararat. In the late summer of 2008 ten Kurdish workers hired by Parasut, the guide used by the Chinese, are said to have planted large wood beams taken from an old structure in the Black Sea area (where the photos were originally taken) at the Mt. Ararat site. In the winter of 2008 a Chinese climber taken by Parasut's men to the site saw the wood, but couldn't get inside because of the severe weather conditions. During the summer of 2009 more wood was planted inside a cave at the site. The Chinese team went in the late summer of 2009 (I was there at the time and knew about the hoax) and was shown the cave with the wood and made their film. As I said, I have the photos of the inside of the so-called Ark (that show cobwebs in the corners of rafters - something just not possible in these conditions) and our Kurdish partner in Dogubabyazit (the village at the foot of Mt. Ararat) has all of the facts about the location, the men who planted the wood, and even the truck that transported it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar phenomenon took place in &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC101.html"&gt;Paluxy River, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. Some creationists find fossil footprints that look vaguely (to the biased eye) human, pretty soon a flood of evangelical Christians are searching the area for confirmation, and very quickly, the locals, being no dummies and seeing a tourism goldmine, start carving up even better footprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can hardly blame the Turks around Ararat. There's a lot of money being poured into the local economy from these numerous creationist expeditions. It only makes sense to salt a few sites with chunks of wood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/latest_ark_finding_is_a_fake.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/i8wcTIde_YM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272465780791"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/summer_reading_list.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bfe3cad518d4af1b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Books"/><title type="html">Summer Reading List</title><published>2010-04-28T15:43:18Z</published><updated>2010-04-28T15:43:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/F_93KFCDtN0/summer_reading_list.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/summer_reading_list.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Julia is going overseas for most of the summer, and she is putting together her reading list.  I'm sure she'll put together a fine list.  But we live in a culture in which we are compelled to suggest to high school students what they might want to read, especially in preparation for college. I've looked at a couple of those lists, and they are dismal. Some seem to be lists of works that are especially long, challenging of language, in many cases unpublishable in the modern market, out of date, and boring. I mean, really, Moby Dick?

&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:14pt;color:#990000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greece fears batter markets again&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Purdy, who sent this one in to Language Log Plaza, writes, "However hard I try to parse this correctly, I cannot suppress the mental  image of traders buying and selling the raw materials for Yorkshire pud  - and scaring the Greeks in the process."&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shares a strong family resemblance to previously noted &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/magazine/31FOB-onlanguage-t.html"&gt;crash blossoms&lt;/a&gt; (as unintentionally ambiguous headlines have come to be called). The errant &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_path_sentence"&gt;garden-path&lt;/a&gt; interpretation is set into motion by the second word, &lt;em&gt;fears&lt;/em&gt;, which can be construed as either a plural noun (as part of the noun-noun compound "Greece fears") or a third-person singular present-tense verb (with "Greece" as its subject). Taking the verb path then allows the next two words ("batter markets") to be read as a noun-noun compound (the object of "fears") rather than as a verb and its noun complement.&lt;/p&gt;

It's not one of those tabloids that publish anything in order to pander to the lowest common denominator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even a "respectable" newspaper can get taken in when it comes to religion. For some reason, the editors of this newspaper thought it was legitimate to publish a story on the latest announcement about the discovery of Noah's Ark [&lt;a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/801041--noah-s-ark-found-researchers-claim"&gt;Noah’s Ark found, researchers claim&lt;/a&gt;]. They picked up on a story in a Chinese newspaper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone with an IQ over 100 knows there was no such thing as a world-wide deluge in 2800 BCE and there's no such thing as a giant ark built by some shepherd in Israel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Science disproved that particular Biblical myth a long time ago. Whenever you see a story like this there are only two possibilities; either the "researchers" are making it up, or they were the victims of a hoax (or a bit of both). In this case, it seems to be mostly a hoax perpetrated on a gullible group who were only too willing to fall for it.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PZ Myers has the details: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/latest_ark_finding_is_a_fake.php?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+scienceblogs%2Fpharyngula+%28Pharyngula%29&amp;amp;utm_content=Google+Reader"&gt;Latest Ark finding is a fake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What about when a presumably respectable newspaper publishes something silly that flies in the face of everything we know about science and history? There's no excuse for that. Shame on &lt;i&gt;The Toronto Star&lt;/i&gt;. Maybe they should hire a science journalist to save them from future embarrassment?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/S9hE8nY72pI/AAAAAAAAKlo/laOXZgMZ-TM/s1600/tmp.jpg" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/S9hE8nY72pI/AAAAAAAAKlo/laOXZgMZ-TM/s400/tmp.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="274"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-6057696815392819820?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272462643994"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1893">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dcef3a485b2f9721</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><category term="vaccines"/><title type="html">The Vaccine Wars</title><published>2010-04-28T13:41:30Z</published><updated>2010-04-28T13:41:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1893" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last night Frontline aired a show called The Vaccine Wars. You can watch the &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/vaccines/view/"&gt;full episode online here&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, they did a good job of representing the current state of the science, and the anti-scientific nature of the anti-vaccine movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall theme of the piece was that anti-vaccine parents are irresponsible and go against the science. In fact, their view are immune to science, as they dismiss the evidence which contradicts their position, and constantly shift the goalposts when evidence goes against a link between vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The piece did cut some corners on details, but probably will only be noticed by someone steeped in the anti-vaccine movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the anti-vaccinationists have started their whining. To be fair, we complain when journalists do a terrible job of reporting science, which can be interpreted as taking an editorial position with which we disagree. But then it is our job to demonstrate that they got the science wrong. Handley and Gordon are just complaining that their point of view was not catered to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon is complaining on (of course) the &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/pbs-frontline-show-about_b_554691.html"&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; that his interview was not used. Welcome to the club. Any expert who makes themselves available to journalists will at time experience taking time to provide a great deal of information, or to give a long interview, and then have it end up completely on the edit room floor. Or, at times they will just use a quote or two, but miss your main points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not defending this – I think it mostly reflects the fact that journalists and producers write their story before they investigate, and then search for quotes to plug into their narrative. But at other times, a serious journalist will gather a great deal of information, and then decide what the story is, which means some points of view will be left out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is heartening to see that those of us who have been defending vaccines from their ideological and pseudoscientific opponents are getting mainstream media attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the show for yourself – it’s worth the hour.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272462307775"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.9509/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bc2f22b6808e0827</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Protected Reef Offers Model for Conservation</title><published>2010-04-28T14:43:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-28T14:43:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.9509/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;GLOVER'S REEF, Belize -- As Alex Tilley powers his 15-foot skiff over the turquoise surface, a dark form slips across the white sand floor below.

President Obama’s speech recently made it clear that Constellation’s days are numbered, and that he is urging NASA to look into a better heavy-lift vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone agrees, of course. Jeff Hanley — the manager of the Constellation Program — &lt;a href="http://www.physorg.com/news191474763.html"&gt;has apparently sent out an email&lt;/a&gt; that is an attempt to save at least part of the current system. I have not seen this email, but &lt;a href="http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-04/nasa-administrator-angles-save-ares-i-budget-axe"&gt;it’s alleged&lt;/a&gt; to try to use Obama’s idea of continuing with the Orion space capsule concept to save even more of Constellation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/nasa_orion-150x150.jpg" alt="nasa_orion" title="nasa_orion" width="150" height="150"&gt;Obama wants NASA to keep developing the Orion capsule as a lifeboat for the space station (and, I assume, a crew capsule for future deep space missions). Of course, to test such a capsule it has to be lofted to orbit. How do you do that? This is where Hanley’s email comes in: the best way to get Orion into space is aboard the Ares 1 rocket, the first such vehicle to be built under Constellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As schemes go, that’s pretty clever. Hanley is leveraging Ares — which will be canceled under Obama’s plan — using Orion. In other words, the Ares 1 rockets will have to continue to be developed and built if we are to get Orion up and running. That way, even if Constellation is canceled, at least part of it will live on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/11/nasa_ares-1.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Drawing of NASA&amp;#39;s Ares-1 rocket" title="Drawing of NASA&amp;#39;s Ares-1 rocket" width="128" height="72"&gt;It may be clever, but is it wise? I’m not sure. The Ares 1 has been tested once, and a lot of folks outside of NASA took a very dim view of it… &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/buzz-aldrin/why-we-need-better-rocket_b_351335.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Buzz Aldrin essentially called it a fraud&lt;/a&gt;, saying it was nothing more than a dog-and-pony show by NASA to make it look like progress was being made, when in reality it was a failure. That doesn’t make me hopeful that Ares 1 is what we want to throw our support behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been pretty clear on this: Constellation is basically a good idea, but is off to such a rocky start that it may be best to stop throwing money at it. NASA needs to do these things, in this order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Figure out what its Next Giant Leap is — asteroid rendezvous, Moon base, mission to Mars;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Figure out just what is needed to not only &lt;em&gt;accomplish&lt;/em&gt; this goal, but to &lt;strong&gt;sustain&lt;/strong&gt; it with an eye toward the next big goal;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Start cutting metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, as usual, is in Step 2. Sure, that first step (ironically) is sometimes fuzzy and vague, but &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/15/obama-lays-out-bold-and-visionary-revised-space-policy/"&gt;Obama laid out at least a place to start in his speech last month&lt;/a&gt; (even if I disagree &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; with him about the Moon). But politics, public relations, whatever — NASA always stumbles (with plenty of help from Congress) at that dreaded Step 2, drawing up plans that seem to over-reach and not be realistic in terms of budget, goals, and timelines. That’s why we have the Shuttle, the space station, and no future plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get the usual anti-Obama comments, remember that it was the Bush Administration that called for the retiring of the Shuttle before we had a working follow-up vehicle. So &lt;em&gt;no matter what&lt;/em&gt; we have to rely on other countries and private industry until we get that next-gen rocket. But what happens next is perhaps the most critical thing NASA has ever done since the Apollo program was first announced. Political maneuvering and white-elephant saving are the last thing NASA needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What NASA needs is a clear goal, a clear vision, and a clear way to make those happen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But it's a necessary step in science communication and publishing because clarity of expression is pretty darned crucial to getting your message across and avoiding misunderstandings. It's doubly important when the language of publication is not the native language of the authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shame, then, that even top journals do not employ copyeditors. Take the following sentence, that I found in an &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;EMBO&lt;/span&gt; J&lt;/em&gt; abstract earlier today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Abasic sites represent the most frequent &lt;span&gt;DNA &lt;/span&gt;lesions in the genome that have high mutagenic potential and lead to mutations commonly found in human cancers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell me, reading that, are abasic sites the most frequent &lt;span&gt;DNA &lt;/span&gt;lesions, or are they rather the most frequent lesions that have high mutagenic potential and/or lead to cancers? I had to go and look it up, because proper journalism involves getting your facts straight and if I get something wrong then the excrement truly hits the air circulation device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the same abstract, I also found this wonderfully tortuous construction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This amino acid templating mechanism was corroborated by switching to pyrimidine specificity because of mutation of the templating tyrosine into tryptophan. The tyrosine is located in motif B and highly conserved throughout evolution from bacteria to humans indicating a general amino acid templating mechanism for bypass of non-instructive lesions by &lt;span&gt;DNA &lt;/span&gt;polymerases at least from this sequence family.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know what you mean, but man, that's painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the authors' fault. Were I to write an article for a German language publication I would hope that a good German speaker would be editing my prose to check for precisely that kind of ambiguity. Which means that I'd expect a copyeditor to be on staff (or based in India), which in turn (because these people need to eat occasionally) means that either I have to pay to publish, or pay to read. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you know what? This is why science publication should never, ever be &lt;em&gt;kostenlos&lt;/em&gt;, no matter where you stand in the Open Access debate.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And just so that other journals don't feel left out:&lt;/p&gt;

Since you are only visiting, you might not be aware that nothing is open past, like, 10pm (not even coffee houses), but you get in your rental car and go driving around in search of your Chinese feast anyway. You try hitting up Panda Express, but no such luck. Of course they're closed. You try the neighborhood Chinese restaurant: closed as well. You get back in the car, and think to yourself "maybe the OTHER Panda Express will be open", but alas, it is not. You are ready to return to the hotel and just go to sleep when you think to yourself, "the MARKET is still open." And since you are a culinary genius, you know how to make a homemade version of Panda's orange chicken (I bet you want that recipe, don't you? Don't try looking it up online; you'll find some weak imitations, and I have tried them all). So you head to the market, collect your ingredients, and head back. It's late, but you're motivated enough to cook. Lucky for you, your hotel room has a kitchenette.

Now you're faced with a problem. When you set out on your orange chicken quest, you did not know where you would find those glazed pieces of chickeny goodness. You just drove around. Now you have to find your way back to the hotel, and without relying on GPS or Google Maps, or whatever. Since you're visiting, you don't know the streets at all. You do remember though that your hotel was near a really tall office building. Maybe you could try to find that building.

This is the problem facing many animals, every day. Today, we shall concern ourselves with the octopus.

There are those who just hate vaccines – because they don’t trust the system, they don’t like the idea of injecting something into their children, or they blame vaccines for their child’s illness or disorder. There is also the “mercury militia” – those who blame environmental mercury for all ills, and whose attention was drawn to vaccines through the mercury-based thimerosal connection. &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1838"&gt;I wrote recently&lt;/a&gt; about another group – radical environmentalists who see vaccines and just another environmental exposure the government is trying to cover up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another group that has been around for a while but about which I have not written before – some elements of the right-to-life group. What is their connection to vaccines? – the false belief that vaccines contain cells from aborted fetuses. Recently Lifenews published an article with the following headline: &lt;a href="http://lifenews.com/nat6272.html"&gt;Study Suggests Link Between Autism and Use of Cells From Abortions in Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. The study, of course, does nothing of the sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The EPA Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LifeNews editor, Steven Ertelt, was referring to a recent EPA study published in Environmental Science Technology called &lt;a href="http://www.all.org/pdf/McDonaldPaul2010.pdf"&gt;Timing of Increased Autistic Disorder Cumulative Incidence&lt;/a&gt;. If you read the paper you will find no mention of vaccines, let alone fetal cells in vaccines. The study simply looked at databases of autism diagnosis to see if there was a point at which the increasing cumulative diagnoses was most sharp – any turning points in the data. The point of this exercise is to suggest where to look for a potential environment factor contributing to autism – because that’s what the EPA does, look for environmental exposures that are causing human disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that in the California, Danish, and worldwide datasets the turning point happened around 1988-1989, while in the Japanese dataset the turning point was spread out more from 1988-1996. Therefore, they conclude, if we want to look for an environmental factor we should look for things whose exposure began around 1988-1989. That is the extent of their conclusion – nothing about vaccines or abortions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, their study did not even establish that the rising rates of autism are due to any environmental factor. In the discussion they give a nice summary of other documented contributors. These include diagnostic substitution, expanding the diagnostic criteria, younger age at diagnosis, influx of children with the diagnosis to areas with good services, and increased awareness and surveillance. No one of these factors can explain the entire increase, but it is possible that all of them together can, and it is certain that they explain at least part of the rise of autism diagnosis. A real increase cannot be ruled out, but is not necessary to explain the data – and this study does not change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Abortion Link&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ertelt demonstrates the ability of dedicated ideologues to transform a study beyond all recognition. He reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1988 date is significant because, as pro-life blogger Jill Stanek notes, the Sound Choice Pharmaceutical Institute indicates that’s when the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices added a second dose of the MMR vaccine, containing fetal cells from aborted babies, to its recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it – a second dose of MMR vaccine was added. Since the vaccine schedule was being expanded regularly over the last two decades, no matter what date the EPA study found as the turning point for increased diagnosis, a temporal link to some vaccine could have been found. So the fact that this roughly correlates with the addition of a second dose of MMR is meaningless. It is not evidence of a connection. At best this kind of data may suggest a potential link, that would then have to be confirmed by other means – but even that is extremely weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ertelt continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For years the evidence has pointed toward the link between vaccines using DNA from aborted babies and the rise of Autism Disorder rates,” he said. “Parents need and deserve to know the risks associated with vaccinations made from lines derived from the bodies of aborted children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the pharmaceutical industry ignores the evidence and continues to put our children at risk,” Sound Choice is conducting studies on the impact of residual human fetal DNA in vaccines on the brain development and autism in children, Sedlak continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute – the headline says (or at least strongly implies) that cells from aborted fetuses are in vaccines, but now they are talking about “lines derived from” cells from aborted fetuses. And then it sounds like they are not talking about cells at all, but just “residual human DNA.” So which is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some vaccines culture the attenuated virus in human diploid cell lines that were derived from aborted fetuses. There are currently two such human cell lines in use: the WI-38 line (Winstar Institute 38), with human diploid lung fibroblasts developed in 1964, and  MRC-5 first cultured in 1970.  So each cell line is over 40 years old. Further, the cells themselves are not part of the vaccine. Viruses are cultured in these cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that viruses are sloppy in their reproduction – they get their DNA mixed up with other viruses and host DNA. So it is likely that viruses cultured in a human cell line will come away with bits of DNA from that cell line – but so what? There is nothing special or different about this DNA. There is no theoretical reason why it should pose any health risk. This is simple scare-mongering using deception and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is the point – scaring the public with emotional appeals. A search on this topic reveals dozens of websites and article declaring that there is “aborted fetal tissue” in vaccines – a claim so remote from the tiny sliver of truth on which it is based that it is simply a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no issue with those who have a moral objection to anything that derives from abortions, if that is their moral position. I object to distorting the science in order to spread propaganda. If you have to lie to make your point, then your position is severely diminished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ertelt further reports&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanek also commented on the new developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always read it was mercury in vaccines that was implicated in autism, although many studies state this isn’t true,” she said, noted SCPI debunks the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting – so the pro-life antivaccinationists are at odds with the mercury militia antvaccinationists. They are willing, it seems, to look at the data to debunk the notion that mercury in vaccines is linked to autism, but then happily cite a potential connection to MMR without also noting that the same volume of data also has cleared the MMR vaccine of any connection with autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPA study is interesting in that it clarifies the timing of the increase in autism diagnoses. It says nothing about the cause of this increase, however, and does not contradict the generally accepted interpretation that artifacts of definition and surveillance are largely, if not completely, responsible for the increase. But ideologues have twisted this study as if it suggests a connection to vaccines, which were not even mentioned in the article and were not part of the research. But not only vaccines – those vaccines that were cultured in cell lines derived over 40 years ago from aborted fetuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, there is no reason to suspect, either theoretically or empirically, that there is any health risk from using these cell lines in the production of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has not stopped some pro-life antivaccinationists from misrepresenting this study and the background science for their own propaganda purposes. Accurate science should inform moral and ethical discussions, it should not be subverted to an ideological position. One might further consider it immoral to use misinformation to scaremonger about a public health measure, making the position of those pro-life antivaccinationists who engage in such activity even more tenuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I disagree with him. I think in fact it’s more likely that an aggressive alien race would create self-replicating robot probes that will disperse through the galaxy and destroy all life &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But &lt;em&gt;more likely&lt;/em&gt; still doesn’t equate to &lt;em&gt;likely&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve been thinking about this on and off for a few days, in fact, and I suspect a likely answer to Fermi’s Paradox — &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox"&gt;&amp;quot;Where are they?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; — is simply that intelligent life that is capable of interstellar flight doesn’t last long enough to colonize other stars. That would neatly explain why, if stars with planets are common (which we know is almost certainly true), and the conditions for life to arise are relatively common (again, that seems very likely), the galaxy isn’t overrun with life. It should be by now; it’s had billions of years to have space-faring races evolve and colonize the whole shebang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in reality, Hawking’s idea and the one I go over in my book are probably wrong. But I’m an optimist, and I can hope that the reason the galaxy isn’t softly humming with life (that’s Carl Sagan’s poetic phrase) is that we’re the first, or at least the first in a while. That would mean we still get our chance. It’s a big responsibility, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to be clear, that’s not snark, even if this post started out a bit snarky. I’m serious. We may be utterly, entirely alone in a galaxy filled with planets that outnumber people on our own planet 50 to 1. That idea gives me the creeps more than the idea of hostile aliens bent on sterilizing each of those planets. But at least it gives us a good chance to spread and see the place a bit. I’d like to think that in a hundred generations, this arm of the Milky Way will boast a thousand human planets. It’s a nice thought.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's a valid relationship between me and Richard Nixon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deborah Lockwood and her husband William Ward are my great&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; grandparents. Deborah was born in Watertown Massachusetts in 1636 [see &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/09/hanging-of-goodwife-knapp-in-1653.html"&gt;The Hanging of Goodwife Knapp in 1653&lt;/a&gt;]. William Ward was born in Fairfield Connecticut in 1631. Deborah's mother was Susanna Norman. There must be a million descendants of the Norman, Ward and Lockwood families.

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not stopping a Christian group from &lt;a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/culture/noahs-ark-found-claim-noahs-ark-ministries-international-2610954.html"&gt;saying otherwise&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now a group called Noah’s Ark Ministries International says they’ve found the ship’s wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not 100 per cent that it is Noah’s Ark, but we think it is 99.9 per cent that this is it,” researcher Yeung Wing-Cheung told Agence-France Presse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers and a film crew have apparently uncovered wooden beams and compartments they say housed the animals. &lt;strong&gt;Carbon dating has proven the structure to be 4,800 years old&lt;/strong&gt;, Yeung said, which gibes with the literal biblical timeline of the flood. He also says the group has ruled out a human settlement at the dig site.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon dating?  The same carbon dating that the same kinds of Christians reject when used in other scientific endeavors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is typical fundamentalist reasoning: It’s all bad, unless it makes you look good.  Tragedy is awful, but it just means God has a better plan for you.  And science is wrong, unless it proves a Biblical story true.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: Remember the  “Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer” (STEP) last year?  It found (among other things) that people who knew they were being prayed for &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/05/15/study-concludes-intercessory-prayer-doesnt-work-christians-twist-the-results/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;got worse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than other people.  Remember how &lt;em&gt;Christianity Today&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/may/27.43.html?start=2"&gt;spun that&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Ironically, STEP actually supports the Christian worldview. Our prayers are nothing at all like magical incantations. Our God bears no resemblance to a vending machine. &lt;strong&gt;The real scandal of the study is not that the prayed-for group did worse, but that the not-prayed-for group received just as much, if not more, of God’s blessings.&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, God seems to have granted favor without regard to either the quantity or even the quality of the prayers. By instinct, we might selfishly prefer that God give preferential treatment to those who are especially, deliberately, and correctly prayed for, but he seems to act otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True to his character, God appears inclined to heal and bless as many as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That… or the authors couldn’t handle the results, so they purposely misinterpreted the study.  You can take a wild guess what they would have been saying if the data showed statistically significant results in favor of prayer…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to Noah’s Ark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes them 99.9% (but not 100%) sure it’s the Ark?&lt;/strong&gt;  Is there some science behind that or a random number just being thrown out there?  I’m going to say the latter.  Don’t forget: 99.9% of bullshit is still bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what will happen when this claim — like every other Creationist claim — is thoroughly debunked?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing.  The supporters will just plug their ears, close their eyes, and pretend like it never happened.  They’ll crawl back into ignorance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any Christian publication or fundie leader supports this “discovery,” we need to be ready to call them out on it when this “Ark” is found to be something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be an interesting discovery?  Maybe.  But they have yet to show evidence that it’s actually Noah’s Ark.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I wasn’t sure why, and it was only today that I learned of the circumstances as to why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first met Jef Clark at the 2006 &lt;a href="http://www.keypoint.com.au/~skeptics/2006_Convention"&gt;Australian Skeptics National Convention in Melbourne, Victoria&lt;/a&gt;. We were at the same table for the dinner and I mentioned that I had seen his website and recognised his name when he introduced himself. We only talked briefly, but he remained in my mind as an example of an enthusiastic skeptic who was keen to use the internet to connect with people (something that was very much in its early stages in Australian skepticism, back then).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think he was surprised that I recognised his name from the online book ‘&lt;a href="http://huntinghumbug101.podbean.com/the-ebook/"&gt;Humbug&lt;/a&gt;‘, which was one of the few ‘hits’ that I found when searching for what resources skeptics had online. Back then, Richard Saunders hadn’t started the Skeptic Zone podcast – it was only a year later that the TANK vodcast began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t recall meeting Jef after that time, but his son Theo presented at ‘Briskepticon’, or the Australian Skeptics National Convention in 2009 (as you might have guessed, it was held this time in Brisbane, Queensland). By this time, the Hunting Humbug podcast was well into development, and Theo reflected his father’s enthusiasm by demonstrating the use of Google Wave and Twitter in his talk about fallacies – &lt;a href="http://www.skepticsfieldguide.net/2009/11/bah-thats-humbug-live-from-briskepticon.html"&gt;there is an archive of that presentation featured on his site.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jef was probably best known amongst fellow online skeptics as the co-host of “Hunting Humbug 101″, a podcast that provides a crash course in shooting down bad arguments, looking at fallacies from pseudoscience, science misconceptions, politics, philosophy and the media. After a second battle with cancer, he died earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I regret that I did not get to know more about him nor recall meeting him after the Melbourne convention, but Jef Clark certainly contributed a significant body of material to Australian skepticism. &lt;a href="http://huntinghumbug101.podbean.com/2010/04/19/episode-35-the-best-of-jef/"&gt;Episode 35 – The Best of Jef is available on the Humbug site&lt;/a&gt;; it contains a link to all the back-issues of the Australian Skeptic magazine where he contributed articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mathematical proofs, it’s a well-known fact that if at some point you divide by zero accidentally or on purpose, then you end up being able to prove absolutely anything you want – for instance, that 2+2=5 or that 1+1=0. The same phenomena appears to govern any number of publications that conclude that climate science is all a fraud – at some point, an impossible calculation is performed and from then on, anything (and everything) can be proven. Critical thinking appears to vanish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest example is that of Claude Allègre – whose recent book “The climate imposture” would have you believe at least six impossible things before breakfast and a great many more before dinner. This is notable because Allègre is one of the most eminent figures in science communication in France, Academie de Sciences member, Crafoord prize winner, former minister of education and research and a fixture on the late night talk shows in France (including a topical satirical version of the ‘muppets’). One might expect a certain degree of rigour from an author with such a pedigree, but on the contrary, nearly every explanation, graphic, or citation in this book is misleading or just plain wrong. If Allègre was not such a high profile figure in France, this nonsense would have been dismissed and ignored, instead, it is regular fodder for the &lt;a href="http://tv.lepost.fr/2010/03/11/1981958_clash-claude-allegre-vs-valerie-masson-delmotte-climatologue.html"&gt;late night talk shows&lt;/a&gt;. In my entire career I have never seen so many factual errors in a single publication. It is truly a remarkable work!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is practically impossible to give a complete overview of what is wrong with the Allègre’s book. However, some people have made a good start: Stephane Foucart, a science journalist at Le Monde, wrote a piece on &lt;a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2010/02/27/le-cent-fautes-de-claude-allegre_1312167_3244.html"&gt;Le cent-fautes de Claude Allegre&lt;/a&gt; (the ‘Hundred Errors’ – this is a play on words, ‘un sans-faute’ (pronounced the same way) means a perfect score) and Sylvestre Huet from the Liberation started a &lt;a href="http://sciences.blogs.liberation.fr/home/2010/02/claude-all%C3%A8gre-premier-debuggage-de-limposture.html"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://sciences.blogs.liberation.fr/home/2010/02/all%C3%A8gre-d%C3%A9buggage-2-le-sergent-recruteur.html"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://sciences.blogs.liberation.fr/home/2010/02/all%C3%A8gre-d%C3%A9buggage-3-le-graphique-faux.html"&gt;debunkings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://sciences.blogs.liberation.fr/home/2010/03/all%C3%A8gre-debuggage-4-limposteur-du-climat.html"&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; is now at &lt;a href="http://sciences.blogs.liberation.fr/home/2010/03/all%C3%A8gre-debuggage-5.html"&gt;part five&lt;/a&gt; (also in French) and which he has turned into a short book! I started my own list of errors &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.de/primaklima/2010/02/herzlich-lachen-mit-claude-allegre-teil-i.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (in German). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more egregious examples of blatant making stuff up was covered by Science last week (following on from a &lt;a href="http://sciences.blogs.liberation.fr/home/2010/03/claude-all%C3%A8gre-accus%C3%A9-de-falsification-par-h%C3%A5kan-grudd.html"&gt;post by Huet&lt;/a&gt; who revealed that Allègre had hand-drawn a continuation of tree-ring data from Hakan Grudd to show cooling over the 21st Century – something of course that no trees could possibly show (at least yet!). Even before Allegre “improved” the data by drawing in an extension more to his liking, the implication that Grudd’s work in any way challenges the prevailing view of unusual large scale warming in recent years was highly misleading.  Grudd’s paper (available &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/8j71453650116753/?p=d8fa8cb6551244a1baa8341234f6aafa&amp;amp;pi=1"&gt;here, open access&lt;/a&gt;) deals solely with summer temperatures at Lake Tornetrask in Northern Sweden, and the paper states clearly that “although the climate of northern Fennoscandia seems to have been significantly warmer during medieval times as compared to the late-twentieth century, the published composite records of northern hemisphere climate (Moberg et al. 2005) do not show a conspicuously warm period around AD 1000.” Once again, Allègre has shown himself willing to jump on any curve “going my way,” regardless of its relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But much of the joy of reading this book is in details – things that it would be trivial to get right without having much impact on the general thesis being put forward, but instead reveal without doubt that the author does not have a single clue about the subject. So let’s start (all translations are mine and reasonably accurate):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The first thing one might notice is that almost every non-french scientist has their name spelled wrong:  Solansky for Sami Solanki; Usoskiev for Ilya Usoskin and Funkel for Richard Finkel. The most amusing case is during the discussion of tropical cyclones with climate change, where he lists three names of people who have posited a connection: “Wester, Tech and Kerry Emmanuel”. Everyone of course recognizes Kerry Emanuel (despite the incorrect spelling), and “Wester” is (also misspelled) Peter Webster (of &lt;a href="http://webster.eas.gatech.edu/static/Papers/Webster2006a.pdf"&gt;Webster et al, 2006&lt;/a&gt;). But who was this eminent Hurricane expert Tech? I had no idea until Stephane Foucart lifted the veil. Peter Webster is from the Georgia Institute of Technology, frequently abbreviated to simply “Georgia Tech”. So in his “extensive literature studies” Allègre probably found a line like “Peter Webster, Georgia Tech, thinks that …” and voila! Professor Tech was born!
&lt;li&gt;
On page 53, in a typical example of his style, Allegre writes that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
”Jones declares that the global mean temperature raised by 0.6% [sic]. …. How can he claim such a precision with such sampling errors? Nevertheless, Hansen-the-fanatic, without revealing his sources, immediately approves of Jones curve. Those who made statistics based on such shortcomings in sampling are discredited as scientists”.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. We’re pretty sure that most people measure temperature deviations in degrees, so maybe the ‘%’ was just a simple typo.  The characterisation of Hansen is presumably hyperbole (though see below for worse treatment), but given that all of the sources of the GISTEMP temperature record (which was first published in 1987) are &lt;a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt; (along with all the source code, and completely &lt;a href="http://www.clearclimatecode.com"&gt;independent replication&lt;/a&gt;), the ‘without revealing his sources’ line is a little rich (especially given Allègre’s undocumented ‘extrapolation’  (cough) of the Grudd data series mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
On page 300, the greenhouse effect is explained, but for some reason CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not considered to be a ‘real’ greenhouse gas. He says explicitly there are three such gases, water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane (This is a pretty large simplification since it neglects ozone, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, any number of CFCs, and theoretically pretty much any gas with a structure that has three or more atoms). He continues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
”It is due to water vapour, and water vapour alone, that the mean temperature at the Earth surface is +15°C and not -18°C”.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This again is plain wrong. Depending a bit how you weight the overlapping spectral absorptions of the different greenhouse gases the contribution of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the total greenhouse effect is about 20% (with water vapour giving 50% and 25% for clouds, which we are sure that Allègre realises are made of condensate (liquid water and ice) and not vapour…). And indeed, since water vapour in particular is a feedback to the temperatures, removal of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will certainly lead to cooling and a subsequent reduction in water vapour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.scienceblogs.de/primaklima/Photo%2050.jpg" width="90%"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, Allègre is of course very sceptical about the use of computer models, and thinks they are taking up all the money available for research (an error that would be easily corrected by looking at NASA’s budget for instance) and so his preference for ‘true’ observations is clear. Take the last interglacial period for instance (also known as the Eemian), around 125,000 years ago. He compares (see figure above) something called the “Gore curve” with something called the “true curve” (la courbe veritable). Al Gore actually shows the temperature and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution from &lt;a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/icecore/antarctica/domec/domec_epica_data.html"&gt;Epica Dome C&lt;/a&gt; for the last 600.000 years. So let’s assume that this is in fact what Allègre means. Amusingly, &lt;a href="http://www.2012matters.co.uk/images/Gore%20with%20CO2%20temp%20graph.jpg"&gt;this image&lt;/a&gt; from the movie shows that Allègre’s hand drawn version of the bottom curve (the reconstructed temperature in East Antarctica) is profoundly different (in the relative warmth at the Eemian, and the number of cycles), but let’s move on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipping past the inconsistency in the text where he says that until now the best estimate for the last interglacial temperature in Antarctica was +3°C (compared to present) while his “Gore curve” has a zero anomaly compared to today, let’s look at the justification for the new ‘true’ estimate of +6°C warmer. This is referenced to a paper by Sine et al, 2007 in Science (note that every piece of that reference is wrong: as usual, the name is misspelled (it’s Louise Sime, not Sine), the year was 2009 and the publication was in Nature – easy mistakes, I guess).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice core temperature reconstructions such as Dome C are based on the isotopic composition of the ice. This isotope signal needs careful calibration and &lt;a href="http://researchpages.net/media/resources/2009/12/11/SIME_nature08564.pdf"&gt;Louise Sime and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; make the point that under warm climate conditions such as the Eemian the calibration developed for cold climate conditions might be different – in fact isotopes during warm periods might be less sensitive to temperature, and so applying the cold-climate calibration might underestimate actual temperatures. However, their results would therefore only concern the time period at the peak of the ultimate interglacial, and does not have any implications for the cold climate values. Note however, that Allègre’s ‘one true curve’ seems to have had a warm trend imposed from 125,000 years ago to the present. I contacted Louise Sime and asked if she thought this was a good use of her paper. She made it clear that she’d not had any exchange with Claude Allègre and that her paper does not discuss the temperature reconstruction over the entire glacial-interglacial period at all (&lt;a href="http://sciences.blogs.liberation.fr/home/2010/03/louise-sime-proteste-contre-lincorrect-claude-all%C3%A8gre-.html%22"&gt;that would be a ‘no’&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Allègre presents a ‘true curve’ which is hand-drawn, in which an Antarctic temperature record is described as a global mean, on which he imposes a long term trend which is credited to Sime and colleagues who completely disown it. And the irony of ironies? Sime’s results are based on a climate model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The phase relation between CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and temperatures in the Antarctic ice cores is a frequent source of confusion, and Allègre doesn’t attempt to miss this opportunity to confuse further. As is well known, both temperature and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are correlated to the Milankovitch cycles in complex ways – with both climate acting on the carbon cycle and with the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; level changing climate through it’s role as a greenhouse gas. The changes over time have been described as a “chicken and egg” situation in which changes in one component affect the other – however the first one was changed initially (&lt;a href="http://www.atmos.washington.edu/2006Q2/211/articles_required/Lorius90_ice-core.pdf"&gt;Lorius et al, 1990&lt;/a&gt;). Thus the leads and lags involved doesn’t have any impact on climate sensitivity calculations, but it is important for understanding carbon cycle feedbacks which might affect future concentrations of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Allègre makes the standard (and illogical) contrarian argument that if eggs follow chickens then chickens cannot follow eggs, and highlights the paper by Caillon et al, 2003 that constrained the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lag to about 800 years (though with large uncertainties) based on work from his PhD. According to Allègre, Caillon was then ‘punished’ by his institute (which is mine too) for publishing this paper. So I called Nicolas to ask about this ‘punishment’. Once he stopped laughing, he pointed out that he is doing exactly what he wants to be doing (developing measuring technologies) and is very happy with &lt;a href="http://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/Pisp/21/nicolas.caillon.html"&gt;his permanent (tenured) position&lt;/a&gt; at CNRS. I’m sure more people would love to be punished like that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
It is a very common technique in debating to try and suggest that your argument is correct by claiming that more and more important people are agreeing with it. Allègre makes &lt;a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2010/02/27/la-liste-imaginaire-des-cautions-scientifiques-enrolees-par-l-ancien-ministre_1312168_3244.html#ens_id=1275244"&gt;frequent use&lt;/a&gt; of this tactic, but &lt;a href="http://sciences.blogs.liberation.fr/home/2010/02/all%C3%A8gre-d%C3%A9buggage-2-le-sergent-recruteur.html"&gt;Sylvestre Huet&lt;/a&gt; made the effort to call some of these alleged “heretics” and “insurgents” and found that they didn’t agreed with Allègre’s position at all. Allègre additionally claims (p138) that there is even numerical proof for this reversal in the opinion among “american specialists of climate”. However, the source for this claim was a 2009 survey among American TV weather presenters. In a further effort to round up some support, he cites Bill Ruddiman’s hypothesis that human land use change was an important climate forcing over the last few thousand years. But Ruddiman’s theory works via the influence of prehistoric man on the global methane and carbon cycle and needs their greenhouse effects to work! [RC note: Allègre isn&amp;#39;t the only contrarian to have mistakenly dragooned Ruddiman to their cause - see &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/02/strange-bedfellows/"&gt;this earlier example&lt;/a&gt;!]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the book is as full with conspiracy theories and insults against climate scientists  as any blog you might find on the wilder shores of the internet. However I have never seen something as bad as this from someone who is a leading member of a National Academy of Science. Lindzen (a member of US National Academy) writes articles that are a model of scientific decorum in comparison! In describing the history of the different IPCC reports Allègre introduces the different participants as “religious fanatics”, “Marxists” in search for new arguments to destroy the civil society, “greedy” and “mediocre scientists” (all literal expressions from the manuscript). The list of accusations against Jim Hansen for example is nearly unbelievable. Among other things Allègre makes the astonishing claim that during the last 15 years Hansen has done no scientific work and that he has forced his collaborators to put his name on the publications. Over that period, Hansen has listed 68 publications with 37 as first author – thus the scale of his perfidy would need to have been immense! I asked Gavin whether GISS is really the slave camp implied, and he just laughed. Hansen presumably can’t be bothered to deal with this kind of accusation, but Allègre’s claim is almost certainly libelous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truly astonishing thing though is how hermetically sealed and impervious to fact Allègre’s  whole argument is. No-one is honest, every result is fraudulent (excepting of course, Allègre’s ‘true curves’), no-one is without an agenda (except Allègre of course, and possibly Michael Crichton) and any scientist espousing the mainstream view or journalist questioning him is &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.de/primaklima/2010/03/last-exit-stalinismus.php"&gt;a Stalinist&lt;/a&gt;. Any contradiction of his arguments is simply proof that you are part of the conspiracy. It is this error that is the equivalent of ‘dividing by zero’ – once you have convinced yourself that only your own opinion matters, you can prove absolutely anything to your own satisfaction – but, unfortunately, to no-one else’s.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>group</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272438292157"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/the_vaccine_war_a_review.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/62bde1dd81282801</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">The Vaccine War: Telling it (mostly) like it is about the anti-vaccine movement</title><published>2010-04-28T08:00:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-28T08:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/x4eKyD72BWI/the_vaccine_war_a_review.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/the_vaccine_war_a_review.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/the_vaccine_war.php"&gt;expressed concern&lt;/a&gt; about a FRONTLINE episode that was scheduled to air tonight entitled &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/vaccines/"&gt;The Vaccine War&lt;/a&gt; (which, by the time you read this, should be available for online viewing in case you missed it). My concern was that there was going to be a heapin' helpin' of false balance, based on the promotional materials. My concerns were later somewhat assuaged based on the pre-airing reaction of the anti-vaccine movement, which was fairly wary, if not hostile even. Of course, any television show that doesn't conclude that their view that vaccines cause autism is at plausible or even likely is virtually guaranteed to have an infiltration of anti-vaccine loons in the comments attacking relentlessly, but I was heartened to see a &lt;a href="http://watching-tv.ew.com/2010/04/27/frontline-vaccine-war-jenny-mccarthy/"&gt;review like this&lt;/a&gt; proclaiming the documentary to be very much science-based and intolerant of the misinformation, pseudoscience, quackery, and lies of the anti-vaccine movement. I could only hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another indication that &lt;em&gt;The Vaccine War&lt;/em&gt; might be OK from a science-based perspective was that the antivaccine crank blog Age of Autism (AoA) preemptively set up a post in which the merry band of antivaccinationists proclaimed that they &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/04/join-age-of-autism-live-blogging-tweeting-during-the-vaccine-war-on-frontline.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;would be live blogging and live Tweeting&lt;/a&gt; the special. Conveniently enough, they included links to the &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/ombudsman/feedback.html"&gt;PBS Ombudsman&lt;/a&gt;, links to &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/frontline/vaccines"&gt;FRONTLINE&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/frontlinepbs"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;, and its &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/frontlinepbs"&gt;Twitter stream&lt;/a&gt;, presumably to facilitate said influx of anti-vaccine loons to those locations to protest most piteously being mistreated by a television show pointing out that there is no evidence that vaccines cause autism and, even worse, pointing out that anti-vaccinationists are endangering children. Then there's a &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/04/age-of-autism-the-vaccine-wars.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;convenient post full of links to AoA misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, cherry picking, and distortions, presumably to provide said anti-vaccine loons with links to use when they protest most piteously their treatment on FRONTLINE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to wait until the show aired, watch it, and report back to you, my readers, in the meantime savoring a couple of characteristic reactions, first from the grand macher of the anti-vaccine movement, reclaiming his place now that Jim Carrey has apparently dumped Generation Rescue's spokescelebrity Jenny McCarthy, &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/04/join-age-of-autism-live-blogging-tweeting-during-the-vaccine-war-on-frontline.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e20134802e5ebb970c#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e20134802e5ebb970c" rel="nofollow"&gt;your bud and mine J.B. Handley&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I personally spent 2 hours with Jon Palferman and Kate McMahaon, the producers of the piece. The whole point of my meeting was to explain that this was not Parents vs. The Science and that our community takes its cues from doctors and scientists. I encouraged them to interview Jon Poling, Bernadine Healy, Boyd Haley, and many others.

&lt;p&gt;When Jenny was interviewed, Jay Gordon sat next to her the entire time and was also part of her interview - let's see if they show him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told Frontline, "Get all the people from the other side you want, just be fair in telling the totality of our story, and don't turn this into a Parents vs. the science" like the NY Times did."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My response back from Kate McMahon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"FRONTLINE will carry out a detailed and even-handed investigation including voices from all sides of the controversy including parents, activists, physicians, scientists, lawyers, politicians and vaccine manufacturers. We will examine the evidence relating to an association between increases in the prevalence of autism and hypothesized causes such as MMR vaccine, thimerosol and other toxins associated with vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's hoping they live up to what they said they would do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's hoping they don't, I thought. But clearly J.B. wasn't too happy, which gave me hope that The Vaccine War would be science-based. Then I saw these Tweets from everybody's favorite pediatrician to the stars, apologist for the anti-vaccine movement, and pediatrician to Jenny McCarthy's son Evan &lt;a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/JayGordonMDFAAP/status/12931241205"&gt;PBS show about vaccines. Don't bother to watch it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/JayGordonMDFAAP/status/12949601551"&gt;A number of scary articles in newspapers today to augment PBS' scary vaccine show tonight. They interviewed me for 2 hrs and cut it all.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gee, sounds like sour grapes, doesn't it? It's also interesting that Jenny McCarthy had Dr. Gordon sitting next to her the whole interview, probably because she's so prone to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/jenny_mccarthy_shows_off_her_knowledge_o.php"&gt;saying incredibly stupid things&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, Dr. Jay is also fairly prone to saying &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/mobile_phone_companies_tobacco_companies.php"&gt;pretty stupid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/dr_jay_gordon_pediatrician_to_the_stars.php"&gt;things&lt;/a&gt;, too; so I don't know if he's much of a safeguard to the message. I guess we won't get to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did the show turn out? Here follows my impressions and semi-live blogging. Feel free to watch the show (embedded at the top of this post) and check it out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

If you remember, McMillen’s high school was run by hatemongers who could not tolerate a lesbian attending the  prom with her girlfriend and dressed in a tuxedo, so they tried to exclude her. When the ACLU told them they couldn’t do that, they officially canceled the prom altogether. At least, that’s what they wanted us to think. Another prom was secretly organized that included everyone except McMillen and some other unpopular kids. This led to confusion as to who the adults really were in that school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well now yet another lesbian  student, Ceara Sturgis, &lt;a href="http://www.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2010/04/27/mississippi-goddamn-high-school-erases-lesbian-student-from-yearbook"&gt;had her photo expunged from her high school  yearbook&lt;/a&gt; because she was dressed in a tuxedo like a man. I guess there’s nothing Mississippi hates more than androgyny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not all. Guess who’s coming to Constance McMillan’s graduation. If you guessed the Westboro Baptist Church planning to protest Constance, &lt;a href="http://blogout.justout.com/?p=16984"&gt;you’re absolutely correct&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the children running Itawamba Agricultural High School better not complain about it either. As far as I’m concerned, the children running Itawamba Agricultural High School have no right to object to the Westboro Baptist Church. As bad as the WBC is, at least they’re honest. They never set up an elaborate ruse in order to break the spirits of a young girl. That’s beneath them.&lt;/p&gt;

Every time she does this, she is of course completely overwhelmed by the piles of cool and bloggable science out there (seriously, I've got like 20 topics for the next week, of course not all will make it).  But she's also surprised to see some familiar faces.  A lot of times it's a familiar face related to her field and the stuff she's been recently interested in (for example, Yavin Shaham just wrote an interesting editorial on binge eating and food addiction in Nature Neuroscience which Sci might have to blog), but everyone once in a while it's something like this:

OMG!  Sci knows that guy!!

So of course Sci had to go and ask if I could blog it.  And of course the gracious Zen said yes!

And first of all, I would like to introduce you to today's three species:

Louisiana red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii)

(Handsome little devil, no?)

White shrimp (Litopenaeus setiferus)

(OM NOM NOM)

And the grass shrimp (Palaemonetes sp.)

(By far the coolest because they are see through).

And now, let's talk about nocioception. Read the rest of this post... | Read the comments on this post......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least this first story can't be blamed on Mississippi. &lt;a href="http://blogout.justout.com/?p=16984"&gt;Fred Phelps is planning to picket Constance McMillen's graduation&lt;/a&gt;. This will be &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; interesting … how will the town and her fellow students respond? Will they be cheering the Phelpsians on, or will they finally get a good look in the mirror?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residents of the state can be blamed for this one: another &lt;a href="http://www.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2010/04/27/mississippi-goddamn-high-school-erases-lesbian-student-from-yearbook"&gt;lesbian student, Ceara Sturgis, had her photo expunged from her high school yearbook&lt;/a&gt;.

For example some people go green, because  it directly improves your health, others because they feel an  inter-generational obligation to conserve the environment, again others  buy green products for reasons of social justice. (BTW:  I&amp;#39;m really excited about this fully compostable  alternative to plastic plates..!)

Now a research report in the  journal of personality and social psychology suggests that another big  motivating factor in going green might be a less noble -yet equally  effective- desire to improve one&amp;#39;s social status. In other words: People  are going green to be seen! Here&amp;#39;s what the study found:In a  first experiment more than a hundred students were randomly assigned to  either a status seeking, or a neutral control condition. Participants in  the status seeking condition were asked to read a short essay (which in  previous experiments had been shown to successfully elicit status  motives). Participants in the neutral condition...you get the idea...

After  completing the status priming, participants were lead to what they were  told was a different experiment, and then given different hypothetical  purchasing options for different products; cars, soaps, and dishwashers.  For each of the product tpes the participants were shown either a  &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; version or a conventional version, and&amp;quot;for  each choice, the two products were equal in price, were manufactured by  the same company, and were accompanied by three features that described  key aspects of each product. Importantly, the non-green product was  superior on dimensions of luxury and performance, whereas the green  product was superior on the pro environmental dimension.&amp;quot;The  graph below shows the percentage of people who chose the green product  in both of the priming conditions. Although it clearly depicts the  influence that status concerns had on pro-green choice behavior in the  experiment, this result is not yet the full story.The  - in my opinion - more interesting part of the story occurred when the  researchers repeated the above experiment, but introduced a slight twist  in how they asked people to report on their preferences for the  different products. In this second, modified design, one group of  participants was asked to reveal their preferences according to  instructions that read &amp;quot;Imagine that you are out  shopping at a store.&amp;quot;while the other half read  instructions that ordered them to&amp;quot;Imagine that you  are shopping online by yourself at home.&amp;quot;As shown in  the next graph, people&amp;#39;s status concerns no longer increased  preferences for the green product when this choice was imagined to be a  private choice made in the anonymity of the internet. Apparently &amp;quot;going  green to be seen&amp;quot; only does the trick, when you can actually expect to  be seen...Similarly, the researchers  found that the relative price of the products played a significant role  in determining whether status motives influence green preferences:  Without status priming, participants did as well-behaved rational economic actors do and liked the green  products more when they were cheaper, and less when they were more  expensive. However - and not too surprising at this point - , when  status concerns were primed, green products were more attractive to  participants precisely when they were described as being more expensive  than their conventional counterparts.Besides showing off a cool  study design for investigating a very relevant topic the study might  even lend itself for some practical advice:In the authors own words:&amp;quot;Whereas  status motives have traditionally been associated with selfishness, our  framework suggests that activating status motives may be an effective  strategy for promoting proenvironmental or other types of prosocial  behavior. Indeed, while economic or environmental concerns can certainly  foster green behavior, the social aspects of conservation are often  ignored. Yet we find that social motives such as concern for status can  be significant in fostering green behavior.&amp;quot;For  marketers, this might even suggest that linking green products to status  (e.g., celebrity endorsers, prestigious events), could prove profitable&amp;quot;  especially when a green product is relatively expensive&amp;quot;Whatever works to save the planet, I&amp;#39;d say...

In some cases, a few mutations can take a protein to a novel fold, as with Philip Bryan&amp;#39;s protein G work. In others, closely related sequences within a whole family populate different kinds of folds, as Matt Cordes illustrated for the case of Cro proteins. In addition, there are some cases such as lymphotactin, where interconversion between two very different structures takes place at equilibrium, as illustrated by Brian Volkman&amp;#39;s research. Each time stories like this come up I have mentioned that this kind of behavior (termed &amp;quot;metamorphism&amp;quot; in a 2008 commentary by Alexey Murzin) suggests a means by which proteins could evolve from one structure to another without losing foldedness or function. Recently, a group from the Weizmann Institute published results in PNAS that speak to this possibility.

Yadid et al. are looking at a class of proteins called β-propellers. Characteristics of the sequences of these proteins, especially high homology between different blades within a protein, suggest that these proteins are &amp;quot;built up&amp;quot; by gene duplication and fusion from precursors that were either multimeric in nature or made from a smaller number of blades (or both). In particular, they worked with a protein called tachylectin-2, that binds sugars. You can see its structure at right (or examine it at the PDB). The color-coding recognizes that the N and C termini are adjacent to one another, meaning that each &amp;quot;blade&amp;quot; of the propeller actually incorporates one strand from a neighbor. The whole protein is a bit under 250 residues in size. Previously, the authors of this paper had randomly chewed up the tachylectin-2 DNA from either end, a process that one might expect would produce a bunch of useless garbage. Some of the products of this experiment, however, were functional pentamers. But, they were about 100 amino acids long, suggesting that each monomer incorporated two blades. This meant that the structure of the pentamers had to differ from that of the original protein in some key way, but the proteins could not be crystallized due to low yields and instability.

To solve this problem, Yadid et al. performed directed-evolution refinement of the sequences of two promising candidates. From the pool of proteins thus produced they were able to crystallize two, which had interesting properties. As one might expect given the known data, both these proteins formed ten-bladed propellers (the structures have PDB codes 3KIF and 3KIH) in the form of two five-bladed propellers that were linked to each other. In the case of the mutant called Lib2-D2-15, 3 of the 100-residue subunits contributed two blades to the propeller apiece, while the remaining two monomers each contributed to three blades. That doesn&amp;#39;t add up to 10 because each of the two oddballs contributed four strands to one blade, three strands to another, and one strand to the third. That means one blade was uniquely of that monomer and the other two were shared. One of these blades was shoved into the second propeller, generating an asymmetric pentamer. Note also that the two oddballs weren&amp;#39;t equivalent: one was arranged 4-3-1 and the other 3-1-4. The other mutant, Lib1-B7-18, was even weirder in some ways. In that mutant, four of the monomers contributed to three blades in a 1-3-4 manner. The last monomer, however, contributed to four blades, two from each propeller, with a pattern of 1-3-1-3. Because these structures cannot form unless the monomers adopt multiple structures (3 in the case of Lib2-D2-15 and 2 in the case of Lib1-B7-18), it follows that the monomers must be metamorphic.

The evolved fragments didn&amp;#39;t have higher stability to guanidinium hydrochloride than the source fragments, suggesting that the improved expression and solubility was not due to improved stability. The authors argue that the improved expression was mostly due to a change in the isoelectric point of the mutants, which decreased towards neutral in both cases. However, the evolved fragments also were able to refold from the denatured state, which the source fragments could not do. To the authors, this suggests that the directed evolution process actually selected for metamorphism; that is, the proteins were stabilized by an increased ability to sample states that formed productive pentamers.

The observations in this study, although very interesting, do not tell us anything directly about the evolution of tachylectin-2. While it is possible that the current protein evolved from a metamorphic precursor like these fragments, there is no direct evidence that this is the case, nothing to indicate that evolution performed in reverse what Yadid et al. did here. Whether metamorphism contributed to the diversity of β-propeller folds in general, or to the evolution of this protein in particular, remains very much an open question. The metamorphism observed here may be more a consequence of a particularly robust fold tending towards its original state than evidence of hidden metamorphic potential in singular structures. As such, the article&amp;#39;s title strikes me as overbold given the data. That said, it is certainly not implausible that odd assemblies like these pentamers played a role somewhere along the evolutionary path that created the rich library of β-propellers we have today, and this study establishes that even very strange steps along the way can occur without destroying the protein&amp;#39;s function or certain gross features of its structure.

Amongst these scientists is Joao de Magalhaes, who runs the excellent senescence.info websites, including the GenAge and AnAge databases. You should certainly browse through the materials there if you haven't already done so. You might recall that de Magalhaes was also amongst those attempting to raise funds for genetic sequencing of long-lived mammals - again with the aim of learning more about the roots of longevity by way of comparison between species with very different life spans. There is a good set of data showing a strong correlation between mammalian life span and the composition of mitochondrial DNA - implying that the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging in fact describes the dominant process of degenerative aging in mammals. This fits in with the clear importance of autophagy, as autophagy is the process by which damaged mitochondria are recycled before they can cause more harm to a cell and the surrounding tissue. Here, however, let me......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Listen to the podcast and &lt;a href="http://www.world-science.org/forum/urban-raptors-hawk-eagle-falcon-peregrine-vulture-david-bird/" title=""&gt;join the discussion in the forums&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Listen to an interview about city-dwelling raptors. Download MP3

&lt;p&gt;David Bird is a wildlife biologist at McGill University in Montreal. He directs the university's Avian Science and Conservation Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bird is editor of the the new book Birds of Canada.  He also wrote The Bird Almanac: A Guide to Essential Facts and Figures of the World's Birds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our radio program, we aired a story about how raptors -- birds of prey -- are struggling to survive in Beijing.  You can listen to that story here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Beijing, some cities are providing good habitat for raptors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * Peregrine falcons now nest in churches and skyscrapers in North American and European cities.&lt;br&gt;
    * Goshawks are a common sight in Hamburg, Germany.&lt;br&gt;
    * Sparrowhawks are found in abundance in Nairobi, Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn about the thrills and perils of city life for raptors, and bring your own thoughts and questions to David Bird.  He's our guest in the Forum through Friday, May 7th. The conversation is just to the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * How can you make your community more raptor-friendly?&lt;br&gt;
    * Do you live next door to a bird of prey? Tell us about your experiences.&lt;br&gt;
    * Have you been involved with conserving raptors in your city or neighborhood?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natalie Wolchover, an aspiring science writer, has started a fun blog called &lt;a href="http://www.factodiem.com/"&gt;Facto Diem&lt;/a&gt;.  For those of you who didn’t attend Catholic school, that’s Latin for “Fact of the Day.”  (Or a close enough facsimile.)  I didn’t even know there were that many facts in the world!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the more venerable sections of the blogosphere, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2010/04/laser_smackdown_vote_for_the_m.php"&gt;Chad Orzel is running a poll&lt;/a&gt; concerning the most amazing application of lasers.  Considering that “death ray” is not among the options, it’s a pretty good list. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should also link to &lt;a href="http://melliferax.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/scientia-pro-publica-27/"&gt;Scientia Pro Publica #27&lt;/a&gt;, over at Melliferax.  (Clearly Latin is the lingua franca of the science blogosphere.)  Most of the posts involve living things in some way or another, but they should nevertheless be of interest to those of us with more inorganic inclinations.&lt;/li&gt;

It's annoying that so many people don't know how to do it right.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After mentioning the author, title, and publisher, offer some kind of general statement about the book as a whole. Was it a really good book, an average one, trash, or something else? You could also compare and contrast the book with other similar books. Was it better or worse than these other books? You might even want to mention why you read the book in the first place. Why did you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Somewhere in your review you should tell the reader on what level you think the book is geared to. Is it geared for the professional scientist, philosopher or Biblical scholar? Then say so. At what comprehension level is the book best suited for? Is it something everyone can enjoy, or is it aimed instead at the college or even the masters level? That's what readers need to know. Who will benefit the most from this book? Then evaluate the book based on it's perceived level of readership. If the author was aiming at the college level then don't criticize it because it was not written for the professional reader, and vice versa. Although, sometimes you might not know, and if so, say so. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now for some specific do's and dont's.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;First some do's:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Do try to be charitable. This is based on the humanistic principle of &lt;i&gt;The Golden Rule.&lt;/i&gt; Let the author speak as much you can charitably allow. Give him or her some space in your review. And do not unfairly focus on the weaknesses of a book without also telling the reader about its strengths, and vice versa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Do tell us what the author is arguing for. What is his or her main argument? Do this for the book as a whole, and if you're reviewing each chapter one at a time, then do so for each chapter. What is the author trying to get across? Briefly tell us. We want to know. While doing so keep in mind # 1 above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Do offer some criticisms of the book, if you have any, or if they're important enough to mention. We want to know what you think of what the author is saying. Although, sometimes it's enough to just tell us what the author is arguing for, since the important thing is to tell the reader what the author is doing in the book for us to judge for ourselves if we want to get it. If you do criticize the book do so from your perspective since that's the only perspective you have. Don't play the proverbial Devil's advocate by defending a position you don't agree with. Let the Devil speak for himself. ;-) But if you do so anyway, then also say what you think the author might say in response to those arguments. Keep in mind once again # 1 above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now for some dont's:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Don't rate a book poorly just because you disagree. If you're on Amazon you must rate it from 1-5. On your blogs you can choose to give it a grade much like a teacher would grade a semester paper, from A to F. But just because you disagree with the author doesn't mean you must rate or grade it poorly. You might think the book is poor, of course, but there are many books that lay out the arguments of the opposition very well and deserve a high rating. I have personally rated several Christian books with a 5 star rating on Amazon even though I disagreed with them. This merely means you think the book does as best as can be expected from the opposition, even if you think that isn't much. What a 5 star rating on Amazon means in some cases is that this is an important book written by an important person, that is argued well from their perspective, and/or a book that must be dealt with in the coming years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Don't rate a book highly just because you agree with it either. There are many poorly argued books that conclude what you do but don't deserve a good recommendation precisely because of how poorly they argued their case. This can be hard for many reviewers to do since a book you agree with can slip under your normal critical thinking radar skills precisely &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; you agree with its conclusions. This is a common error among many reviewers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Don't be a nitpicker. The more educated and intelligent a reviewer is then the more that reviewer argues against the main argument of the particular author's book or chapter. You can also tell from what a reviewer chooses to argue against if he or she is being fair in the review. Fair reviewers do not nitpick at minor points unrelated to the main argument itself, unless they have first dealt with the main argument, and only if the space available to do this is warranted. My book, WIBA, has been attacked &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/06/nitpickers-have-stated-to-attack.html"&gt;in this way by nitpickers&lt;/a&gt;. Every book will have some needed corrections to it, but I see no reason to nitpick at a book unless there are enough of them that makes doing so warranted, as a sort of "here's one example of many." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are more do's and dont's but this is a good enough start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Happy reviewing everyone.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-3172184068431331471?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

This study was funded by the National Cancer Institute and National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Remember what the Last Psychiatrist says: What do researchers want to be true?First comes the filter that will aid our interpretation of the results:&amp;quot;TODAY’S YOUTH HAVE UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS to entertainment media (Roberts et al., 2005), and longitudinal research has linked various forms of entertainment media with aggressive behavior (Bushman and Anderson, 2001), sexual behavior (Collins et al., 2004), and tobacco use (Sargent, 2005). Indeed, the available research evidence has led the National Cancer Institute (2008) to declare a causal relation between exposure to movie smoking and youth smoking initiation.&amp;quot;In words of Mr. Mackey, &amp;quot;Mm..R-rated movies are bad...mmkay.&amp;quot; The study was done by survey. 3,577 youths where chosen out of 4,655 (grades 5-8) because they reported to never have drunken alcohol without the knowledge of their parents. Also at baseline assessment the youths rated how restrictive their parents were in allowing them to view R-rate movies. Statistics 101: Very boring, but very important to interpret these results.This study is correlational. This results are known as the standardized coefficient. This can vary from +1 (indicating a perfect positive relationship), to zero (indicating no relationship), all the way down to -1 (indicating a perfect negative relationship, that is, when the frequency of a factor goes up, the other factor goes down). As a rule of thumb, standardized coefficients between .00 and .30 are considered weak, between .30 and .70 are moderate, and between .70 and 1.00 are considered strong.The primary meaning of standardized coefficients lies in the amount of variation in one variable that is accounted for by the variable with which it is correlated. To obtain this information, you square the standardized coefficient (e.g., .30 x.30). This number is called the coefficient of determination. Then you multiply the coefficient by determination 100. This proportion of variance indicates the percentage of variance. The coefficient of determination is the primary information measure. Correlation coefficients of .30 account for about 10 percent of the variance (.30x.30 =.90x100= 9%). Here are the results as reported in the abstract, that is, the information they want you to know:&amp;quot;The sample included 2,406 baseline never-drinkers who were surveyed at follow-up, of whom 14.8% had initiated alcohol use. At baseline, 20% reported never being allowed to watch R movies, and 21% reported being allowed all the time. Adolescents allowed to watch R-rated movies had higher rates of alcohol initiation (2.9% initiation among never allowed, 12.5% once in a while, 18.8% sometimes, and 24.4% all the time). Controlling for sociodemographics, personality characteristics, and authoritative parenting style, the adjusted odds ratios for initiating alcohol use were 3.0 (95% CI [1.7-5.1]) for those once in a while allowed, 3.3 [1.9, 5.6] for those sometimes allowed, and 3.5 [2.0, 6.0] for those always allowed to watch R-rated movies. Alcohol initiation was more likely if R-rated movie restriction relaxed over time; tightening of restriction had a protective effect (p &amp;lt; .001).&amp;quot;With odds-ratios, 1.0 represent the prevalence of something (e.g., drinking behavior) that already exists in the population. Anything above that represents an increase in prevalence. For example, in the study, it&amp;#39;s reported that youths who have peers who drink have an OR of 5.7, meaning that there is over a 400% increase in the incidence of early on-set drinking when one&amp;#39;s peers start drinking early (peer pressure). Kids allowed to view R-rated content once in a while showed a 200% increase, those allowed sometimes saw a 230% increase, and those allowed all the time saw a 250% increase.While these numbers are quite high, this tells us nothing about the relationship strength. Remember multiple variables can lead to this result. Here is a graph of the correlation coefficients:Exposure to R-rate movies has a standardized coefficient of 0.10. This relationship is weak. Using the formula above, the amount of variance in behavior attributed to viewing R-rated content is only 1%.  So why are youths, who are exposed to R-rated content, 2 times more likely to try alcohol at an earlier age?Here is how the authors explain it: &amp;quot;Youth who say that their parents allow them to watch R movies see more are movies and, therefore, more depictions of alcohol use...thus, the mechanism could be social influence via modeling of positive depictions of alcohol use.&amp;quot;Wrong!Exposure to R-rated movies various with onset of early alcohol use by 1%. That means 99% of the variance is explained by other reasons (e.g., peer pressure!) While it is true that this tiny relationship is statistically significant, it has no practical significance what so ever. But who cares about the actual science, politicians and other nanny state advocates have their sound bite, &amp;quot;The research to date suggests that keeping kids from R-rated movies can help keep them from drinking, smoking and doing a lot of other things that parents don&amp;#39;t want them to do, Sargent said.&amp;quot; (2)If only it were that simple.Tanski SE, Cin SD, Stoolmiller M, &amp;amp; Sargent JD (2010).

&lt;p&gt;Couples who are infertile often choose surrogacy or adoption as a means to become parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why choose surrogacy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couples who want to have a genetic relationship with the child often select &lt;a href="http://www.surrogacy.com/"&gt;surrogacy&lt;/a&gt; instead of adoption. Typically, they’re in regular contact with the surrogate mother throughout the entire pregnancy – even enjoying the birth experience in the delivery room. For couples who fear they won’t be able to bond with a child without the genetic connection, surrogacy makes sense. Surrogacy agencies can handle the matching, payments, and all other aspects of this type of agreement. Keep in mind that surrogacy is expensive, sometimes costing more than $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why choose adoption?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://Adoption.com"&gt;Adoption&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic alternative for infertile couples, gays and lesbians, single parents, and anyone who wants to provide a child with a safe, loving home. Adoption can be done domestically or internationally, as well as through the foster care system. Though adoption can be expensive, there are means to reduce or eliminate the costs – including the &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-13697-Joplin-Adoptive-Families-Examiner~y2010m3d24-Health-care-reform-bill-increases-adoption-tax-credit"&gt;adoption tax credit&lt;/a&gt;, as well as adopting foster children through the state. The adoption process can be long and tedious, depending on the age range, race, and other details about the infant or child whom you’d like to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, choosing between surrogacy and adoption is an extremely personal decision. Do your research, and weigh the pros and cons before making the right choice for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, many girls are getting nose jobs as Sweet 16 gifts. And there are numerous cases of children even younger than 16 undergoing plastic surgery. But how young is too young and what are the ramifications of kids going under the knife?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.plasticsurgery.org"&gt;American Society of Plastic Surgeons&lt;/a&gt;, the number of teens getting plastic surgery has doubled since 2002. For those who have a birth defect or are disfigured in an accident, you can make a strong case for the necessity of cosmetic surgery. However for those teens doing it in the name of beauty, there should be limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are possible surgical ramifications for someone who is not yet developed. And then there are the risks of surgery, general anesthesia, and pain medications. Additionally, the psychological and emotional consequences can be severe. What if your daughter has unrealistic expectations of how her life will change after surgery? Even adults who have undergone plastic surgery can suffer from &lt;a href="http://www.illinoissocietyofplasticsurgery.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=72:coping-with-post-operative-depression&amp;amp;catid=24:monthly-newsletters-on-plastic-surgery&amp;amp;Itemid=97"&gt;post-surgical depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the changes going on in a teen’s mind and body, should we really add the serious effects of plastic surgery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s no different than kids getting braces for crooked teeth,” says &lt;a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/36101073/ns/today-parenting_and_family/#ixzz0lDtRgoEo"&gt;Dr. Sam Rizk&lt;/a&gt;. But is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USDA won’t allow breast augmentation to be done on anyone younger than 18. However, some breast surgeries are performed at a younger age by surgeons who deem them medically necessary. Facial plastic surgery usually doesn’t take place until facial growth is complete (females: 14, males: 15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/36101073/ns/today-parenting_and_family/"&gt;msnbc.com&lt;/a&gt; ran an article about the pros and cons of letting teens have plastic surgery that brought up several valid points on both sides of the argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you allow your 16-year-old to undergo cosmetic surgery? Leave your comment below and tell us what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word “doula” comes from the Greek word meaning “a woman who serves.” In modern times, it’s used to refer to a professional who provides physical, emotional, and informational support to the expectant mother before, during, and immediately following birth. Some research has shown that women who use doulas have shorter labor, fewer complications, and healthier babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A birth doula will assist the mother in preparation for the birth of her child, stick with her through labor, and provide information and support along the way. She is a nurturer and a protector. A postpartum doula helps the mother after birth in all aspects of having a new baby in the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you go about hiring a doula?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you have a friend or relative who has used a doula, you can listen to their recommendations. You should also ask your obstetrician or local birth center for referrals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, several websites such as &lt;a href="http://alace.org"&gt;alace.org&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://cappa.net"&gt;cappa.net&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://doula.com"&gt;doula.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://dona.org"&gt;dona.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://doulanetwork.com"&gt;doulanetwork.com&lt;/a&gt; have listings of available certified doulas around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you find a few doulas in your area, start making phone calls. Before meeting face to face, ask them on the phone if they’re taking new clients during the month you’re due. Also find out about their experience, training, and fees. Each doula should also provide you with a few references you can contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewing Doulas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you’ve narrowed it down to two or three doula candidates, start conducting interviews. During the meeting, talk about your birth plan and find out what the doula’s role will be before, during, and after birth. You may want a doula who provides mostly emotional support and information. On the other hand, you may like a doula who is more physical – giving massages and other types of therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the interview process, you’ll be able to determine which doula meets your needs and also meshes with your personality. Before signing any agreement or paying any fee, be sure to ask about the doula’s refund policy – just in case things don’t work out.&lt;/p&gt;

If you know your ancestors, you can access the "one world" tree and check to see who you're related to. It's especially fun to see which famous people are your distance cousins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's only one problem. You really have to know something about your ancestors before you trust the results. Most of the relationships are wrong because someone has entered the wrong data and it gets propagated to the "one world" tree. This is a problem with all such databases—including scientific ones. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's one of the reliable hits. It shows how Bette Davis is a distant cousin. She descends from my great&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; grandparents Captain Richard Norman and his wife Margaret Alford.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Colwill initially found it amusing when a series of migraines caused her native West Country accent to be displaced by a Chinese lilt. But after a month, the joke is wearing thin for the 35-year-old IT project co-ordinator. "I have never been to China," she says. "It is very frustrating and I just want my own voice back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1265433/Croatian-teenager-wakes-coma-speaking-fluent-German.html#ixzz0lqP6D3gV"&gt;Another recent news story&lt;/a&gt; that fits into a similar paradigm is that of the "Croatian teenager wakes up from a coma speaking fluent GERMAN."  A psychiatrist mentioned in this Daily Mail (Online) article is quoted as saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In earlier times this would have been referred to as a miracle, we prefer to think that there must be a logical explanation — its just that we haven&amp;#39;t found it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There are references to cases where people who have been seriously ill and perhaps in a coma have woken up being able to speak other languages — sometimes even the Biblical languages such as that spoken in old Babylon or Egypt - at the moment though any speculation would remain just that — speculation — so it&amp;#39;s better to continue tests until we actually know something.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of some pentecostal churches I attended as a little boy where members of the congregation (also referred to as "Holy Rollers") would engage in glossolalia or "speaking in tongues."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm as suspicious of the Foreign Accent Syndrome as I am of "speaking in tongues."  In any event, I'd like to hear the "Chinese lilt" of Sarah Colwill to determine just how "Chinese" it really is.  And it would be interesting to hear just how good the young Croatian girl's German is and to find out how much German she had studied before allegedly acquiring fluency in that language while in a coma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've known people who can mimic accents uncannily well after hearing them spoken for only a few moments.  My son, Thomas Krishna, is particularly talented in this respect, and so was the late Michel Strickmann, a professor of Taoism at UC Berkeley.  But mimicking is an intentional, voluntary phenomenon, and makes no pretense toward actual mastery of another language.  Foreign Accent Syndrome and the other two cases discussed above are ostensibly involuntary and pretend to varying degrees of competence in another language than one's own.&lt;/p&gt;

Vernon school district and John Freshwater, the district’s insurer employed two attorneys to represent &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;the district and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Freshwater in addition to R. Kelly Hamilton, who is employed by Freshwater himself.  Today those attorneys, Robert H. Stoffers and Jason R. Deschler of the law firm Mazanec, Raskin, Ryder &amp;amp; Keller Co., L.P.A., filed a request with the court to withdraw as trial attorneys for Freshwater.  They say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 23, 2010 circumstances arose which prevent Robert H. Stoffers, Jason R. Deschler and Mazanec, Raskin, Ryder &amp;amp; Keller, Co., L.P.A. from continuing to represent Defendant Freshwater in the within case in accordance with Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct.  Defendant Freshwater continues to be represented by R. Kelly Hamilton. Attached hereto are the Affidavits of Robert H. Stoffers and Jason R. Deschler which attest to there being good cause, pursuant to the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct, which require them and Mazanec, Raskin, Ryder &amp;amp; Keller Co., L.P.A. to withdraw as Trial Attorneys for Defendant Freshwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some identifying information, the identical affidavits say only that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.  On April 23, 2010 I became aware of circumstances which prevent me from continuing to represent Defendant Freshwater in the above-referenced case in accordance with the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. There is good cause, pursuant to the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct, for me to withdraw from my representation of Defendant Freshwater in the above-referenced case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned of this only a few hours ago, and have not yet found out what those circumstances are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The federal trial was due to start on May 24, but this will no doubt delay that.  We don’t yet know what effect, if any, this will have on the administrative hearing on Freshwater’s termination, which is due to resume April 29.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Added in edit:&lt;/strong&gt;  Hamilton has now requested that the hearing be closed to spectators and media, claiming that potential jurors in the federal trial may be unduly influenced by media coverage of the hearing.  &lt;a href="http://www.accountabilityinthemedia.com/search?updated-min=2010-01-01T00%3A00%3A00-05%3A00&amp;amp;updated-max=2011-01-01T00%3A00%3A00-05%3A00&amp;amp;max-results=6" rel="external "&gt;PDF of the request (4.6 MB) here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;(Hat tip to &lt;a href="http://www.accountabilityinthemedia.com/" rel="external "&gt; Accountability in the Media&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;I’ve since learned that a lawyer named Sara Moore represented the district defendants (BoE and administrators) in the Dennis family’s suit against the district, while Deschler and Stoffers were assigned to represent only Freshwater.  So the potential conflict of interest hypothesis advanced below doesn’t hold up.&lt;/p&gt;

According to their article, the site is set to increase revenue by 22% in 2010 thanks to the ads, making an expected $36 million off the ads alone (Craigslist refuses to volunteer specific information, but those projections were estimated by Advanced Interactive Media Group).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ads provoke all kinds of opponents: some who simply don’t want to see sex ads when they’re looking for an apartment sublet; others who argue against the moral standing of ads that sell sex services. Many human rights groups say that Craigslist has become a number one outlet used by human traffickers to sell sex services of women and girls against their will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite playing host to ads for illegal services, Craigslist is protected against legal restraint by the Communications Decency Act, which places legal responsibility for ad content on users, not websites. But what do you think? Should Craigslist allow ads for sex services?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

Now which of them, do you suppose, has the raunchiest sex lives? Christians? Jews? The nonreligious? Or atheists, perhaps?Well, the answer is... all of them!Cindy Meston (at the University of Texas) and colleagues interviewed over 1,000 students in their survey of sexual behaviours, and found almost no difference between the different faith groups in what was reported. Virtually all of them reported in engaging in some form of premarital sex.Women (although not men) who were Jewish or fundamentalist Christians did report a somewhat lower incidence of sexual intercourse - but apart from that pretty much anything goes.No differences in the types of sexual activities (it was quite a, erm, exhaustive survey), in the number of partners (both in the past and the number anticipated in the next 5 years), or in the age at which they lost their virginity. If anything, Christian women lost their virginity slightly earlier than atheists.What&amp;#39;s more, there was no difference in the level of infidelity between atheists and the non-religious - more evidence that religious identification is a poor guide to honesty.In a separate study, they looked at the frequency and types of sexual fantasies. Here there was a clear difference. Atheist and especially agnostic women (but again, not men) fantasise more often and more widely (gender bending, masochism, sadism, gender bending - you name it!).Oddly enough, the only men to confess to having taken part in homosexual intercourse were Christian (just under 10% of Christian men) - although in the second study there was no hint of increased gender-bending fantasies. Make of that what you will.So far this has all been about self-reported identification. Are you Christian, Jewish, Spiritualist, Non-religious, atheist, or agnostic? But what about intensity of beliefs?Meston and colleagues also measured beliefs using some fairly standard scales - spiritual beliefs, paranormal/new age beliefs, fundamentalist beliefs, and intrinsic religiosity (how central religious belief is to your life).When you look at beliefs, rather than identification, some rather starker differences emerge.Broadly speaking, compared with non-believers, any form of traditional religious belief has a deadening effect on sexual activity (both the  act and also fantasies, especially for women). However, paranormal and new age beliefs were linked to an increase in all kinds of sexual activity.For men, the effect was much less. Indeed, fundamentalist Christian men actually reported more sexual partners in the past year than their non-religious counterparts! A case of get religion and get laid? Or just down to the fact that here is a relative shortage of evangelical men?So, among these students, it seems that religious affiliation is a poor guide to sexual behaviour and fantasies, but that women (and also some men) with strong religious beliefs try to avoid even thinking about it.But that&amp;#39;s students! What about older folk? Well, Mark Regnerus (also at the University of Texas - it seems to be a hotbed of sex research) and colleagues have just published a study into the sex lives of older Americans.It turns out that among oldies, too, there is very little relationship between religion and either sexual frequency or sexual satisfaction. Just as with the youngsters, however, unmarried women who were also religious were also less likely to have had sex.But religion had no effect on male sexual activity. Makes you wonder why religion is so popular among women in the US, and yet shunned by men!Farmer, M., Trapnell, P., &amp;amp; Meston, C. (2008).

&lt;p&gt;Add this to the list of offenses we’ve seen from the insurance industry: Recently, the insurer Wellpoint was caught canceling the policies of women newly diagnosed with breast cancer and other conditions, according to a &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63M2YM20100426"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius isn’t too happy about it. She’s called on the nation’s largest insurer to stop, reminding them in a letter that the practice will soon be outlawed because of recent health care reforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reuters article alleges that Wellpoint was using a computer system to target patients who had been recently diagnosed with breast cancer. The insurer denies the charges, saying it uses the system only to find conditions patients would have known about when they applied for insurance coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice, known as “rescission,” isn’t uncommon. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/work-in-progress/2010/04/23/wellpoint-breast-cancer-insurance-woman/"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; notes that every year tens of thousands of Americans lose their health insurance after being diagnosed with expensive or life-threatening illnesses. Luckily, the practice will be banned under the new legislative reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the course of this amazingly viral experiment, some more...&lt;i&gt;astute&lt;/i&gt;...commentators have revealed some truly amazing and insightful true facts about the Boobquake. I'd like to take a moment here to offer some equally astute commentary to those facts, if I could.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;True Fact: Boobquake is not Serious Activism.&lt;/h4&gt; Yes, this is true. Thank you for pointing it out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;True Fact: Boobquake will probably not change what Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi and his believers believe.&lt;/h4&gt;Now that you mention it, I do seem to recall that they are fundamentalists and radicals, so this is also true. I never would have realized it if people hadn't been bringing it up over and over again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;True Fact: Boobquake will do nothing to help the oppressed women of Iran.&lt;/h4&gt;It most assuredly will not. In fact, another startling revelation has just occurred to me: making fun of Teabaggers will not feed starving children in Rwanda. Whew, I'm so glad to have &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; monkey off my back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;True Fact: Boobquake is not solidly scientific.&lt;/h4&gt;Until people started pointing this out &lt;i&gt;ad nauseam&lt;/i&gt;, I honestly thought that Boobquake stood a chance of being published in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; within the year. Thanks for being so quick on the draw, people. Even if it crushes my dreams and leaves me with a single, Iron-Eyes Cody tear running down my cheek, I'd rather know the &lt;i&gt;truth&lt;/i&gt; than believe a comforting lie about the scientific status of Boobquake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;True Fact: Men will stare at women's exposed breasts during Boobquake.&lt;/h4&gt;Very much so. Being a man, I was already aware of this fact based on my heterosexual wiring, but it's definitely worth pointing out time and time again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and how could I possibly forget the most important True Fact?&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;True Fact: Boobquake is immature, juvenile humor.&lt;/h4&gt;Yes. Yes it fucking is. And all of you self-serious, "high-minded," "mature" dipshits who have been whining for a week and a half about all of the above can go eat a dick. Seriously. Saute it, deep-fry it, boil it, or just munch on it raw; I don't care. Just find some way to chomp on a cock and swallow it down. Because you're all a bunch of fucking twits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boobquake has never been anything more than a giant middle finger to an ignorant Muslim radical on the other side of the planet. If someone told you it was a serious attempt at science or activism or changing the world, that person was mistaken or lying. If you came up with that brilliant straw-man yourself and then wasted precious kilobytes of internet space to fap about how smart, mature, and deep-thinking you are, then you can go fuck yourselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And to the folks that keep going on about how "Skepticism/atheism/feminism/activism/science is serious business," well, you can go eat &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; dicks.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-4229897040493135561?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Don)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272401034932"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=23658">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9270c0ce90115e43</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="College Atheists"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Andrew Lovley Explains His Secular Invocation Speech</title><published>2010-04-27T20:00:07Z</published><updated>2010-04-27T20:00:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/04/27/andrew-lovley-explains-his-secular-invocation-speech/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back in December, the founder of the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Portland-ME/Southern-Maine-Association-of-Secular-Humanists/268198990042"&gt;Southern Maine Association of Secular Humanists&lt;/a&gt; (SMASH), &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Lovley&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/12/18/south-portland-mayor-asks-secular-humanist-to-deliver-invocation/"&gt;delivered a secular invocation&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;Tom Coward&lt;/strong&gt;, the new mayor of South Portland, Maine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/02/04/should-humanists-deliver-invocations/"&gt;little bit of backlash&lt;/a&gt; from the secular community — some people objected to the very idea of invocations in the first place and didn’t like that Andrew gave a speech at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the recent Secular Student Alliance &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/nelsreflection"&gt;New England Leadership Summit&lt;/a&gt;, Andrew spoke about how he was chosen to deliver the invocation as well as his responses to the backlash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite bit comes at 20:45 &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you watch the speech, you can tell why Andrew was chosen.  He’s a terrific representative of the Humanist community.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tonight on Frontline, &amp;quot;The Vaccine War&amp;quot; presents both sides of the controversy over whether young children should be vaccinated for diseases such as measles and polio, and in a rare display of TV-news common sense and independence, one side is shown to be — sorry — wrong. Frontline&amp;#39;s documentary will, I hope, leave any sensible viewer feeling that you&amp;#39;d have be deluded or selfish not to have your kids vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m going to have to tune in just for the unbelievable spectacle of a television show taking a skeptical, science-based view of the issue. It&amp;#39;s broadcast at 8pm Central time on PBS — apparently, it will also be available online as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t bad — a little dry, not quite as blunt as I&amp;#39;d have liked it to be, but I think it made a good case. They&amp;#39;d show the anti-vaxers making some claim, then they&amp;#39;d show how they were simply wrong. Too much time was given to the doofuses, but I think that had to be done in order to shoot them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most effective bit, though, was the showing of the effects of diseases like whooping cough, which can be easily immunized against. If I were a young parent trying to make a decision about whether to immunize (because I was an ignorant git unaware of the science behind vaccines), a bunch of statistics from an epidemiological study might not be that persuasive…but a video of a baby girl gasping for air and near death because of a disease that I could prevent her from getting, I&amp;#39;d give her the shot. No argument.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/must-see_tv_frontline_takes_on.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/wCMIDIY8FyA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272400726586"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/if_fox_news_and_wing_nut_daily.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3ca603d330951fa4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">If Fox News and Wing Nut Daily say it's true, it must be so</title><published>2010-04-27T20:52:18Z</published><updated>2010-04-27T20:52:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/5omY0cLp70g/if_fox_news_and_wing_nut_daily.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/if_fox_news_and_wing_nut_daily.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ho hum. I'm getting lots of mail about this ridiculous story on &lt;a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;amp;pageId=146369"&gt;WND&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/04/27/noahs-ark-found-turkey-arafat/"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt; claiming that Noah's Ark has been discovered atop Mt Ararat. No, it hasn't. This is yet another mob of incompetent evangelicals hiking all over a big hill in Turkey and credulously interpreting every rock formation and every chunk of wood as proof that they've found a big boat. It's the same BS &lt;a href="http://www.wyattmuseum.com/"&gt;Ron Wyatt&lt;/a&gt; was peddling for years. It's always the same stuff: distant photos of a rock formation that is vaguely boat-shaped, but nothing close-up to suggest that it is anything but a rock formation. Or sometimes it's a photo of a glacial ridge, with the claim that the Ark is buried under that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the occasional close-ups of &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; — &lt;a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;amp;pageId=146369"&gt;this latest account has lots of those&lt;/a&gt; — that look more like recent construction: a cabin, a mine shaft, the reinforced walls of a well. Again, nothing competently photographed to show context or extent or overall structure, nothing that even looks like a boat. In particular, though, it looks nothing like a 5,000 year old boat left exposed on a mountaintop or churned up by a glacier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do have one other novel claim this time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group claims that carbon dating proves the relics are 4,800 years old, meaning they date to around the same time the ark was said to be afloat. Mt. Ararat has long been suspected as the final resting place of the craft by evangelicals and literalists hoping to validate biblical stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, yeah. &lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt; the creationists are willing to say carbon-dating is valid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/if_fox_news_and_wing_nut_daily.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/5omY0cLp70g" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272400726585"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/youre_doing_it_wrong.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c89b3d9860c8340e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">You're doing it wrong</title><published>2010-04-27T20:35:29Z</published><updated>2010-04-27T20:35:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/9QuSqLrU0xE/youre_doing_it_wrong.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/youre_doing_it_wrong.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the Department of Unfortunate Analogies, here's a &lt;a href="http://www.laughyourway.com/blog/sometimes-sex-is-just-sex/"&gt;Christian minister giving advice on one's marital obligations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said, sometimes sex is just sex; it's what you do when you are married. &lt;b&gt;Just like cleaning the toilet is what you do to keep your house clean&lt;/b&gt;...and I bet you don't have this great desire or huge emotional connection to scrubbing the porcelain! You do it because it needs to be done and that's the way it is with married sex... it does need to be done! It's the glue that God gave us to bond us to one another. The bible is very clear that it is your responsibility as a spouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Au contraire…if ever you&amp;#39;re at the point where sex is a chore like scrubbing a toilet, I think maybe it&amp;#39;s time to back off and think and talk and figure out what you&amp;#39;re doing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course, rubber gloves, disinfectants, and getting down with a great big bristly scrubbing brush is your kink.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/youre_doing_it_wrong.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/9QuSqLrU0xE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272400412486"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2010/04/a_little_help_please.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8bf1928ad2a6d543</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">A little help, please</title><published>2010-04-27T20:57:17Z</published><updated>2010-04-27T20:57:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/gUmVI869gsk/a_little_help_please.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2010/04/a_little_help_please.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Next week I'm going to be giving a talk at the &lt;a href="http://www.michigan.gov/msp/0,1607,7-123-1593_3507-231917--,00.html"&gt;2010 Great Lakes Homeland Security Training Conference &amp;amp; Expo.&lt;/a&gt;  The title of the talk will be  "Medical Blogs: An Under-Recognized Resource for Public Health Awareness and Communication", but I'll probably speak more broadly about web 2.0.

&lt;p&gt;One possible ways to enlist blogs and social media in disaster response is to direct people to a specific link where official information can be found.

I am going to tweet this post, and I'd like others to retweet it and/or post it to your social media of choice.  I'll be using a bit.ly link so that I can gather some crude data about the post's propagation.

Regular readers of this blog will be aware of my conception of positive emotions  in terms of promotion focus and negative emotions in terms of prevention focus. Today I will try to relate this to the specific action-tendency theory of negative emotions and broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions (as proposed by Barbara Fredrickson).

If you have ever purchased a Surly necklace from me through the mail you know that I like to include a strip of paper nestled in the bottom of the box with a quote about art, science or skepticism. A large part of my Surly-Ramics art project has to do with communication and how the art interacts with the owner and the viewer. I like to think of the quotes I send as another &lt;img src="http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/1424/quoteskn.jpg" alt="quotes" width="270" height="270"&gt;way to inspire the people I come in contact with to learn or to start a conversation or to have a good laugh. I keep hundreds of quotes separated into topics in bags and I hand pick one out to send with each order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want more quotes. So I have actively started collecting new ones. I am now even writing down cool things I hear people say when I am out and about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a quote I heard last weekend at SkeptiCAL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Skepticism is a perspective that does not accept or reject claims at face value, but withholds judgment until specific evidence is available.” ~ Eugenie Scott&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one of my all-time favorite quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never believed in God, but I believe in Picasso.” ~ Diego Rivera&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And something Surly Johnny said that made me laugh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m so lowbrow, they call me moustache.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of your favorite quotes and why do you love them? Have you ever said or heard anything quote worthy? Can I quote you on that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afternoon Inquisition (or AI) is a question posed to you, the Skepchick community.

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36730295"&gt;A pertussis outbreak in California has already killed two infants&lt;/a&gt;. This event resonates with what happened in Australia a year ago; vaccination rates are low, and the victims are too young to be vaccinated themselves. With herd immunities compromised, the littlest and most defenseless reap the effects. This is not necessarily caused by the antivaxxers, but it’s worth noting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2010/04/outbreak_of_paralysis_points_t.html"&gt;There is apparently a small outbreak of polio in Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt;. Vaccinations are critical, but so is sanitation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) PBS airs a documentary called &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/vaccines/?utm_campaign=vaccines"&gt;&amp;quot;The Vaccine Wars&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; tonight. It’s about what you think it’s about. Check your local listings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/04/26/h1n1.one.year.anniversary/index.html?hpt=C1"&gt;H1N1 is still out there&lt;/a&gt;, and still hurting and killing kids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2010/04/27/vaccine-reactions-suspend-seasonal-flu-vax-to-kids-under-5/"&gt;A bunch of kids got pretty sick after vaccinations in Australia&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear what happened, and officials are investigating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6) The good news? At least for Finland, it’s good: &lt;a href="http://www.thl.fi/fi_FI/web/fi/tiedote?id=22315"&gt;97% of kids there are vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;. For &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. Amazing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent the day metal-detecting a lovely high-profile site in Uppland for a colleague. It's turf-covered and a popular haunt of campers and picnic parties. My next detector is definitely going to be one that can differentiate between aluminium and precious metals. &lt;a href="http://saltosobrius.blogspot.com/2006/04/death-to-makers-of-aluminium-bottle.html"&gt;I hate aluminium&lt;/a&gt;. I took up 111 objects and almost all of them were made of that accursed metal: mainly pull tabs, bottle tops and crumbly nasty wads of foil, but also a tent peg and sundry other things. The oldest find was a 1934 coin. I was a little touched to find a 1980s scout badge, just like the ones I used to wear. And even though I found nothing of archaeological interest, I enjoyed seeing the site and doing the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A funny detail: Gustavus VI Adolphus was an archaeologist and took part in a trial dig at this site in his youth. Then he was king of Sweden from 1950 to 1973. And I found a coin struck with his image in his old age on site...&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, many European registrants were unable to attend because of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano. The meeting website has links to the PDFs for 67 of these "Volcano Posters".One of those unable to attend was Dr. Jonas Persson of Stockholm University.  He was scheduled to speak in the final symposium of the conference, which was on control of executive control, or who controls the "controller" in the brain (without resorting to a homunculus or an infinite regress of Mini-Me's). His co-author, Dr. Patricia Reuter-Lorenz of the University of Michigan, gave an interesting presentation about their work on the ups and downs of cognitive training: gains that transfer to other tasks across sessions and fatigue that transfers to other tasks within a session.  The abstract is reprinted below.---------------Symposium Session 5Tuesday, April 20, 1:00 - 3:00 pm, Westmount et al BallroomWhat Controls Executive Control?  The Influence  of 'Control Context'Chair: Amishi Jha, University of Pennsylvania. . .Talk 3: Training and Depletion of Executive Functions: The Case of  Interference ControlJonas Persson1, Patricia Reuter-Lorenz2; 1Stockholm  University, 2University of MichiganBrain imaging reveals overlapping sites of prefrontal activation  for different cognitive tasks suggesting they may share core executive processes. We tested this hypothesis by measuring behavioral interactions between memory tasks presumed to require interference  control - a putative executive process that mediates selection from  competing representations. Behavioral data show that different training  regimens produce either negative or positive transfer from working  memory to semantic and episodic memory task performance. We show that  eight days of training on high interference versions of three different  working memory tasks increased the efficiency of interference control on  the training tasks and on untrained tasks in new memory domains. In  contrast we have also demonstrated negative transfer and  process-specific “fatigue” effects indicating that control efficiency in  a second task is diminished by high control demands in a prior task  immediately preceding it in time. This suggests that interference  control is a finite resource that can be temporarily depleted.  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to elucidate the  mechanisms associated with decreasing efficiency or resource depletion  of the interference control process. Along with reduced performance,  fMRI indicates negative transfer is associated with reduced  process-specific activation, and increased homologous activation that  may be compensatory. In sum, this suggests that interference control is  an executive function that is both resource limited and plastic making it possible for training to alter its efficiency.---------------These findings became extremely relevant (albeit ignored) in light of the ultra-high impact paper by Adrian Owen et al. (2010) published in BBC/Nature on April 20, informing us there was "No gain from brain training" in a massive group of 11,430 volunteers. The research volunteers participated in online training exercises that tapped (1) reasoning, planning, problem solving; (2) short-term memory, attention, visuospatial processing, mathematics; or (3) ability to answer obscure questions using the internet.Numerous other outlets have already summarized these results, so I won't attempt to do so here. The main issue was whether the gains obtained through simple practice  effects transferred to tasks that weren't in the training set. The short  answer is no.Brain training doesn't boost brain power, work suggests (BBC)Brain-training games don't work (Guardian)Brain   training games don't work (BPS Research Digest)Brain-training  games get a D at brain-training tests (Not Exactly Rocket Science)Brain Test Britain - Results in-depth (BBC - Lab UK)I am not a proponent of brain training games that make unsound claims lacking credible  scientific evidence to back them up. But in light of the spectacularly negative findings of Owen et al., the question arises of whether their training regimen (10 min 3  times a week for 6 weeks) was adequate to produce significant effects. Predictably, those with a stake in the matter said no, the training was neither sufficient in duration nor applicable to other commercially available products.BBC  “Brain Training” Experiment: the Good, the Bad, the UglyPosit Science Disputes Results of the BBC Brain Training StudyA final issue concerns the population under study, a presumably "normal" group of 18-60 year olds without cognitive impairments or cognitive decline. Would the same training exercises help an older population at risk for dementia? On the other hand, seniors might be especially vulnerable to persuasive false claims from unscrupulous brain training vendors. Thus it's important to have scientifically valid and accessible research on whether cognitive training might help an aging population (Lustig et al., 2009).

She contacted me and told me some chilling news: &lt;a href="http://www.steingrueblworldenterprises.com/2010/04/hard-times-ahead.html"&gt;her daughter Elise was recently diagnosed with leukemia&lt;/a&gt;. She’s being treated, and I know we all hope things go well for her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the meantime, this makes Elise susceptible to many preventable diseases. We need people to get vaccinated! As Heather says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vaccinate. Elise and thousands of kids like her are counting on not dying from things like measles and whooping cough while they fight cancer. Unless it’s a specific health risk to you or your child, just vaccinate. Please. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also implores people to get on the bone marrow donation registry. Search around online for information on how to do this. I plan on doing this myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart goes out to her and her family, as it does to anyone affected by this awful illness. I’m going to find out what booster shots I need, because I take this issue very seriously. I hope you do too.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers – representing academia, the World Bank, and the US Forest Service – identify a potential global model for raising and allocating funding to individual countries on the basis of their ability to provide globally important ecosystem services. This model would apply successful payment collection and disbursement systems already in use around the world. The paper focuses on the mechanisms for payments for ecosystem services, which, according to the researchers, are the only practical way for international actors to influence an individual country’s use of its natural resources. The researchers identify which mechanisms could support the scale of payments needed to address a rather large problem: payments for provisioning services ($4 trillion) outpace payments for atmosphere-regulating services ($7 billion) by three orders of magnitude. (Note that the authors consider only one regulating service: carbon sequestration and mitigation.) The researchers describe the market failures affecting climate change mitigation and biodiversity protection – the failures occur because they involve non-excludable, non-rival public goods – before moving on to a discussion of the potential for new PES schemes. The first proposal would adapt the Brazilian ICMS Ecologico, a “successful intergovernmental fiscal transfer scheme,” to a global scale. Under this system, states control the disbursement of sales tax revenue to municipalities by providing incentives to conserve land parcels which are important for biodiversity or the water supply and which have legitimacy in local communities.The second proposal would attempt to address the market failure brought about by the unacceptably high costs (in the short term) of addressing a long-term problem (climate change) that is likely to bring its own high costs far in the future. Since technological innovations are “not completely excludable… Once a technology is developed by one firm at high cost, other firms can cheaply copy it. The result is under-investment by the private sector in new technologies.” Rather than strengthening intellectual property rights, the authors advocate open-source innovation – through sharing of energy R&amp;amp;D – to make sure that duplicative research is avoided and that everyone benefits from technological advances. This paradigm would include a global research consortium that would determine the appropriate technologies to be shared broadly in the effort to control climate change as cheaply as possible. [See article for higher-quality image.] Open-source innovation, it is hoped, would reduce the costs of innovation, increase the present value of these benefits to society, and ultimately mobilize the supply of climate solutions to meet the growing demand for these solutions. Although ancillary to the main points of the paper, one of the most compelling points – a reference to the 2006 Stern Report – is this illustration of the impacts of controlling climate change on income and standards of living: “Had we initiated [mitigation efforts to stabilize atmospheric carbon at 550 ppm, reducing the risk of catastrophic climate change by 32%], we would currently be enjoying our living standards from 4-5 months ago.”Farley, J., Aquino, A., Daniels, A., Moulaert, A., Lee, D., &amp;amp; Krause, A.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Amateur&amp;quot; astronomer Ralf Vandebergh took this incredible shot of the Space Shuttle Orbiter &lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; as it was docked to the space station. Mind you, &lt;em&gt;this picture was taken from the ground!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/vandebergh_sts131.jpg" alt="vandebergh_sts131" title="vandebergh_sts131" width="610" height="458"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! &lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; was 369 km (220 miles) away from Ralf when he snapped this shot using his 25 cm (10″) telescope. The atmosphere above his observing site was calm and steady, aiding him in getting such an astounding picture. Incredibly, he was tracking the Orbiter and station manually, moving his telescope by hand!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://ralfvandebergh.startje.be/vieuw.php?qid=303316"&gt;He has other pictures&lt;/a&gt; of this mission as well, including several of the space station. Ralf’s images have graced this blog before, including &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/01/spectacular-new-iss-picture-from-the-ground/"&gt;this one of the station&lt;/a&gt;, a picture of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/25/shuttle-and-station-imaged-from-the-ground/"&gt;Discovery and ISS&lt;/a&gt; from an earlier mission, and one &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/10/space-walker-from-the-ground/"&gt;actually showing an astronaut doing a spacewalk&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to forget that space isn’t all that far away, starting (officially) only 60 miles above our heads. The ISS orbits just 350 km (210 miles) above the Earth’s surface… which may not seem like much. But that’s vertical height; imagine climbing a staircase that high! It takes a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of energy to get there, but, as it happens, only about the same amount of energy once there to go anywhere in the solar system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As author Robert Heinlein said: once you’re in orbit, you’re halfway to &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;. All it takes is energy, and the will to go there.&lt;/p&gt;

And true to form over one million of them are doing so, according to &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/DEAR-LORD-THIS-YEAR-YOU-TOOK-MY-FAVORITE-ACTOR-PATRICK-SWAYZIE-YOU-TOOK-MY-FAVORITE-ACTRESS-FARAH-FAWCETT-YOU-TOOK-MY-FAVORITE-SINGER-MICHAEL-JACKSON-I-JUST-WANTED-TO-LET-YOU-KNOW-MY-FAVORITE-PRESIDENT-IS-BARACK-OBAMA-AMEN/111712585523370"&gt;this Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;. Christian, why haven't you joined in yet? You think it's not biblical? Think again. Ever hear of &lt;a href="http://www.theopedia.com/Imprecatory_Psalms"&gt;the imprecatory Psalms&lt;/a&gt; in the Bible? Doing so is Biblical, you see. So choose: either follow the Bible and pray for his death, or reject the Bible. Oh, I know, these Christians are just idiots--more than a million of them--right? No, the Bible is barbaric and your God was a poor communicator if he wanted them to think differently. Calling for prayers like this could inspire some idiot to try to kill him. Christians who do this ought to be ashamed of themselves, especially if this happens. But these Christians really want him to die, don't they?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-5621365422816207608?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when she saw it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/jesus-and-fsm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/jesus-and-fsm.jpg" alt="" title="jesus-and-fsm" width="550" height="366"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just Jesus, either.  The Flying Spaghetti Monster is there, too.  Double whammy!  (If you can’t make out that red writing, it says “Noodly Appendage”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, it’s a sign of the apocalypse.  Or a boobquake.  Or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see it?!  I’ll try to help…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/jesus-and-fsm2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/jesus-and-fsm2.jpg" alt="" title="jesus-and-fsm2" width="550" height="366"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were Abigail, I’d never wash the kitchen again.  That would be heresy.  Her best best is to charge for admission and then just buy a new house.&lt;br&gt;

Logistics got in my way. I apologize. So today, Monday: The Reckoning, I am here to give you the news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Women Thinking Free Foundation will be hosting its first official event on May 22! And its second official event on June 22! (And more more more!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/WTF-Item.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="WTF Item" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/WTF-Item.jpg" alt="" width="154" height="155"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Our first official speaker agreed to the terms of her contract with us before she got famous. This is the skeptical version of “buy low, sell high”. For weeks, she was my top choice for a speaker, and then she started getting a little bit of buzz around the community regarding a blog post. I already pretty much love everything about her, and then the added bonus of hot buzz sealed the deal for me. I asked her. She said yes. Next thing I know, she’s an international news sensation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, our first speaker is &lt;a href="http://blaghag.com"&gt;BlagHag, Jen McCreight&lt;/a&gt;! Ms. &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&amp;amp;pz=1&amp;amp;cf=all&amp;amp;ned=us&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=boobquake"&gt;Boobquake&lt;/a&gt; herself! She is also the brilliant creative mind behind Atheist Barbie! Not only that, but she co-founded Purdue University’s Society of Non-Theists. AND!! This fall she’s heading off to Seattle to get her PhD in Genome Sciences from the University of Washington. She’s young, smart, sassy, fun, strong, skeptical, and all around fantastic… and at 22, is making a real name for herself in the community. I can’t think of a better person to be the face of the launch of our organization. (And the fact that she was mentioned on the Colbert Report last night is pretty freakin’ rad!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next month, if you’re in the Chicago metro area, please come out to attend our launch! Jen will give a talk then we’ll all head downstairs for food and beers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are $10, tax deductible, and are available&lt;a href="http://www.shop.womenthinkingfree.org/Jen-McCreight-kicks-off-WTFs-inaugural-event_c4.htm"&gt; through our website shop&lt;/a&gt; and will also be available at the door, space permitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost: &lt;/strong&gt;$10 online and at the door (cash or cards accepted) providing Jon Stewart and Katie Couric don’t hog all the seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Food and booze not included&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limited metered street parking is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$13 unlimited weekend parking is available at the Children’s Memorial parking garage at 2515 N Clark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;Save the Date&lt;/strong&gt; for our June event!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 12, 10:00am,&lt;/strong&gt; we will be taking a private tour of the &lt;strong&gt;FermiLab&lt;/strong&gt; in Batavia, Il! It’s a 2.5 hour walking tour of the facility, and will (hopefully) be guided by one of the women scientists on staff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour will be &lt;strong&gt;$30 per person&lt;/strong&gt;, is limited to no more than 40 people, &lt;strong&gt;and will include lunch&lt;/strong&gt;. More details to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else do the Women Thinking Free have planned over the next few months?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Gorski of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?page_id=224"&gt;Science Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An adult science fair! (like grown ups, not like XXX)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Science in Art expo (rumored to include the works of Skepchick’s own &lt;a href="http://surlyramics.com"&gt;Surly Amy&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pub Crawl Fundraiser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Science street fair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and in October we’ll start organizing Skepchicamp 2011!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more skepticism!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more women!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye out for more announcements and events! We’re just getting started. Our goal is to make Chicago so skeptical that Oprah goes broke and Jenny McCarthy never returns.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Elyse</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272384710404"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/curiouswavefunction/~3/Rdkg4clqDcM/it-not-mutation-stupid.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/514adc56fe8e260f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">It&amp;#39;s (not) the mutation, stupid</title><published>2010-04-27T10:24:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-27T10:24:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/YZLtoYOiApM/it-not-mutation-stupid.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/curiouswavefunction/~3/Rdkg4clqDcM/it-not-mutation-stupid.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Cancer has emerged as a fundamentally genetic disease, where mutations in genes cause cells to go haywire. Yet, finding out exactly which mutations are responsible for a certain type of cancer is a daunting task. A recent report in Nature which details the cataloging of tens of thousands of mutations in tens of thousands of tumors illustrates the merits and dangerous pitfalls of such an approach.The article talks about the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), formed in 2008, whose task is to coordinate an international effort spread across different countries, where every country has the responsibility of documenting significant mutations in certain types of cancer. For instance, the US is doing 6 types including brain and lung, China is doing gastric, India is doing oral and Australia is doing pancreatic. The process would involve sequencing tens of thousands of genes from tumors. The goal is to find out all the mutations that separate cancerous cells from normal ones.Yet this goal immediately runs into David Hume's well-known problem of induction. If a mutation in a gene is observed in, say 5% of tumors, would it be observed in all of them? More importantly, would it be significant as a causative agent? Consider the IDH1 gene which encodes isocitrate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the all-important Krebs cycle. As the article notes, IDH1 was not regarded as significant when it initially showed up in a very small subset of certain kinds of tumors. But then it consistently showed up in 12% of brain tumors of a certain kind and 8% of tumors from leukemic patients. Thus, rather than being a chance occurrence, IDH1 now seems like a significant correlative factor for cancer. It is now hot cancer genomic property.But this is just the beginning, the very beginning. Evolutionary biologists are very well familiar with the problem of determining which mutations- called "drivers"- are causative for a given phenotype, and which ones are just "passengers". One of the biggest mistakes that "adaptionists" can make is to assume that every genotypical change somehow provides a selective advantage, when the change could just be riding on the back of another significant one. Identifying and cataloging thousands of mutant genes says nothing about which of those are truly responsible for the cancer and which ones have just come along for the ride. As a researcher quoted in the article says, "it's going to take good old-fashioned biology to really determine what these mutations are doing". And I think we can all agree that's its going to take a lot of good old-fashioned biology to accomplish this. Firstly, one has to determine the function of the mutated gene by doing knockout and other experiments, and endeavor fraught with complications. Maybe it codes for a protein, maybe it does not. Even if it does, one then has to identify the function of that protein by finding a suitable system in which it can be expressed and purified. Structure determination may be another hard obstacle on the path to success. Finally, if any kind of therapeutic intervention is going to be attempted, one would have go first find out whether the target is "druggable". And then of course, the long and wildly uncertain road towards finding a small molecule inhibitor only begins. Even assuming that all this happens, there is no guarantee that hitting the enzyme will produce a therapeutic response. Maybe the enzyme that is mutated is part of a complex pathway of signaling, and maybe one has to really hit something upstream or downstream to actually make a difference. And of course, hitting the target may cause a difference, but it may not be therapeutically significant enough. Thus, it's pretty clear that this project is far from curing any kind of cancer at this stage. What we just described is light years ahead of what is being currently done. Plus, it's worth noting that this is data that is extremely heterogeneous, collated from a variety of populations, potentially subject to the capricious standards of individual agencies and workers. It's nothing if not a statistician's nightmare.So is the effort worth it? Undoubtedly. Sitting among those haystacks of mutations is the valuable one that may actually be causative. We are never going to identify the culprit if we never line up the suspects. But here, much more than in a police lineup, it is easy to be seduced by statistical significance. The pursuit of the wrong gene could easily mean the loss of millions of dollars and countless hours wasted. The researchers who have descended into this quagmire need to be more careful than Ulysses on their tortuous journey toward the discovery of important cancer-causing mutations. It is all too easy to slip on a stone and chase the wrong rabbit into the wrong rabbit hole. And there are countless number of these at every step. As Yeats might have rephrased a line from one of his enduring poems, "tread softly, because you tread on my genes".Ledford, H. (2010).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/04/stephen-hawking-says-trying-to-contact-space-aliens-is-too-risky/1"&gt;Stephen Hawking says we should avoid any aliens&lt;/a&gt;—they&amp;#39;ll destroy us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/04/25/hawking-beware-the-alien-menace/"&gt;Sean Carroll agrees, but think it's highly unlikely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/26/in-which-i-disagree-with-stephen-hawking/"&gt;Phil Plait disagrees that aliens will destroy us&lt;/a&gt;, also thinks it is unlikely anyway, but also thinks it more likely we'd be demolished by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_machine"&gt;von Neumann replicators&lt;/a&gt; without seeing the aliens at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/04/if_aliens_exist_should_we_be_e.php"&gt;Ethan Siegel is optimistic and wants to run out waving his arms for attention&lt;/a&gt;. He scares me the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the token biologist, I&amp;#39;ll differ from all of them. If I were in charge of humanity&amp;#39;s expansion into the universe, and if light-speed is the absolute limit it seems to be, I&amp;#39;d be sending out robot probes all right…all loaded with the biological seeds to impose human-compatible biospheres on any remotely human-compatible geospheres it encountered. It would bombard atmospheres with bacteria, sow the planet with algae, fungi, and lichens, and work its way up to grasses and trees and rodents and birds. And then it would start unspooling the stored genetic information of millions of humans into infants that would be raised onboard, educated by machines, and eventually transported onto the now hospitable planet surface to build a new technological civilization. Communication between planets would be limited and slow, and all the planning would be long-term — thousands to tens of thousands of years — so this wouldn&amp;#39;t be so much the growth of a human empire, but an organic expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd expect that any intelligent aliens aspiring to expand would be doing the same thing. There would be variants: maybe Phil Plait is right, and advanced alien civilization will discard biology and advance in machine mode; it may also turn out that it is easier to modify biology than planets, so my bioprobes will produce radically gene-engineered humans who don't look much like us anymore in order to more rapidly take over new worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my bet would be on interplanetary biowarfare, the slow infiltration of engineered organisms to change environments for alien compatibility. The only way we&amp;#39;d be able to survive is to fight them on the same ground. Don&amp;#39;t expect alien tripods with lasers, watch out for alien viruses and bacteria turning the soil and atmosphere poisonous or unsupportive. I&amp;#39;d also side with the people who are arguing we ought to worry about aliens, if they exist — if they&amp;#39;re so advanced over us that they can travel here, they aren&amp;#39;t going to be as interested in our primitive conversations as they are in our real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think the possibility of that happening to us is unlikely. Intelligent life with grand schemes of interstellar expansion don't seem to be evident out there, or maybe there are interesting obstacles that thwart such growth that we haven't quite discovered yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I also caught an episode of &lt;a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/stephen-hawking/"&gt;Hawking's &lt;i&gt;Into the Universe&lt;/i&gt; on the Discovery Channel&lt;/a&gt;, the one on alien biology. I have to say I thought it was just awful, with no useful content and was merely a contrived excuse for the Discovery Channel to trot out more cgi of imagined weird animals. Biology is definitely not Hawking's strength. Maybe his other episodes on time travel and cosmology will be more thoughtful and interesting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/hawkings_aliens.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/X4_DWceZGx0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272384192212"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/boobquake_bombed.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7e84f95c79dacb2d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Boobquake bombed</title><published>2010-04-27T15:35:24Z</published><updated>2010-04-27T15:35:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/B5uXCtCDnIs/boobquake_bombed.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/boobquake_bombed.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/04/boobquake_bombed/jehovah_like.jpeg" width="200" height="252" alt="jehovah_like.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are in, and I'm sorry to say that &lt;a href="http://www.blaghag.com/2010/04/and-boobquake-results-are-in.html"&gt;women dressing provocatively caused no significant statistical difference in the frequency or magnitude of earthquakes&lt;/a&gt;.

Certified Nursing Assistant, then following details will provide you detailed knowledge about CNA?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;After passing of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, all states were federally mandated to both approve CNA certification training programs and maintain a list of all state-licensed or certified nurse aides.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Any nursing aide, who wants to work in hospitals, nursing homes, long term care facilities and other health centers, for providing everyday care to the patients should meet following requirements to get the certification or license to work:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements for CNA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nursing aide student should complete state and federal regulated approved CNA training program &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pass a state competency evaluation

completed CNA program in the specific state, can ask the board of health of the perspective state for the waiver of the in-state program requirements and . Any student, who has obtained &lt;a href="http://www.bestcertifiednursingassistant.com/nursing/sample-nursing-care-plan"&gt;sample nursing care plan&lt;/a&gt; from an accredited institution of higher learning, can also petition to be exempted from any additional educational requirements.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNA Training Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;All CNA Training Program should compile with state approved CNA training programs. For getting &lt;a href="http://www.bestcertifiednursingassistant.com/cna/cna-certification-test"&gt;CNA certification test&lt;/a&gt; , a nursing student should meet below given education standard:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complete state approved classroom learning and training&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clinical trainings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.bestcertifiednursingassistant.com/red-cross/red-cross-cna-classes-option"&gt;Red Cross CNA classes&lt;/a&gt; learning includes nursing basic skills, which include: Medical ethics, Emergency care, Nursing care, Infection control, Rehabilitation and Residents' rights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The classroom learning are prior to clinical trainings and students are prevented from getting in touch with actual patients, After completion of classroom learning component, the students, during clinical training gets the opportunity to work with patients in long term care units. All aspect of training is performed under the strict supervision of certified or licensed nurse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;CNA training programs are offered in community colleges, high schools, community centers, adult learning institutes, and long-term care facilities where nursing aide is employed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;After successful completion of CNA training programs and passing of competency evaluation test, a CNA gets the certification and is placed on official registry of the specific state and can work legally in hospitals, nursing homes and long term care units.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7879767-625071343125873848?l=amr2you.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Anne)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://amr2you.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://amr2you.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">G-News!</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://amr2you.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272381748928"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/what_does_an_illegal_immigrant.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dd2b0c6450d70041</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Race and Racism"/><title type="html">What does an illegal immigrant look like?</title><published>2010-04-27T16:17:20Z</published><updated>2010-04-27T16:17:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/Ckh8xDNbU-8/what_does_an_illegal_immigrant.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/what_does_an_illegal_immigrant.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Republicans Scuttle Climate Change, Immigration Reform, and Their  Own Credibility. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And yikes, it’s simply mind-smackingly mind smacking. Behold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1007a/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/hst_20th_carina.jpg" alt="hst_20th_carina" title="hst_20th_carina" width="610" height="561"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ye gods.&lt;/strong&gt; Click to get access to massively embiggened versions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a stunning close-up of a section of the vast Carina Nebula, a sprawling and complex Escher-like region of gas and dust about 7500 light years away. It’s the scene of chaotic star birth and death, slammed and reslammed by winds from stars being born and others busy blowing up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this image — which is &lt;em&gt;only a part of &lt;a href="http://download.esa.int/images/hubble/heic1007e_H1.jpg"&gt;the full view of this magnificent vista&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; — the tentacles of dust tower light-years in length, and at the tips of those fingers are stars that are just now forming. The material around them is thicker than what surrounds it, and can partially withstand the onslaught of subatomic particles and fierce ultraviolet being blasted about by hot, young, massive stars nearby, off the top of the image. This wind and light blow away the lighter material, leaving behind these structures that are essentially sandbars in space, material protected by the denser gas and dust at the tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All along the sides of the towers you can see streamers of material, filleted tenuous wisps that appear to be flowing from the towers themselves. But, in fact, this is matter flooding &lt;em&gt;past&lt;/em&gt; the towers, gas slamming into and screaming around them. Look around the image and you can see the shock waves, the tremendous forces at play here. To give you a grasp of this, &lt;em&gt;the battle ground for this action is tens of trillions of kilometers across, and the material is moving at a million kilometers per hour&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is sculpting on a scale that would make Zeus cower in fear. But Nature does it as a matter of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the forces at work here are capable of beauty and incredible detail. For example, cast your eyes upon this feature located at the tip of the uppermost trunk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/hst_20th_carina_detail.jpg" alt="hst_20th_carina_detail" title="hst_20th_carina_detail" width="610" height="371"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite part of the image, and not just because it looks like an angry gray alien (though admittedly that does add a bit of cool). The reason I love it (and the other one located at the tip of the fatter tower to the lower left) are the twin beams of material coming out of either side of it. Those jets of matter are caused by the forming star at the center; the star is being born in the center of a flattened disk called an &lt;em&gt;accretion disk&lt;/em&gt;. Complex magnetic fields are at play here, and they cause the gas in the disk to be propelled away, up and out from the star’s poles, at high speed. Note the beautiful sculpted shock wave at the left end of the jet as it plows into the dense material in the nebula itself. We see lots of these paired jets — called &lt;em&gt;Herbig-Haro Objects&lt;/em&gt; — and they mark the positions of new stars. Our Sun may have looked a lot like this about 4.6 billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s take a step back. Here’s a fascinating look at this scene, &lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1007b/"&gt;comparing the view in visible light to that of infrared&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1007b/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/hst_20th_carina_vis_ir.jpg" alt="hst_20th_carina_vis_ir" title="hst_20th_carina_vis_ir" width="610" height="428"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that in the left (visible) image, you don’t see very many stars. The dust is thick in Carina, and that blocks the light from the stars. But in the IR (right), the light can pass through the dust and we see many more stars. A lot of the detail in the towers disappears because the pillars are transparent in IR, so we lose that part of the picture. In the visible, the colors represent light from glowing oxygen (blue), hydrogen and nitrogen (green), and sulfur (red). These are not necessarily the most abundant elements in the gas (well, hydrogen is), but they tend to glow the brightest and are easiest to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is more than just (just! ha!) a beautiful image. The multi-color versions of it tell us the temperature, the density, and the elemental composition of the gas and dust as well. By examining clouds like this one, we learn about the vast and subtle processes that take place when stars are born en masse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much to see here that I could go on for quite some time about it. But I think I’ll just leave it here. Go and download the hi-res versions of these images and simply play with them. Have fun, and keep in mind that what you are seeing here was unimaginable just a few decades ago. The things we can do now…&lt;/p&gt;

Our lecturer, &lt;a href="http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/staff/jharvey.htm"&gt;Jeremy Harvey&lt;/a&gt;, was honest to an amusing fault about what we might gain from the course from the outset. He started by listing three reasons he had been able to come up with, why philosophy might be useful to us as scientists – and then succinctly explained why, actually, he had decided they weren’t good reasons after all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. A knowledge of philosophy might make us more effective scientists; in thinking about ‘the big picture’ we might get a more realistic view of the questions we’re seeking to answer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bumps and bruises of childhood can’t always be avoided, but there is no reason for children to suffer from infectious diseases that can be prevented by vaccines. Polio, measles, diphtheria, whooping cough (pertussis) and other illnesses are often thought of as diseases of past generations. While today’s parents may not have experienced  these diseases, the germs still exist – and these diseases can re-emerge – if parents don’t vaccinate their children. To remind parents about the importance of childhood immunizations, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has launched a new educational awareness campaign called Protect Tomorrow during National Infant Immunization Week, April 24-May 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protect Tomorrow reminds us of the terrible diseases of the past, and teaches parents that vaccines protect infants and children from infectious diseases that can lead to hospitalization, disability and even death. The campaign encourages parents to talk with their pediatrician about the benefits of vaccines, the importance of the recommended immunization schedule and how best to protect their child’s health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the vast body of evidence that shows the public health benefits of vaccines, a vocal minority of anti-vaccine activists is needlessly frightening the public, and putting children at risk. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) annual National Immunization Survey, nearly one-quarter of children in the U.S. between the ages of 19 and 35 months did not receive the recommended series of childhood vaccines in 2008, the last year for which this data is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our goal for the campaign is to urge parents to get their children vaccinated today so they can have a healthy tomorrow,” said pediatrician Alanna Levine, MD, FAAP. “Each year, the recommended immunization schedule is reviewed and published by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Family Physicians. It is critical that parents talk with their pediatricians and ensure their children are up-to-date with vaccinations so that children are protected and history does not repeat itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core components of the educational campaign are TV and radio public service announcements that recall the devastation of diseases that can now be largely prevented by vaccines. To complement the PSAs, there are resources available online at &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/www.ProtectTomorrow.org"&gt;www.ProtectTomorrow.org&lt;/a&gt;, including vignettes featuring three individuals from the TV PSA recounting their personal experiences with these diseases. Those who log on can also access complete information about vaccines, including the recommended immunization schedule. The Protect Tomorrow Web site launches April 27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Protect Tomorrow campaign is a public health service of the American Academy of Pediatrics with support provided by Sanofi Pasteur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t tapped out on environmental content post-Earth Week, you may want to check out these videos about the unending debate over tap water versus bottled water, which &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/feel/tap-water-vs-bottled-water-whats-safer-and-healthier-115/"&gt;we previously posted about&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentary film &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tappedthefilm.com/"&gt;Tapped&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; claims that – thanks to one of the greatest marketing ploys of all time – we use approximately 18 million barrels of oil to transport water every year. And the H20 might not even be that safe. Great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another YouTube hit, &lt;em&gt;The Story of Bottled Water&lt;/em&gt;, claims “carrying bottled water is on its way to being as cool as smoking while pregnant”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/homestyle/04/22/blacklash.bottled.water/"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; reported that this video has received more than 500,000 views since launching last month, and not surprisingly, ticked off the International Bottled Water Association. But so far Americans are still hitting the bottle – we buy more than 500 million bottles of the clear stuff every week.&lt;/p&gt;

What life has done is taken useful functional elements that were worked out in the teeming, diverse gene pools of the dominant single-celled forms of life on earth and repurposed it in novel ways. The really interesting big bang of life occurred long before the Cambrian, as organisms evolved useful tools for signaling, adhesion, regulation, and so forth — all stuff that was incredibly useful for a single cell negotiating through space and time in a complex external environment, and which could be coopted for building multicellular organisms.&lt;/p&gt;

Consequently, they were asked to rate their enjoyment of the music, and in a later stage, to recall excerpts and descriptions. What would you expect the results were?The results show a significant negative effect of description, suggesting that prefacing an excerpt with a text description reduces enjoyment of the music. In the end Margulis gently summarizes the findings as ‘conceptualizing listening by connecting it to linguistically named correlates (a practice fundamental to music training) may have more multifarious (and not always straightforwardly beneficial) effects on musical experience than commonly assumed.’ Yet another case that ‘to know more’ is not always ‘to hear more’.

His great cause, the philanthropic purpose he'd like to be remembered for, is propping up the quackery of homeopathy and other such nonsensical therapies. And now &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/apr/26/prince-charles-aide-homeopathy-charity-arrested"&gt;one of his aides in this misguided impulse has been arrested for fraud&lt;/a&gt;. How appropriate. I doubt that Charles has done any embezzling — British royalty are rich enough that it would be superfluous — but it&amp;#39;s a shame that he won&amp;#39;t be arrested for the greater harm he has perpetrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any system of hereditary transfer of leadership is going to be afflicted with the unfortunate vagaries of chance, compounded by the distortion of traditional privilege. Why the British continue to put up with this nonsense is a mystery…maybe one virtue of ninnies like Charles is that when an obvious fool sits on the throne, people will come to their senses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Nah, that won&amp;#39;t happen. We had a couple of palpable incompetents running the US for a while — Reagan and Bush the Younger — and we&amp;#39;ve still got people revering them.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/the_monarchy_is_reduced_to_thi.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/1xXy1Ls6ciQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272376203853"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/republicans_petty_and_stupid.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d08b2b2177a70b5d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">Republicans: petty and stupid</title><published>2010-04-27T13:10:24Z</published><updated>2010-04-27T13:10:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/_e1rrW8zRv8/republicans_petty_and_stupid.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/republicans_petty_and_stupid.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I linked to an &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/shall_we_mess_up_a_local_repub.php"&gt;offensive poll by Minnesota Republicans in district 42&lt;/a&gt; (that's one of the Minneapolis suburbs, by the way). My readers marched in, voted against their support for Arizona's racial-profiling, anti-immigrant law, and completely skewed the results to be against the desired Republican outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens often enough; the point is that these kinds of internet polls do not reliably produce accurate results, and it's easy to twist a poll in a contrary way. Most often these polls are put up as a kind of exercise in self-affirmation, because, for instance, very few non-Republicans read the SD42 Republican web site, and what we do is subvert that backpatting purpose of the poll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What typically happens then is that eventually the poll is archived or closed, and everybody moves on. It's a freakin' &lt;i&gt;internet poll&lt;/i&gt;, you know — it&amp;#39;s inconsequential. Only…the Republicans of SD42 just can&amp;#39;t let it go. It&amp;#39;s apparently very important to them that they preserve their illusion that their readers support their policies in every possible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what did they do? Multiple resets of the poll, throwing out all of the votes — for a while, they were resetting it every 10 minutes. Attempts to lock the poll: they&amp;#39;d let votes accumulate for a few minutes from a fresh start, and as soon as their side showed a slight edge, freeze it there (some of the readers here discovered an alternate path to the polling service and worked their way around it). Rewriting the answers, first to remove the stereotypical language, then to reverse the sense of the answers (we were not fooled), and now…and &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sd42gop.com/"&gt;look at what they've done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you believe in enforcing our nation's immigration laws?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. An orderly immigration policy is essential to maintaining a free society. &lt;br&gt;Yes. And that is why I support Arizona's immigration law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is amazingly pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I declare this pharyngulation a total victory, the most complete demolition of a poll that we have ever accomplished. They are in a shambles, reduced to displaying meaningless noise that doesn't even have a pretense of giving voters a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if these clowns were actually running our real world election system…oh, wait. They are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/republicans_petty_and_stupid.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/_e1rrW8zRv8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272376062672"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=176045">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/33130137cd8f0235</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="breast cancer"/><category term="cancer"/><category term="lung cancer"/><category term="Mary Horrigan Connors Center For Women’s Health and Gender Biology"/><title type="html">Lung Cancer Smoke Signals: Women Still at High Risk</title><published>2010-04-27T13:03:02Z</published><updated>2010-04-27T13:03:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/lung-cancer-smoke-signals-women-still-at-high-risk/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/cigarettes.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Smoking Addiction" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/cigarettes-300x273.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="273"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new report features some scary stats about lung cancer, which is the leading cause of death among both men and women. Check this out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women, killing more women each year than breast and all gynecological cancers combined. Every day, nearly 300 women will be diagnosed with  lung cancer and  about 200 women will die of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lung cancer incidence in women has  increased six-fold over the past 30 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twenty  percent of women diagnosed with lung cancer today have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; smoked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Report conducted by the &lt;a href="http://www.lungcanceralliance.org/shadows/speak_out.html"&gt;Mary Horrigan Connors Center For Women’s Health and Gender Biology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Our lecturer, &lt;a href="http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/staff/jharvey.htm"&gt;Jeremy Harvey&lt;/a&gt;, was honest to an amusing fault about what we might gain from the course from the outset. He started by listing three reasons he had been able to come up with, why philosophy might be useful to us as scientists – and then succinctly explained why, actually, he had decided they weren’t good reasons after all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. A knowledge of philosophy might make us more effective scientists; in thinking about ‘the big picture’ we might get a more realistic view of the questions we’re seeking to answer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two spectacular new hominid fossils found in a cave at Malapa in South Africa in 2008 and 2009 have been assigned to a new species, &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus sediba&lt;/em&gt; (‘sediba’ means ‘wellspring’ in the local seSotho language). Discovered by a team led by Lee Berger and Paul Dirks, it is claimed by them to be the best candidate yet for an immediate ancestor to the genus &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;. The fossils are between 1.78 and 1.95 million years old, about the same date of the oldest &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt; fossils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first fossil, MH1, found by Lee Berger’s son Matthew, is an almost complete skull and partial skeleton of an 11 to 12 year old boy. The 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; fossil, MH2, is a partial skeleton of an adult female, including some jaw fragments. The boy’s brain has a typical australopithecine size of 420cc, compared to the smallest &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; brain of 510cc. Both skeletons are small, about 130cm (4’3”) tall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Au. sediba&lt;/em&gt; is most similar to, and quite likely descended from, &lt;em&gt;Au. africanus&lt;/em&gt;. The upper limbs are long, and similar to other australopithecines. Many features of the hip, knee and ankle bones show it was bipedal, like other australopithecines, but the foot bones are still quite primitive. However Berger et al. list many other features of the skull, teeth, and pelvis in which it resembles early &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; fossils. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discoverers have suggested that &lt;em&gt;Au. sediba&lt;/em&gt; might be ancestral to either &lt;em&gt;Homo habilis&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Homo rudolfensis&lt;/em&gt;, or that it might be a closely related sister group to &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; - not a direct ancestor, but a close cousin. As the authors admit, these two individuals existed after the earliest known &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; fossils (at about 2.3 million years), so they can’t be human ancestors. However, it’s possible that the &lt;em&gt;sediba&lt;/em&gt; species had already existed for a few hundred thousand years and that early members of it could have been human ancestors.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, prominent scientists quoted in the media have split fairly evenly on the question of whether &lt;em&gt;sediba&lt;/em&gt; should have been assigned to &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; - Bill Kimbel, Don Johanson, Susan Anton and Colin Groves went for &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;, while Meave Leakey, Tim White and Ron Clarke didn’t. Some scientists have even suggested that it may be a late-surviving variant of &lt;em&gt;Au. africanus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the authors argued that the overall body plan was australopithecine, and hence put it in that genus. This seems to be the conservative and safest plan; even if they are right in their claims about &lt;em&gt;sediba&lt;/em&gt;, the fossils do not seem out of place in &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt;, whereas putting them in &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; would have run the risk of needing to reclassify them later if they did not turn out to be very closely related to &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;. It would also, as Chris Stringer pointed out in an interview, require “a major redefinition” of the genus &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, it’s an important discovery even though we don’t yet know exactly how it fits into the family tree and what it means for human origins. Refreshingly, the discoverers have been fairly restrained in their claims about the fossil, and are keeping other options in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creationist organization Answers in Genesis &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2010/04/10/news-to-note-04102010#one" rel="external "&gt;has already taken note of the fossil&lt;/a&gt;. One might have expected that such small, and small-brained, fossils would be dismissed as apes. A few years ago, I’m sure AIG would have done so unhesitatingly. But AIG has strongly backed the idea that the similarly-sized &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/flores.html" rel="external "&gt;Hobbit from Flores&lt;/a&gt; is a pathological human. Because of that, and probably also because some scientists have said &lt;em&gt;Au. sediba&lt;/em&gt; should have been classified as &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;, AIG was surprisingly cautious. After referring to a quote by Berger that the small brain size of &lt;em&gt;sediba&lt;/em&gt; (an australopithecine feature) is similar to that of the Flores Hobbit, AIG says that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Berger’s comment suggests the &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus sediba&lt;/em&gt; fossils may in fact be misclassified &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; individuals who were fully human.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Creationists must be cautious interpreting news like this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whatever happened to &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/4113.asp" rel="external "&gt;this earlier claim by AIG&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When complete fossils are found, they are easy to assign clearly as either ‘ape’ or human, there are only ‘ape-men’ where imagination colored by belief in evolution is applied to fragmented bits and pieces. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What happened to it is that creationists have been slapped around by reality: there are too many cases where creationists have classified fossils differently, and even cases of creationists changing their mind about some fossils. In spite of having an almost complete skull of &lt;em&gt;sediba&lt;/em&gt;, AIG &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; can’t decide whether it’s an ape or a human. If they can’t tell if it’s an ape or a human, they obviously can’t rule out the possibility that it is an intermediate. The fact that they can’t tell is strong evidence that it is intermediate, because modern apes and humans are extremely easy to distinguish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Thomas of the Institute for Creation Research &lt;a href="http://www.icr.org/article/5346/" rel="external "&gt;has also written about &lt;em&gt;sediba&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike AIG however, ICR had no hesitation in calling it an ape. Thomas even disputes the claim that &lt;em&gt;sediba&lt;/em&gt; was bipedal, saying
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… in neither &lt;em&gt;A. ramidus&lt;/em&gt;’ nor &lt;em&gt;Au sediba&lt;/em&gt;‘s remains were found the relevant hip bones to even make such a determination!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Odd. MH1 has a good specimen of the os coxa bone, more commonly known as “the hip bone”, which is, funnily enough, the “relevant hip bone” for diagnosing locomotion. And let’s not forget that Berger et al. said that the hip, knee and ankle bones all show evidence of bipedality. I think the experts have a bit more credibility here than the ICR’s science writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last gripe: it was depressing to see how many newspaper headlines used the term “missing link”. It’s a misleading and meaningless term, as &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2250212/pagenum/all/" rel="external "&gt;Carl Zimmer explains well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

He starts off with a horrid straw man quoted from Jeremy Rifkin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific observer is never a participant in the reality he or she  observes, but only a voyeur.  As for the world he or she observes, it is  a cold, uncaring place, devoid of awe, compassion or sense of purpose.   Even life itself is made lifeless to better dissect its component  parts.  We are left with a purely material world, which is quantifiable  but without quality … The scientific method is at odds with virtually  everything we know about our own nature and the nature of the world.  It  denies the relational aspect of reality, prohibits participation and  makes no room for empathic imagination.  Students in effect are asked to  become aliens in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a Hollywood level cardboard stereotype. It certainly does not resemble what I have experienced as science or scientists. Without getting too much into this side point, Rifkin himself is a controversial figure in the scientific world. He is an economist, not a scientist, and just to give you a flavor of his reputation, Stephen J. Gould once wrote about his work that it was, “a cleverly constructed tract of anti-intellectual propaganda  masquerading as scholarship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dossey, however, takes Rifkin one better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Rifkin’s view, the way science is currently defined and taught is a  profound violation of how today’s youngsters — and an increasing number  of scientists — see the world.  Although he does not use these words,  the way kids are taught science these days constitutes a form of child  abuse.  It involves the forced infliction of a false identity.  There is  an unfortunate precedent — Native American children who were once  forced into white-run schools and forbidden to speak their native tongue  or wear native clothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right – science education is abusing children by force feeding them a world view incompatible with their nature, just like we abused Native Americans. I think I see a new Godwin’s Law in the making – making an emotional appeal to Native Americans as the symbol of Western cultural scientific abuse, or the transgressions of the artificial against the “natural.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Dossey goes on to make two legitimate points about science education, making his overall article rather incoherent. It is not clear what his premise has to do with his later points, and it seems like he was just looking for an excuse to swipe against science. He argues that the public image of science is as a lone endeavor, when in reality it is a community effort. Kids might be more attracted to science if they knew how communal it was. I agree – and have made that point before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also points out that women have yet to feel fully welcome in the world of science. Again, he is far from the first person to point this out – this is a recognized problem and is getting better and is getting attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let me get back to his premise, which was that science is cold and lifeless, whereas the real world is connected and vibrant – what hogwash. That is the kind of thing that, in my opinion, only someone largely naive to the awe and wonder of science can say. That is the attitude of someone who does not want real science, but magic, the kind of magic that makes you believe in premonitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific world view is full of awe and wonder. Understanding how truly awesome the universe is  – in its elegant complexity, its staggering beauty, and the many intricate systems of which it is comprised – gives a profound feeling of connectedness and sparks the imagination. And it has the advantage of being real – unlike, say, premonitions. Science is the study of our nature and the nature of the world – so how can it be at odds with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion the view of Rifkin and Dossey is the view of a cranky outsider – someone trying to score cheap points, but devoid of any true experience or insight about science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also turn the criticism around – in my younger days I was enamored of ESP, alien visitation, and other pseudosciences. They were fascinating, but I could not escape a hollow feeling in that deep down I sensed that these were fantasies, not reality. I wanted to find something to latch onto, to feel that these things were real, but I never found anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I delved into a real science, like astronomy or paleontology, the experience was much more profound and satisfying, because I knew these things were real. I knew that dinosaurs actually walked a very strange landscape in our past, and that Mars was another world we would one day visit. And when I started learning about how things actually work, I felt even more connected to the world, in a satisfying way that no pseudoscience or fantasy ever provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dossey is in no position to lecture about the deficiencies of the scientific world-view. He disguises his ideological problems with science in borrowed legitimate observations, and mixes them with howling straw men that no scientist would recognize in themselves. The result is not even “a cleverly constructed tract of anti-intellectual propaganda  masquerading  as scholarship,” because no one would confuse this for scholarship. It is anti-intellectual fluff for the Huff Po, which is buried in the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272372484312"><id gr:original-id="1016 at http://layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/62e3f7fb14a4eb06</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="DPSDB" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1566"/><category term="Philosophy" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1565"/><category term="Science" scheme="http://layscience.net/science"/><title type="html">Philosophy: a tool for debunking pseudoscience?</title><published>2010-04-26T15:09:22Z</published><updated>2010-04-26T15:09:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://layscience.net/node/1016" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; Over the past few days I’ve been taking a brief but intensive graduate lecture course in the history of philosophy of science. Our lecturer, &lt;a href="http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/staff/jharvey.htm"&gt;Jeremy Harvey&lt;/a&gt;, was honest to an amusing fault about what we might gain from the course from the outset. He started by listing three reasons he had been able to come up with, why philosophy might be useful to us as scientists – and then succinctly explained why, actually, he had decided they weren’t good reasons after all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. A knowledge of philosophy might make us more effective scientists; in thinking about ‘the big picture’ we might get a more realistic view of the questions we’re seeking to answer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure most of you have heard of &lt;a href="http://www.drweil.com"&gt;Dr. Andrew Weil&lt;/a&gt;, that champion of quackademic medicine who has made it his life's mission to bring the woo into academia in the form of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/06/science_is_irrelevant_resistance_is_futi.php"&gt;training programs to "integrate" quackery&lt;/a&gt; with science-based medicine. From his home base at the University of Arizona, he spreads the woo hither and yon throughout academia, racking up big speaking fees wherever he goes and building a multimedia empire of books, DVDs, TV appearances, and Internet presence. Not satistfied, last year in the early stages of the debate over health care reform, Dr. Weil decided to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/the_three_musketeers_of_woo_meet_dartagn.php"&gt;try to influence legislation&lt;/a&gt; with Deepak Chopra and Rustum Roy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's particularly infuriating about Dr. Weil is that he is the master of obfuscation, the bait and switch. He paints himself as being all about nutrition and exercise (and who could be against that?), but he assiduously avoids telling anyone exactly what he means by "integrative medicine." Look at his &lt;a href="http://integrativemedicine.arizona.edu/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Look at the &lt;a href="http://integrativemedicine.arizona.edu/clinic/physicians.html"&gt;list of practitioners&lt;/a&gt;. Look at a &lt;a href="http://integrativemedicine.arizona.edu/clinic/index.html"&gt;description of the clinic&lt;/a&gt;. You'll be hard-pressed to find a detailed list of what modalities are actually offered at his clinic, other than vague mentions of "nutrition" or "mind-body" medicine. When it comes to "integrating" the woo with scientific medicine, mixing them up in a purée so fine that it's impossible to tell what's science-based and what's not. Knowing my low opinion of Weil, I never thought I'd be taking his side on anything, but in this case I am, albeit not enthusiastically. The reason is that Dr. Weil has met a quack that makes him seem like a paragon of hard core science-based medicine, and that quack is not happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/compared_to_robert_o_young_andrew_weil_l.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/compared_to_robert_o_young_andrew_weil_l.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/F1zaHNI2yKk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272369452842"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/augmented_twitter_a_conversati.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cd3a30a6bee11c2e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="#140conf"/><title type="html">Augmented Twitter: A Conversation with Three Futurists: #140conf (video)</title><published>2010-04-27T12:54:13Z</published><updated>2010-04-27T12:54:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/alwuf3S1bmM/augmented_twitter_a_conversati.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/augmented_twitter_a_conversati.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;FakeJerry Paffendorf (@WELLO) - Artist, futurist, entrepreneur. joshua fouts (@josholalia) - Cultural relations futurist at the crossroads of emergent media, digital diplomacy, games, virtual worlds and storytelling. &lt;br&gt;

While we’re on tenterhooks, the &lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Planck/index.html"&gt;Planck team&lt;/a&gt; has been feeding us tidbits to keep us occupied. The first was a gorgeous &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/03/17/its-a-dusty-universe-out-there/trackback/"&gt;map of the dust&lt;/a&gt;. Now they’ve released some &lt;a href="http://planck.cf.ac.uk/node/166"&gt;images of a stellar daycare&lt;/a&gt;. Planck’s key science goals have to do with mapping the CMB, which is an image from the far edge of the Universe. All the foreground stuff in between (like our galaxy, and all its dust and stars) is a nuisance, and need to be removed. Most of the Planck team would be just as happy if no stars existed at all. In that case the images of the CMB would be pristine and spectacular, and the whole mission would be a lot easier. Of course, it’d be pretty cold and lonely Universe, since there’d be no Sun, and no Earth, and no Planck team, and (shudder to think) no blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For better or worse, there are dusty regions in our galaxy, filled with newly-born stars. Planck has been specifically designed to map out these annoying foregrounds, so as to be able to remove them from its images. The trick is that stars generally form in these regions, because it is precisely this dust which collapses to form stars. But this same dust obscures our view of what’s happening, at least at optical wavelengths. At microwave wavelengths, one can image the dust directly, and Planck observes at multiple frequencies precisely to do this. It makes detailed maps of stars and dust, just to subtract them off. But in the process, we get these lovely pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/04/Orion_30-353-857_combined_rgb.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/04/Orion_30-353-857_combined_rgb-300x225.jpg" alt="Planck&amp;#39;s view of Orion" title="Planck&amp;#39;s view of Orion" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The image is of Orion. The right panel is a composite image, while the left shows the three individual color bands: red corresponds to synchrotron emission from hot electrons in our galaxy’s magnetic field, green corresponds to hot gas (presumably heated by the stars), and blue corresponds to cold gas (this is the stuff that collapses into stars). The giant red circle in the image is from a star which exploded roughly 2 million years ago, and blew out its surrounding dust (inhibiting further star formation in that region). We’re seeing the aftermath of the birth (and death) of a star! The details of how stars are born, live, and die are pressing astrophysical questions, and these images show us the process as it unfolds. Whatever. Enough with the distractions. Planck has now imaged the entire sky in at least three frequency bands, and it looks like the data is good. Hopefully the full-sky CMB maps aren’t too far behind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What do Christians do or say that frustrates you?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few examples of what I have in mind: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bait-and-switch: Where they become your “friend,” but really, they just want to convert you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not speaking out against other Christians who do really crazy things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume that everyone who isn’t a Christian is “lost” or needs “saving”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s for a project I’m working on.  Your short answers (with elaboration if you’d like) would be very helpful.  Thanks!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Woodville North man Ian Jolly, 57, was barred from dining at Grange restaurant Thai Spice in May last year after a staff member mistook his guide dog Nudge for a "gay dog", the tribunal heard this week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;A statement given by restaurant owners Hong Hoa Thi To and Anh Hoang Le said one of the waiters had understood Mr Jolly's partner Chris Lawrence "to be saying she wanted to bring a gay dog into the restaurant".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"The staff genuinely believed that Nudge was an ordinary pet dog which had been desexed to become a gay dog," the statement said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Mr Jolly and Ms Lawrence were refused entry to the restaurant - which displays a "guide dogs welcome" sign - even after providing staff with a guide dogs fact card.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This being Language Log rather than Endocrinology Log, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=site%3Alanguagelog.ldc.upenn.edu%2Fnll+testosterone&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;gs_rfai="&gt;for the most part anyhow&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#39;ll pass over in silence the hormonal misunderstanding, and focus on the phonetic one. And let&amp;#39;s grant that in casual speech, the difference between one and two /d/ segments — as in, say, &amp;quot;guide dog&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;guy dog&amp;quot; — is likely to fade away. But what about the vowel difference between &lt;em&gt;guide&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;gay&lt;/em&gt;? Shouldn't that have been a clue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in Adelaide, maybe not so much. Like the vowel in &lt;em&gt;gay&lt;/em&gt;, the main-stressed vowel in &lt;em&gt;Australian&lt;/em&gt; is a member of the FACE &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_set"&gt;lexical set&lt;/a&gt;; and the fact that &lt;em&gt;Australian&lt;/em&gt; is jocularly rendered as "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strine"&gt;Strine&lt;/a&gt;" tells you something about the fate of this vowel down under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those skilled in the art, a more quantitative version of this story is told by Figure 6 from Felicity Cox, "&lt;a href="http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/about/staff/cox_felicity/Cox_inpress.pdf"&gt;The acoustic characteristics of /hVd/ vowels in the speech of some Australian teenagers&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Australian Journal of Linguistics&lt;/em&gt; 2006:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CoxFig6.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CoxFig6.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;Fig. 6: The time normalised average formant trajectory diagrams for /eɪ/ superimposed onto the monophthong vowel spaces for females and males&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this figure shows is that the vowel in &lt;em&gt;hayed&lt;/em&gt; starts right at the bottom of the vowel space, with the most open available vowel sound, and ends with the highest, frontest available vowel sound. For us speakers of American English, in the northern states at least, the "long i" sound of the vowel in &lt;em&gt;hide&lt;/em&gt; is the best approximation of this in our normal vowel inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However,  my &lt;em&gt;hide&lt;/em&gt; vowel generally starts somewhat backer and ends quite a bit lower — and so, in general, does the Australian variety, according to Cox&amp;#39;s Figure 7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CoxFig7.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CoxFig7.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;Fig. 7: The time normalised average formant trajectory diagrams for  /aɪ/ superimposed onto the monophthong vowel spaces for females and males.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for speakers of Australian English, &amp;quot;guide dog&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;gay dog&amp;quot; do have different vowels in the first syllable — &lt;em&gt;lace&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;lice&lt;/em&gt; are not actually homophones — but these two diphthongs are much more similar than they would be in varieties of English where the FACE vowel is pronounced  [ei].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[See  &lt;a href="http://clas.mq.edu.au/voices/"&gt;Australian Voices&lt;/a&gt;, or Robert Mannell's page "&lt;a href="http://clas.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/ausenglish/"&gt;The Vowels of Australian English&lt;/a&gt;", for more information. Based on those pages, and on the charts in Jonathan Harrington et al., "&lt;a href="http://clas.mq.edu.au/felicity/Papers/Harrington1997.pdf"&gt;An acoustic phonetic study of broad, general, and cultivated Australian English vowels&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Australian Journal of Linguistics&lt;/em&gt; 1997, I believe that the basic patterns discussed above are fairly general characteristics of Australian English, not limited to the teenagers studied in Cox 2006.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the names of the restaurant owners, it seems possible that the staff involved in this misunderstanding were not native speakers of Australian English, or at least not of the same variety as the affected customers. In particular, the staff may have responded to the local variety of English by systematically collapsing the FACE vowel with the PRICE vowel, so that they have the same phonetic expectations for e.g.&lt;em&gt; raid &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;ride&lt;/em&gt;. For those of us whose FACE and PRICE vowels are very different, this merger is unexpected.  But there's a similar case that's a cross-linguistic stereotype:  many native speakers of languages with simpler vowel inventories tend to collapse the English KIT and FLEECE sets, so that they don't reliably distinguish between (say) &lt;em&gt;hid&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;heed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272362487879"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=3214">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/93fdb81cdae3f755</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Science"/><category term="book review"/><category term="Embiggen Books"/><category term="encyclopedia"/><category term="pop culture"/><title type="html">This Is The Book that Jacqueline Susann Wanted To Write</title><published>2010-04-27T07:39:55Z</published><updated>2010-04-27T07:39:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/-8pfSrrAuXA/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/2010/04/this-is-the-book-that-jacqueline-susann-wanted-to-write/"/><content xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://embiggenbooks.com/review/product/list/id/12075/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Picture-81.png" alt="" width="363" height="169"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://embiggenbooks.com/review/product/list/id/12075/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Submitted for Embiggen Books&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trouble is, I’ve cleaned up my office over the weekend but I know I have a copy of ‘&lt;strong&gt;Science: The Definitive Visual Guide&lt;/strong&gt;‘, edited by Adam Hart-Davis, somewhere in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovely surprise, this book – &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/competition_time/"&gt;I won it in a competition&lt;/a&gt; for making a quirky comment about inventions for one of the ScienceBlogs. Highly recommended. Unique. Put it somewhere safe. Very careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere tidy and safe. Huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big thing, nice hardcover, slippery slipcase that may or may not have the corpse-smudge of a particularly determined wasp that wanted my coffee. Really solid design, a ‘one-hit wonder’ that’s for sure. It’s probably on a bookcase. In one of the bookshelves, I suspect. Maybe it’s on the top shelf?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’ll be here somewhere. Be right with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can’t go wrong with a title like ‘&lt;em&gt;Science!&lt;/em&gt;‘ though. &lt;a href="http://www.skepticality.com"&gt;Say it out loud, just like the way Derek Colanduno does!&lt;/a&gt; I mean, what’s not to love about that? ‘&lt;em&gt;Definitive Visual Guide&lt;/em&gt;‘, to boot. The kind of text that you used to splay out on the floor with when you were a kid, completely engrossed with tracing a jammy finger around the illuminated tracks of of the solar system, until you could recite all the planets in several galaxies in alphabetical order and irritate the heck out of your primary-school teachers by correcting them about Pluto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of book you used to spend hours on a Sunday, slowly opening up to the picture of the preying mantis and slamming it shut with a satisfying bang and squeal. Sure, I still do that today with my laptop, but it’s hell on the hinges. Maybe I left it under the coffee table?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I could say that choosing to anthropomorphise Science as a wide-eyed ingénue, fresh off the boat from the plains of Idaho, embarking on a career that brings her to the dizzying heights of fame and fortune before her eventual self-destruction at the hands of a heartless Hollywood movie-machine, was a move of heart-stopping genius. I’d even say it’s one that sets Hart-Davis’s editing apart from all the other illustrated Science encyclopedias out there. But then you’d just know that it’s not in the lounge-room either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned more about the wretched early years of germ-warfare, 21st-century climate solution debates and the ongoing quest for a unified field theory than any episode of ‘Stargate Universe’ (even the episode where Brian J. Smith took his shirt off, which I’ve watched numerous times, in half-speed). The reference section at the back is not only an easy-guide to the equations on which science is built, it also forms the basis of a wide range of in-joke tattoo designs for particle physicists world-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clear and informative sections on quantum physics and the internet, with full-colour behind-the-scenes snaps of lab-coated Roger Daltrey sucking the life out of his victims with a syringe, is amongst some of the best writing that television-maven Tracy R.

He argues that “New Atheism” is a passing fad. Here’s a taste of the kind of intellectually black hole found within:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take, for instance, the recently published &lt;em&gt;50 Voices of Disbelief:  Why We Are Atheists&lt;/em&gt;. Simple probability, surely, would seem to  dictate that a collection of essays by fifty fairly intelligent and  zealous atheists would contain at least one logically compelling, deeply  informed, morally profound, or conceptually arresting argument for not  believing in God. Certainly that was my hope in picking it up. Instead, I  came away from the whole drab assemblage of preachments and preenings  feeling rather as if I had just left a large banquet at which I had been  made to dine entirely on crushed ice and water vapor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um, have you ever considered that their goal wasn’t to provide you with “at least one logically compelling, deeply  informed, morally profound,  or conceptually arresting argument for not  believing in God”? That would be shifting the burden of proof, which is on the theist to prove their particular tribal god exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I could spend all day on this article but since &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/that_hollow_ring_that_tired_ob.php"&gt;PZ Myers already did that&lt;/a&gt;, I’d rather just focus on this idea that the popularity of atheism is just a fad. Let’s look at some statistics, shall we? Current polls show that the self-identificed religiously unaffiliated in the U.S. are at 16%, which is pretty much double what it was in the early 90′s. Now let’s look at &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/192583"&gt;another recent poll&lt;/a&gt;. Christianity has declined by 10% in the U.S. over the past two decades. How about a poll from this month that shows 26% of Millennials (those born after 1980) are religiously unaffiliated, compared to 20% of Gen Xers and 13% of Baby Boomers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the rate of religiously unaffiliated continues to rise at a similar rate as it has for at least 70 years, we can expect to see a third of the next generation following the Millennials to be religiously unaffiliated. A fad, Mr. Hart? No, there seems to be a very consistent pattern here that rather perfectly correlates with progressing media technology.&lt;/p&gt;

This came up on a different thread.  Although it is possible to make a fake stage act that involves what looks like knife throwing, that is actually fairly rare.  It is easier to learn to throw the knife than to make a contraption that would actually fool today's skeptical audiences. &lt;/p&gt;

They got my name from Stephen Barrett of Quackwatch and asked if I could speak about questionable weight loss treatments like HGH, MIC (methionine, inositol and choline), and the HCG Diet. I seized the opportunity to discuss how to evaluate any medical claim, with examples from alternative medicine as well as from weight loss. My title was “Questionable Evidence for Questionable Treatments.” I talked about some of the things that can go wrong in clinical trials and why simply finding reports of positive randomized controlled trials (RCT) is not enough. I advocated rigorously science-based medicine and recommended the SBM website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several people came up afterwards to express their thanks and their agreement, but some of the questions from the audience were rather hostile. One man said he was a military doctor and he was using and teaching acupuncture (which I had criticized as a bad example of &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/toothfairyscience.html"&gt;“tooth fairy science”&lt;/a&gt;  in my talk). I asked for his opinion of battlefield acupuncture and he just said “No comment.” A couple of people thought science wasn’t enough and thought it was okay to prescribe questionable treatments when there was no proven effective treatment. I responded that I had no objection as long as the patient was told the facts and not given the false impression that the questionable treatment had been tested and shown to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was glad for the chance to meet some of the ASBP members. I had never met a bariatric physician and was interested to learn about their practices and philosophies. I had never really thought about the fact that most obese patients had associated diseases like hypertension and diabetes, so their overall management could be very complex. I attended the whole obesity course: some of what I heard was educational, some of it was questionable, and some of it was frankly disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first speaker was Gary Taubes, author of &lt;em&gt;Good Calories, Bad Calories&lt;/em&gt;. I had read his book and agreed with his evaluation of the dietary fat hypothesis, but I was not entirely convinced that he had enough clinically significant evidence to justify replacing it with the carbohydrate hypothesis. In this talk, based on his forthcoming book, he focused on the history of the case against sugar. It was refreshing to hear him say that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until demonstrated otherwise, high fructose corn syrup is just another form of sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A researcher, John Baxter, MD, discussed new drugs based on thyroid hormone that attempt to separate its beneficial effects on atherosclerosis and obesity from its harmful side effects. Interesting, but still in a very preliminary research stage. He went on to complain about the impediments to approving new drugs. In his opinion, the studies the FDA requires are intended to look for risks rather than benefits. He defended the “file drawer” practice, saying that his group did not publish negative trials that didn’t get the results they wanted (perhaps because the experimental design was flawed), since that would “&lt;strong&gt;pollute the literature”&lt;/strong&gt; (?!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vernon Neppe spoke on nutritional supplementation and biopsychosocial issues. He said that supplements are drugs, they may be dangerous, manufacturing controls are poor, evidence is lacking, pharmacology is complex, interactions are common, there is evidence favoring vitamin D and fish oil supplements but questions remain, and generally food is better than pills. And he addressed the “natural” fallacy by pointing out that snake venom was natural. I was impressed by his common sense and was amazed by his alphabet soup of credentials: I don’t remember ever seeing anyone with more initials after his name. He listed 14 titles: MD, PhD, FRSSAf, DFAPA, DSPE, BN&amp;amp;NP, FRCPC, DABPN, FFPsych, MMed, DPsM, MB, BCh. I only know what the first two mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kendall Gerdes spoke on food allergy and food addiction, a talk deserving a post just for itself. I’ll cover it next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Robert Lerman recommended omega-3 supplementation for bariatric patients because of its anti-inflammatory, insulin sensitizing, CVD risk-reducing effects and other potential benefits. He made a good theoretical case, but didn’t have any real evidence showing clinical benefit. He cited one study that reported higher &lt;em&gt;maximum&lt;/em&gt; weight losses with fish and fish oil supplements than with placebo but did not report the average weight loss or the statistical significance. Without that information, I thought it was too meaningless to bother mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Barbara Schneidman reported on hot button issues for state medical boards. Some boards have restricted the use of “weight loss enhancers” to patients with a BMI over 30, and have prohibited using Schedule II drugs for the purposes of weight loss. Audience members thought this was unwise, that doctors should have the freedom to prescribe according to their own clinical judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Bland, PhD spoke on “Beyond the Dogma of the Calorie.” Maybe it’s not that excess calories cause obesity which then causes diabetes, but rather that some underlying mechanism causes both obesity and diabetes. He pointed out that after bariatric surgery the blood glucose and lipid levels fall faster than the weight. He blames an interaction between genetics and the environment that he thinks involves “Larmarckian” inheritance (that’s his synonym for epigenetics). He implicates the gut microbiome as both causing and resulting from obesity. Some of the slides he didn’t get to (but that were included in the syllabus) covered resveratrol and claimed that specific dietary phytochemicals play a role in obesity and metabolic diseases. For what it’s worth, &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/bland.html"&gt;Dr. Bland is featured on Quackwatch&lt;/a&gt;.  He has been in trouble with the FTC and the FDA for making unsubstantiated claims about supplements sold by his companies. He believes in detoxification and is a notorious promoter of naturopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were informative talks about managing childhood obesity and about pre- and post-op care for bariatric surgery. A talk on the Mediterranean diet covered a number of evidence-based health benefits, but did not explain why the speaker advocates a “modified” Mediterranean diet supplemented with protein powder, chromium, lipoic acid, and cinnamon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ASBP recently issued an official policy statement that HCG does not work for weight loss and that the HCG diet is not recommended. The last speaker on the program challenged the ASBP’s position. He claimed that the “con” studies were flawed, that more studies are needed, and that meanwhile HCG should only be used by physicians with special training and expertise (like him). One of his slides said “&lt;strong&gt;It is OK to use a placebo&lt;/strong&gt;;” he added the caveat “as long as it works.” That statement can be criticized both on the basis of the meaning of the word “placebo” and on the consensus of medical ethicists that using placebos is unethical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a room full of commercial booths. I was amazed at all the innovative ways companies had devised to profit from obesity. Most of them were giving away free samples of foods and supplements. (“You’re too fat, so let us sell you food”?) One product was a calcium citrate/vitamin D supplement disguised as a chocolate candy, with added calories. Is that a good idea? One salesman told me his products were classified as “medical foods” that were covered under a special FDA regulation. The FDA apparently doesn’t agree. They warned Dr. Bland that his similar products did not fit their regulatory definition of medical foods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…because the diseases and conditions described in the product labels do not have distinct nutritional requirements and because the products do not have any unique impact on the dietary management of those diseases and conditions beyond that which could be achieved by modification of the normal diet alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More next week.&lt;/p&gt;

Now so far it looks like it will be weighted more on the side of the medical experts despite the false balance between experts and celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what really got my attention was a video clip of the show that Orac embedded in his article. Unfortunately, I was unable to embed it here. So I will refer people to Orac’s piece (click the link above) to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What disturbs me about the mothers featured in the video (other than the complete lack of, you know, &lt;strong&gt;fathers&lt;/strong&gt; because the idea that anyone would want to hear the opinions of male parents is just madness!) is the complete inability of the mothers in the clip to recognize the blatant, inherent flaws in their own logic and their solipsistic inability to see the big picture. According to these mothers, while vaccines may benefit the health of the society as a whole, their only concern is for the welfare of their specific child and fuck everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now first of all, vaccines are the safest form of medical prevention mankind has ever produced and the benefits far outweigh the risks. So we’re dealing with a false choice here. It’s not a protect the individual versus protecting the group scenario. That’s silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem I have with their position the interviewer tries to address, though his facts are just flat-out dismissed because the women say they just don’t believe it. Apparently, reality is shaped by what these few scientifically illiterate mothers consider to be believable. Anyway, my second problem with their position is this naive false dichotomy that vaccines either work 100% or 0% without any room in between. If I were the interviewer, I’d have asked if they thought condoms were either 100% safe and effective or 0% effective. Then I’d ask them if cars crash 100% of the time or 0% of the time. Then maybe I’d hold up a yellow card and ask them whether the card is red or blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my main problem is that they’re clearly being told  in that segment the fact that whether they choose to vaccinate their kids or not does in fact affect the health and safety of others, including infants too young for the vaccines, those with specific medical conditions preventing them being vaccinated, and of course those just like the children of these women who go against their own interests by simply choosing not to vaccinate their kids when they otherwise could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we follow their logic to its inevitable conclusion, they’re encouraging other parents to be just as negligent as them, and in doing so actually INCREASE the likelihood of their own kids’ deaths. Not only are they not vaccinating their kids in the name of protecting the individual over the group while relying on the vaccinations of others to protect them, but in the process, they are encouraging fewer people to vaccinate, in effect diminishing the very herd immunity their children and others take for granted and lean on for protection. A comparable example is drunk driving.  One could apply the same flimsy arguments to the personal freedom to drive drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These women are like the Gungans from The Phantom Menace only at least the Gungans were smart enough to eventually recognize that they live in an interconnected world where sometimes what’s best for the individual is doing what’s in the best interest of the group. This is a lesson that even chimpanzees and thousands of other species on the planet have figured out, and yet these morons can’t seem to grasp the concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is they can’t see beyond themselves. What they lack is even a basic understanding of game theory.  A &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium"&gt;Nash equilibrium&lt;/a&gt; is created when the players make the best decisions they can, taking into account the decisions of the others. It’s that taking the other players’ decisions into account part that’s the important part. Now Nash’s equilibrium doesn’t necessarily guarantee every individual involved will ultimately benefit but it does improve the likelihood of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classic hypothetical used to test Nash’s equilibrium is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma"&gt;Prisoner’s Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two suspects are arrested by the police. The police have insufficient  evidence for a conviction, and, having separated both prisoners, visit  each of them to offer the same deal. If one testifies (defects from the  other) for the prosecution against the other and the other remains  silent (cooperates with the other), the betrayer goes free and the  silent accomplice receives the full 10-year sentence. If both remain  silent, both prisoners are sentenced to only six months in jail for a  minor charge. If each betrays the other, each receives a five-year  sentence. Each prisoner must choose to betray the other or to remain  silent. Each one is assured that the other would not know about the  betrayal before the end of the investigation. How should the prisoners  act?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of vaccines, it’s a little different. If everyone plays defect, the result is essentially an execution for all. This is a terrible strategy, one that could potentially kill us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variation on the Prisoner’s Dilemma is featured in the film&lt;em&gt; The Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

As the door opens, light spills across the awestruck faces of all present—and the soundtrack sweeps us forward into “Ode to Joy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was almost exactly how I felt the first time I stepped into a university library. I mean, I actually made that comparison at the time, which isn’t entirely surprising; who at 18 does not believe they’re the central character of a Hollywood movie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping through those doors, I remember almost trembling with emotions as vast as they were pretentious. It’s a feeling I expect few young people in the developed world would have today—not because kids love knowledge (or pretension) any less, but because few in the internet era are so isolated from information.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:300px"&gt;&lt;img title="Bishops_library" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Bishops_library.jpg" alt="Bishop&amp;#39;s University library" width="290" height="188"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bishop&amp;#39;s University library, c. 1993&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived on campus an atheist and a fledgling skeptic, and dramatically under-read. This wasn’t for lack of trying. In those days, it was genuinely difficult to get your hands on skeptical material: there were no podcasts, no Google, no Amazon, no blogs, no skeptical magazines on newsstands. If you couldn’t find it in your local book store, it didn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had one small taste of the skeptical literature: my well-read copy of the BC Skeptics’ thin &lt;em&gt;Rational Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; newsletter, which CSICOP Fellow Barry Beyerstein handed out after a panel at a sci-fi convention I attended in Junior High. That small outreach effort was enough to make me &lt;a href="http://blog.bcskeptics.info/?p=11"&gt;powerfully interested in skepticism&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking into the Bishop’s University library was an Ode to Joy moment, and it just kept getting better. I recall my astonishment when I realized there was an entire second story to the collection! I spent days there those first weeks. (I can still remember some of the books I discovered: Blackmore’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0879758708?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=skepticcom-20&amp;amp;%20linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0879758708"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dying to Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/051734582X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=skepticcom-20&amp;amp;%20linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=051734582X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asimov’s Guide to the Bible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and George H. Smith ’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/087975124X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=skepticcom-20&amp;amp;%20linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=087975124X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atheism: The Case Against God&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; come to mind.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the true treasure, the lamp at the end of the cave, the thing that helped set the course of my life, was hidden away in the periodical collection: a complete set of the &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skeptical Inquirer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, going back to its launch in 1976. I couldn’t believe such a wealth of skeptical research existed! I worked my way through the stack systematically, hungrily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was it. I was truly head over heels for skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Back to Basics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking of that experience a lot recently. These last weeks have been a rough ride for many skeptics, as longstanding debates about the scope and tone of skepticism have collided with the decentralized, organic nature of skepticism 2.0. I care a lot about those issues, advocating often for &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/downloads/WhereDoWeGoFromHere.pdf"&gt;a back to basics approach to skepticism&lt;/a&gt;—a traditional, science-based skepticism that solves mysteries and educates the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I thought: why not really go back to the beginning? Why not go back to my own roots as a skeptic, reading those old back issues—and back further, to the roots of the skeptical project? The Achilles heel of skepticism 2.0 may be that new skeptics are unfamiliar with the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, these last few days I’ve been losing myself in &lt;em&gt;Skeptical Inquirer&lt;/em&gt; issues from 1977 and 1978. I’m falling in love all over again. The directness of those early voices is inspiring: here were investigable mysteries, and by god, skeptics were going to solve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m learning a great deal by looking back once again at how they worked, about how things have changed and about how they haven’t. In coming posts, I’m going to dip increasingly into lessons from the early literature of skepticism. We’ve come a long way since 1976—further since the days of Houdini—but we’ve got things to learn from those who set us on this path. Let’s have another look at what those things are.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Loxton</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272348962465"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3036070768804518015.post-8471295064153387804">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1a0910936399cc78</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Monsters from the Id Converge on LA</title><published>2010-04-27T05:50:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-27T06:15:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.nap.edu/~r/x-changefiles/~3/8unbJw5aptA/monsters-from-id-converge-on-la.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/feeds/8471295064153387804/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2010/04/monsters-from-id-converge-on-la.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2010/04/monsters-from-id-converge-on-la.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/blog" type="html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/S9Z_25bpO-I/AAAAAAAAAMA/E-VfXxvse_E/s1600/F15233.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:309px;height:320px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/S9Z_25bpO-I/AAAAAAAAAMA/E-VfXxvse_E/s320/F15233.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Psst! Hey there! Yeah, you, Los Angeles-based fans of the Science &amp;amp; Entertainment Exchange! We&amp;#39;re inviting you to a special screening this Saturday, May 1, at 12 noon, of David Gargani&amp;#39;s independent documentary, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.monstersfromtheid.net"&gt;Monsters from the Id&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. It will be at the Los Feliz 3 Cinema, 1822 North Vermont Avenue -- and admission is free (for as long as seats remain available) if you RSVP before noon this Friday. (&lt;a href="http://www.theunitedfest.com/losangeles/tickets.htm"&gt;Tickets&lt;/a&gt; are $10 at the door.) It's part of the &lt;a href="http://www.theunitedfest.com/losangeles"&gt;Los Angeles United Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; taking place city-wide this weekend. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So what are you waiting for? Okay, it's tough to get out of the house before noon on a Saturday, but this is a rare chance to see &lt;i&gt;Monsters from the Id&lt;/i&gt;, which weaves the intersecting themes of over thirty classic films in order to tell the untold story of the Modern Scientist and his role in inspiring a nation. (Bonus points if you can name the classic film from which the title derives.) The film asks, "Where is science inspiration found today?" And after the film, we'll a lively, opinionated discussion about some of the issues raised, featuring input from these esteemed panelists:&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kristin Baldwin&lt;/b&gt; is an assistant professor of cell biology at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego. Her research employs cloning and stem cell technologies to understand the brain and to model neurological disease. In a recent breakthrough, her team produced mice from skin cells that they had reprogrammed backward in their development to have all the desirable characteristics of embryonic stem cells. These experiments pave the way for new therapies, such as using a patient’s own cells to grow replacement organs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kevin Hand&lt;/b&gt; is a planetary scientist and astrobiologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. His work focuses on the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the solar system, particularly the physics and chemistry of icy moons in the outer solar system. He was featured in director James Cameron’s IMAX film, &lt;i&gt;Aliens of the Deep&lt;/i&gt;, and has been highlighted on the Discovery Channel and the National Geographic Channel. Hand also founded Cosmos Education, with regional branches in the US, UK, Zambia and Kenya.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Randy Olson&lt;/b&gt; is a former marine biologist turned documentary filmmaker (&lt;i&gt;Flock of Dodos, SIZZLE!&lt;/i&gt;) and the author of &lt;i&gt;Don't Be Such a Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style&lt;/i&gt;. His short films and features have premiered at Tribeca Film Festival and Telluride Film Festival, among others. He is also director of the Shifting Baselines Ocean Media Project.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;RSVP: rloverd@nas.edu. Hope to see you there!

&lt;p&gt;In Western Australia, 55 children suffered convulsions after having the vaccination, and almost 200 others suffered fevers and vomiting, chief health officer Dr Tarun Weeramanthri said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccination programme was suspended last week when adverse reactions began to appear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health authorities are undertaking urgent tests in an effort to understand why the reactions took place. Most of the adverse reactions took place in WA, but reports are now trickling in from SA, QLD and NSW. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In NSW, one child with a fever and rash and one child with a febrile convulsion have been reported to NSW Health. Both children have now fully recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, a child aged 2 from Queensland died 12 hrs after receiving a seasonal flu vaccination, but it is not yet known if the vaccine was implicated. The coroner is investigating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State authorities are currently working together to compile the spread of the reactions to better characterise the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commonwealth’s chief medical officer, Professor Jim Bishop told ABC radio; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We’ve got to keep this in perspective. We’re looking at an increase in fever causing convulsions in a state and we’ve got to work out if that’s above the baseline.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial speculation was the vaccines may have been a bad batch but this has since been ruled this out, since multiple batches were used. CSL, the manufacturers of Fluvax, said three rival vaccines are available nationwide and that investigators have yet to discover which vaccine was given to the affected children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Bishop said this year’s batch includes swine flu vaccine, which was subject to thorough testing last year, and two strains of seasonal flu that were only minutely different to previous vaccines to combat slight genetic changes in the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Barr, the deputy director of the World Health Organisation’s influenza centre in Melbourne, said he thought it unlikely that the combination of the different strains in the vaccine would have triggered the reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Barr told ABC Radio that viruses produced and tested in a laboratory, then made into vaccines on a commercial scale, were &lt;em&gt;”all investigated individually for any particular differences in those viruses which might lead to some of these things we’re seeing currently, such as fever”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TGA is currently testing samples of the vaccines used in Western Australia where most of the reactions have occurred. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—-&lt;br&gt;
UPDATE: from the &lt;a href="http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/no-sign-flu-vaccine-caused-toddlers-death-autopsy-20100427-toz8.html"&gt;Brisbane Times&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An initial autopsy into the death of a Brisbane toddler has found no sign the seasonal flu vaccine was to blame, the state’s chief medical officer has said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Jeannette Young said a series of further tests would be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a press conference this afternoon, Dr Young defended Queensland Health’s handling of the toddler’s case and blamed the private general practitioner who administered the vaccine to the girl for not reporting it, as is required under law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has referred the Mt Gravatt doctor to the Medical Tribunal Board.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists can find genes involved in blood vessel growth in yeast–which have no blood. They can find genes that help build human embryos in plants, where they sense gravity. It’s a twist on a twist on Darwin’s great insights descent with modification.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010346" title=""&gt;Bee Threat Elicits Alarm Call in African Elephants&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unlike the smaller and more vulnerable mammals, African elephants have relatively few predators that threaten their survival. The sound of disturbed African honeybees Apis meliffera scutellata causes African elephants Loxodonta africana to retreat and produce warning vocalizations that lead other elephants to join the flight. In our first experiment, audio playbacks of bee sounds induced elephants to retreat and elicited more head-shaking and dusting, reactive behaviors that may prevent bee stings, compared to white noise control playbacks. Most importantly, elephants produced distinctive "rumble" vocalizations in response to bee sounds. These rumbles exhibited an upward shift in the second formant location, which implies active vocal tract modulation, compared to rumbles made in response to white noise playbacks. In a second experiment, audio playbacks of these rumbles produced in response to bees elicited increased headshaking, and further and faster retreat behavior in other elephants, compared to control rumble playbacks with lower second formant frequencies. These responses to the bee rumble stimuli occurred in the absence of any bees or bee sounds. This suggests that these elephant rumbles may function as referential signals, in which a formant frequency shift alerts nearby elephants about an external threat, in this case, the threat of bees.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010331" title=""&gt;A Geometrical Perspective for the Bargaining Problem&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A new treatment to determine the Pareto-optimal outcome for a non-zero-sum game is presented. An equilibrium point for any game is defined here as a set of strategy choices for the players, such that no change in the choice of any single player will increase the overall payoff of all the players. Determining equilibrium for multi-player games is a complex problem. An intuitive conceptual tool for reducing the complexity, via the idea of spatially representing strategy options in the bargaining problem is proposed. Based on this geometry, an equilibrium condition is established such that the product of their gains over what each receives is maximal. The geometrical analysis of a cooperative bargaining game provides an example for solving multi-player and non-zero-sum games efficiently.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010315" title=""&gt;Potential Hazard to Human Health from Exposure to Fragments of Lead Bullets and Shot in the Tissues of Game Animals&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lead is highly toxic to animals. Humans eating game killed using lead ammunition generally avoid swallowing shot or bullets and dietary lead exposure from this source has been considered low. Recent evidence illustrates that lead bullets fragment on impact, leaving small lead particles widely distributed in game tissues. Our paper asks whether lead gunshot pellets also fragment upon impact, and whether lead derived from spent gunshot and bullets in the tissues of game animals could pose a threat to human health. Wild-shot gamebirds (6 species) obtained in the UK were X-rayed to determine the number of shot and shot fragments present, and cooked using typical methods. Shot were then removed to simulate realistic practice before consumption, and lead concentrations determined. Data from the Veterinary Medicines Directorate Statutory Surveillance Programme documenting lead levels in raw tissues of wild gamebirds and deer, without shot being removed, are also presented. Gamebirds containing ≥5 shot had high tissue lead concentrations, but some with fewer or no shot also had high lead concentrations, confirming X-ray results indicating that small lead fragments remain in the flesh of birds even when the shot exits the body. A high proportion of samples from both surveys had lead concentrations exceeding the European Union Maximum Level of 100 ppb w.w. (0.1 mg kg−1 w.w.) for meat from bovine animals, sheep, pigs and poultry (no level is set for game meat), some by several orders of magnitude. High, but feasible, levels of consumption of some species could result in the current FAO/WHO Provisional Weekly Tolerable Intake of lead being exceeded. The potential health hazard from lead ingested in the meat of game animals may be larger than previous risk assessments indicated, especially for vulnerable groups, such as children, and those consuming large amounts of game.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010326" title=""&gt;Epigenetic Variation in Mangrove Plants Occurring in Contrasting Natural Environment&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Epigenetic modifications, such as cytosine methylation, are inherited in plant species and may occur in response to biotic or abiotic stress, affecting gene expression without changing genome sequence. Laguncularia racemosa, a mangrove species, occurs in naturally contrasting habitats where it is subjected daily to salinity and nutrient variations leading to morphological differences. This work aims at unraveling how CpG-methylation variation is distributed among individuals from two nearby habitats, at a riverside (RS) or near a salt marsh (SM), with different environmental pressures and how this variation is correlated with the observed morphological variation. Significant differences were observed in morphological traits such as tree height, tree diameter, leaf width and leaf area between plants from RS and SM locations, resulting in smaller plants and smaller leaf size in SM plants. Methyl-Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP) was used to assess genetic and epigenetic (CpG-methylation) variation in L. racemosa genomes from these populations. SM plants were hypomethylated (14.6% of loci had methylated samples) in comparison to RS (32.1% of loci had methylated samples). Within-population diversity was significantly greater for epigenetic than genetic data in both locations, but SM also had less epigenetic diversity than RS. Frequency-based (GST) and multivariate (βST) methods that estimate population structure showed significantly greater differentiation among locations for epigenetic than genetic data. Co-Inertia analysis, exploring jointly the genetic and epigenetic data, showed that individuals with similar genetic profiles presented divergent epigenetic profiles that were characteristic of the population in a particular environment, suggesting that CpG-methylation changes may be associated with environmental heterogeneity. In spite of significant morphological dissimilarities, individuals of L. racemosa from salt marsh and riverside presented little genetic but abundant DNA methylation differentiation, suggesting that epigenetic variation in natural plant populations has an important role in helping individuals to cope with different environments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010332" title=""&gt;Effect of Parenchymal Stiffness on Canine Airway Size with Lung Inflation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although airway patency is partially maintained by parenchymal tethering, this structural support is often ignored in many discussions of asthma. However, agonists that induce smooth muscle contraction also stiffen the parenchyma, so such parenchymal stiffening may serve as a defense mechanism to prevent airway narrowing or closure. To quantify this effect, specifically how changes in parenchymal stiffness alter airway size at different levels of lung inflation, in the present study, we devised a method to separate the effect of parenchymal stiffening from that of direct airway narrowing. Six anesthetized dogs were studied under four conditions: baseline, after whole lung aerosol histamine challenge, after local airway histamine challenge, and after complete relaxation of the airways. In each of these conditions, we used High resolution Computed Tomography to measure airway size and lung volume at five different airway pressures (0, 12, 25, 32, and 45 cm H2O). Parenchymal stiffening had a protective effect on airway narrowing, a fact that may be important in the airway response to deep inspiration in asthma. When the parenchyma was stiffened by whole lung aerosol histamine challenge, at every lung volume above FRC, the airways were larger than when they were directly challenged with histamine to the same initial constriction. These results show for the first time that a stiff parenchyma per se minimizes the airway narrowing that occurs with histamine challenge at any lung volume. Thus in clinical asthma, it is not simply increased airway smooth muscle contraction, but perhaps a lack of homogeneous parenchymal stiffening that contributes to the symptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_273.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/veQNpWcEG0E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272334222677"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/boobquake_well_did_the_earth_m.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c464ac354b188369</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Boobquake: Well?

These guys start with a picture, as a canvass. Then, as people tweet using a particular hashtag, their avatars become pieces of the mosaic, gradually building the image as event is happening. It took about two days, the duration of the meeting, to fill the entire image up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image, as it was slowly developing, was occasionally projected on the screen behind the speakers. The Hashtag Art guys were also set up in the side room (where coffee and power-strips were), projecting the image onto a screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I approached them and they realized who I was they got very excited, to my astonishment, to meet me....."Oh, you are @BoraZ!". What?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, each person's avatar is supposed to appear in the mosaic only once. But my avatar,, apparently, appeared something like 162 times. It was a glitch of some sort, and they had no idea how and why that happened. They asked me - but what do I know, I am so non-tech-savvy, I was more surprised than they were. But we agreed that if and when they discover what the bug was, they would tell me but would not remove the 161 extra avatars as that would leave an ugly black hole in the image. Good for me - by using the magnifying tool and placing the cursor over my avatar you can see a tweet of mine. If you then click on my avatar, you will go to my Twitter profile. Nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I don’t want kids.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does she really need more of an explanation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people might think so, but GG is comfortable with her decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’m &lt;em&gt;delighted&lt;/em&gt; with my choice to not have children! I’ll miss out on some great experiences parents have, but I’ll be an available friend or relative to support them. I’ll gain the benefits of being an adult without such a lifelong responsibility: I’ll have more money, more ability to be flexible and involved in my hobbies and goals, and I won’t lack love, friendship, or joy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also offers a nice list of what people should avoid saying to women who say they don’t want to have children.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely some thought-provoking material from someone who prefers not to grow her own food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many of you have no desire to have children?  What are your reasons for not having them?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

See if you can keep this straight:  Malcolm is a professor in the departments of Mechanical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering at Northwestern, with undergraduate degrees in philosophy and computer science, and a Ph.D. in neuroscience.  He’s also one of the only people I know who has a doctorate but no high school diploma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this varied background, Malcolm &lt;a href="http://www.neuromech.northwestern.edu/research/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; connections between biomechanics and neuroscience — how do brains and bodies interact?  This unique expertise helped land him a gig as the science advisor on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caprica_%28TV_series%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caprica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the SyFy Channel’s prequel show to &lt;em&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/em&gt;.  He also blogs at Northwestern’s Science and Society blog.  It’s a pleasure to welcome him to Cosmic Variance, where he’ll tell us about robots, artificial intelligence, and war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;———————————————————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a pleasure to guest blog for CV and Sean Carroll, a friend of some years now. In my &lt;a href="http://blog.scienceinsociety.northwestern.edu/2010/02/are-we-wired-for-war-with-cylons/"&gt;last posting&lt;/a&gt; back at Northwestern University’s Science and Society Blog, I introduced some issues at the intersection of robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and morality. While I’ve long been interested in this nexus, the most immediate impetus for the posting was meeting Peter Singer, author of the excellent book ‘Wired for War’ about the rise of unmanned warfare, while simultaneously working for the TV show &lt;em&gt;Caprica&lt;/em&gt; and a U.S. military research agency that funds some of the work in my &lt;a href="http://www.neuromech.northwestern.edu/"&gt;laboratory&lt;/a&gt; on bio-inspired robotics. &lt;em&gt;Caprica&lt;/em&gt;, for those who don’t know it, is a show about a time when humans invent sentient robotic warriors. &lt;em&gt;Caprica&lt;/em&gt; is a prequel to &lt;em&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/em&gt;, and as we know from that show, these warriors rise up against humans and nearly drive them to extinction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/04/a-centurian-cylon-in-battlestar-galactica-2.jpg" alt="a-centurian-cylon-in-battlestar-galactica--2" title="a-centurian-cylon-in-battlestar-galactica--2" width="320" height="320"&gt;Here, I’d like to push the idea that as interesting as the technical challenges in making sentient robots like those on &lt;em&gt;Caprica&lt;/em&gt; are, an equally interesting area is the moral challenges of making such machines. But “interesting” is too dispassionate—I believe that we need to begin the conversation on these moral challenges. Roboticist Ron Arkin has been making this point for some time, and has written &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Governing-Lethal-Behavior-Autonomous-Robots/dp/1420085948"&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt; on how we may integrate ethical decision making into autonomous robots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that we are hardly at the threshold of building sentient robots, it may seem overly dramatic to characterize this as an urgent concern, but new developments in the way we wage war should make you think otherwise. I heard a telling sign of how things are changing when I recently tuned in to &lt;a href="http://www.wtop.com/"&gt;the live feed&lt;/a&gt; of the most popular radio station in Washington DC, WTOP. The station had commercial after commercial from iRobot (of Roomba fame), a leading builder of unmanned military robots, clearly targeting military listeners. These commercials reflect how the use of unmanned robots in the military has gone from close to zero in 2001 to over ten thousand now, with the pace of acquisition still accelerating. For more details on this, see Peter Singer’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wired-War-Robotics-Revolution-Conflict/dp/0143116843"&gt;‘Wired for War’&lt;/a&gt;, or the March 23 2010 congressional hearing on The Rise of the Drones &lt;a href="http://oversight.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=4840&amp;amp;Itemid=30"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While we are all aware of these trends to some extent, it’s hardly become a significant issue of concern. We are comforted by the knowledge that the final kill decision is still made by a human. But is this comfort warranted? The importance of such a decision changes as the way in which war is conducted, and the highly processed information supporting the decision, becomes mediated by unmanned military robots. Some of these trends have been helpful to our security. For example, the drones have been effective against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda because they can do long-duration monitoring and attacks of sparsely distributed non-state actors. However, in a military context, unmanned robots are clearly the gateway technology to autonomous robots, where machines can eventually be in the position to make decisions that have moral weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But wait!” many will say, “Isn’t this the business-as-usual-robotics-and-AI-are-just-around-the-corner argument we’ve heard for decades?” Robotics and AI have long been criticized as promising more than they could deliver. Are there signs that this could be changing? While an enormous amount could be said about the reasons for the past difficulties of AI, it is clear that some of its past difficulties stem from having too narrow a conception of what constitutes intelligence, a topic I’ve &lt;a href="http://www.neuromech.northwestern.edu/publications/MacI09a/MacI09a.pdf"&gt;touched on&lt;/a&gt; for the recent &lt;em&gt;Cambridge Handbook of Situated Cognition&lt;/em&gt;. This narrow conception revolved around what might loosely be described as cognitive processing or reasoning. Newer types of AI and robotics, such as embodied AI and probabilistic robotics, tries to integrate some of the aspects of what being more than a symbol processor involves: for example, sensing the outside world and dealing with the uncertainty in those signals in order to be highly responsive, and emotional processing. Advanced multi-sensory signal processing techniques such as Bayesian filtering were in fact integral to the success of Stanley, the autonomous robot that won DARPA’s Grand Challenge to drive without human intervention across a challenging desert course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As these prior technical problems are overcome, autonomous decision making will become more common. Eventually, this will raise moral challenges. One area of challenge will be how we should behave towards artifacts, be they virtual or robotic, which are endowed with such a level of AI that how we treat them becomes an issue. On the other side, how they treat us becomes a problem, most especially in military or police contexts. What happens when an autonomous or semi-autonomous war robot makes an error and kills an innocent? Do we place responsibility on the designers of the decision making systems, the military strategists who placed machines with known limitations into contexts they were not designed for, or some other entity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these challenges are about morality and ethics. But it is not clear whether our current moral framework, which is a hodgepodge of religious values, moral philosophies, and secular humanist values, is up to responding to these challenges. It is for this reason that the future of AI and robotics will be as much a moral challenge as a technical challenge. But while we have many smart people working on the technical challenges, very few are working on the moral challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we meet the moral challenge? One possibility is to look toward science for guidance. In my next posting I’ll discuss some of the efforts in this direction, pushed most recently by a new activist form of atheism which holds that it is incorrect to think that we need religion to ground morality, and even dangerous. We can instead, they claim, look to the new sciences of happiness, empathy, and cooperation for guiding our value system. &lt;/p&gt;

Stephen Hawking is in the news today, big time.  Why?  He says that &lt;a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/04/stephen-hawking-says-trying-to-contact-space-aliens-is-too-risky/1"&gt;intelligent aliens almost certainly exist&lt;/a&gt;, and that we should definitely &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8642558.stm"&gt;not try to contact them&lt;/a&gt;.  In fact, he argues, we should stay as quiet as possible and try to avoid detection.  To quote him:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I was floored.  And I was even more shocked when I realized that this opinion was &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/04/25/hawking-beware-the-alien-menace/"&gt;a common one&lt;/a&gt; among &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/01/16/be-vewwwwy-vewwwwy-quiet/"&gt;my scientific peers&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all due respect, I completely disagree.  If an alien's ship managed to come all the way from another star system to within range of Earth, we would already know an incredible amount about them.  What follows is what I would say to them.  (And you should feel free to opine in the comments.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that, like us, you grew to prominence on your planet, evolving over hundreds of millions of years to become the most successful species on your world.  We know -- like us -- you gained mastery over your environment, learning to utilize resources and tools to construct a myriad of things that would have never existed without your intervention.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, &lt;i&gt;unlike us&lt;/i&gt;, you have managed to build a ship to sustain you during an interstellar voyage, far away from any natural power sources (like stars).  This is a &lt;i&gt;fantastic&lt;/i&gt; achievement, and we are a long way off from anything approaching this!  Your technology is far, far advanced from ours.  It's very likely that your astronomy skills -- particularly for finding planets you're interested in coming to for their natural resources -- are superb, and vastly superior to our own.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, if you're &lt;i&gt;looking&lt;/i&gt; for a world in order to harvest resources from &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; we're a good fit, &lt;b&gt;you're going to find us whether we advertise or not&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we are young, and in our technological infancy.  It was only 10,000 years ago -- about 400 generations -- that we started planting seeds and growing our own food.  It is only now, at the present day, that we are beginning to learn how to live within the means of what our planet can sustainably provide.  And you &lt;i&gt;must have&lt;/i&gt; figured that part out in order to develop the technology and devote the resources to sustainably survive &lt;b&gt;without a planet or power source&lt;/b&gt; at all.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many questions we are striving to learn the answer to, that we are only even beginning to pose well.  And yet, to survive a long-term space journey, any alien race must have already figured out an answer to these and many other questions.  The two big ones that I want to ask are these:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have evolved to be selfish hoarders, always hungering for more, and to expand beyond the means of our resources.  How did you overcome the limitations of your evolution?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The resources available to plunder on our planet are limited, and it is almost unimaginable to imagine surviving a long amount of time (many years, at &lt;i&gt;least&lt;/i&gt;, but probably many generations) without any power source at all!  But you did it.  What was your solution to your energy needs?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
But to imagine malevolent aliens?  Why?  Destroying us would be like crushing a colony of microbes just for kicks to them.  Their technological level must be at least hundreds, if not tens of thousands of years beyond ours.  Can you imagine even the greatest military force from the Napoleonic Era even lasting a few weeks against our modern warfare technologies?  It simply wouldn't happen.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what irks me most of all is the &lt;i&gt;cowardice&lt;/i&gt; behind a viewpoint that we shouldn't rush to meet a peer in this Universe.  It would be like forgetting the best part of being human: our bravery, our sense of adventure, our will to explore, our thirst for learning and discovery, our curiosity, and our desire to experience all that existence has to offer.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; am eager.  &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; want to meet them.  &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; want to know the answers to those questions.  Right now, when I put the numbers I think are most likely into the Drake equation, I find it very unlikely that there ought to be another intelligent civilization within a hundred million light years of us.  But if there is, I'm going to try to find them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if any aliens are reading this, &lt;b&gt;PICK US!  HERE!&lt;/b&gt;  All of humanity may not be ready for you, but some of us are.  If you come, the rest of us will come around.  And I'll be among the first to welcome and greet you.  Be gentle with us and be careful with our delicate biology.  We have a lot to learn, and could use a great teacher.  I hope to hear from you soon.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best,

NEW ORLEANS — Coast Guard officials said Monday afternoon that the oil spill near Louisiana was now covering an area in the Gulf of Mexico of 48 miles by 39 miles at its widest points, and they have been unable to engage a mechanism that could shut off the well thousands of feet below the ocean’s surface.

&lt;p&gt;“Boobquake” is the clever idea of blogger Jen McCreight of &lt;a href="http://www.blaghag.com/2010/04/in-name-of-science-i-offer-my-boobs.html"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;Blag Hag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was born after hearing the claim of an Iranian cleric that “women and girls who don&amp;#39;t dress appropriately increase promiscuity in society, when promiscuity spreads, earthquakes increase.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCreight proposed that April 26th would be declared “Boobquake” and suggested that women wear cleavage-exposing tops in order to test the claim. Surely, if the cleric was correct, the combined supernatural power of all of this immodesty would result in a powerful earthquake.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Boobquake” is more than just an experiment. By purchasing related t-shirts, you can support international earthquake relief, as well as educational programs focused on the dangers of pseudoscience and the supernatural. 100% of the profits generated by t-shirt sales will be donated to the James Randi Educational Foundation and the Red Cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to our 4th reader giveaway! (And trust us, it won’t be      our last.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/Lite.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Lite" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/Lite-300x161.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="131"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eat this up: Van’s new Lite Waffles – made with wholesome, natural ingredients like  whole wheat flour, honey, oats, barley, and millet – have just &lt;em&gt;70  calories&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;one gram&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;of fat&lt;/em&gt; per waffle. And each serving (two waffles per  serving) has &lt;em&gt;six grams of fiber&lt;/em&gt;! They’re a delicious snack that  flatters your figure and tickles your taste buds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blisstree loves Van’s waffles, so we’re partnering with them,   and for this week’s reader giveaway…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four&lt;/em&gt; lucky Blisstree readers* will each win:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 5 Free Boxes of Van’s Waffles! (5 coupons redeemable for any Van’s products)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering our exclusive Van’s waffles giveaway couldn’t be easier. Just tell us   by 6 p.m. ET    this Saturday, May 1, 2010, about your favorite healthy waffle topping! (Natural, local maple syrup for us, thank you.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Van’s has  been making delicious waffles with good-for-you ingredients  for decades. Its new Lite waffles offer real nutrition, and are a great  choice for breakfast. Because of the high fiber count, they’re also the perfect  snack to help prevent the afternoon slump. Plus, they’re made with great  ingredients  like quinoa, barley, brown rice flour, and amaranth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Giveaway open to U.S. residents only. Blisstree will     select four winners at random and contact them after May 1, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, Carl Zimmer gives further evidence of how evolution is advancing medicine.  Zimmer tells the story of &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/science/27gene.html?hp"&gt;Ed Marcotte at the University of Texas&lt;/a&gt;, and how his work on yeast, combined with the concept of deep homology between yeast and human genes, has enormous promise for medicine—everything from cancer to genetic defects.   It involves going back and forth between species, with the iterations finding ever more genes that might be involved in human diseases; and it all rests on the proposition that genes in humans that do one thing might be evolutionarily related to genes in other species that do different things. (This, of course, is one of the observations that has been used to refute Intelligent Design’s notion of “irreducible complexity.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s way cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our local Republican districts has a poll on this issue. You will not believe the wording on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sd42gop.com/"&gt;President Obama called the new Arizona bill banning illegal immigration "misguided". Do you agree?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sí, señor!
      22%&lt;br&gt;
No Way, José!
      77%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
      
&lt;p&gt;They really need to add a cute little icon of the Frito Bandito to that, just to add a little more class. It's especially funny because Minnesota is experiencing a growing influx of Hispanic workers, who are getting stuck with the essential but menial jobs of our agricultural economy. It seems like a bad idea for Republicans to be mocking a growing part of our electorate, but hey, if they want to shoot themselves in the voting booth, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, read it carefully. They are not asking if you approve of the immigration bill, they are asking if you approve of Obama's dislike of the bill. If you think the bill is misguided, vote yes; if you think we need to crack down on the rising brown tide, vote no. I actually wonder if the current small vote for yes is the result of Republicans unable to puzzle out the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rethuglicans noticed. The poll has been reset, and the ridiculously stereotyped answers have been changed to a simple yes and no now. I guess we embarrassed them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/shall_we_mess_up_a_local_repub.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/5hiWGlnQcxM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272317536309"><id gr:original-id="1011 at http://layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/969d447b23fece05</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Climate Change" scheme="http://layscience.net/environment/climate-change"/><category term="Climate Change" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/119"/><category term="data" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1558"/><category term="denialism" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/87"/><category term="FOIA" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1557"/><category term="open access" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/456"/><category term="publishing" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/457"/><title type="html">Scientific Data and Freedom of Information</title><published>2010-04-26T21:04:22Z</published><updated>2010-04-26T21:04:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://layscience.net/node/1011" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; So last week I was given &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/1014"&gt;a bit of a roasting&lt;/a&gt; by guest blogger Sarah over a remark I made on Twitter, where I said that I couldn't see why academic data should be covered by the Freedom of Information Act.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of mixed wisdom out there about what organic material you should and shouldn’t return to the earth. If you want to stay on Mother Nature’s good side, check out this list of things the &lt;a href="http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/composting/by_compost.htm"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; suggests trashing instead of composting:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1. Sick plants:&lt;/strong&gt; Adding diseased or insect-ridden plants to your compost will just make other plants ill. (But you can compost healthy plants.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Coal or charcoal ash:&lt;/strong&gt; These can also harm plant life. (But you can compost fireplace ashes.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3. Black walnut tree leaves or twigs:&lt;/strong&gt; While most leaves are okay to recycle, walnut leaves contain substances that can damage plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Dairy products:&lt;/strong&gt; These will stink up your bin and attract outdoor pests. So dump your yogurt elsewhere, but toss eggshells into the compost pile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Fats, grease, lard, or oils: &lt;/strong&gt;As with dairy products, their odor can attract unwanted visitors. (And they don’t break down well.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
6. Pet wastes: &lt;/strong&gt;Needless to say, your kitty’s litter likely contains parasites, bacteria, and other unsavory stuff that could make humans sick. (But cow or horse manure is fine for composting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Yard waste treated with pesticides&lt;/strong&gt;: This could kill beneficial composting organisms. (But if you don’t use pesticides, your lawn debris is good to go…again.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Meat or fish bones and scraps&lt;/strong&gt;: More stinky stuff you don’t want to mess with outside – it’s like inviting a family of rodents and flies over for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Grains and carbs:&lt;/strong&gt; They actually make great composting material, but vermin love them way too much. (&lt;a href="http://planetgreen.discovery.com/home-garden/compost-avoid-items-bin.html"&gt;Planet Green&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Chemically treated wood:&lt;/strong&gt; Not good. (&lt;a href="http://planetgreen.discovery.com/home-garden/compost-avoid-items-bin.html"&gt;Planet Green&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

Culturally, they are perhaps best known for inaccurate forecasts and questionable fashion statements. To the untrained eye, it may seem that their only job requirements are neon smiles and a working knowledge of how to place cartoon graphics of altostratus clouds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/S9X8xbqW-0I/AAAAAAAAAL4/UDkAWASlzVo/s1600/6a00d8341c2c3f53ef00e5550a92808834-640wi.png"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;width:320px;height:179px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/S9X8xbqW-0I/AAAAAAAAAL4/UDkAWASlzVo/s320/6a00d8341c2c3f53ef00e5550a92808834-640wi.png" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hollywood has often portrayed weather reporters in a less than favorable light to match this mainstream image, with notable showings by Nicole Kidman, Bill Murray, Nicolas Cage, Will Farrell, and Steve Martin.  And our most memorable blundering fictitious weather specialists sometimes cross over into reality.  This was the case when American Idol promoted the show by sending contestants to do the weather at Fox affiliates in their hometowns. Does anyone really need to know much of anything about the weather in order to talk about it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/CXw3cACiv20%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stephen Colbert didn’t need to ask that question directly last month when his Colbert Report took on a recent study on TV weather forecasters’ views on global warming.  Instead the show managed to poke fun at the TV weather business by calling attention to the results of the study, in which university researchers found that, unlike the overwhelming majority of climatologists, half of those who deliver weather news on TV question the existence of global warming.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Colbert promised and delivered&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;a “science catfight.” In one corner was Brenda Ekwurzel of the Union of Concerned Scientists, representing climatologists.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;In the other was Joe Bastardi of AccuWeather, a TV weather forecaster.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cobert's twisted genius in offering humor and information simultaneously, a cornerstone of his program, teaches as it entertains.    By cartoonishly agreeing with scientific inaccuracy, he subverts an uninformed message that could otherwise confuse the average viewer.  Laughter and entertainment can perhaps be more effective than any press release or university study in reaching an otherwise indifferent audience that may not get&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;exposed&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;to public policy issues in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;table style="font:11px arial;color:rgb(51,51,51);background-color:rgb(245,245,245)" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="360" height="353"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr style="background-color:rgb(229,229,229)" valign="middle"&gt;&lt;td style="padding:2px 1px 0px 5px"&gt;&lt;a style="color:rgb(51,51,51);text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold" href="http://www.colbertnation.com/"&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="padding:2px 5px 0px;text-align:right;font-weight:bold"&gt;Mon - Thurs 11:30pm / 10:30c&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr style="height:14px" valign="middle"&gt;&lt;td style="padding:2px 1px 0px 5px" colspan="2"&gt;&lt;a style="color:rgb(51,51,51);text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold" href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/269929/april-06-2010/science-catfight---joe-bastardi-vs--brenda-ekwurzel"&gt;Science Catfight - Joe Bastardi vs. Brenda Ekwurzel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr style="height:14px;background-color:rgb(53,53,53)" valign="middle"&gt;&lt;td colspan="2" style="padding:2px 5px 0px;width:360px;overflow:hidden;text-align:right"&gt;&lt;a style="color:rgb(150,222,255);text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold" href="http://www.colbertnation.com/"&gt;www.colbertnation.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr valign="middle"&gt;&lt;td style="padding:0px" colspan="2"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://media.mtvnservices.com/mgid:cms:item:comedycentral.com:269929&amp;amp;width=360&amp;amp;height=301&amp;amp;flashVars=autoPlay%3Dfalse" width="360" height="301"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr style="height:18px" valign="middle"&gt;&lt;td style="padding:0px" colspan="2"&gt;&lt;table style="margin:0px;text-align:center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%" height="100%"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr valign="middle"&gt;&lt;td style="padding:3px;width:33%"&gt;&lt;a style="font:10px arial;color:rgb(51,51,51);text-decoration:none" href="http://www.colbertnation.com/full-episodes/"&gt;Colbert Report Full Episodes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="padding:3px;width:33%"&gt;&lt;a style="font:10px arial;color:rgb(51,51,51);text-decoration:none" href="http://www.indecisionforever.com/"&gt;Political Humor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="padding:3px;width:33%"&gt;&lt;a style="font:10px arial;color:rgb(51,51,51);text-decoration:none" href="http://www.colbertnation.com/video/tag/Fox+News"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-912519959983371149?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

And when I say everything, I include you, dear reader, and the tapeworms of Madagascar. They carry a hidden history of our entire species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure we’d all prefer that there was no such connection. Tapeworm are not just gross, but they are pretty much the polar opposite of the human existence. They have no brain. They have no eyes. They lack mouths and guts, having turned their body inside out, absorbing food through its surface. Most of their hideously long body is made up of segments, each of which contains its own supply of both eggs and sperm. To reproduce, the tapeworm fertilizes its eggs, either with its own sperm or another tapeworm’s, and then sheds its segments. Once out of the body, those segments can crawl around on the ground on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, like it or not, tapeworms–or at least the pork tapeworm &lt;em&gt;Taenia solium&lt;/em&gt;–has an intimate relationship with us. After all, it can only live in our guts as an adult, where it will dwell for years and grow over 20 feet long. Without us, these tapeworms would simply not exist. From the safety of our guts, they can shed six egg-loaded segments a day, each of which contains 50,000 eggs. If a pig swallows one of these eggs, it hatches in the animal’s instestines, drills its way into the abdominal cavity, and finds a muscle to infect. There it dwells in a barely visible cyst, for years if need be. In order to complete its life cycle, it must get into another human, which it does if a human eats a piece of infected, undercooked pork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrying an adult tapeworm around in your gut may be disturbing, but it’s not the worst thing a tapeworm can do to you. Sometimes people get infected with the eggs of pork tapeworms, rather than the cysts. Instead of developing into an adult, the tapeworm treats you like a pig. It invades your muscles, where it makes a cyst. Sometimes the tapeworms can get into people’s brains. These cysts can trigger dangerous reactions from our immune systems, and can sometimes be fatal. This disease, known as cysticercosis, is relatively rare in the United States. Only 221 people died of it between 1990 and 2002. But in other parts of the world, it’s a lot worse, with ten percent or so of the population of many countries showing signs of having had the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madagascar is one of those countries. In the highlands, over 20% of people have antibodies to cysticercosis. To get a better handle on the epidemiology of the disease, medical researchers at the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar have traveled around the country, gathering tapeworm from different regions. They isolated DNA from 13 of the samples and then compared their genetic sequences to see how they were related to one another, and to tapeworms from other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family tree of tapeworms they got was &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2010.01.008"&gt;strangely ancient and alien&lt;/a&gt;. In many cases, the closest relatives of tapeworms on Madagascar are not other tapeworms on Madagascar. The tapeworms that live in the southwest part of the island are closely related to tapeworms hundreds of miles away, in Africa. The tapeworms in other parts of the island are more closely related to tapeworms thousands of miles away, in south Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists then tallied up the mutations in each lineage of tapeworm to figure out how long ago they had split off from a common ancestor. All the &lt;em&gt;T. solium&lt;/em&gt; tapeworms the scientists studied descend from a common ancestor that lived about 680,000 years ago. The southwest Madagascar tapeworms and the tapeworms of Africa share a common ancestor that lived 235,000 years ago.  All of the Madagascar and Asian tapeworms share a common ancestor that lived about 260,000 years ago. The Madagascar tapeworms and their very closest Asian relatives share an ancestor that lived 85,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how on Earth did one remote island end up with two such deeply split lineages of tapeworms in their pigs? The answer is like a guided tour thorugh the evolution of our species, rolling right on through the history of civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with pork tapeworms, there are two other species of &lt;em&gt;Taenia&lt;/em&gt; that live in humans. One, &lt;em&gt;T. asiatica&lt;/em&gt;, also cycles between people and pigs, but only in Asia as the name suggests. The other, &lt;em&gt;T. saginata&lt;/em&gt;, moves between people and cows. Both of these human tapeworms use domesticated hoofed mammals (known as ungulates) as their intermediate hosts. Pigs and cows were only domesticated within the past 11,000 years or so. The best way to find clues to how these tapeworms colonized us is to compare them to the 39 species of &lt;em&gt;Taenia&lt;/em&gt; tapeworms that infect wild animals. Eric Hoberg, a parasitologist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and his colleagues have found that most &lt;em&gt;Taenia&lt;/em&gt; tapeworms form cysts in wild ungulates, such as antelopes, and then become adults in the carnivores that eat their intermediate hosts. The closest relatives of all three human tapeworms live in Africa. Hyenas are the hosts of the closest relatives of pork tapeworms, while lions are the hosts of the closest relative to the other two species, &lt;em&gt;T. saginata&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;T. asiatica&lt;/em&gt;. Hoberg and his colleagues compared the mutations in the DNA of &lt;em&gt;T. saginata&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;T. asiatica&lt;/em&gt; and found that their common ancestor lived somewhere between 780,000 and 1.71 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new results from Madagascar fit in nicely with Hoberg’s &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2005.11.049"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;. Hundreds of thousands of years ago, our ancestors lived in Africa, where they scavenged meat from ungulates. In so doing, it appears, they stepped into the life cycle of &lt;em&gt;Taenia&lt;/em&gt; tapeworms. Tapeworms that might have ended up in the gut of a hyena or a lion ended up in the gut of our ancestors instead. Over thousands of years, some populations of these tapeworms adapted to our scavenger ancestors. These were the common ancestors of today’s human tapeworms, whose great antiquity is now recorded in the DNA of living tapeworms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As hominins expanded their ranges both within Africa and beyond it, they carried their tapeworms along for the ride. As hominins scavenged new game, the tapeworms adapted to new intermediate hosts. Hominins gradually developed the skills and weapons to hunt game, offering still more opportunities for their tapeworms. Neanderthals and other hominins hunted wild boar as well, and it’s likely that we infected them with the ancestors of today’s pork tapeworms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting about 11,000 years ago, humans domesticated pigs many times over, both in &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19900568"&gt;East Asia&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855556"&gt;Near East&lt;/a&gt;. Now the trip from host to host became riduclously easy for the tapeworms. Instead of waiting for its wild boar host getting speared by a hunter, it could make the journey on the dinner plate. Judging from the deep split in the evolution of pork tapeworms, the parasites must have made two separate shifts from wild boar to domesticated pigs, in both East Asia and the Near East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genealogy of the tapeworms also matches up nicely with the human history of Madagascar. People only arrived on the island 2000 years ago. They came from two directions. Bantu farmers sailed from the west from Africa across the Mozambique channel. Asians came from the east, traveling thousands of miles across the Indian Ocean from Indonesia. Malagasy culture emerged from the mingling of these two origins. That culture also includes the livestock that the Bantu and Indonesians brought to the island. And those animals brought parasites with them that had been separated for almost 700,000 years, reaching back to a time when our ancestors had yet to invent fire or spoken language.&lt;/p&gt;

(Actually, this isn’t really a test of the cleric’s idea, since he blamed earthquakes on the &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-ml-iran-earthquakes-promiscuity,0,6333394.story"&gt;adultery attendant on display of boobage&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many women who do not dress modestly … lead young men astray, corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society, which (consequently) increases earthquakes,” Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi was quoted as saying by Iranian media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, the idea has been taken up with approbation by some of my favorite bloggers, including &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/a_good_mocking_is_better_than.php"&gt;P.Z&lt;/a&gt;., &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2010/04/rule_34_d_boobquake.php"&gt;erv&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2010/04/this-blog-supports-boobquake.html"&gt;Russell Blackford&lt;/a&gt;.  How do I feel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t get behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call me humorless, call me a militant pro-feminist, call me a prude—call me what you want, but somehow the idea of women mocking religion by showing their breasts comes perilously close to making points through sexuality instead of through good arguments and brains. (Just imagine how tepid the response would be if, in the same cause, all of us male bloggers decided to show ourselves in jockstraps).  The predictably leering response of men, who of course have tendered enthusiastic thanks for the mammaries, just confirms this suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s worse is that some women who don’t want to participate in this affair have been derided as anti-sex.  Even Russell Blackford took this tack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there was a lot of 1980s pseudo-feminism that took a similar attitude to that of Christianity and Islam, problematising displays of female beauty and even expressing disgust with heterosexuality itself. The worst offender was the egregious Andrea Dworkin – who died relatively young back in 2005. In her case, good riddance. These pseudo-feminists merely use feminist-sounding language to rationalise the religion-based anti-sex morality into which they were socialised. But they lack the self-insight to understand that it’s what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, Russell, if you really think that male and female bodies are &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; beautiful, why do you suppose that this event is getting much more publicity than would a similar display of male skin? Do you think CNN would be all over the event if it was men who were showing their junk? Of course not—and you know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And do you really want to tar women who object to selling ideas with sex as acolytes of Andrea Dworkin?  That’s simply unfair.  Some women don’t want to bare their mammae, and NOT because they have a “religion based anti-sex morality”; they simply have good reason to think that in the long run such stunts will hinder women being taken seriously as thinkers and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to agree with the take of Miranda Hale at &lt;a href="http://www.mirandacelestehale.net/?page_id=2491"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exquisite With Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,  who is an atheist and a feminist, but won’t be doffing her duds today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is fantastic and well-intentioned. It points out both the ridiculousness of the cleric’s claim and the despicable and harmful practice of blaming all sorts of horrible things (including sexual assault) on women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the great majority of the responses to this effort have been anything but fantastic. Instead, it has inspired, primarily at its Facebook event page, many comments of the “show us your tits!” or “Dude, awesome, I’ll get to see some boob photos on Monday” variety. And, for some reason, women are complying. They’re posting photos of their cleavage and men are responding with “awesome boobs!”, etc. The Facebook event page has almost 200,000 “attendees” and the effort has received a great deal of media coverage. And that’s all well and good, but how many of these individuals are actually concerned with raising awareness of this issue? Very, very few, I’d say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, one can assert that the event has been unfairly “hijacked” by the men who are reacting in this way, but this response wasn’t hard to predict. And although the men making these types of comments are solely responsible for the attitudes expressed in them, why provide them with fodder? I understand that this is intended to be a lighthearted attempt to point out the ridiculousness and stupidity of the assertions made by the cleric, but that intention has been completely buried under a constant stream of “show us your tits” comments. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . Let’s dress however we want to, let’s be as modest or as immodest as we choose, and let’s use our sexuality however we see fit. It’s all about choice. If Boobquake is your kind of thing, then, by all means, enjoy it. But don’t stop there. Write about these issues. Raise consciousness about them. Speak out against the “show us your tits” reactions. And please don’t pretend that merely showing as much cleavage as possible is somehow making any kind of difference. It’s not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it doesn’t make a difference in promoting atheism and mocking faith, what good is it? It’s just Playboy on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:  &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ceiling_cat"&gt;Ceiling Cat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/seanmcarroll"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;weighs in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several days ago, while walking to my car past a small patch of woods adjacent to the building where my office is, one of my students called to me from the woods. He has been working on various projects, and this year has been pretty much in charge of a project to monitor the abundance  of an &lt;a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/invasives/"&gt;invasive&lt;/a&gt; exotic &lt;a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/invasives/pdfs/redcrayfish.pdf"&gt;crayfish&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.kenoshanews.com/scripts/edoris/edoris.dll?tem=lsearchart&amp;amp;search_iddoc=7794423"&gt;a local pond&lt;/a&gt;. He was sitting on a chair in the middle of the woods, and as I approached him I noticed two bird feeders hanging in trees nearby. He explained that he was working on a lab for his animal behavior course, but had seen few or no birds that morning. Surveying the woods, I noticed how open it was because the canopy trees had not yet leafed out, and very few of the understory trees or shrubs had either. There were, however, quite a few flowering herbaceous plants, and, seeing how the birds were scarce, we took a look at the flowers. They were unevenly distributed over the forest floor, with large clumps or colonies here and there. We wondered about this– were there subtle habitat differences we could not immediately see that determined where the plants grew?  Or perhaps they reproduced clonally, and each patch was where a successful individual had landed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-11066" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/this-is-what-college-should-be/wiki-599px-bloodroot_sanguinaria_canadensis/"&gt;&lt;img title="Wiki-599px-Bloodroot_(Sanguinaria_canadensis)" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/wiki-599px-bloodroot_sanguinaria_canadensis.jpeg?w=500&amp;amp;h=500" alt="" width="500" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloodroot- the start of it all. Photo by UpstateNYer from Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I take some pride in my knowledge of local trees, forest herbs are not my forte. The student said he thought the plants nearest us, with white flowers and lobed, shamrock-like leaves, were &lt;a href="http://www.botany.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/detail.cgi?SpCode=SANCAN1&amp;amp;Genus=Sanguinaria&amp;amp;Family=Papaveraceae&amp;amp;Species=canadensis&amp;amp;Common=bloodroot&amp;amp;photo=..%2Fphotos%2FSANCAN1_KS1.jpg&amp;amp;thumbmaps=..%2Fthumbmap%2FSANCAN1.gif&amp;amp;hand=H"&gt;bloodroot&lt;/a&gt;. He plucked one, and sure enough a reddish sap was evident in the stem. We looked around a bit more, and found some &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.botany.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/SearchResults.cgi?Genus=Trillium"&gt;Trillium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, too. About this time a graduate student who also works in my lab was walking down a path through the woods, and we called him over, and showed him the plants we’d found. I told the students about how this was a good time to be in the forest, because you see much further before the understory leafs out, allowing you to see the topography and the distribution of the big canopy trees at a glance, as well as the flowering herbs, some of which are ephemeral and will soon die back, but others of which will, after flowering early, keep their green leaves all season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned to the students that I’d seen a great web post that morning about &lt;a href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/8/2010/04/first-contact-alien.png"&gt;first contact with aliens&lt;/a&gt; (h/t: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/first_contact.php"&gt;PZ&lt;/a&gt;), which stressed the likely lack of similarity and extreme technological disparity between us and interstellar travelers (“nuclear weapons [used by them] vs. sponges [which would be us]“), and how a binary code would be the way to communicate, although PZ noted they’d probably collect several specimens for the interstellar natural history museum before they figured out the sponges [that would be us] were sentient. The grad student suggested that it wouldn’t be that bad, since convergent evolution would insure that they had some basic similarities to us. I said I’m not so sure, and noted that &lt;a href="http://people.ucsc.edu/~laporte/simpson/Index.html"&gt;George Gaylord Simpson&lt;/a&gt;, in his famous essay on the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/143/3608/769.pdf"&gt;nonprevalence of humanoids&lt;/a&gt; (link might require subscription), had argued strongly that life elsewhere is decidedly unlikely to be familiar to us. We discussed what basic similarities there might be among life forms evolved completely independently.  Bilateral symmetry?  Common on earth, but how many times had it evolved independently here? Cephalization? There were some interesting cases of it evolving in primitively radial urchins. Carbon based?  It beats silicon, but there was the &lt;a href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Horta"&gt;Horta on &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The grad student recalled how &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; “explained” the prevalence of humanoids by having the “&lt;a href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Ancient_humanoid"&gt;ancient humanoids&lt;/a&gt;” seed the galaxy with DNA that would lead to the evolution of humanoids. This, I noted, is no explanation at all, but it did show the &lt;em&gt;Star Trek &lt;/em&gt;producers were aware of the thrust of Simpson’s critique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went on to note that there were ways of trying to distinguish independent from convergent origins. Shared, yet arbitrary, characteristics, such as the genetic code, suggest a single origin (unless of course there are functional differences among possible codes, which would make them non-arbitrary), while clearly adaptive similarities might arise through convergence (see &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/13/how-the-tapir-got-his-spots-iii/"&gt;whales and icthyosaurs&lt;/a&gt;). About this time we all realized we had other things we were supposed to be doing– meetings, lectures, etc. So we split up, and headed for our varied destinations. As we did, the first student said, “This is what college should be.”&lt;/p&gt;

The first oral contraceptive was approved by the FDA on May 9, 1960, and the Pill’s development was named by &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; as the greatest scientific development of the 20th century. Last week’s &lt;em&gt;TIME Magazine&lt;/em&gt; cover story, “&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1983712,00.html?xid=newsletter-weekly"&gt;The Pill at 50: Sex, Freedom, and Paradox&lt;/a&gt;” was entirely devoted to the pros, cons, and controversies of the baby blockers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its checkered past, today the Pill is almost like a multivitamin; and it’s the number one birth control method for women in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a quick office poll, and most women here have tried the Pill or are currently on it, but opinions vary wildly on whether they love it or hate it. Some have experienced horrible side effects and opted for a different method. Others swear by it and have been on it for years. What about you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t know what kind of conspiracy is going on, but someone is out to make women feel fatter. A new study suggests that federal guidelines on obesity should put more women into the “obese category,” according to an article in &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2010-04-25-women-obesity_N.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the federal government uses the body mass index (BMI), a measuring standard that’s based on a person’s height and weight. (Who hasn’t tried to add a half-inch to her height in order to make the results turn out better?) But the bad news is the study in &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; found that more women are actually obese than the BMI calculation finds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under international guidelines from the World Health Organization, which conducts body-fat analysis, about half of white women and more than two-thirds of Latino women are considered obese. Yet about half of these women aren’t classified as obese under U.S. rules. Apparently, the U.S. has been going light on the obesity calculations – perhaps because many of our citizens are already so much heftier than those of other nations.&lt;/p&gt;

The last name was unusual but one that I recognized as that of a guy I grew up with---and this little boy looked just like him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I politely asked the woman if she was D's wife.  She laughed and introduced herself as a family friend.  My friend D and his wife were in California getting her cancer treatment.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd heard that D's wife had been diagnosed with cancer shortly after giving birth, but I hadn't really seen D in years.  He was one of the nice kids in the neighborhood, brilliant but not overly nerdy, kind, and not into torturing other kids.  I figured he must have married a wonderful woman.  And I was right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how we all became friends, but somehow we did.  My wife and his hit it off immediately.  She was never "our friend with cancer" but just our friend.  Still, there were reminders that she wasn't entirely well.  A couple of years ago, she started to experience a cough and some pain in her side.  Despite this, we went to a side-splittingly funny movie where she alternately laughed and cried.  We found out a little later that she had broken a rib. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend has been in the hospital for a while.  It's a long story, and not a good one, so we'll leave that be, but it's given me an opportunity to spend a lot of time with her.  And while I'd rather hang out at their pool with the kids eating Chinese food, this time together has been remarkable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite what the Lifetime network would have you think, illness isn't pretty.  Our tendency to glamorize illness (perhaps to gain some control of our fears) has not made it any less unpleasant. The Victorian era saw a glamorization of consumption (tuberculosis) in literature. In one of his first stories (&lt;i&gt;Metzengerstein&lt;/i&gt;), Edgar Allen Poe wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The beautiful Lady Mary! How could she die?- and of consumption! But it is a path I have prayed to follow. I would wish all I love to perish of that gentle disease. How glorious- to depart in the heyday of the young blood- the heart of all passion- the imagination all fire- amid the remembrances of happier days- in the fall of the year- and so be buried up forever in the gorgeous autumnal leaves!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may have seemed a better death than many others available at the time, but for whatever reason, tuberculosis came to embody tragedy and beauty, soulfulness and sadness.  In the U.S. and Europe today, tuberculosis is rarely fatal. Cancer seems to have taken the place of tuberculosis, with innumerable books and movies depicting the beauty and dignity of suffering from cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a great deal of dignity to be found among those who are ill, there is little beauty in suffering.  What I have enjoyed about my time with my friend is her humor and love; her husband's intelligence and kindness; her friends' devotion.  That is where the beauty is, not in her disease.  The disease is the nasogastric tube, the nausea, the abdominal pain.  The disease is wanting a piece of pizza you can't have, wanting to watch your child grow up but being uncertain if you will even see his next birthday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not just the patient who fails to see the glamor in suffering.  Friends and family aren't so enamored of it either.  It's common for people to find themselves alone when they are suffering the most.  It's no fun to watch someone suffer, and many times friends will stay away to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But spending time with someone who is ill is a privilege.  As a physician I am allowed to share in the intimacy of illness and dying.  As a friend I am allowed to share it in a completely different way.  If she weren't ill, I would never have this much time with her and her husband.  I would never have this much time with her other friends. But I would trade every minute of this time for another summer by the pool, another side-splitting laugh at the movies, or a play date for our kids.  There is no glamor in her illness, an illness which she fights with humor and dignity.  The beauty is in her, and in her family.  It is in the love they share with their friends, in their willingness to continue to open their hearts when most of their energy is spent fighting this bastard of a disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no beauty in disease.  The beauty, such as it is, is in the time spent together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/vKbuODTVbHk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272311301655"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/that_hollow_ring_that_tired_ob.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/888780eedea7d7af</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">That hollow ring, that tired objection</title><published>2010-04-26T20:38:06Z</published><updated>2010-04-26T20:38:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/7ddMOm7zoAU/that_hollow_ring_that_tired_ob.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/that_hollow_ring_that_tired_ob.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lots of people sent me a link to this essay in which &lt;a href="http://www.firstthings.com/article/2010/04/believe-it-or-not"&gt;David Hart declares "New" Atheism a passing fad&lt;/a&gt;, expecting me to take it apart. I didn&amp;#39;t have the heart, and I&amp;#39;m busy right now, sorry. It&amp;#39;s a horribly written and excessively long piece — I&amp;#39;d almost call it purple prose if the periphrastic verbosity and passionless vacuity of the author hadn&amp;#39;t leeched all the color out of it. It hurt my brain to &lt;i&gt;start&lt;/i&gt; reading it, and after scrolling down a couple of pages with no end in sight, I set it aside. TL;DR, as the glib technorati like to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did finally drag myself through it over a light lunch — it was amazing, it even sucked the flavor out of the horseradish sauce on my sandwich — and I was also encouraged by the fact that &lt;a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/04/theology"&gt;Kevin Drum rolled his eyes and dismissed it&lt;/a&gt;. So I'll toss off a few brief (a word unfamiliar to Hart) and I would hope cogent (definitely a word from a language foreign to him) words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole essay has one note, played over and over: oh, these New Atheists are so boring, so tepid, so uninteresting that they deserve no attention at all and will eventually fade away. And then he goes through a bunch of them, complaining about how empty their arguments are, for something like 4800 words. If you bother to read it, here's a hint to help you get through it all: imagine it read aloud in the voice of Eeyore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a sample of a familiar argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principal source of my melancholy, however, is my firm conviction that today's most obstreperous infidels lack the courage, moral intelligence, and thoughtfulness of their forefathers in faithlessness. What I find chiefly offensive about them is not that they are skeptics or atheists; rather, it is that they are not skeptics at all and have purchased their atheism cheaply, with the sort of boorish arrogance that might make a man believe himself a great strategist because his tanks overwhelmed a town of unarmed peasants, or a great lover because he can afford the price of admission to a brothel. So long as one can choose one's conquests in advance, taking always the paths of least resistance, one can always imagine oneself a Napoleon or a Casanova (and even better: the one without a Waterloo, the other without the clap).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all that noise, basically is what he is saying is the ridiculous canard that these atheists are only tackling the &lt;i&gt;easy&lt;/i&gt;, foolish arguments for God, which isn't quite right. We tackle all the arguments for God, especially the ones that are widely held and that dominate the public imagination. It's not our fault that we're driving Panzers and they're all peasants and whores (you know, I'd never think of an analogy so belittling of believers as the one that Hart himself comes up with. I'm impressed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is typical of this genre of criticism, though, Hart has no Stalingrad to blunt our armored assault. Where's his argument for the truth of religion or the reality of God? He hasn't got one. All he's got are claims that the loss of God-belief would somehow diminish us, so we better not do it. It's very unconvincing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait! He does say something about an argument for God. Here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most venerable metaphysical claims about God do not simply shift priority from one kind of thing (say, a teacup or the universe) to another thing that just happens to be much bigger and come much earlier (some discrete, very large gentleman who preexists teacups and universes alike). These claims start, rather, from the fairly elementary observation that nothing contingent, composite, finite, temporal, complex, and mutable can account for its own existence, and that even an infinite series of such things can never be the source or ground of its own being, but must depend on some source of actuality beyond itself. Thus, abstracting from the universal conditions of contingency, one very well may (and perhaps must) conclude that all things are sustained in being by an &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; plenitude of actuality, whose very essence is being as such: not a "supreme being," not another &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; within or alongside the universe, but the infinite act of being itself, the one eternal and transcendent source of all existence and knowledge, in which all finite being participates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is immaterial whether one is wholly convinced by such reasoning. Even its most ardent proponents would have to acknowledge that it is an almost entirely negative deduction, obedient only to something like Sherlock Holmes' maxim that "when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, &lt;em&gt;however improbable&lt;/em&gt;, must be the truth." It certainly says nearly nothing about who or what God &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reaction of any rational, intelligent human being to that explanation should be, simply, "What?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're not one of those, but an actual Christian, I think your first reaction should be to print out that paragraph, take it to your minister, and ask him or her to explain it to you. And maybe suggest that it be the subject of next Sunday's sermon. Let me know how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I trace my existence back to chance events delimited by the possibilities of physics and the pinball game of history. I don't call any of those elements "god", and I especially don't get all pompous and call it the &lt;span&gt;"&lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; plenitude of actuality"&lt;/span&gt; or any kind of being at all. Hart has no excuse for personifying his causal source, or even implying that it has any kind of intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, Sherlock Holmes is an utterly abominable guide to reason: his methods don't work. The naive dependence on the infallibility of deductive logic  that Arthur Conan Doyle saddled the detective with is ridiculous, and that aphorism is impossible to implement in the real world, where you really can't eliminate all possibilities. And I will remind everyone that Doyle believed in fairies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again, try to get any of the millions of Christians out there to accept Hart's freakishly abstract and dessicated definition of God. Won't happen, unless you stumble across another withered Christian academic with a penchant for recondite abstractions. And they're almost as odious to the faithful as atheists, tolerated only because they provide that kind of vacuous bluster as cover for the nonsense they really believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hart actually does make a specific plea for Christianity, as part of a 'rebuttal' (hah!) of Grayling. It's pure emotionalism, not a hint of reason anywhere, wallowing in the bathos of the crucifixion in the same way as Mel Gibson's &lt;i&gt;Passion&lt;/i&gt; did…only without the blood and, well, passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, displayed with an altogether elegant incomprehensibility in Grayling's casual juxtaposition of the sea-born goddess and the crucified God (who is a crucified man), one catches a glimpse of the enigma of the Christian event, which Nietzsche understood and Grayling does not: the lightning bolt that broke from the cloudless sky of pagan antiquity, the long revolution that overturned the hierarchies of heaven and earth alike. &lt;b&gt;One does not have to believe any of it&lt;/b&gt;, of course--the Christian story, its moral claims, its metaphysical systems, and so forth. But anyone who chooses to lament that event should also be willing, first, to see this image of the God-man, broken at the foot of the cross, for what it is, in the full mystery of its historical contingency, spiritual pathos, and moral novelty: that tender agony of the soul that finds the glory of God in the most abject and defeated of human forms. Only if one has succeeded in doing this can it be of any significance if one still, then, elects to turn away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highlighted one key phrase that reveals where Hart&amp;#39;s criticisms completely miss the mark. &amp;quot;One does not have to believe any of it&amp;quot; — but I&amp;#39;m afraid that&amp;#39;s the crux of the matter. Is it true? You can declaim all kinds of wonders and miracles and grand moral lessons built on the story, but if it&amp;#39;s not actually &lt;i&gt;true&lt;/i&gt;, the whole program founders. Unless, of course, it's propped up by gullible faith. Then it teeters on, afflicting culture with nonsense and error until the rot expands enough to cause the whole worthless mess to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're seeing that now. The New Atheists are just rapping on that hollow edifice, listening to the echoes (like Hart's essay), and beginning to push a bit. It will fall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/that_hollow_ring_that_tired_ob.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/7ddMOm7zoAU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272311301655"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/bye-bye_mcleroy_hello_dunbar.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/75022c726405fe54</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Bye-bye McLeroy, Hello Dunbar</title><published>2010-04-26T19:10:29Z</published><updated>2010-04-26T19:10:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/ghIhmUg1cS4/bye-bye_mcleroy_hello_dunbar.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/bye-bye_mcleroy_hello_dunbar.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Arch-creationist dentist Don McLeroy is limping and quacking his way off the Texas Board of Education, but there's still plenty of crazy left behind. Cynthia Dunbar recently appeared on a far right-wing radio show to preach her revisionist history, her dislike of atheists and Christians who aren't part of her sect, and plead for more god in the schools. &lt;a href="http://tfninsider.org/2010/04/26/dunbar-takes-new-trip-on-extremism-train/"&gt;Texas Freedom Network provides a synopsis&lt;/a&gt;; listen to the actual show at the peril of your sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theamericanview.com/index.php?id=1645" rel="nofollow"&gt;Speaking last week on a far-right talk show, The American View,&lt;/a&gt; (read &lt;a href="http://www.theamericanview.com/index.php?id=5" rel="nofollow"&gt;more about the show here&lt;/a&gt;) Dunbar — a Richmond Republican representing a state board district that stretches from west of Houston to Austin — attacked public education and even the religious faith of people who don’t agree with her. She also repeated her infamous attack on President Obama as a terrorist sympathizer. And as the state board prepares to take a final vote next month on social studies curriculum standards for public schools, Dunbar suggested that supporters of separation of church and state don’t understand the Constitution and that the drafters of the First Amendment had no concerns “whatsoever” for the nonreligious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught a bit of the beginning, when the announcer/interview is shouting out his vision of &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; American View — there is only one — and was amused at one thing. He&amp;#39;s harping on the usual quasi-religious veneration of the Founding Fathers, when he makes it clear that he&amp;#39;s not talking about &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; Founding Fathers, the ones tainted by that Enlightenment nonsense, but the &lt;i&gt;original&lt;/i&gt; founders, the ones who settled on this continent in the 17th century, and who put God, God, God, God, and God in everything. Merely being 230 years behind the times is insufficient for these guys — they want to roll the calendar back at least 400 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not “Frontline explores the controversy”, because among real scientists there is no controversy. Not “a movement for safer vaccines”, because the proponents of such a movement would respect scientific consensus over misguided ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontline&lt;/em&gt;, as usual, is calling it like it is. Editors, watch and learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/BASSboard.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/BASSboard.jpg" alt="" title="BASSboard" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(More after the jump)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group was wonderful, the questions they asked were really interesting, and I got to meet some of the commenters on this site whom we’ve all gotten to know over the years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look!  It’s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/category/richard-wade/"&gt;Richard Wade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Richard.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Richard.jpg" alt="" title="Richard" width="500" height="667"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;Siamang&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Siamang.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Siamang.jpg" alt="" title="Siamang" width="500" height="667"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re real people.  From the Internet.  Isn’t that amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random: As we were heading to dinner after the talk, Siamang showed me the Star Walk application on his iPad.  Now, I must have one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How awesome is that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the Los Angeles area, you should attend BASS meetings.  You can &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2200742119"&gt;find out more about them here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently they've been wrong all these years when they said that Jesus lives in every man's heart. He actually lives in the lung. I guess that's all the more reason for smokers to quit smoking. You wouldn't want to smoke out Jesus, would you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least this sort of pareidolia makes it difficult for believers to show up to worship, although if this patient's identity is ever revealed it wouldn't surprise me if he became known as some sort of miracle holy man.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/jesus_dwells_not_in_your_heart_but_rathe.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/v1BFHHNiZOc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272309091205"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=175900">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/da71a71d7956caad</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="bisphenol-A"/><category term="BPA"/><category term="BPA-free"/><category term="fda"/><category term="food containers"/><category term="Food Safety Bill"/><category term="lead-free"/><category term="lunch box"/><title type="html">If the Food Safety Bill Won't Ban BPA, We Will: 10 BPA-Free Food Containers and Lunch Boxes</title><published>2010-04-26T18:29:31Z</published><updated>2010-04-26T18:29:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/if-the-food-safety-bill-wont-ban-bpa-we-will-10-bpa-free-food-containers-and-lunchboxes/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/25/AR2010042503408.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and several food industry and big business interest groups are threatening to stop support of the Food Safety Bill unless it cuts out a ban on containers containing bisphenol-A (BPA). The bill is designed to give the Food and Drug Administration greater regulatory power over food manufacturers and farmers, in order to prevent food contamination. But the amendment to include a ban on BPA in food and beverage containers is highly controversial, causing many in the food industry to refuse to support the bill at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BPA is a chemical found in polycarbonate plastic – it’s in water bottles, credit cards, plastic bags, metal can linings, and many other products we commonly use. Many studies have linked the chemical with breast cancer, developmental and reproductive problems – and it’s on Canada’s federal list of toxic substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not a ban on BPA passes in legislation, you can still try to avoid it at home. Check out our gallery of BPA-free lunch boxes and food containers to keep your leftovers and lunches safe from this controversial chemical:&lt;/p&gt;

But, this has been a bit of a bittersweet week for me.  Before I left for Anaheim I learned that an old friend of mine is dying of a very painful and invasive cancer.  There is very little doubt in my mind that he will be dead by the time I return to MRU. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

While I have done my best to make my peace with him and this, he has been at the front of my thoughts.  You see, I met him when I was a much greener, 19 year old Isis.  He was 20 years older than me.  A real giant of a man with dark hair and eyes, more than six feet tall and 300 pounds, and a paramedic.  As I look back at my career, he was one of the important people who made me who I am.  He taught me that I am the only one who ever needs to know that I am afraid.  He taught me to not let my hands shake.  He taught me to swallow my nerves and keep my focus on the task at hand.  He was patient with me and made me believe that if I am confident, others will put their trust in me.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After an event at the meeting, a colleague came up to me and said, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know how you did that so calmly.&amp;quot;  I replied to her, &amp;quot;Are you kidding?  I was trying not to pee my pants the entire time but no one but  me needed to know that I was afraid.&amp;quot;  And this all made me remember again how fortunate I have been to have him as a mentor.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, what's the point of all of this?  You may remember that Marty Frank and I have a friendly Twitter wager.  Yesterday I promised $1 to the Porter Minority Development Fund of the APS to every new follower I gained on Twitter.  Then Marty wrote this in my comments section:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Isis, you are both beautiful and brilliant. You have shown me how the web can be used both for fun and a good cause. I greatly appreciate your offer to influence this battle by using the all mighty buck. I would like to raise your offer by the all might two buck. I guess that is appropriate since California is the home of "2 buck chuck." My offer is $2.00 per new follower up to a max of $1000. To help me get there, I invite your science blog followers to follow me through Wednesday at ExecDirectorAPS on Twitter. That is the quickest way for me to get 500 new followers. 

However, that is not all I propose we do to raise funds for the Porter Minority Development Fund. I invite your followers, and I will also invite followers of the APS Fecebook and Twitter pages to go directly to the APS website (www.the-aps.org) and click "donate" to help us to increase diversity in science. 

Lastly, for those of you attending EB, stop in at the APS Office in the Marriott, Orange County Ballroom, Salon 1 and drop off a personal check in support of the Porter Minority Development Program.

Whether Isis or I win in our battle royal, we both know that in the end, our minority trainees and our efforts to increase diversity will be the real winners.

Isis, feel free to post som&lt;/em&gt;e of these comments on your ScienceBlog page and in your personal Twitter feed. &lt;/blockquote&gt; Last night I did a lot of thinking about all of this. I am who I am because I had great mentors. The Porter Development Fund provides mentors to minority students traveling to this very large national meeting - a meeting that can be overwhelming for anyone who is attending for the first time.  I have had the honor of meeting some of the Porter Fellows and they are outstanding scientists.  Some of the folks who have been Porter fellows are still attending this meeting many years later.  So, I can&amp;#39;t in good faith use this program to win a Twitter bet when I know I could just give them $500.  I also can&amp;#39;t not give them the full $500 just because people don&amp;#39;t follow my tweets.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, I will work with the APS to simply donate my $500 to the fund.  I would encourage you to visit this website and &lt;a href="http://www.the-aps.org/ebuspprod/apscustomizations/apssubscriptionlisting/tabid/230/default.aspx"&gt;make a donation&lt;/a&gt; to the fund.  I&amp;#39;m still going to kick Marty Frank&amp;#39;s ass at the tweet-off, but at least I will know that someone will still get a mentor even if I don&amp;#39;t.  I also hope you&amp;#39;ll click my blog a lot because Mama now has $500 
to work off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/04/the_man_who_taught_me_to_not_b.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/94zB6oG9qUA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272305128870"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/schaechter/~3/LoqJKtKkgdU/true-or-false-all-metazoans-need-o2.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e30476da84dbe5c3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">True or False: All Metazoans Need O2</title><published>2010-04-26T13:00:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-26T13:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/rcFFTwKu8VA/true-or-false-all-metazoans-need-o2.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/schaechter/~3/LoqJKtKkgdU/true-or-false-all-metazoans-need-o2.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">by Elio I am the Lorax, and I'll yell and I'll shout for the fine things on earth that are on their way out!

When does driving become a significant safety hazard as cognition and motor skills decline?The American Academy of Neurology recently published a Practice Parameter update: Evaluation and management of driving risk in dementia.  This important review provides clinicians and family members with assistance in making an accurate and timely decision.The authors of the guideline review research evidence of a variety of markers for unsafe driving risk.  Some markers have more research support than others.  A standard assessment of driving ability is the on-road driving test.  Mild dementia may not cause significant driving impairment.  On study found that among those with mild dementia, 76% were able to pass an on-road driving test.The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale appears to have the most research support for predicting unsafe driving.  This scale scores six variables: memory, orientation, judgement/problem solving, community affairs, home and hobby activity and personal care.  Subjects with a score of 0 on this test are generally not at increase risk of driving problems.  Scores of 0.5 and higher have been tied to increased risk of accidents and increased rates of failure to pass an on-road driving test.The Mini-mental status score is less clear in predicting driving impairment.  Nevertheless the authors support using a score of 24 out of 30 as a cutoff for examining the need to discontinue driving.The guidelines list a variety of markers for risk that have various levels of research support from highest (level A to lowest level C.  This list is:Clinical Dementia Rating Scale score 0.5 or higher (Level A)Caregiver rating of patient&amp;#39;s driving ability as marginal or unsafe (level B)Recent history of traffic citations (Level C)Recent history of accidents (Level C)Reduced driving mileage--less than 60 miles per week (Level C)Self-reported avoidance of driving situations (Level C)Minimental status scores of 24 or less (Level C)Aggressive/impulsive personality behaviors (Level C)Interestingly, the patient&amp;#39;s self-rating of safe driving ability is not useful.  A patient with dementia is unable to accurately report their driving ability.More comprehensive neuropsychological testing does not appear to provide additional prognostic information.  It can be helpful in estimating severity of dementia which does relate to risk.For those with markers of risk, family should support alternate methods of transportation and urge voluntary surrender of driving  privileges.  For those at high-risk who refuse, referral to the local state Department of Motor Vehicles or a professional driving evaluation should be considered.This guideline paper provides a patient and and a family/caregiver questionnaire that is helpful in assessing the at-risk driver.  Others scales are also included.Photo of Hawaii Sunset Courtesy of Yates PhotographyIverson, D., Gronseth, G., Reger, M., Classen, S., Dubinsky, R., &amp;amp; Rizzo, M. (2010).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Patrick Sauer’s fourth “Read It Like a Man”  weekly column for Blisstree. Find his previous installment on &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/read-it-like-a-man-80s-hair-metal-books/"&gt;“80s Hair Metal” here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter 4: NOLA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans? &lt;a href="http://www.patricksauer.com/index.php/Essays/red-state-rumba-wrap-up-the-city-of-new-orleans.html"&gt;I do&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, it’s truly the happiest place on earth. But last year, due to economic conditions beyond my control (I blame Goldman Sachs for forcing me to play Wii every afternoon throughout 2009), the wife and I weren’t able to make our annual pilgrimage to Jazz Fest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, that situation will be rectified, and thanks to &lt;em&gt;Treme&lt;/em&gt; and a never-ending WWOZ iTunes stream, I’m more excited than ever. On tap are Simon &amp;amp; Garfunkel, a panel discussion with David Simon (hosted by Harry Shearer, ideally conducted as Kent Brockman), Trombone Shorty, Pearl Jam, the softshell crabs at Clancy’s, the oyster and bacon sandwich at Cochon, and general day-drinking debauchery that will keep my BAC and BMI well above medically recommended levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get in the swinging mood, I’ve been revisiting some of my favorite local literary works. New Orleans attracts the eccentric, so naturally it’s a writer’s paradise. This chapter could come in a hundred different versions; terrific titles I won’t be discussing include &lt;em&gt;Rising Tide&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Moviegoer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Awakening&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A Streetcar Named Desire&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;1 Dead in Attic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Yellow Jack&lt;/em&gt;, and any of Anne Rice’s bloody gay vampire series, if that’s what you like to sink your teeth into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never been, you should go. And don’t take my word for it, put your trust in Louis Armstrong: “Way down yonder in New Orleans/In the land of dreamy scenes/There’s a garden of Eden/You know what I mean?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beignet Breakdown:&lt;/strong&gt; Admittedly, Toole’s amazing novel isn’t under the radar, but it’s so good that if you only read one book about New Orleans in your lifetime, make it the one with a protagonist so insufferable that you’ll never look askance at the most obnoxious guy in your office again. For the uninitiated (if you exist),&lt;em&gt; A &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confederacy of Dunes&lt;/em&gt; is the story of Ignatius Reilly, an obese flatulent asexual medieval scholar forced to (gasp) get a job in a plebeian world that fails to recognize his genius. Basically, it’s a series of madcap encounters between Reilly and local pathetic oddballs like his tortured sodden mother, a pornography-selling teenager, a dim-witted stripper with a feisty cockatoo, a group of belligerent fightin’ lesbians, a senile office clerk way gone in dementia, a hapless cop in ridiculous disguises, and a horny “activist” in the Bronx who apparently lusts for Reilly’s lumpy bones. There’s no way to do the story justice in a paragraph, other than to say it’s one of the funniest books in the American canon. (And not English comp “Chaucer is so ribald” funny, but fat-guy-fall-down-go-boom funny.) Here’s a taste from Ignatius: “…When my brain begins to reel from my literary labors, I make an occasional cheese dip.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the amazing things about &lt;em&gt;A Confederacy of Dunces&lt;/em&gt; is that each chapter and sub-chapter move the plot forward. There’s no wasted paper; it’s the &lt;em&gt;African Queen&lt;/em&gt; of books about intolerable corpulent gassy faux-radical Fortuna-obsessed hot dog vendors. There are also couple of interesting backstories that make &lt;em&gt;A Confederacy of Dunces&lt;/em&gt; particularly endearing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* John Kennedy Toole committed suicide 11 years before publication, which only came about because his mother found a faded carbon copy of the manuscript and convinced Walker Percy to read it. It became a cult classic and won the &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/firsttuesday/s2310030.htm"&gt;Pulitzer Prize&lt;/a&gt; in 1981.&lt;br&gt;
* It’s become the book that can’t be adapted, a supreme irony because Reilly’s favorite pastime is attending movies he knows he’ll hate (a.k.a.“filmed abortions that were offenses against any criteria of taste and decency.”) Numerous filmmakers have tried to bring it to the &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2155500"&gt;big screen&lt;/a&gt; and failed. As recently as 2007, a version was in the works with Lily Tomlin, Paul Rudd, Mos Def, and Will Ferrell in a fat suit, but it’s gone the way of all the other productions, including an insane Harold Ramis project that was to star John Belushi and Richard Pryor. Bluto’s fondness for Chicago cuisine and speedballs shitcanned the project, and as Ramis said in &lt;a href="http://www.andheresthekicker.com/index.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;And Here’s the Kicker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “It’s defeated every writer who’s ever tried it over the years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Women Need to Read: &lt;/strong&gt;Regardless of the ancillary factoids, &lt;em&gt;A Confederacy of Dunces&lt;/em&gt; is a must-read for fans of the awesome, whether you set foot in NOLA or not. Toole’s secret weapon is that, in a strange way, he makes Reilly admirable, if not lovable. Wouldn’t we all like to live our lives completely on our own terms? To tell the world what we’re thinking at every turn? Yes, we would. Reilly is such a singular over-the-top character that nobody has ever spent time with anyone like him – a few hours would be grounds for justifiable homicide – but that doesn’t mean we wouldn’t want to be him, if only for one day. &lt;em&gt;A Confederacy of Dunces&lt;/em&gt; is as much New Orleans as crawfish and the Neville Brothers, so read it. Now. It will open your valve and let you revel in telling the “undesirables” to go to hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Letters-New-Orleans-Rob-Walker/dp/1891053019"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Letters From New Orleans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Rob Walker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beignet Breakdown: &lt;/strong&gt;Walker is best known as the man behind the “&lt;a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/features/magazine/columns/consumed/index.html?qa&amp;amp;scp=1-spot&amp;amp;sq=&amp;amp;st=nyt"&gt;Consumed&lt;/a&gt;” column in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, a weekly look at the enjoyable crap that makes us Americans. Right around 2000, Walker and his girlfriend “E.” left Gotham and decamped to New Orleans. He started sending emails of the sights and sounds, little slice-of-life vignettes that give a sense of what life is like down there without being polemical or overly guidebook-y. Told in the first-person, Walker weaves together mythology, conversations, observations, bits of history, unanswered questions, and hilarious moments in time that capture the flavor of the oddity that is New Orleans. One of the reasons it works so well is that it isn’t all reflexive. Walker puts on a skeleton costume and throws out beads while marching in a Carnival parade, attends a jazz funeral after seeing an ad in the paper, and indulges in a long, lazy boozy lunch at old-school coats-and-ties staple &lt;a href="http://www.galatoires.com/"&gt;Galatoire’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Women Need to Read:&lt;/strong&gt; Walker’s book is pre-K (he was there from 2000-03), so his pieces don’t carry the post-storm weariness. He’s certainly not oblivious to the day-to-day realities of most New Orleanians, but his time there wasn’t defined by the destruction of a great American city and the deaths of its citizens. Thus, he’s unencumbered while ruminating on how NOLA is a place of nonconformity that refuses to change come hell or (ahem) high water. It’s a place where a man can get fried pound cake, where former Bill Clinton paramour Gennifer Flowers can reinvent herself as a torch singer, and where levy bonfires are a Christmastime tradition. &lt;em&gt;Letters From New Orleans&lt;/em&gt; is a great primer, a quick read, and Walker distills the Big Easy in a single word better than I ever could: “unselfconsciousness.”&lt;/p&gt;

He became so immersed that his current gig is writing for HBO’s new series &lt;em&gt;Treme&lt;/em&gt;, which is at least one lonely blogger’s dream. Shortly after Katrina, Piazza wrote &lt;a href="http://www.patricksauer.com/index.php/People-More-Interesting-than-I/why-new-orleans-matters.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why New Orleans Matters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an important visceral screed about the “profoundly wounded place.” It had the immediacy of Thomas Paine’s &lt;em&gt;Common Sense&lt;/em&gt;, but deeper truths always come from fiction, so in 2008, he called upon his inner-Charles Dickens and penned the novel &lt;em&gt;City of Refuge&lt;/em&gt;. Similar to &lt;em&gt;Oliver Twist&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Hard Times&lt;/em&gt;, Piazza used rich, sympathetic characters to show that when the sun refuses to shine, the moon turns red with blood, and the new world has yet to be revealed – good luck finding a saint marching anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;City of Refuge&lt;/em&gt; tells the parallel story of two families – one black, one white – and how they deal with Katrina’s aftermath. S.J. Williams, a carpenter and widower from the Lower Nine, waits it out; Craig Donaldson, a Midwest native editing an alternative newspaper, doesn’t. Over the course of six months, both men will be uprooted and moved around the country. Both men bear the scars of Katrina, yet yearn to get back to the thing that has a hold on them, New Orleans. Williams watches his neighbors drown, his community wash away, and has to come to grips with the fact that everything he’s ever known is gone. Donaldson has more resources, but he’s stuck in a Chicago suburb that will have to be his home if he wants to keep his wife and two kids together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Women Need to Read:&lt;/strong&gt; The broad outline is familiar, but it serves Williams and Donaldson because they aren’t archetypes. Their personal journeys – thick with rage, hope, and reality – are what sets this novel apart from the long-faded news coverage and Spike Lee’s great &lt;em&gt;When the Levees Broke&lt;/em&gt;. And as tremendous as &lt;em&gt;Treme &lt;/em&gt;has been so far, &lt;em&gt;City of Refuge&lt;/em&gt; is as-it-happens, so it’s more urgent and perilous. (Although, one suspects Creighton Bernette abides, &lt;em&gt;City of Refuge&lt;/em&gt; is probably on his bookshelf, and I’ll bet you a Hubig’s pie that Piazza had a hand in his “manmade catastrophe, a Federal fuck-up of epic proportions” &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPVMxuoarbg"&gt;rant&lt;/a&gt;.) All told, &lt;em&gt;City of Refuge&lt;/em&gt; even does an better job than Piazza’s first attempt at grappling with Katrina. It proves why New Orleans matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth Week just wrapped, but I encourage anyone headed to NOLA to recycle those beer cans, eat a local lunch (like say a Central Grocery muffuletta, Zapp’s Cajun Crawtator and an Abita turbodog), and if you’re a better person than I am, swing a hammer with Brad Pitt’s &lt;a href="http://www.makeitrightnola.org/"&gt;Make It Right&lt;/a&gt; nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if anyone is out at Jazz Fest, look me up. Say hello. I’ll be the doughy white guy in cargo shorts and flip-flops nodding his head rhythmically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laissez les bon temp rouler.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

First, he's been &lt;a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/04/26/454022/rethinking-our-evolution-via-fossil.html"&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; about his forthcoming book, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencefactory.co.uk/content/authors.php?aid=128"&gt;Written in Stone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Writing about the history of science provides context for what we have come to understand about ancient life and reminds us that science thrives on the constant re-examination of what has already been discovered.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, at the Smithsonian website, an essay on the &lt;a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/specialsections/ecocenter/air/EcoCenter-Air-The-History-of-Air.html"&gt;interplay between evolution and atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The trigger for this rampant gigantism was a peculiar, newly evolved characteristic of plants that drove oxygen levels to as high as 35 percent of the atmosphere during the Late Carboniferous. Lush equatorial forests produced a considerable amount of oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis, but that alone wasn't enough to drive atmospheric oxygen to such high levels. The cause was the chemical compound lignin, which plants use to build themselves up. Bacteria of the time were so inefficient at breaking down lignin in dead plants that they left behind a huge amount of carbon-rich plant material to become sequestered in the swamps (and eventually to transform into the rich coal deposits that gave the Carboniferous its name). Bacteria use oxygen as they break down carbon-rich material, but lignin prevented this process until bacteria evolved the ability to decompose the compound. This biological quirk caused oxygen levels to soar.

&lt;p&gt;The surplus of oxygen allowed amphibians, which take in some of the gas through their skins, to breathe more efficiently and grow to larger sizes. Arthropods breathe in a different way: they possess a network of branching tubes called tracheae that connect small openings in an invertebrate's exoskeleton to its cells, and oxygen seeps through the body via this system. In an oxygen-rich atmosphere, more oxygen could be diffused through this branching network, and this opened up evolutionary pathways that allowed arthropods, too, to grow to gargantuan proportions. The fact that the oxygen would have increased the air pressure as well meant that the large flying insects of the time would have gotten more lift for each beat of their wings, allowing flying arthropods to reach sizes that are structurally impossible for their present-day relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$ \mathcal{L}[\tilde{\phi},\phi] = \tilde{\phi}\left((\partial_t + D_A(r_A - \nabla^2)\right)\phi - u\tilde{\phi}(\tilde{\phi} - \phi)\phi + \tau \tilde{\phi}^2\phi^2. $$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particle physicists of the 1970s would recognize this as the Lagrangian for a &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0370-1573(75)90034-4"&gt;Reggeon field theory&lt;/a&gt; with triple- and quadruple-&lt;a href="http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/27985"&gt;Pomeron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://prd.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v9/i12/p3304_1"&gt;interaction vertices&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Such is the perplexing unity of mathematical science:  formula &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; appears in widely separated fields &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;.  Sometimes, this is a sign that a common effect is at work in the phenomena of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; and those of &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;; or, it could just mean that scientists couldn't think of anything new and kept doing whatever worked the first time.

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/san_andreas.jpg" alt="san_andreas" title="san_andreas" width="200" height="293"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;The actual cleavage &lt;br&gt;that causes earthquakes.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a geek, a skeptic, or a man, then you’ve probably heard that today is &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Boobquake/115608248460905"&gt;Boobquake&lt;/a&gt;: a day for women around the world to show off their cleavage in an attempt to debunk a fundamentalist Iranian cleric who blames natural seismic events on women dressing immodestly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, all that shaking and jiggling in the ground is caused by… well, I don’t need to belabor the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I happily endorse both of these things (the cleavage and the debunking). But I do have one niggling doubt. Bear with me here…&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
First, &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-ml-iran-earthquakes-promiscuity,0,6333394.story"&gt;last week an Islamic cleric in Iran said&lt;/a&gt; that all the earthquakes occurring in that country are caused by women dressing &amp;quot;immodestly&amp;quot;. Yes, this same screwed-up thinking that brought us the Taliban and the idea that burning, throwing acid upon, and beheading women is all their own fault for being, y’know, &lt;em&gt;women&lt;/em&gt;, gives us this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Many women who do not dress modestly … lead young men astray, corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society, which (consequently) increases earthquakes… What can we do to avoid being buried under the rubble?&amp;quot; Sedighi [the cleric] asked during a prayer sermon Friday. &amp;quot;There is no other solution but to take refuge in religion and to adapt our lives to Islam’s moral codes.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got news for you, Sedighi: if I were God, I’d be throwing &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; earthquakes your way for the way you treat women. In fact, I’d send a few thousand mini ones that open the Earth and just swallow up the twinkie clerics who say such profoundly horrid things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serious note: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/09/international-womens-day/"&gt;I’ve said this before&lt;/a&gt;, but it bears repeating: not all cultures are created equal. Any culture that sweepingly and maniacally oppresses half their population is what I would call evil. Moral relativism be damned: that kind of crap is wrong, plain and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the response on the skeptical and science blogs was pretty good; mockery, for the most part, which is what this kind of insanity deserves (Maria at Skepchick, for example, took this opportunity &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/why-boobs-matter-in-skepticism/"&gt;to debunk myths about breasts&lt;/a&gt;). But Blag Hag, a female blogger, came up with an interesting idea: &lt;a href="http://www.blaghag.com/2010/04/in-name-of-science-i-offer-my-boobs.html"&gt;Boobquake&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is for women around the world to show off their assets today, Monday, April 26, in an attempt to debunk the cleric. When there is no earthquake today, it will show the cleric for what he is: a sexist jerk&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mired in an ancient and ridiculous mode of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of Boobquake for many reasons. It’s an excellent display of physical mockery, which is a great way to raise awareness. It also resonates in American culture because we have so many people who are so twisted up about such things morally; I support poking them in the eye with this kind of thing as well. Also, I’m unapologetically a heterosexual man, so c’mon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have a major reservation with this idea as well, and it has to do with the number of earthquakes around the world. &lt;a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqarchives/year/eqstats.php#table_us"&gt;Here is a table&lt;/a&gt; from the USGS giving the number of earthquakes per year listed by magnitude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqarchives/year/eqstats.php#table_us"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/worldquakes_2000-20101.jpg" alt="worldquakes_2000-2010" title="worldquakes_2000-2010" width="610" height="162"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you’d expect, there are very few huge quakes, and a lot of little ones. We expect to rack up maybe one quake more powerful than magnitude 8 in a year, but on average we get one in the magnitude 6 – 6.9 range every couple of days somewhere in the world, and one in the 5 – 5.9 range something like three to five times every day. That’s every few hours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s the weakness in the Boobquake plan. The idea of Boobquake is to debunk the cleric by saying that women can reveal their boobs and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; start a seismic event (ignoring perhaps the tremors caused by geek guys habitually running to their computers every few minutes and checking for updates). But without defining the time period, the earthquake size, and the region in advance, this can actually &lt;em&gt;reinforce&lt;/em&gt; the cleric’s claims! Given the huge tracts of land involved, no matter when women of the world unveil their decolletage, there is bound to be a magnitude 5 quake within an hour or so of the event, and a mag 6 quake within a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also know that supernatural thinking makes people see correlations where none exist, and to also retroactively assign credit after an event to something that happened before it. They cling desperately to such measures like a drowning man to a life preserver. And when the parameters (like time and size) aren’t defined in advance, that makes uncritical thinking easier. If there is even a modest earthquake today, then that cleric can declare victory. If there’s a big quake, then it’s more like sending that drowning man a motorboat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still and all, this is perhaps a minor complaint given the positive nature of the cause itself. I really like the idea of web-based activism, especially when it comes to rallying a lot of people to make a clear statement… and in this case, the more people who see that cleric for the fool he is, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I stand with my XX-oriented friends against the neolithic thinking of gender-oppressing religions. As Ben Franklin would say were he here today: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang lifted and separated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="footnote"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr width="30%" align="left"&gt;

"The law in nations with a well-developed judiciary does not force anyone to testify against a child, a father, against other people close to the suspect," Castrillon told RCN radio.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Um... Castrillon is 80 years old, so he probably is not familiar with the internet abbreivation, IANAL.  But he should be.  Because this statement was not just despicable, it was profoundly stupid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a nugget of truth in this when there is no prospect for the crime to be repeated, i.e. a person would typically not be prosecuted for failing to report a past crime of their spouse after finding out about it.  But if you know another crime is imminent, you are not off the hook, even if it is a family member.  That's called "conspiracy".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And family members I am pretty sure &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be compelled to testify.

This is notable, and somewhat more than standard political misbehavior, in that Krauthammer is actually a psychiatrist. Some examples:
-"Now, I cannot testify to Howard Dean's sanity before this campaign, but five terms as governor by a man with no visible tics and no history of involuntary confinement is pretty good evidence of a normal mental status. When he avers, however, that 'the most interesting' theory as to why the president is 'suppressing' the Sept. 11 report is that Bush knew about Sept. 11 in advance, it's time to check on thorazine supplies." (Washington Post, 12/5/03)
-"Well, it looks as if Al Gore has gone off his lithium again." (Fox Special Report, 5/25/04)

And yet at other times, Krauthammer has disavowed precisely this sort of stuff, writing:
As a former psychiatrist, I know how difficult it is to try to understand the soul of even someone you have spent hundreds of hours alone with in therapy. To think that one can decipher the inner life of some distant public figure is folly.

Even the experts haven't a clue.

Here are 5 common stories you’ll hear about breasts and the facts behind them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Underwire Bras Cause Cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still periodically get this spam and I bet you do too! It appears to have started with a book called &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/product/0895296640/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_helpful?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;coliid=&amp;amp;showViewpoints=1&amp;amp;colid=&amp;amp;sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending"&gt;Dressed to Kill&lt;/a&gt;, written by two medical anthropologists, Soma Grismaijer and Sydney Ross Singer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Skepboobs.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Skepboobs" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Skepboobs-300x236.jpg" alt="" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book claimed that underwire bras compress the lymphatic system under the arms and breasts, supposedly causing a buildup of toxins. This has been widely refuted by several sources. The &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/MED/content/MED_6_1x_Underwire_Bras.asp?sitearea=MED"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not know of any epidemiologic studies published in scientific journals that suggest bras directly contribute to breast cancer risk or that lymphatic compression by bras might cause breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read more after the fold!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Staring at boobs is good for men’s health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a claim that is often attributed (wrongly) to the New England Journal of Medicine. &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/photo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="photo" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/photo-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In fact, this study was never published in any medical journal. According to &lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/humor/iftrue/breasts.asp"&gt;Snopes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article referred to above was not printed in The New England Journal of Medicine or any other major medical journal. It is, in fact, a slight reworking of a piece that has run on at least two occasions in that celebrated tabloid Fountain of Truth, the Weekly World News (13 May 1997 and 21 March 2000) and has escaped into the wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, the Weekly World News, that bastion of fine journalism… Sorry guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.&lt;strong&gt; Silicone breast implants increase your risk for cancer and other disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/193030.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="193030" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/193030-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/BreastImplants/ucm063719.htm#2"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; has approved silicone gel-filled breast implants made by Allergan and Mentor.&lt;br&gt;
The website does warn of several possible risks to breast implants, including the danger of rupture, a potential impact to a woman’s ability to breast feed, either by reducing or eliminating milk production and routine &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Photo-482.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Photo 482" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Photo-482-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;mammograms may be more difficult with breast implants. But no danger from the contents of the implants themselves, saline or silicone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Your breast size determines how much breast milk you can produce. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breast milk is determined by the milk glands in the breast; breast size is dependent on the amount of supporting &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Photo-on-2010-04-25-at-21.58.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Photo on 2010-04-25 at 21.58" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Photo-on-2010-04-25-at-21.58-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;fibrous and fatty issue in the breast. So women with larger breasts won’t necessarily produce more breast milk. Some women do have trouble producing milk or find it more painful or uncomfortable than others but that is not related to breast size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Astronaut2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As far as I can tell, the breast size/milk relationship is nothing more than another way to add to the insecurities that plague women with smaller breasts. You’re ‘less of a woman’ and ‘less of a mother.’ Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Parasites can live in unwashed underwear and cause larvae to grow in your breasts. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh dude. The images for this one on &lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/medical/breastrash.asp"&gt;Snopes&lt;/a&gt; are hideous. I don’t recommend you look at them. Suffice it to say, they involved photoshopping a breast together with a lotus seed pod to make it seem like some sort of nasty parasite had infected a breast. There’s also a video floating about which actually does show doctors &lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/medical/graphics/breastrash.mpg"&gt;removing parasites from a woman’s breast&lt;/a&gt; (again, I &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/boobs.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="boobs" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/boobs-300x234.jpg" alt="" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;don’t recommend watching it). This is a genuine video but is caused by the larvae of the Tumbu fly. According to a 2004 study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutaneous myiasis of the breast due to infestation by the larva of &lt;em&gt;Cordylobia anthropophaga&lt;/em&gt; is rare. To the best of our knowledge, only one case has been reported in the English literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_4146.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_4146" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_4146-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="175"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I’ll wait for you to come back from screaming into your pillows. Sorry about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else is out there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only touched on a few myths here. I could have done a whole section on just &lt;a href="http://www.breastfeeding.com/all_about/all_about_myths1.html#M1_1"&gt;breastfeeding myths&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.health.com/health/condition-article/0,,20215558,00.html"&gt;breast cancer myths&lt;/a&gt;. Breasts are, no pun intended, a touchy subject and people can sometimes be embarrassed to discuss. This taboo means that it’s easier for bad information to get out there and stay in the public consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, keep in mind, there are lots of reasons that we need to keep breasts in the forefront of our minds when it comes to skeptical discussions. Our boobs depend on it!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Masala Skeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272297813312"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2010/04/a_worrisome_plan_to_make_the_e.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f08d6521058cfb8b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Geology"/><title type="html">A worrisome plan to make the earth move.</title><published>2010-04-26T16:50:31Z</published><updated>2010-04-26T16:50:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/qfNMU43Sqec/a_worrisome_plan_to_make_the_e.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2010/04/a_worrisome_plan_to_make_the_e.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has come to my attention that a number of people are &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/highlyallochthonous/2010/04/boobquake_a_slightly_silly_tes.php"&gt;risking catastrophic seismic activity&lt;/a&gt; today by exposing n00bs.&lt;/p&gt;

They will now be posted on Mondays and Thursdays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Richard,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.  I have been transitioning away from religion for some time now (it started in high school), and it has taken nearly 7 years for me to come to terms with my atheism.  In fact I have only recently been able to call it by that name.  This transition has been difficult for a number of reasons, but particularly from the familial guilt that I grew up with.  The idea of living without sin was ingrained in my brother and I from a young age, and getting to and living in heaven for eternity was a goal that we discussed frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;em&gt;The God Delusion,&lt;/em&gt; I was struck by the chapter on children becoming indoctrinated in their parent’s religion, usually by means of fear.  During my childhood, I was regularly told by my parents that they would be judged on how I lived my life.  This was an awful prospect for me.  Hell was a scary destination, but personally going to hell was outweighed by the thoughts of my parents being sent there through my actions or sinful behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to lie to them about my transitioning convictions, and I believe that they suspect that I have fallen away from Christianity since leaving their house (I got my B.S. in zoology and teach science), but I am still mortified about their reaction to my atheism.  I know that it will come about somehow, but I would like it to be on my terms.  How can I tell them that I have not become anything other than without a god?  Or that this decision was my own and that the way they raised me is how I still live, apart from their faith?  Thank you again for your help, I understand that there are many others in similar situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Freethinker Now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Freethinker,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the ultimate guilt trip.  Parents have been emotionally blackmailing their children for millennia by blaming their own physical, emotional or social suffering on their children’s behavior, but to use the threat of eternal torment is the most contemptible version of this ploy I’ve ever encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any level of severity, the “you’re doing this to me” game is a destructive manipulation that uses people’s best traits against them. It exploits our natural human instinct to protect our family even at our own risk. Most people can accept punishment for their own transgressions far more easily than to watch others take that punishment in their stead. In the movies, only when the villain points the gun at the hero’s child, spouse or parents, does the hero feel helplessly compelled to do the villain’s bidding.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the despicable tactic you have described, the parents play the roles of both the hostage and the hostage taker, and they are threatened with terrible consequences unless the children submit to the hostage taker’s demands. This fills the children with fear, guilt, confusion, and later, resentment and anger. Although resentment and anger can be very unhealthy if the children get permanently stuck in it, it can be a necessary step toward a healthy liberation from the undeserved fear and guilt that has been used to manipulate them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much your parents actually believe in this idea of judgment against them is not clear. They may fully believe it, or they may know it’s just a powerful way of controlling children, or they may see it as something in between. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s really beside the point. Your task is to fully free yourself. You must break the spell.  Now as an adult, whatever power this scheme has over you is whatever power you give it.  Even though you no longer believe that your parents will suffer in hell because of you, you’re still worried about &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; belief in that. So you are still feeding it power, and are still at the effect of the emotional blackmail. You cannot continue to try to protect your parents from their own beliefs. They have to take responsibility for that, and see to their own salvation. Their religion provides them with means to their redemption regardless of their child’s conduct, and they know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freethinker, I suggest that you wait a while before you tell your parents about your non-belief, but not because they are not ready. Wait because I think that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are not ready. You had seven years of difficult struggling to free yourself from so many fearful and guilt-laden ideas, but you’re still new to accepting your atheism, only just recently being able to use that word. You describe yourself as still transitioning in your convictions, and so you may still have some insecurity about those convictions. You may not yet have clear and confident responses ready for your parents’ objections, challenges and manipulations, and they will very likely use them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, one way out of fear and guilt is the stage of resentment and anger, but it is important to eventually heal from that as well.  Only after your resentment and anger at how your love and loyalty were misused have subsided should you consider telling them about your unbelief.  You will need the serenity that comes from having completed your own full liberation.  During that conversation, you’ll need to be able to calmly say something like, &lt;em&gt;“Mom and Dad, I’m living a life that reflects the good values that you taught me. I’m not ashamed or afraid, and you don’t need to be ashamed or afraid either.  Your relationship with your god is up to you, not me.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, consider that you don’t actually have to &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; tell them. There are some things that are nobody’s business but your own, and this is one of them. You don’t owe them this truth. It belongs to you, not them.  Whether you tell them or not, focus on your own healing and your own recovery.  You’ve done a remarkable job so far. Keep going until you’re completely free. &lt;/p&gt;

of posts&lt;/a&gt; that claimed to talk about finger trees. Unfortunately, I really
botched it. I'd read a bunch of data structure papers, and managed to get
myself thoroughly scrambled. What I wrote about was &lt;em&gt;distantly&lt;/em&gt; related
to finger trees, and it was useful to help understand how fingertrees work -
but it was not, in any way, shape, or form, actually a description of
fingertrees. Since then, I've been meaning to write a proper post explaining
finger trees - but with the work on my book, and with chaos at work, I just
haven't had the time. This time, in order to do my damnedest to make sure that
I don't screw it up again, I'm basically go to describe finger trees over a
couple of posts by walking through the best finger-tree paper that I could
find. The paper is &lt;a href="http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.html"&gt;"Finger Trees: a
simple general-purpose data structure", by Ralf Hinze and Ross Patterson.&lt;/a&gt;
This &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; by the paper that introduced the structure, but I'm not
sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The point of finger trees is pretty simple. It's very similar to the point
of zippers. Programming in functional languages is terrific. As I've described
before, there are a lot of advantages to writing functional code. But there are also
a lot of places where a naive implementation of an algorithm using a functional
data structure is dreadfully inefficient. Functional code may be prettier, more maintainable,
and more reusable - but imperative code is frequently much more efficient. When you're
doing an operation that, conceptually, modifies a piece of a complex data structure, 
then functional code can really suck. Finger trees give you a way around that - for many common updatabale data structures, you can build finger-tree versions that are very close to or fully as good as imperative, updating structures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2010/04/finger_trees_done_right_i_hope.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2010/04/finger_trees_done_right_i_hope.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/7YUP_9k8VTc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272294809946"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2010://2.4603">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2c8981471c17490d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Assault on Science" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Legal Issues" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Slightly Off Topic" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="dna" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="DNA"/><category term="creationism" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="creationism"/><category term="legal" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="legal"/><title type="html">University pays damages to Indian tribe for alleged misuse of DNA</title><published>2010-04-26T15:13:12Z</published><updated>2010-04-26T17:32:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/04/university-pays.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported a week or so ago that Arizona State University had paid damages to an Indian tribe for misuse of DNA that had been collected by a University researcher (&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/us/22dna.html" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, with further analysis &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/us/22dnaside.html" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The tribe claimed that the researcher, Therese Markow, had obtained permission to use the DNA for one purpose but then used it for other purposes.  That is, she had not obtained informed consent for wider-ranging research than the original research, which was to study diabetes among the members of the tribe. The Times did not give enough information about the consent given by the Indians to allow a judgment as to whether Professor Markow acted unethically, but she insists that she did not, in part because it is impossible to tell in advance the direction of a research project.  Indeed, it is easy to conjecture that the University settled the suit because contesting it would damage its image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the issues that rankled the tribe was that the DNA was used to cast doubt on their creation myth. Forgive me, but their creation myth is as obviously wrong as the more-widespread creation myth of many Biblical literalists.  It needs to have doubt cast upon it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act was not a factor in the lawsuit, the case reminds me of nothing more than that of &lt;a href="http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/kman/" rel="external "&gt;Kennewick Man&lt;/a&gt; (see also &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennewick_Man" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). In that case, an Indian tribe  stymied the efforts of anthropologists to study a fascinating fossil that had been discovered in the Pacific Northwest and at least appeared not to have Indian features. In the end, the Army Corps of Engineers destroyed the archaeological site.&lt;/p&gt;

Like, wow. Didn't know we had that power.

Of course, it may be because I framed Blum's book, The Poisoner's Handbook, as a kind of ideal case study in how to communicate science. But, well, it is. If I give the book an endorsement during the show, it's because it is richly deserved.

Blum does a fantastic job of embedding science within a narrative driven by characters and human drama (in this case, the 1920s scientific quest to catch poisoners, who were previously operating with relative impunity). As an author, she thereby ensures that she will both educate readers about chemistry--on the show, for instance, we discuss the crucial difference between ethyl and methyl alcohol, which had no small policy and human health import during Prohibition--and also intrigue and entertain them.

There are many, many would-be science communicators who should take a lesson from Blum's success. And indeed, in one part of the show that was cut, she told me that Hollywood may be interested in the story she's created.

&lt;p&gt;I disagree with him. I think in fact it’s more likely that an aggressive alien race would create self-replicating robot probes that will disperse through the galaxy and destroy all life &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;more likely&lt;/em&gt; still doesn’t equate to &lt;em&gt;likely&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve been thinking about this on and off for a few days, in fact, and I suspect a likely answer to Fermi’s Paradox — &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox"&gt;&amp;quot;Where are they?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; — is simply that intelligent life that is capable of interstellar flight doesn’t last long enough to colonize other stars. That would neatly explain why, if stars with planets are common (which we know is almost certainly true), and the conditions for life to arise are relatively common (again, that seems very likely), the galaxy isn’t overrun with life. It should be by now; it’s had billions of years to have space-faring races evolve and colonize the whole shebang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in reality, Hawking’s idea and the one I go over in my book are probably wrong. But I’m an optimist, and I can hope that the reason the galaxy isn’t softly humming with life (that’s Carl Sagan’s poetic phrase) is that we’re the first, or at least the first in a while. That would mean we still get our chance. It’s a big responsibility, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to be clear, that’s not snark, even if this post started out a bit snarky. I’m serious. We may be utterly, entirely alone in a galaxy filled with planets that outnumber people on our own planet 50 to 1. That idea gives me the creeps more than the idea of hostile aliens bent on sterilizing each of those planets. But at least it gives us a good chance to spread and see the place a bit. I’d like to think that in a hundred generations, this arm of the Milky Way will boast a thousand human planets. It’s a nice thought.&lt;/p&gt;

But I heard it first from that man about town &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/JoshACagan"&gt;Josh Cagan&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Vision is arguably our most (intentionally) utilized sensory system, so its pretty important to figure out how it works. And it's what David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel set out to investigate starting in the late 1950s. Ultimately, their work would get them a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, in 1981.

As ClimateWire reports:
The Senate climate bill sits on the brink of collapse today after the lead Republican ally threatened to abandon negotiations because of a White House push to simultaneously overhaul the nation's immigration policies.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has been under fire from conservatives for months for helping to shepherd a Democrat-led bid to tackle global warming via a "grand compromise" on energy. But on Saturday afternoon, he signaled the partnership could soon be over.
Graham promised to leave President Obama and Senate Democrats standing at the altar after they started pushing last week for a comprehensive immigration reform bill that he called "nothing more than a cynical political ploy" headed into the 2010 midterm elections.

Oh boy. Need I say that this flap augurs extremely poorly for the chances of getting a bill passed any time soon? The politics of this are hard enough already, and now we're stopping before we even got started. Quoted in the ClimateWire piece, I think Tom Friedman puts it best:

So it’s unfortunate that the best known book on the subject of evolution is On the Origin of Species. Because the theory of evolution is not about the origin of life.

A recent article by Paz-y-Miño and Espinoza made that rookie mistake. And they got called on it. And quite right, too. The letter writers, Rice and colleagues, however, are upset not just because Paz-y-Miño and Espinoza use the theory too loosely. 

They’re scared. 

The first reason they give to separate evolution from the question of the origin of life (a.k.a. abiogenesis) is:

(S)tudents often hold more tightly to a supernatural account for the origin of life than they do to a supernatural account for how the diversity of life arose(.)

This sounds dangerously like self-censorship.

I can almost hear Basil Fawlty’s voice in my head: “Whatever you do, don’t mention the origin of life!”

We talk about the branching pattern of classification as evidence for evolution. We talk about commonalities of living things as evidence for evolution. When you examine those pieces of evidence for evolution, it is a logical inference that life originated on this planet once. To completely separate natural selection and abiogenesis does a disservice to both.

Darwin, as usual, was ahead of the game and saw the two were logically connected. The last chapter of Origin (first edition), he wrote:

(A)ll living things have much in common, in their chemical composition, their germinal vesicles, their cellular structure, and their laws of growth and reproduction. ... Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.

Rice and colleagues also argue that abiogenesis is more the domain of physics and chemistry than biology. This sounds like an easy excuse for timid teachers: “Not my department, have a nice day.”

Scientists working on the origin of life problem are going to be testing hypotheses that life originated following the regular laws of chemistry and physics. That is, they will be testing materialistic hypotheses. Yes, some people are going to have problems with that for religious reasons, and won’t like that science does not allow for the immaterial. Yes, scientists currently have fewer responses to religious objections to abiogenesis.

But there is no point in trying to hide the science around the origin of life under the rug in an effort to get people to buy into evolution. It’s cowardly way to teach science.

I basically responded that this question is thousands of years  old – every generation, apparently, has felt this about the youth of  their time. Things are not necessarily getting worse, although  confirmation bias and a narrow perspective may make it seem so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generation question aside – this also raises the question of how  to make science and skepticism more popular in general, but especially  with the next generation. A listener then sent me a link to the  following article: &lt;a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html"&gt;Why Nerds are Unpopular&lt;/a&gt;.  The author writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of people who were nerds in school, and they  all tell the same story: there is a strong correlation between being  smart and being a nerd, and an even stronger inverse correlation between  being a nerd and being popular. Being smart seems to make you  unpopular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why? Basically, the author argues that smart kids invest their  time and energy into the things that they like. Meanwhile, being popular  in high school is a full-time job, requiring a great deal of time and  effort – time the nerds are unwilling to commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="More..." src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt=""&gt;I found his argument  unconvincing. The article goes into many other issues, about the roots  of teenage angst, that you may find interesting, but I want to focus on  this primary point – nerds are unpopular because they don’t invest time  in being popular. While this is likely to be one factor, there are  others that I can readily identify from my own experience. The answer,  as much as there is one, is multifactorial and there will be a different  mix of reasons in different kids, different schools, and different  cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s not avoid the obvious – many nerds are socially  awkward. Having a high IQ does not necessarily mean you have a high EQ  (emotional quotient) or that you are politically savvy. I am not  suggesting that all nerds fit this stereotype, but some certainly do,  and to varying degrees. To some extent, people will follow their talents  because it’s the path of least resistance. So for the book-smart but  socially inept kid – of course they will choose to value and excel  intellectually, and devalue and ignore social networking, fashion, and  physical pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you think about it, you probably knew  in school, and still know, people who combine talents in these various  realms to different degrees. There are smart athletes, and smart but  socially savvy kids, and even not-so-smart nerds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must also  consider that popularity is also complex – because there are cliques and  subcultures. Many kids will seek out and network with other kids who  share their interests (again, to varying degrees). School also forces us  to socialize to some extent across whatever social bounds form. But in  general the jocks hang out with the jocks and the nerds hang out with  the nerds. From this subcultures emerge. Kids seek to be popular within  their subculture, while simultaneously trying to raise the status of  their group. So nerds often try to be popular among their fellow nerds.  Sometimes this can result in desperately isolated cliques – sacrificing  and even denigrating any popularity in the broader culture in order to  fit in with a small group of  like-minded compatriots. Having trouble  fitting in – you can go goth (for example) and give up on any broader  popularity, but at least you will instantly fit in with the other goths.  This, unfortunately, is also the root of cults – cults provide instant  acceptance at the expense of a rigid “us vs them” ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subcultures  also mean that interests and experiences reinforce the separation of the  subcultures. The Big Bang Theory is a good representation of this – the  nerds on the show share common interests and knowledge which becomes  part of the glue of their subculture. They can share inside jokes about  Star Wars and LOTR, discuss science, and entertain themselves with jokes  about the low intellectual capacity of the muscular jock boyfriend of  the pretty girl next door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultures have inertia. Kids have their  own culture, and many subcultures, and they create awaiting receptacles  as kids try to fit in somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So “popularity” is a socially  complex and multifaceted phenomenon, and there is therefore no single  cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what of the original question – how do we as activist  skeptics make science, intellectualism, and skepticism more generally  accepted in our own culture? It is not, as some would argue, hopeless. I  offer as examples the fact that not every school has the same culture. I  went to a prep school, and I can tell you that the culture was somewhat  flipped – the academically successful kids tended to be more generally  popular. There were still subcultures and different groups with  different interests and characters – but generally, being smart was  considered a virtue. The culture of the school generally respected hard  work, integrity, and achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an artificial situation  in a way – a selective population, both self-selective, and selected by  their parents (who were probably generally overachievers) and the  school itself. But it demonstrates that children will not inevitably  form a subculture that generally values beauty and athleticism and  devalues intelligence. The culture of this school was that achievement  was valued in all its forms, but especially intellectual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other  countries also have different cultures. In Asia, generally, scholastic  achievement and hard work is more highly valued by the broader culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  bottom line is this – don’t assume that an American public school  experience is universal and broadly applicable social lessons can be  derived from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me what this means is that we can slowly move  the culture in the direction of valuing smarts and even nerdiness. Bill  Gates has done this, to some degree – we now celebrate the alpha nerd.  Kids see wealthy powerful nerds with the attractive mates, and they get  the message. Computers have done this – once the sole domain of nerds,  they are now chic. Even cheerleaders will whip out their iPhones to text  their friends – using a computer device to communicate? Twenty years  ago that was unbelievably nerdy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still fighting the  sit-com and TV culture. While I have seen more programs celebrating  smarts (CSI, The Mentalist, Jimmy Neutron, Mythbusters, etc.) we are  still plagued by the sit-com nerd stereotype, and the general promotion  of an anti-intellectual culture, especially among kids. There is room  for improvement there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also – we have to consider that we have  various goals. We would like to swell the ranks of those kids who value  intelligence and reason, but also we want to empower those kids who are  already there. Encourage them to pick up their heads and see that smarts  are valued in at least segments of the broader culture. The older they  get, the more being smart is cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think the high-school  culture significantly flips when you get to college. Again, we have a  somewhat selective subpopulation. But also we have a different  subculture. Even if we can’t penetrate high-school culture that much (I  am not saying we can’t, but even if) once kids get to college or even  just into their 20s, when they are really searching for themselves  intellectually, promoting a culture of science and skepticism can have a  great impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the evidence suggests that we are actually  succeeding. The number of people who show up to skeptical meetings is  not only increasing, their average age is dramatically decreasing. We  have a significant following of people in their twenties. Sure – we have  a lot of work to do. But it’s not hopeless. The future, in my opinion,  is bright.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272284794705"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/marys_monday_metazoan_below_an.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/373781b6c6d8ed02</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Organisms"/><title type="html">Mary's Monday Metazoan: Below and above</title><published>2010-04-26T12:41:39Z</published><updated>2010-04-26T12:41:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/krsmVyT9bpc/marys_monday_metazoan_below_an.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/marys_monday_metazoan_below_an.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/04/rugosedfrog.jpeg" width="425" height="460" alt="rugosedfrog.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hoplobatrachus rugulosusis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The only thing I did exclusively for fun was read a pretty depressing novel about slavery, U.K. LeGuin's &lt;i&gt;Powers&lt;/i&gt; (2007).&lt;ul&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2010/04/weekend_fun_18/reggie2.jpg" width="250" height="376" alt="reggie2.jpg"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Represented the Swedish Skeptics off-stage at the &lt;a href="http://nmtrolleri.se"&gt;Nordic Conjuring Championship&lt;/a&gt; in Uppsala, as our organisation sponsored the event. I was surprised to see different competing magicians do the same tricks, and then realised that of course there are fashions in that too. The winner was &lt;a href="http://www.komikerklubben.se/artist6c.htm"&gt;Reggie Simon&lt;/a&gt;, an excellent performer originally from the US, whose act contained wry references to that country's racism and gun-nuttery.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Directed the annual spring cleaning of walkways, greenery and parking lot in my area, then served participating neighbours spicy lentil soup, which was well received.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sat through nearly two hours of little girls prancing about in order to get to my own kid's performance, which was of course stellar. Ballet really is an oasis of girl culture. Dancing, fancy outfits, make-up, and everybody enjoying themselves. Sometimes even more than the audience does.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you, Dear Reader?

&lt;p&gt;But what of the original question – how do we as activist  skeptics  make science, intellectualism, and skepticism more generally  accepted  in our own culture? It is not, as some would argue, hopeless. I  offer  as examples the fact that not every school has the same culture. I  went  to a prep school, and I can tell you that the culture was somewhat   flipped – the academically successful kids tended to be more generally   popular. There were still subcultures and different groups with   different interests and characters – but generally, being smart was   considered a virtue. The culture of the school generally respected hard   work, integrity, and achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an artificial situation  in a way – a selective population,  both self-selective, and selected by  their parents (who were probably  generally overachievers) and the  school itself. But it demonstrates  that children will not inevitably  form a subculture that generally  values beauty and athleticism and  devalues intelligence. The culture of  this school was that achievement  was valued in all its forms, but  especially intellectual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other  countries also have different cultures. In Asia, generally,  scholastic  achievement and hard work is more highly valued by the  broader culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  bottom line is this – don’t assume that an American public  school  experience is universal and broadly applicable social lessons  can be  derived from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me what this means is that we can slowly move  the culture in the  direction of valuing smarts and even nerdiness. Bill  Gates has done  this, to some degree – we now celebrate the alpha nerd.  Kids see  wealthy powerful nerds with the attractive mates, and they get  the  message. Computers have done this – once the sole domain of nerds,  they  are now chic. Even cheerleaders will whip out their iPhones to text   their friends – using a computer device to communicate? Twenty years   ago that was unbelievably nerdy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still fighting the  sit-com and TV culture. While I have seen  more programs celebrating  smarts (CSI, The Mentalist, Jimmy Neutron,  Mythbusters, etc.) we are  still plagued by the sit-com nerd stereotype,  and the general promotion  of an anti-intellectual culture, especially  among kids. There is room  for improvement there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also – we have to consider that we have  various goals. We would like  to swell the ranks of those kids who value  intelligence and reason,  but also we want to empower those kids who are  already there. Encourage  them to pick up their heads and see that smarts  are valued in at least  segments of the broader culture. The older they  get, the more being  smart is cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think the high-school  culture significantly flips when you  get to college. Again, we have a  somewhat selective subpopulation. But  also we have a different  subculture. Even if we can’t penetrate  high-school culture that much (I  am not saying we can’t, but even if)  once kids get to college or even  just into their 20s, when they are  really searching for themselves  intellectually, promoting a culture of  science and skepticism can have a  great impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the evidence suggests that we are actually  succeeding. The  number of people who show up to skeptical meetings is  not only  increasing, their average age is dramatically decreasing. We  have a  significant following of people in their twenties. Sure – we have  a lot  of work to do. But it’s not hopeless. The future, in my opinion,  is  bright.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272283600503"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=175856">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/33b4a58b5b6a0224</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="Bette Midler quote"/><category term="quote"/><category term="Superwoman"/><title type="html">Quote of the Day: Bette Midler's Superwoman</title><published>2010-04-26T11:00:01Z</published><updated>2010-04-26T11:00:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/quote-of-the-day-bette-midler-superwoman/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;My idea of super woman is someone who scrubs her own floors.&lt;/p&gt;

A functioning organization, not simply a group of recognized faculty.&amp;quot;The overarching purpose of Academies is to bring education back as the central focus of academic medicine. They are supposed to have [2]:a mission that advances and supports educatorsa membership composed of distinguished educatorsa formal schoolwide organizational structure with designated leadershipdedicated resources that fund mission-related initiativesIn 2003, there were only 21 Academies in existence in the United States. Since then, Academies are becoming increasingly popular. This paper describes their survey of all 127 U.S. medical schools to determine the state of Academies as of 2008, specifically in the areas of membership, benefits, and funding.ResultsWith an impressive 96% response rate (122 or 127 schools), the authors noted several interesting findings. Although there were tons of interesting descriptive data from the study, here are the main take-home points:There are 36 Academies as of 2008 (year of survey), with 21 created on or after 2004.Surprisingly, less than half of the Academies (16 of 36) required a teaching or educator&amp;#39;s portfolio in the application process. These portfolios are an educator&amp;#39;s way to show value to all the teaching and educational scholarship that they do, which traditional CV&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t convey.Membership benefits primarily are nonmonetary and include: schoolwide recognition (92% of Academies), networking opportunities (78%), participation in faculty development events (50%), importance in promotions and advancement (50%), and mentorship (39%). Faculty development is a central focus of Academies.Members were selected based on standards or criterion-referenced methods (69%) versus a norm-reference where applicants are measured against each other.This article is interesting because of it introduces the concept of Academies in medical schools.The UCSF Academy of Medical Educators was created in 2000 and is going strong. Just sent my application in today. Wish me luck.References[1.] Dewey CM, Friedland JA, Richards BF, Lamki N, Kirkland RT.

The conference sold out all 200 slots, and the audience is a pretty lively bunch.  I was invited here to speak at a breakout session in the afternoon on “Myths and Facts about the LHC” which I trust was entertaining, given all the media attention to the possibility that the LHC will &lt;a href="http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/safety-en.html"&gt;destroy the world by producing a black hole&lt;/a&gt;, that the &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/6318034/Could-the-Large-Hadron-Collider-be-held-back-by-its-own-future.html"&gt;Higgs boson is coming back from the future to prevent its discovery&lt;/a&gt;, and the various notions about CERN in Angels and Demons such as that the lab is using the LHC to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASVeN-58HKk"&gt;create an antimatter superweapon&lt;/a&gt;.  All relatively standard topics for the skeptics…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening talk, but Eugenie Scott, addressed the rather deep question of how skepticism relates to science: is one included in the other?  Do they overlap?   Her conclusion, arrived at with humor, grace, and thoughtful examples, was that science is contained within skepticism, that  the general approach to knowing we call skepticism is applied in the case of science to understanding the natural world.  As a physicist, I need to continually put myself in the mindset of the (mostly) non-physicists in the audience.  Skepticism is to a physicist as natural as breathing…this is not true of everyone in the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Morrison, senior scientist at NASA Ames’ Astrobiology institute, gave a truly mind-boggling talk about the rapidly increasing end-of-the-world-in-2012 phenomenon.  It all started with Nibiru, the planet that the Zetas told a Wisconsin woman, Nancy Lieder, would crash into the earth round about then.  Of course the thing snowballed and led to the movie &lt;a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/2012/"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; (actually the movie appropriated the 2012 meme a few years into prouction).  Morrison has received over 3500 emails about the phenomenon, ranging from death threats against him (because, natch, NASA is covering it all up) to suicide threats (who wants to live to see the end of the world?) and everything in between.  He made a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQqn-zZzbLw"&gt;youtube video&lt;/a&gt; trying to allay fears of the world’s imminent demise.  (Of course I told my session that the LHC was scheduled to resume at full energy on Dec. 21, 2012, the particular date in question.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a difficult choice of parallel sessions to attend, but chose the one on psychics by Karen Stollznow.  And, of all things, I learned something very interesting about quantum physics that I had been blissfully unaware of.  Watch for a future post once I read up on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, Brian Dunning, creator and host of Skeptoid.com, delivered a devastating blow to the myth of the origins of the &lt;a href="http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4201"&gt;Virgin of Guadalupe&lt;/a&gt;, the most pervasive symbol of Catholicism in Mexico.   What becomes clear is that this was another example of the Catholic church appropriating the symbols of the indigenous population it was attempting (ultimately successfully) to convert.   In the beginning, though, he lamented the failure of the skeptical movement as a movement.  He pointed out that all that skepticism can offer is negative: we kill sacred cows and remove the scales from peoples’ eyes.  But how will we save critical thinking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all I found the conference quite eye-opening, and I have realized that we have a long way to go to counter the rising tide of ignorance of science and what it means to adopt a skeptical world view.  Even once-respectable types like &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/author/dunning/"&gt;Bill Nye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://vodpod.com/watch/1974439-video-michio-kaku-on-2012-solar-storm-fox-tv"&gt;Michio Kaku&lt;/a&gt; are starting to fall to the dark side.  Too many think of skepticism as simply disbelief, when all it means is to place rationality at the base of our intellectual foundation.  Help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, Australian law mandates that students receive one hour of religious training per week.  The Christians who run these services get tens of millions of dollars per year to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if parents don’t want their kids wasting their time in these classes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Parents are able to opt-out their children from the religious education class, however &lt;strong&gt;that hour is spent idle&lt;/strong&gt;. My children are separated for this hour from the rest of the class and given computer time. My 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grader and her fellow opt-out students are unsupervised for that hour. Some parents have reported their child sat for the hour in empty hallways, alone.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple days ago, &lt;strong&gt;Dr. John Kaye&lt;/strong&gt; of the Greens party spoke about &lt;a href="http://www.theleader.com.au/news/local/news/general/churches-revolt-over-pilot-ethics-classes-in-primary-schools/1804033.aspx"&gt;an alternative for students who opt out of religious training&lt;/a&gt;: ethics classes.  He framed it in terms of the &lt;a href="http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20100421046"&gt;religious-training-or-nothing&lt;/a&gt; dilemma many parents face:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… The practice is discriminatory and wasteful and is founded only in the conviction held by some religions that their beliefs should hold a privileged position. That is not only clearly unacceptable in a multi-cultural and multi-faith free society but also deeply offensive to those who do not share confidence in the infallibility of the religious beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Philip Cam from the University of New South Wales developed the course materials that invite students to develop responses to challenging ethical dilemmas. &lt;strong&gt;Ethics or the science of moral reasoning is a well developed area of study and has been taught successfully in schools around the world.&lt;/strong&gt; The developmental consequences for students are well documented and always positive. It is clearly understood that the course does not substitute for the values and ethical reasoning that are already taught across the curriculum in public education. &lt;strong&gt;It is surprising and alarming to watch a number of churches and religious organisations seek to stop the trial.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, what?  Churches and religious groups are &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; ethics training?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.makeastand.org.au/campaign/index.stw?campaign_id=32"&gt;Yep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Parents and their children should not be forced to choose between ethics classes and SRE [special religious education].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more programmes the Government offers at the same time as school scripture, the fewer students who will be enrolled in SRE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means that parents who would like to send their children to both SRE and ethics classes will not be able to.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also this from &lt;a href="http://www.gordonmoyes.com/2010/04/23/ten-reasons-the-ethics-trial-is-not-a-good-idea/"&gt;“respected Christian leader” &lt;strong&gt;Gordon Moyes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Be warned: if the Government allows this course to continue after the trial, it will jeopardise religious education in public schools, and without such a religious component, public schools will cease to be inclusive of all children. We Anglicans have always been committed to public education. Any decline of SRE would make public schools less attractive to Christian parents and will accelerate the shift to non-government schools.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like they’re asking, “How can my children learn ethics if they’re too busy learning about Jesus?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would hope religious education would &lt;em&gt;include&lt;/em&gt; ethics… but the way they’re framing this as a dichotomy makes it sound like the religious education lacks any ethical substance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know it’s possible to be good without god.  Several millions of us around the world do it daily.  Religion doesn’t have a monopoly on ethics.  But this isn’t an atheist ethics class.  It’s one that has nothing to do with faith at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If parents are choosing to enroll their kids in ethics classes at the expense of the religious classes, maybe the religious educators ought to think about offering something more useful.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe Australia should eliminate the religious education classes altogether.  Let the kids come to school to get a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; education. Leave the religion to the parents or churches.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe someone can explain that to these pastors.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But would-be nappers face some awkward decisions, most obviously - does it matter whether I nap in my chair or ought I try to find somewhere to lie down? And then ... if remaining seated, is it okay to lean forwards and rest my head on a desk?When it comes to napping while leaning back in a chair or car seat, past research has shown that the further you can lean back, the better, at least in terms of subjective fatigue and reaction times. Now Dayong Zhao and colleagues have addressed the leaning forward issue, comparing lying-down napping and leaning-forward napping, and they&amp;#39;ve found that the former is the most effective, but that the leaning-forward variety still has clear benefits compared with no nap at all. Thirty undergrads, all regular nappers, had electrodes attached to their heads before lunch. Then they performed an &amp;#39;oddball&amp;#39; auditory task in which they had to listen to a string of tones and listen out for the occasional one of a different pitch. Next they had lunch before splitting into three groups: one group enjoyed a twenty minute nap lying down; another enjoyed a twenty-minute nap leaning forwards onto a desk (plus pillow for comfort); the final group just spent the same time sitting quietly. After this, all the participants performed a repeat of the oddball task whilst having their brainwaves recorded via electroencephalography. Zhao&amp;#39;s team were particularly interested in the size and delay of the P300 - a brainwave measure of cognitive alertness. Participants in both of the napping conditions showed benefits compared with their peers who&amp;#39;d been denied a nap. The nappers, leaning and lying, reported being in a better mood and feeling less sleepy and they performed better at the oddball task. When it came to the brainwave recordings, however, the leaning-forward nappers, unlike the lying-down nappers, showed no difference from the control group. Uniquely, the lying-down nappers showed an increased P300 amplitude, perhaps indicating increased cortical arousal on their part. The message it seems is clear. A post-luncheon nap is beneficial to your mental functioning even if you&amp;#39;re forced to rest your head on your desk. However, if you can find somewhere to lie down properly, then do, because the benefits of the nap will be that much greater. _________________________________Zhao, D., Zhang, Q., Fu, M., Tang, Y., &amp;amp; Zhao, Y.

&lt;p&gt;The latest &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-larry-dossey/the-scientific-method-an_b_550004.html"&gt;screed is from some bozo named Dr Larry Dossey&lt;/a&gt;. The awfulness begins right away, as he quotes Jeremy Rifkin, the professional Luddite, on the scientific method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]he scientific method [is] an approach to learning that has been nearly deified in the centuries following the European Enlightenment. Children are introduced to the scientific method in middle school and informed that it is the only accurate process by which to gather knowledge and learn about the real world around us ... The scientific observer is never a participant in the reality he or she observes, but only a voyeur. As for the world he or she observes, it is a cold, uncaring place, devoid of awe, compassion or sense of purpose. Even life itself is made lifeless to better dissect its component parts. We are left with a purely material world, which is quantifiable but without quality ... The scientific method is at odds with virtually everything we know about our own nature and the nature of the world. It denies the relational aspect of reality, prohibits participation and makes no room for empathic imagination. Students in effect are asked to become aliens in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is absolutely nothing in that description that fits my conception of the scientific method. It's utter nonsense written by someone who doesn't understand science in the slightest, but is familiar with cartoon stereotypes of the scientist as heartless robot.  Seriously, has this guy never heard of Richard Feynman? Neil deGrasse Tyson? Roy Chapman Andrews? &lt;i&gt;Any&lt;/i&gt; of the biologists I know? We become part of the world by understanding that world as it actually is, unwarped by the superstitious illusions people like Dossey want to impose on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, the complaint is an indignant claim that scientists will tell you that science is the only "accurate process by which to gather knowledge and learn about the real world", which is true. Instead of saying what it is not, though, just once I'd like to see one of these clowns tell me plainly and clearly what his alternative is. Dossey does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's probably just as well. His latest book is on the "Power of Premonitions", and he's also written books on the power of prayer. He's a credulous magic man, in other words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/another_huffpo_pontification_o.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/ALkIYGFP31I" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272272473947"><id gr:original-id="http://bjoern.brembs.net/news.php?item.606.11">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bfce8a7d38284e21</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">In which potatoes in France are like high-ranking journals in science</title><published>2010-04-26T03:35:53Z</published><updated>2010-04-26T03:35:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/QlB5Zr8u7nE/news.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://bjoern.brembs.net/news.php?item.606.11"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">There are about 1.5 million scholarly articles published in all the sciences, spread over about 24,000 journals. Even if there were a single database or entry-point providing access to all the literature, nobody would be able to keep up with everything that is being published in their field of work any more. Desperately looking for some clue as to which publications to select for in-depth reading and which to ignore, scientists began to rank the journals according to how often the articles in these journals were cited. This ranking got started around the 1960s, when the number of journals started to proliferate. Fast-forward to today: What began as a last-ditch effort to handle an overwhelming flood of scientific information is now a full blown business. Journal ranking by citations is now done commercially by a multi-billion Dollar media corporation, Thomson Reuters. The journal rankings are sold to research institutions on a subscription basis ranging anywhere between approx. 30,000-300,000€ (US$40,000-400,000) annually.With increased visibility for the high-ranking journals came an increase  in submitted contributions. The higher ranking the journal, the more readers and contributors, so the more income for the publisher. And so the vicious cycle of scientific publishing evolved: more and more scientists want to publish in and read the high-ranking journals. Due to the high volume of submissions, the publishers of these journals are in a position to pick about 2-5% of the submitted articles for publication and reject the rest, increasing the prestige of these journals even more. Sometimes these rejections are accompanied by a recommendation to submit the work to one of the  lower-rank journals of the same publisher. Clearly, something has to be exceptionally 'good' to make it into a high-ranking journal (or, as some claim, have the potential to increase the journal's rank). After a few cycles, it became difficult to distinguish if a scientific finding was so 'good' that it made it into the high-ranking journals or if it had to be good because it was published there. Indeed, for some aspects of scientific life such as promotions, hiring, grant proposals or other sorts of evaluations, this question wasn't even asked anymore. Publication quality became synonymous with journal rank. Today, where a scientist has published is often more important than what was published. In all human life, scarcity and branding are two powerful factors for determining value, as I'm sure any economist can tell a story or two about. Scientists are human beings and journal rank is but one example of just how prevalent the human factor is in the scientific enterprise. Today, the future of a professional scientist is all too often dominated more by the economics of scarcity and branding, rather than science.What does all that have to do with potatoes in France?After a discussion about potatoes over lunch the other day, I stumbled across this beautiful tale, published in 1956 in the American Potato Journal on how the potato arrived in France in the 18th century: This endorsement of the potato and that of the various potato dishes served at the King's table were enhanced by placing a uniformed guard on Parmentier's potato plot. Parmentier's considerate removal of the guard at night during the harvest season is reported to have furthered the success of the potato with the King's subjects. This story so reminded me of scientific publishing. Wikipedia puts the story a little more bluntly: Parmentier therefore began a series of publicity stunts for which he  remains notable today, hosting dinners at which potato dishes featured prominently and guests  included luminaries such as Benjamin Franklin and Antoine Lavoisier, giving bouquets of potato blossoms to  the King and Queen, and surrounding his potato patch at Sablons with  armed guards to suggest valuable goods — then instructed them to accept  any and all bribes from civilians and withdrawing them at night so the  greedy crowd could "steal" the potatoes. Now I wouldn't know anything about bribes, but the part about creating artificial scarcity and a brand name to increase value for an ordinary object rang familiar.In a recent 'Opinion' article in one of the journals at the very top of the rank, Nature, the author correctly points out that this system of journal rank has many flaws and should be replaced by a more scientific system for the metric evaluation of science. She specifically calls for social social scientists and economists to be involved in developing this new system, underscoring the points above. Indeed, it is remarkable that our current journal rank system is still in place. After all, not only does the author and many scientists agree, but also the originators of the journal rank system, the high-ranking journals themselves and even some evaluators all have long realized that using journal rank to evaluate individual researchers is both "unfair and unscholarly". I have lamented this absurd state of affairs plenty of times right here and elsewhere. However, artificial scarcity and brand name have, by now, developed such a powerful dynamic, fueled by billions in taxpayer money and a rich history of great scientific traditions, that it seems unstoppable, even if all participating parties agree that putting an end to it would be better for science.It is with these powerful dynamics (and some analogous evolutionary dynamics) in mind that I posted an off-hand comment to the 'Opinion' article mentioned above. The comment stated that any, even the most complex and scientifically tested system will eventually succumb to social dynamics adapting the scientific community to the system and maximizing the individual participant's benefit while minimizing their costs. The only system that would be immune to such dynamics is one where the rules change more quickly than the social dynamics can follow:Wouldn't it be nice if metrics weren't needed? However, despite all the justified objections to bibliometrics, unless we do something drastic to reduce research output to an amount manageable in the traditional way, we will not have any other choice than to use them.However, as the commenters before already mentioned, no matter how complex and sophisticated, any system is liable to gaming. Therefore, even in an ideal world where we had the most comprehensive and advanced system for reputation building and automated assessment of the huge scientific enterprise in all its diversity, wouldn't the evolutionary dynamics engaged by the selection pressures within such systems demand that we keep randomly shuffling the weights and rules of these future metrics faster than the population can adapt?This comment will soon be published as a 'Correspondence' piece in the printed version of Nature. I'll update the post with the direct link as soon as it is online. Coincidentally, the current LaborJournal contains a letter from me, which states pretty much the same thing, with some additional information.Hougas, R. (1956).

AACR is the meeting dedicated to basic and translational research; ASCO, as the word “clinical” in its name implies, is devoted mainly to clinical research. Personally, being a translational researcher myself and a surgeon, I tend to prefer the AACR meeting over ASCO, not because ASCO isn’t valuable, but mainly because ASCO tends to be devoted mostly to medical oncology and chemotherapy, which are not what I do as a surgeon. Each meeting draws between 10,000 to 15,000 or even more clinicians and researchers dedicated to the eradication of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having taken the Acela train from the NECSS meeting in New York straight to Washington, DC for the AACR meeting, I couldn’t help but think a bit about the juxtaposition of our discussion of the infiltration of quackademic medicine into medical academia with the hard core science being discussed at AACR. One session in particular at AACR highlighted what is one of the most significant differences between science-based medicine and the various forms of “alternative” medicine that we discuss here on SBM on such a regular basis. That difference, quite simply put, is the difference between the simple and the complex. “Alternative” medicine supporters often scoff at practitioners of science-based oncology, asking why we don’t have a “cure for cancer” yet—as if cancer were a single disease!—or why we haven’t made much more progress since President Richard Nixon declared “&lt;a href="http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/timeline/noflash/milestones/M4_Nixon.htm"&gt;war on cancer&lt;/a&gt;” back in 1971. One part of the answer is that cancer is incredibly complicated. Not only is it not a single disease, but each variety of cancer is in and of itself incredibly complicated as well. To steal from &lt;a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/33085.html"&gt;Douglas Adams&lt;/a&gt;, cancer is complicated. You just won’t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly complicated it is. I mean, you may think algebra is complicated, but that’s just peanuts to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday morning, I attended a session that hammered home that cancer is complex. The session was called, appropriately enough, &lt;a href="http://www.aacr.org/home/scientists/publications-of-the-aacr/plenary-speakers-articles/speakers-plenary-3/plenary-3-js-brugge.aspx"&gt;The Complexity of Cancer&lt;/a&gt;. It was chaired by Dr. Joan S. Brugge, professor of Cell Biology at Harvard Medical School and &lt;a href="http://www.aacr.org/Uploads/DocumentRepository/2010_AM/AM2010_final_program_20100420.pdf"&gt;featured as speakers&lt;/a&gt; cancer stem cell expert Dr. Sean J. Morrison of the University of Michigan, as well as two faculty from UCSF, Dr. Lisa M. Coussens and Dr. Allan Balmain. Dr. Brugge spoke about mechanisms that control tumor cell anchorage, as well as the interface between genetics and metabolism in cancer; Dr. Morrison discussed cancer stem cells and how some tumors appear to follow the stem cell model while others didn’t; Dr. Coussens discussed how chronic inflammation can lead to cancer; and Dr. Balmain discussed genetic network analysis as a means of determining the susceptibility to cancer of various cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right from the beginning, Dr. Brugge invoked Nixon’s war on cancer with a particularly appropriate observation, namely that the war has been far more difficult than anyone could possibly have ever envisioned in 1971. Back in 1971, in the wake of the discovery of the first oncogene, &lt;em&gt;src&lt;/em&gt;, most scientists studied almost exclusively cancer cells, not appreciating the role of the surrounding matrix of normal cells and connective tissue in both preventing and modulating tumors. It’s true that, even back in 1971, scientists understood that the immune system has an important role in controlling cancer, but we lacked the tools to study this system in great detail. Since 1971, the list of discoveries about cancer has been long. Some examples include the discovery of many more oncogenes; tumor suppressor genes; the role of tumor angiogenesis in cancer; cancer stem cells; the rediscovery of the Warburg effect and metabolic derangements in cancer cells; and an enormous number of discoveries in tumor immunology. Each discovery helped us understand better how normal cells become tumors and how tumors grow, invade, and metastasize. But each discovery also led to additional complexities and more questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One characteristic that virtually defines a malignant cell in solid organs (as opposed to blood-derived tumors) is its ability to survive when not attached to other cells in its normal surrounding matrix of collagen and other connective tissues. This characteristic of tumor cells has long been recognized, having been first described back in the 1960s. Normal cells, when not attached to the proteins to which they normally cling, rapidly undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). Apoptosis due to becoming detached is known as anoikis. Dr. Brugge started out discussing her interest in anoikis and understanding how breast epithelial cells survive detachment. Her talk ended up encompassing intracellular signaling pathways, metabolic derangements, and genetics. One observation that is likely underappreciated is that cells that undergo detachment develop metabolic deficiencies that lead to decreased ATP deproduction, decreased cellular energy (real energy, not the fake “energy” — or &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt; — that alt-med proponents often invoke), and ultimately programmed cell death. One of the more provocative observations is that antioxidants can actually help save these cells by neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby rescuing fatty acid oxidation. For purposes of this discussion, the details aren’t important (although they are very important for cancer biology). What is important is that antioxidants are not a universal good when it comes to cancer; in the case of the models of breast cancer discussed by Dr. Brugge, antioxidants actually promote the survival of transformed cells because part of the mechanism by which these cells undergo programmed death is through the production of ROS. Does this result mean that antioxidants don’t prevent cancer? Of course not. It does however, when taken in context with other studies, suggest a great deal of complexity, where in some cases antioxidants prevent cancer and others may promote cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast this to the frequent alt-med claim that antioxidants prevent cancer and are virtually always good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Morrison’s talk touched upon one of the most contentious issues in cancer today, namely the cancer stem cell hypothesis. This hypothesis goes something like this. There exist within cancer a population of cells that behave like stem cells. They are self-regenerating and each is capable of dividing indefinitely and recapitulating a tumor, while the vast majority of tumor cells have only limited replicative potential. The population of cells that can actually produce new tumors may be very small, much less than 1% of the cells in any given tumor. This concept has been most validated in leukemias, although there is good evidence that breast and a variety of other cancers may follow a stem cell-like model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/414105ad.2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/414105ad.2-300x177.jpg" alt="Cancer stem cell" title="414105ad.2" width="300" height="177"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer stem cell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the stem cell model of cancer, these stem cells are highly resistant to chemotherapy, which wipes out all the non-stem tumor cells but leaves a few tumor stem cells, which can rapidly grow and then recreate the tumor, even from a single cell. In essence, the stem cell model postulates a hierarchy among tumor cells, as contrasted to the previous model, which was a more stochastic model in which any tumor cell could produce a tumor. To boil the concept down, in the stochastic model, any given cell in a tumor could be viewed as having, for example, a 1% chance of being able to form a new tumor if transplanted, while in the stem cell model only 1% of the cells of a given tumor can form new tumors, but they do so with very high efficiency. Moreover, these cancer stem cells have various protein and genetic markers that distinguish them from other cells in the same cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the cancer stem cell is rather controversial. Personally, although the evidence has persuaded me that there is such a thing as what is commonly called a “cancer stem cell,” from my perspective I view the term as a poor descriptor of this cell mainly for semantic reasons. The term “stem cell” implies unlimited ability to produce different tissue types, which is not what this model is about at all. It’s long been known that tumors are made up of different populations of cells with different characteristics, and it’s not such a stretch to accept that many tumors might have a subpopulation of cells that are most responsible for tumor growth, with most of the other cells remaining quiescent or only slowly dividing. What Dr. Morrison argued is that some cancers follow a more “stem cell” model, while others follow a more stochastic model. He used the example of melanoma to illustrate this point: over 30% of the cells in a given melanoma studied can produce new tumors. While this observation might be consistent with the existence of a melanoma stem cell that makes up 30% of a typical melanoma, Dr. Morrison was unable to find any markers to distinguish the cells that could form tumors from those that could not, and he checked over 50 markers. While this does not entirely rule out a stem cell model (it’s possible that he hasn’t yet found the right marker), it is more consistent with a stochastic model, in which each cell in the melanoma has a 30% chance of being able to form a tumor when transplanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this important? It’s important because it has great relevance to treatment. If a tumor is driven by stem cells, then to eradicate the tumor it is necessary to eliminate the stem cells. If it is driven by a more stochastic mechanism, a non-stem cell mechanism, then a “kill ‘em all” approach is more likely to succeed. Of course, it wouldn’t surprise me if it turns out that most tumors actually fall somewhere on a continuum between being stem cell-driven and being stochastic. Cancer is just that complex. The term “either-or” rarely, if ever, applies to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Coussens’ talk is fascinating for what it revealed about the immune system and cancer. How many times have you heard “alternative medicine” believers and promoters brag that this nostrum or that potion “boosts the immune system”? As we’ve said before here, it’s a meaningless claim, because sometimes boosting the immune system is bad, as in autoimmune diseases. In cancer, it’s long been known that inflammation, particularly chronic inflammation, can lead to cancer. One of the most classic examples of this phenomenon is how gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can lead to inflammation in the lower esophagus, which can lead to a change in the cells there known as Barrett’s esophagus, which can ultimately lead to esophageal cancer. Inflammation is a function of the immune system; consequently, when you take anti-inflammatories, you are suppressing part of the immune system on purpose in order to decrease inflammation. In any case, Dr. Coussens discussed how activation of certain parts of the immune system can suppress cancer development, while activation of other parts can promote tumor progression. This slide, taken on my iPhone, demonstrates the concept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/immune.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/immune-300x204.jpg" alt="immune" title="immune" width="300" height="204"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Balmain echoed this message but came at it from a different angle, namely from the complexity of changes in gene expression in cancer, and how a highly complex interaction between inflammation, stromal cells, the immune response, metabolism, and changes in gene expression in a tissue, specifically skin, can influence susceptibility to cancer. One of the big disappointments in cancer research is that relatively few cancers have easily identifiable genes driving them, even though many tumors have a strong heritable component. The reason may well be due to the inheritance of multiple susceptibility genes of low penetrance, meaning that they don’t individually have a strong effect on the characteristics of a cell. Cancer actually involves changes in the expression levels of hundreds, if not thousands, of different genes. In fact, the way we now look at cancer is through network analysis of the levels of thousands of genes in the cell. We’ve gone from looking at single genes to looking at thousands upon thousands of genes. As Dr. Balmain concluded, cancer susceptibility and progression depend upon the emergent properties of many genes, each of which individually has a small effect, and these genetic variants affect the tumor cell, the microenvironment surrounding the tumor cell, or both. Moreover, depending upon the tumor type and situation, inflammatory networks can play opposite roles, either promoting or inhibiting tumor susceptibility and progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that complicated enough for you yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then let’s move on beyond this talk. On Friday, a bunch of us on our floor on the cancer institute got together to discuss interesting stuff we saw and learned at AACR this year. One topic that came up is the &lt;a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/"&gt;Cancer Genome Atlas&lt;/a&gt;, or TCGA (you gene geeks out there may find the initials amusing, but they explain why the word “the” was included). The idea behind the project is to sequence the genomes of many, many cancers. You might wonder why it’s necessary to sequence so many cancer genomes, and it’s not an unreasonable question. The reason is that so many cancers are driven by different mutations that it’s unlikely that any two tumors have the same set of mutations driving them. Consequently, TCGA seeks to sequence at least 500 cancers for each cancer type studied. It started with a pilot project and has since been expanded to 20 different tumors. By sequencing lots and lots of tumors, or so the idea goes, we can identify commonly occurring mutations and sets of mutated genes, perhaps even across cancers, that can be targeted for therapy. At the very least, it is thought that we will be able to develop a greater understanding of the complexity of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit that when I first heard of TCGA, I was skeptical. To me, it struck me as perhaps the largest fishing expedition in the history of cancer research. Moreover, even this massive undertaking is only part of the picture. As I alluded to earlier, the metabolism of cancer cells is often hugely abnormal, and a “chicken or the egg” argument continues to some extent even now about whether it is the metabolic abnormalities that drive mutations or the mutations that produce metabolic abnormalities. More likely, it’s a little of both, the exact proportion of which depending upon the tumor cell. None of this even considers influences outside of the genome (epigenetic influences) or differences in how proteins are made. Part of our discussion also pointed out that so many mutations have been associated with cancer and that they are often so different in different tumors, even from the same tissue, that trying to figure out which mutations found in TCGA are even relevant to cancer and which ones are actually driving the development, progression, and spread of cancer will be a daunting task, every bit as challenging as the Manhattan Project or sending a man to the moon in less than a decade. In fact, when you consider how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly complicated cancer is, it’s amazing that we do as well as we do now and that we’ve made as much progress as we have, arguments &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=544"&gt;over whether we are too conservative or whether pursuing riskier research strategies will bear fruit faster notwithstanding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare this to the view of many practitioners of unscientific medicine. My favorite example of a vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly simple pseudo-explanation for cancer is that of the late &lt;a href="http://www.huldaclark.com/"&gt;Hulda Clark&lt;/a&gt;, who claimed to be able to cure all cancers (not just all cancers, but all disease) but who died of multiple myeloma herself. Her idea was that &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/clark.html"&gt;all cancer is caused by a liver fluke&lt;/a&gt;, which she would claim to be able to kill (and thus cure the cancer) with device she called her “Zapper,” a cheap little electrical gadget that looked as though it were assembled from spare parts at Radio Shack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another quack, Nicholas Gonzalez, claims that all cancer is &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/kg.html"&gt;due to a deficiency in pancreatic enzymes&lt;/a&gt;, for which he prescribes pancreatic enzyme replacement, up to 150 supplement pills a day, a “nutritional” regimen consisting of various vegetable and fruit juices , and a “detoxification” regimen including coffee enemas. He made a name for himself with a cherry-picked case series of his own patients that appeared to have survived pancreatic cancer far longer than is generally anticipated based on historical controls. This lead to a highly unethical clinical trial that &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1551"&gt;ultimately showed&lt;/a&gt; that Gonzalez’s patients &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1430"&gt;did considerably worse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1545"&gt;than conventional therapy&lt;/a&gt;, as poor as conventional science-based therapy does against pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not the only ones, of course. Still another quack, &lt;a href="http://www.phmiracleliving.com"&gt;Robert O. Young&lt;/a&gt;, ascribes all cancer to “acidity” in the blood, and his treatment is always diet and bicarbonate to try to “alkalinize” the blood:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/AcidCure.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/AcidCure-300x225.jpg" alt="Robert O. Young" title="Robert O. Young" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young even goes so far as to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/your_friday_dose_of_woo_acid_base_or_woo_2.php"&gt;describe cancer as&lt;/a&gt; a “poisonous acidic liquid,” states that “there is no such thing as a cancer cell” and that cancer cells are cells that have been “spoiled by acid.” To him, the tumor is the “&lt;a href="http://articlesofhealth.blogspot.com/2007/05/what-is-cause-of-cancer-is-there-cure.html"&gt;body’s protective mechanism to encapsulate spoiled or poisoned cells from excess acid that has not been properly eliminated through urination, perspiration, defecation or respiration&lt;/a&gt;.” Young’s ideas have sucked in unwitting cancer patients, including one named Kim Tinkham, who even appeared on Oprah’s show a couple of years ago. (In addition, Young also &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/sepsis_is_not_caused_by_infection.php"&gt;doesn’t believe that sepsis is caused by bacterial infection&lt;/a&gt;.) On a related note, another quack named Tullio Simoncini espouses a variant of Robert Young’s ideas in that he believes that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/a_fungus_among_us_in_oncology.php"&gt;all cancer is a fungus&lt;/a&gt;. The similarity is that he prescribes “alkalinization” for the fungus, some of which can involve injecting sodium bicarbonate directly into tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s one difference between science-based medicine and quackery when it comes to cancer, it’s that science-based medicine appreciates the sheer complexity of tumors, while quacks often go for risibly simplistic pseudo-explanations of cancer. The complexity of cancer as a set of related diseases is incredible. Indeed, one has to respect it and even stand in awe at its ability to grow, evolve, and ultimately develop resistance to almost any treatment we can come up with. That’s not to say that the situation is hopeless, but it is an explanation as to why, nearly 40 years after Nixon’s war on cancer commenced, our progress against this foe has been incremental. Despite this record, I remain nonetheless optimistic and expect this situation to change within my lifetime. The reason is that we are finally developing the tools, both scientific and technological, along with the computational power to analyze the data, that hold out hope of an understanding of different cancers deep enough to make real progress in reducing the incidence, morbidity, and mortality from cancer. This isn’t any comfort to patients suffering from cancer now or to those who have (as I have) lost loved ones to cancer, but it does give me hope that, should I be one of the unlucky ones who develop cancer, my chances of survival will be better than at any time in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No quack can even come close to giving me that sort of hope.&lt;/p&gt;

The reason is not because I don't find it interesting or potentially blog-worthy, but rather because it slipped my mind and other things caught my interest last week. Given that the show is going to air beginning tomorrow, I thought that a few thoughts were in order. PBS's Frontline is going to air a show entitled &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/vaccines/"&gt;The Vaccine War&lt;/a&gt;, and here's a preview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/vaccines/#press"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; describing the episode gives me reason for concern:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Vaccines have changed the world, largely eradicating a series of terrible diseases, from smallpox to polio to diphtheria, and likely adding decades to most of our life spans. But despite the gains--and numerous scientific studies indicating vaccine safety--a growing movement of parents remains fearful of vaccines. And in some American communities, significant numbers of parents have been rejecting vaccines altogether, raising new concerns about the return of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough.

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Vaccine War&lt;/em&gt;, airing Tuesday, April 27, 2010, at 9 P.M. ET on PBS (check local listings), FRONTLINE lays bare the science of vaccine safety and examines the increasingly bitter debate between the public health establishment and a formidable populist coalition of parents, celebrities, politicians and activists who are armed with the latest social media tools, including Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, and are determined to resist pressure from the medical and public health establishments to vaccinate, despite established scientific consensus about vaccine safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/the_vaccine_war.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/the_vaccine_war.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/FHPS0WeLBAo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272262465442"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticwonder.blogspot.com/2010/04/sunday-protist-rostronympha-and-latest.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c3ebbca62ba220ad</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Sunday Protist -- Rostronympha and latest parabasalian taxonomy</title><published>2010-04-26T00:20:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-26T00:20:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/xhyH83ntfMs/sunday-protist-rostronympha-and-latest.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://skepticwonder.blogspot.com/2010/04/sunday-protist-rostronympha-and-latest.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Since I just spent hours staring at onychophorans (instead of studying), gonna skimp out on the Sunday Protist this week.

But if that is the case, here’s the story. An Iranian Islamic cleric, Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi, is &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-ml-iran-earthquakes-promiscuity,0,6333394.story"&gt;predicting that earthquakes will hit Iran soon and it’s the women who are at…fault&lt;/a&gt; (Eh? Eh? See what I did there?).  Apparently he thinks women wearing immodest clothing and behaving promiscuously have offended “God,” and that is why we have earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many women who do not dress modestly … lead young men astray, corrupt  their chastity and spread adultery in society, which (consequently)  increases earthquakes”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Iran sits on top of a very unstable fault, so it’s only a matter of time before another earthquake hits regardless of whether the Iranian women wear underwear under their burqas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this little farce has inspired &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=116336578385346"&gt;Boobquake&lt;/a&gt;, a movement designed to fight such primitive superstition byand the oppression of women by  dressing immodestly. The proposal was to scientifically test his claim by devoting an entire day to women dressing immodestly to see if they could cause an earthquake with nothing but the power of their breasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Monday April 26th, is that day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So by the end of today, we’ll know scientifically who the  real boob is.&lt;/p&gt;

But &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8642558.stm"&gt;Stephen Hawking has generated a bit of buzz&lt;/a&gt; by pointing out that contact with an advanced alien civilization might not turn out well for us backward humans.  In fact, we should just try to keep quiet and avoid being noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn’t turn out well for the Native Americans,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof Hawking thinks that, rather than actively trying to communicate with extra-terrestrials, humans should do everything possible to avoid contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained: “We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn’t want to meet.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which I can only say:  yeah.  Sounds about right.  If aliens were sufficiently enlightened to be utterly peace-loving and generous, it would be great to have back-and-forth contact with them.  But it’s also possible that they would simply wipe us out — not necessarily in a &lt;em&gt;Mars Attacks!&lt;/em&gt; kind of invasion, but almost without noticing (as we have done to countless species here on Earth already).  So how do you judge the risk?  (&lt;a href="http://drezner.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/04/25/how_do_you_say_realpolitik_in_klingon"&gt;Dan Drezner&lt;/a&gt; gives the interplanetary-security perspective.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like the LHC doomsday scenarios, but for real — the sensible prior on “murderous aliens” is much higher than on “microscopic black hole eats the Earth.”  Happily, a face-to-face chat seems unlikely anyway.  Nothing wrong with listening in, on the unlikely chance that the aliens are broadcasting their communications randomly throughout the galaxy.  Besides, a little advance warning wouldn’t hurt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;:  I had forgotten that we had &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/01/16/be-vewwwwy-vewwwwy-quiet/"&gt;already discussed this&lt;/a&gt; a couple of years ago.  Old bloggers tend to repeat themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

These black holes can have masses up to ten billion solar masses (1010 M⊙) or more. One of the largest known examples is part of a binary system, and it weighs in at 1.8×1010 M⊙ – see here, here, or here. (There are exceptions, such as the nearby M33, which apparently does not have a central black hole of mass more than 3000 M⊙.)All black holes gravitationally attract any nearby matter, because of their high mass, which is generally ≥ 1 M⊙ even for comparatively tiny stellar mass black holes. Such matter does not necessarily fall directly into the black hole, but instead can go into orbit around the black hole. If there is enough matter close to the black hole, and if it is pulled in rapidly enough, the results can be a spectacular light show, such as one might see (if one could see simultaneously at all wavelengths from very high radio frequencies to X-rays) in the Centaurus A galaxy, about 13 million light years away:This is a view of the whole galaxy – you can see that the central area, which contains the black hole, is unusually bright, and there are jets extending more than the radius of the galaxy itself in both directions perpendicular to the galactic plane. Centaurus A is an example of an &amp;quot;active galaxy&amp;quot;, and it shows the impressive effects produced by the central black hole of such an object. (For more about Centaurus A and this image, see here, here. Another image: here.)The innermost region of an active galaxy, which is the interesting part, is called an &amp;quot;active galactic nucleus&amp;quot; (AGN). This is a general term for a number of puzzling astronomical objects that were noticed at first on account of their unusually vigorous output of energy, but whose similarities were not immediately recognized. AGNs were eventually deduced to be (in almost all cases) just relatively ordinary galaxies with massive central black holes that appear to be responsible for liberating at least as much energy as all the stars in the remainder of the galaxy.Although most galaxies seem to have a supermassive black hole in their center, behavior of AGNs is rather unusual, and AGNs are somewhat rare in the nearby universe, but more common at large distances – hence at an earlier time in the universe. AGN behavior requires not only a supermassive black hole, but also a substantial amount of surrounding interstellar gas that fuels their energy output. AGNs are rather profligate in using their fuel, so presumably most of the available interstellar gas close to a central black hole is consumed over a relatively short period of time (compared to the age of the universe). Consequently, in most nearby galaxies the fuel was used up long ago. The Milky Way has a relatively small central black hole associated with the radio source named Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). The black hole has a mass of ~4×106 M⊙. Sgr A* is not nearly luminous enough to be considered an AGN, so evidently either there is not now enough nearby interstellar gas, or perhaps the black hole is just too small to have ever attracted enough.How luminous does a galactic nucleus need to be in order to qualify as an AGN? It&amp;#39;s really a question of how bright the nucleus is compared to the rest of the galaxy. Messier 77, also known as NGC 1068, is the first galaxy now considered to have an AGN that came to special attention. In 1908 E. A. Fath obtained its spectrum and found it had unusually strong emission lines. (This was at a time when it was still assumed that nebulae were simply fuzzy objects inside our own galaxy.) V. N. Slipher later obtained a better spectrum and noted that the width of the lines implied high velocities – hundreds of kilometers per second. NGC 1068 is fairly nearby – 47 million light years away – and rather large, with a diameter of 170,000 light years (compared to the Milky Way&amp;#39;s diameter of 100,000 light years). NGC 1068 is still under active study at this time – see here.Finally in 1943 Carl Seyfert recognized that NGC 1068 was similar to a number of other galaxies that formed a distinct class, based on the nature of their spectra and because their innermost regions were as bright as the entire rest of the galaxy. This concentration of luminosity in the center was not only exceptional, but it was quite unlikely to be physically possible for a sufficient number of stars to be located in such a small volume of space. Naturally, galaxies of this sort became known as Seyfert galaxies. Other peculiarities of Seyfert galaxies were eventually recognized as well. For example, their spectra contain broad, strong emission lines of hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, and oxygen. This in turn implied that the emitting material had to be in rapid motion in order to produce Doppler broadening of the emission lines. And this in turn implied that a large amount of mass needed to be concentrated in a small volume to account for such high velocities. The characteristics of high central luminosity and broad emission lines tended to occur together enough to justify recognizing Seyfert galaxies as a distinct class, which made up about 1% of nearby spiral galaxies.About 15 years after Seyfert galaxies were discovered, another peculiar type of astrophysical object was noticed – quasars, or, as they were sometimes known, &amp;quot;quasi-stellar-objects&amp;quot;. These came first to attention as strong sources of radio emission, in early radio telescope surveys, such as the original Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources. The strong radio signal was somewhat mysterious, since electromagnetic radiation at radio frequencies (up to 100 GHz at the high end) is normally emitted only by rather cold matter (under about 2 degrees above absolute zero).Many of these sources (&amp;quot;radio galaxies&amp;quot;) were eventually identified with optically visible objects, many of which had already been cataloged as unremarkable stars. But when they came under attention as radio sources and their optical spectra were obtained, their high redshift implied that they needed to have an astonishingly high intrinsic luminosity – too luminous to be explainable simply as very large galaxies containing even the brightest possible stars. Phenomena that are seemingly impossible to explain in terms of familiar examples tend to draw a lot of attention – and this is true, in some respects, of quasars even today. A lot of the mystery is now explainable in terms of active galaxies that are powered by supermassive black holes, and we&amp;#39;ll get more into that in a little bit. But there are also some AGN features, such as the jets that a few AGNs expel at relativistic velocities, which are still not well understood.Although there was still controversy at the time whether redshift could be used as a reliable gauge of distance, if the conventional redshift interpretation (Hubble expansion) was assumed, then quasars would need to be (what was considered at the time, ca. 1960) extremely distant. One of the earliest-recognized quasars, 3C 273, which is the quasar with the largest apparent magnitude and is visible through amateur telescopes, has z=0.158, corresponding to an optical distance of ~2.4 billion light years. 3C 273 was therefore intrinsically far brighter than any star, about 100 times as bright as an entire spiral galaxy. 3C 273 is sometimes considered to be...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.onpointradio.org/2010/04/gordon-hemptons-silence"&gt;Gordon Hempton&lt;/a&gt;, aka SoundTracker, is amazing. &lt;a href="http://www.onpointradio.org/media-player/?url=http://www.onpointradio.org/2010/04/gordon-hemptons-silence&amp;amp;title=Gordon+Hempton%26%238217%3Bs+Natural+Silence&amp;amp;pubdate=2010-04-22&amp;amp;segment=2"&gt;Listen&lt;/a&gt; to this &lt;a href="http://www.onpointradio.org/2010/04/gordon-hemptons-silence"&gt;episode of On Point Radio&lt;/a&gt;, or watch this short YouTube clip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/cAEmKtno9lA%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Great natural sounds! Gordon made 25 years of field recordings. He's making binaural recordings ("sound portraits"). These probably sound great over headphones. Maybe surround sound next, although that's much more difficult to get right in both recording and playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon is absolutely right about the search for silence. I've been attempting to record Great Horned Owls near my home. (I have them on both sides of my house and they call back and forth from about 1-2 am - it's amazing.) The noise-free interval at 1-2 am is unfortunately shorter than the duration of their half minute calls :-(. When we purchased our home, noise level was a major consideration (for music listening), yet a minute of silence is rare here in this fully developed region of Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see an &lt;a href="http://www.recording-microphones.co.uk/XY-coincident-stereo.shtml"&gt;X-Y recording&lt;/a&gt; of bugs (it's nice not to have to wear headphones). Gee, with inexpensive hi-fi 4-channel digital audio recorders (e.g., &lt;a href="http://www.samsontech.com/products/productpage.cfm?prodID=1994&amp;amp;brandID=4"&gt;Zoom H4n&lt;/a&gt;), I wonder why Gordon doesn't simultaneously record binaurally and in X-Y?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackerthemovie.com/ST/Home.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; out too. It looks like a &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1432989/"&gt;movie called SOUNDTRACKER&lt;/a&gt; is coming out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
[(myl)The above is a guest post by &lt;a href="http://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/communications/ist/biographies/campbell-bio.html"&gt;Joe Campbell&lt;/a&gt;.  (Well, it was originally an email to me, which he kindly agreed to let me post.)
&lt;p&gt;Hempton's "head on a stick" reminds of Jim West, who has been awarded &lt;a href="http://www.fi.edu/franklinawards/10/bf_elecengineer_west.html"&gt;the 2010 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Electrical Engineering&lt;/a&gt; (with Gerard Sessler) for inventing the &lt;a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/org/1133/Heritage/Foil/"&gt;electret microphone&lt;/a&gt;. One of the many things that Jim West did with this invention was to build microphones into the ears of a head somewhat like the one shown in the video clip above.  The results were impressive, especially the sound of a baseball bat swung just over the crown of the head, which was impossible to hear over earphones without reflexively ducking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to &lt;a href="http://www.fi.edu/franklinawards/10/flyer_sessler.pdf"&gt;the Sessler-West symposium&lt;/a&gt; to be held at Temple University on Wednesday morning.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272250619152"><id gr:original-id="http://yrif.org/?p=1233">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e9d52c9bf56ef32e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="boobquake"/><category term="science"/><title type="html">Why Boobquake Is Bad Science, And How To Fix It</title><published>2010-04-26T02:21:24Z</published><updated>2010-04-26T02:21:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org/2010/04/25/why-boobquake-is-bad-science-and-how-to-fix-it/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://yrif.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;At this point you are probably well aware of tomorrow’s &lt;a href="http://www.blaghag.com/2010/04/in-name-of-science-i-offer-my-boobs.html"&gt;Boobquake&lt;/a&gt;, in which women (and any chubby men that feel like participating) will flaunt their breasts to test an Iranian cleric’s theory that immodest dress causes earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you look carefully, his claim is &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/04/20/iran.promiscuity.earthquakes/index.html"&gt;slightly different&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The prayer leader, Hojatoleslam Kazim Sadeghi, says women and girls who “don’t dress appropriately” spread “promiscuity in society.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When promiscuity spreads, earthquakes increase,” he says in a video posted Monday on YouTube, apparently of him leading Friday prayers in Tehran, Iran, last week.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes my inner scientist worry.  Maybe immodestly leads to promiscuity, but unless it leads to &lt;i&gt;same-day&lt;/i&gt; promiscuity, then we shouldn’t expect to see an earthquake tomorrow even if Sadeghi is right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s only one way to make sure the science works out.  &lt;b&gt;Promiscuity-quake&lt;/b&gt;!  Who’s in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;April 25th, 2010 | Author: &lt;a title="Posts by  Matthew Newton" href="http://woofighters.org/author/csuntreasurer/"&gt;Matthew Newton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the idea of “science” is brought up, most people agree  that this so-called science is a good thing. In fact, in a somewhat &lt;a href="http://people-press.org/report/528/"&gt;recent poll&lt;/a&gt; by the Pew  Research Center, 84% of Americans surveyed believed the science in their  lives to have a positive influence on society, with only 6% indicating  the opposite. 70% said they believed scientists to have a positive  influence on society, which is even more than doctors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the magical idea of “&lt;strong&gt;what science is to me and not to  you thank you very much&lt;/strong&gt;” sounds preferable to your average  consumer of science, the reality behind belief in American scientific  progress is a bit more bleak. From the same poll, only 17% of those  surveyed believed America to among the “best in the world” when it comes  to scientific research, with 49% believing America to have the best  scientists in the world. It’s a lot easier to deny an intangible idea,  isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/4483/Americans-Belief-Psychic-Paranormal-Phenomena-Over-Last-Decade.aspx"&gt;Three  separate Gallup Polls&lt;/a&gt; taken between 1990 and 2001 measured public  beliefs in various paranormal phenomena. Notably, and in spite of the  84% of Americans putting their &lt;strong&gt;faith&lt;/strong&gt; in science, a  large portion in all three time periods (50%) said they believed in  Extrasensory Perception (ESP) , with only 21% definitively certain about  its nonexistence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://woofighters.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/graph.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://woofighters.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/graph.jpg" alt="" width="641" height="409"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do Americans, who are so sure of  science’s contributions to society, have such a poor misunderstanding of  such basic concepts? Principal researcher Heather Ridolfo’s&lt;a title="graph" href="http://woofighters.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/graph.png"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/%7Egrpproc/crisp/crisp15_3.pdf"&gt;recently  published paper entitled “Social Influences on Paranormal Belief:  Popular Versus Scientific Support”&lt;/a&gt; examined differences in  perception of ESP based on both public and scientific opinion. What was  found is that while people tend to evaluate the validity of claims based  on how many other people support said claims (a cognitive bias known as  the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect"&gt;Bandwagon Effect&lt;/a&gt;),  the support of the scientific community (or lack thereof) has no impact  on evaluating the validity of claims made about ESP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, the researchers concluded that their finding “may reflect  decreasing trust in the institution of science”. Whatever the reason,  the romantic idea of science and the reality behind science have a long  way to go before they meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Interested to know more about it? Sure, &lt;a href="http://www2010.org/www/about/history/" title=""&gt;here's the brief history&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The World Wide Web was first conceived in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. The first conference of the series, WWW1, was held at CERN in 1994 and organized by Robert Cailliau. The IW3C2 was founded by Joseph Hardin and Robert Cailliau later in 1994 and has been responsible for the conference series ever since. Except for 1994 and 1995 when two conferences were held each year, WWWn became an annual event held in late April or early May. The location of the conference rotates among North America, Europe, and Asia. In 2001 the conference designator changed from a number (1 through 10) to the year it is held; i.e., WWW11 became known as WWW2002, and so on.

&lt;p&gt;The WWW Conference series aims to provide the world a premier forum for discussion and debate about the evolution of the Web, the standardization of its associated technologies, and the impact of those technologies on society and culture. The conferences bring together researchers, developers, users and commercial ventures - indeed all who are passionate about the Web and what it has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup. this is &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Web conference. See the &lt;a href="http://www2010.org/www/schedule/" title=""&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt;. And this year it is in my backyard, in Raleigh NC. Now, I do not have time nor money to attend the whole thing. But, the WWW2010 has a few simultaneous conferences happening at the same place and time, for more affordable prices, featuring some of the same people (and others one can bump into in the hallways) and some very exciting topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there is a &lt;a href="http://www.websci10.org/home.html" title=""&gt;Web Science Conference 2010&lt;/a&gt; which has at least two interesting papers presented: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www2010.org/www/2010/04/understanding-twitter/" title=""&gt;Understanding how Twitter is used to widely spread Scientific Messages&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://journal.webscience.org/314/2/websci10_submission_79.pdf" title=""&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) by Julie Letierce, Alexandre Passant, John Breslin and Stefan Decke, and &lt;a href="http://wiki.few.vu.nl/sms/images/9/9c/Websci10-FINAL-29-4-2010f.pdf" title=""&gt;Studying Scientific Discourse on the Web using Bibliometrics: A Chemistry Blogging Case Study (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; by Paul Groth and Thomas Gurney. Both papers will be given tomorrow, on Monday at 2pm. But I did not register for this part, so I cannot see these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I will go to the &lt;a href="http://futureweb2010.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;FutureWeb&lt;/a&gt; conference on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday - the registration also works for the Plenary Talks of the main WWW2010 conference. And I will livetweet and then blog from it all three days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FutureWeb is on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/futureweb2010" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/FutureWeb-2010-Conference/245302567991" title=""&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. They will have &lt;a href="http://www.elon.edu/e-web/predictions/futureweb2010/default.xhtml" title=""&gt;daily video/written coverage&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://futureweb2010blog.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. The hashtag is &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23fw2010" title=""&gt;#fw2010&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official hashtag for the main WWW2010 conference is #www2010 and for the other two co-conferences is #websci10 and #w4a10.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/www2010_conference_this_week_i.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/9WfKVifbgzg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272244459885"><id gr:original-id="http://www.nasw.org/users/mslong/2010/2010_04/CarbonFixation.htm">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/17ae1ad65b13dbd5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Computational Improvement of Carbon Fixation</title><published>2010-04-25T20:35:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-25T20:35:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/uZQVpta_RuA/CarbonFixation.htm" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.nasw.org/users/mslong/2010/2010_04/CarbonFixation.htm"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Ron Milo (Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel) and coworkers have developed theoretical carbon fixation cycles that are improvements over the Calvin-Benson cycle by up to a factor of 3.

From a &lt;a href="http://www.japansociety.org.uk/9225/deciphering-the-rising-sun-navy-and-marine-corps-codebreakers-translators-and-interpreters-in-the-pacific-war/"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; by Ian Nish at the Japan Society:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Professor Dingman has based this enlightening study on extended interviews with former officers in the US Navy and Marine Corps who are now in their upper 80s. But he has also made much use of the unpublished memoirs to be found in the Navy Language School Collection in the Norlin Library, University of Colorado at Boulder where they were trained. It is a tribute to the US government – and the British for that matter – that they appreciated the importance of training linguists during the Asia-Pacific war and had the foresight to recruit and train personnel not of Japanese ancestry to study the Japanese language with a view to serving as language officers. Dingman concludes that it was a successful experiment and draws a painful parallel with the Bush administration’s decision to invade Iraq:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;“In June 2002 America teetered on the cusp of a war in Iraq that has lasted longer than the titanic struggle which the World War II language officers fought… It led to swift military victory, but true peace has proven elusive in the disastrously mismanaged, occupation that followed… those in our armed forces charged with carrying out their orders lacked knowledge of Iraq’s history and culture and of the language of its people. (pp. 249-50)”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there's no question that more interpreters would have been better, I wonder whether deficiencies in military language training bear any significant responsibility for the well-documented problems in managing the American occupation of Iraq. And I also wonder whether the good qualities of the Navy Language School in the 1940s were critical to the success of the American occupation of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first place, I'm fairly certain that the &lt;a href="http://www.dliflc.edu/index.html"&gt;Defense Language Institute&lt;/a&gt; graduated many more people from its Arabic programs during (say) 2001-2003 than the Navy Language School graduated from its Japanese program between July 1943 (when the first class finished) to August 1945 (when the U.S. occupation of Japan began). And on the second place, I believe that the U.S. occupation of Japan ended up being mainly managed by the Army rather than the Navy.  Certainly Douglas MacArthur was Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a picture of what the American occupation was like from a linguistic point of view, I can recommend J. Marshall Ungar's &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ScHa7N2_0HkC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Literacy and Script Reform in Occupation Japan: Reading Between the Lines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, OUP 1966, and (if you can find it) Robert King Hall Jr.'s &lt;em&gt;Education for a New Japan&lt;/em&gt;, Yale University Press, 1949. In particular, it's interesting to follow their description of the argument over whether to force a switch away from kanji ("Chinese chararcters") to the exclusive use of kana (syllabary) or romanization. Although the intellectual and political arguments were complex ones, my impression is that overall, Americans in the military who were better trained in Japanese language and culture (like Hall, who was one of the Navy's Japanese experts) tended to be on the anti-kanji side of the debate. The (pro-kanji) winners of the argument were, I think,  basically following MacArthur's general policy of leaving the Japanese governmental bureaucracy largely in place, and letting it decide most things not seen as central to American interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most relevant criticism of the U.S. military's Arabic language training would not, I think, be the quantity or quality of Arabic-language students, but rather a decision made a long before the first Gulf War about what language to teach them. Rather than learning one of the various regional colloquial versions of Arabic, students were only taught Modern Standard Arabic.  From a linguistic point of view, that's roughly like teaching people Latin and then sending them to duty stations in France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was once told by someone at DLI that they used to teach several different "colloquials", but found that the various military branches were not able to keep the differences straight, and would assign someone who had learned Moroccan Arabic to the gulf, or vice versa, so that DLI gave up and went with MSA alone, since that's the standard written form which students need to learn anyhow. According to the website of the DLI's &lt;a href="http://www.dliflc.edu/middleeasternsch.html"&gt;Middle Eastern Schools&lt;/a&gt;, they now once again teach Levantine, Egyptian, and Iraqi "dialects", "in the third semester of instruction, after students have gained a solid foundation in MSA".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, none of this detracts from the interest of Dingman's history, which I've ordered and look forward to reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, what I’d like to do is introduce you to a colleague of mine… let’s call him Fred (not his real name).  Fred and I know each other because we’re both science educators and we’ve worked together in various capacities before.  Fred is also a very devout evangelical Christian, and he is on a journey of investigation regarding skepticism, &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Creationist_Arguments"&gt;creationism&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; evolutionary science.  When I recently posted to an email list we both frequent, &lt;a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/darwins_bulldogs/"&gt;Darwin’s Bulldogs&lt;/a&gt;, about an anti-evolution letter in the local paper, he spoke up about the letter &amp;amp; writer.  His story is very poignant and quite  reminiscent of what I like to call a “thoughtful believer” who is  attempting to balance what he was once told (“brainwashing” he calls it)  in church versus the truth he now knows.  I think his story is best told in his own words, so with Fred’s permission, I now share those words with you here…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Having grown up in very conservative  churches with a “strong  faith,” yet having a scientifically inquisitive mind, I was immersed in  YEC [&lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Young-Earth_Arguments"&gt;Young Earth Creationism&lt;/a&gt;] for many years, even trying to convince others using some of the  so-called arguments based on the Bible and Christianized science that I  had at my disposal.  As I have gone through my own evolution toward  embracing evolution as revealed by the evidence, these Christianized  arguments make me a bit ill in their display of uneducated bias, blind  “faith,” and inability to see past assumptions that “we” are convinced  simply MUST be true in order to have a valid belief in God. This comes  out strongly in the last part where the evolutionary “archeaologist”  will have to either embrace the bones as evidence for his “hoped for”  link in the descent of man, or as a creationist who will see them as the  APE THAT THEY ARE.  No evidence given… no attempt to consider that  maybe there is room to really CONSIDER the evidence one way or the  other… just the confident (arrogant?) proclamation that they are from  an ape.  This is followed by the Christianized theology that only  mankind is made in the image  of God, not apes.  What does THAT mean?  We Christians tend to  throw that “image of God” thing around as though it’s a trump card, and  I’m more and more convinced that not a one of us has a CLUE what it  really means (notwithstanding the legitimacy of the Biblical statement  itself of course!).  Yet there is a tendency of smug assurance that the  “image of God” is really understood, and that WE KNOW WHAT IT MEANS AND WHAT IT DOES NOT MEAN, so case  closed.  No evidence needed.  The Bible is clear, and we know exactly  what the Bible means, so why work hard to figure out what in fact is  real as revealed by nature and open for ALL to see?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So, the confident assertions are made, and evidence is irrelevant.   Actually, evidence is not known nor understood, and this basic  stupidity pertaining to science is one of the main reasons why so many  of us Christians say such stupid things and don’t have a clue how  ridiculous it all is to thinking, educated (in science) skeptics.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Yet, perhaps the worst part of the article is the supposedly  smirk-inducing little statement “So a pig made a monkey out of an  evolutionist.”  A Christian  SHOULD be trying to follow the example of Jesus Christ I would think, and to  generalize an attitude about evolutionists like this based on a single  act of impropriety is not only to demonstrate that you are out of touch  with the reality of human ambition, but it also alienates and  marginalizes anything else you might say in terms of trying to bring a  convincing argument to the table that will lead others to some greater  “truth.”  It clearly demonstrates that you are deeply deluded if you  think pointing out someone’s bad behavior in some way argues against the  evidence of a whole body of knowledge or otherwise supports your  presuppositions of truth.  “Ah ha!  A slippery event took place in  history in this discussion, therefore my unsupported opinions must be  true!”  What kind of foolishness is this?  Who in their right mind would  give any credence to such “argumentation”?  The Jesus that I see in the  Bible sure didn’t act that way or think that way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Hopefully I’m not boring anyone with what is so obvious, but I  think I understand the psychological mindset of those “Christians”  writing these things, and unbeknownst to them it does not actually  reflect “Christ-like” thinking, and it really irritates me to see this  “raising the high banner of faith” which is done with noble intent, but  is actually raising a red flag that says “I’m an idiot” to the world of  folks who embrace reality, and have gone through the effort of figuring  out a bit of what that reality is as revealed by observations of nature.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;………………………………….&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Yes, you did send the article on Bruce Waltke [&lt;a href="http://ncse.com/news/2010/04/evangelical-scholar-expelled-over-evolution-005432"&gt;an evangelical scholar "expelled" from his seminary for accepting evolutionary science&lt;/a&gt;].   Incidentally, I heard a talk from him about 15-20 years ago that helped  shape some of my understanding of the beginning of Genesis.  It came as  a surprise to me to see that he had this kind of trouble, and  unfortunate as you mention.  Scholars like him are needed in the  seminaries, but alas, the old uneducated presumptions regarding the  “nonegotialbles of the faith” keep truth from having the balancing  impact it needs to have on the millions in the church indoctrinated in  YEC and other nonsense.  Having gone through so many iterations  of  “belief” myself, I know the power of wrong thinking, and how systemic it  is in a person’s life and world view.  Christians just CANNOT see that  they are marginalizing themselves into not just irrelevancy, but actual  disdain, becoming completely ineffective in “spreading the gospel” to  the world, which is the whole point as encouraged by the New Testament.  We  couldn’t be doing a worse job if doing a BAD job was in fact the goal!   Unfortunately, the ONLY thing in my observations that can turn this  around (as in for me), is education.  Yet it is scientific education  that we Christians are most fearful of, so we resort to Christianized  science… pseudo-science. .. and we preach to the choir and feel really  good about ourselves as we actually are erecting roadblocks to the  acquisition of the “truth” that we are committed to delivering to “the  world” that “needs to be enlightened”!  But alas, there is such momentum  in the Christian  community in line with the kind of science we ASSUME is  consistent with scripture that it is almost impossible for those so  steeped for decades (those in authority) to actually embrace what the  Bible (in my opinion)says, which is that truth can be found from nature,  and it encourages us to embrace this knowledge from nature.  Well, on  it goes…&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Just FYI, since you asked, you have total freedom to repost anything I  write if you think it might be helpful in some way.  I’ve been in “the  church” all my life right up to the present time, and it is only in the  ongoing transformation of my own thinking through studying science that I  am able to see more clearly how we Evangelical Christians have taken what has  been handed down to us essentially without question, and eventually we  just about reach the point of no return on this.  Those that fired  Waltke undoubtedly agonized over it because of his standing etc, but  truly believed that they HAD to draw the line somewhere on “truth,” and  went with their convictions and principles (commendable? ), and the wake  of destruction is self-perpetuating, and SO obvious to folks like  “Darwin’s Bulldogs” who have no felt reason to fear or doubt the amazing  story of evolution as it unfolds.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were featured because of their recent court victory in which a judge declared the National Day of Prayer unconstitutional.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The court ruling drew fire from the private National Day of Prayer Task Force. Michael Calhoun, a spokesman, described it as “an attack upon the religious heritage” of the nation. He criticized the Madison organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a sad day in America when an atheist in Wisconsin,” he said, “can undermine this tradition for millions of others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still not easy being an atheist in public. No corporate group gives money to the foundation. Ms. Gaylor said she typically avoids making her views on political candidates public, calling it “the kiss of death” to be endorsed by an organization of nonbelievers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She acknowledged voting for Mr. Obama, and expressed disappointment that his administration has defended the prayer day law. “I don’t give him a pass,” she said. “He’s a constitutional scholar. He knows we’re right.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FFRF continues to lead the charge against breaches of church/state separation.  They’re fighting the big fights and taking the criticism that goes with it.  I’m &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/12/02/is-this-atheist-sign-going-to-help/"&gt;not a fan&lt;/a&gt; of everything that they do, but I think they do enough important work that I am proud to be a member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not already, &lt;a href="http://www.ffrf.org/get-involved/membership/"&gt;you should be one, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheesh. We thought &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; were being all eco-sensitive on Earth Day by bringing a reusable coffee holder to work, drinking tap water, and taking out the recycling. But check out how these rock star mountaineers spent their Earth Week: According to &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSTRE63I54520100419"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;, 20 Nepali alpinists scaled Mount Everest a whopping 26,246 feet to an area called the “dead zone”, because it’s freezing, icy, and scary. Oh, and there’s no fucking oxygen. The point of Extreme Everest Expedition 2010 is to clean up trash and detritus that past climbers have left behind. (In some cases, actual climbers have been left behind, which makes the whole process even more challenging.) All kinds of junk including oxygen tanks, backpacks, equipment, and food storage containers litter the glacier – some of it dating to Sir Edmund Hillary’s first expedition there in 1953. And recently, the crap has become more visible due to melting snow. (Yay, global warming!) This wasn’t the first Extreme Everest Expedition, but it was the first time the hardcore adventurers climbed to such heights in search of refuse. We salute these brave and noble garbage men, especially because all we did that day was turn off the lights before we left.&lt;/p&gt;

When mixed methods are done, they are often done in sequence. For example, qualitative work to understand enough about a phenomenon to develop a survey or interviewing survey respondents  to get richer information about their responses. Network methods are neither quantitative* nor qualitative and it&amp;#39;s not typical to combine them with qualitative methods - hence my interest in this piece. Of course I&amp;#39;m also interested in collaboration in science. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The authors combine network analysis of the co-authorship network with qualitative interviews with the scientists to look at intergroup collaboration, migrations, and exchange of services or samples.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The citation:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Scientometrics&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1007%2Fs11192-010-0224-6&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=A+new+approach+to+analyzing+patterns+of+collaboration+in+co-authorship+networks%3A+mesoscopic+analysis+and+interpretation&amp;amp;rft.issn=0138-9130&amp;amp;rft.date=0&amp;amp;rft.volume=&amp;amp;rft.issue=&amp;amp;rft.spage=&amp;amp;rft.epage=&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.springerlink.com%2Findex%2F10.1007%2Fs11192-010-0224-6&amp;amp;rft.au=Velden%2C+T.&amp;amp;rft.au=Haque%2C+A.&amp;amp;rft.au=Lagoze%2C+C.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Research+%2F+Scholarship%2CLibrary+Science%2C+bibliometrics"&gt;Velden, T., Haque, A., &amp;amp; Lagoze, C. (in press). A new approach to analyzing patterns of collaboration in co-authorship networks: mesoscopic analysis and interpretation &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Scientometrics&lt;/span&gt; DOI: &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-010-0224-6"&gt;10.1007/s11192-010-0224-6&lt;/a&gt; (pre-print available at: &lt;a title="http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4761" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4761"&gt;http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4761&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As background, the authors note some of the limitations of doing ethnographic studies - rich information about a very small group of people (&lt;em&gt;transferability&lt;/em&gt;, but never generalizability) - and of doing large bibliometric studies (mapping a large crowd, but may miss nuances of sub-discipline research area, and also doesn't explain what the network features mean). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The qualitative part of their work is part of a larger ongoing study of chemistry research groups in the US and Europe.  The bibliometric information comes from topical queries in Web of Science. The keywords for the queries were selected to represent three sub-discipline research areas in chemistry. They went back 20 years, and kept the co-authors who had more than one paper in the retrieved set. The result sets were reviewed by participants in the qualitative portion to check that they were on topic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They extracted the largest component (a component is all of the nodes that are somehow connected to each other), and then did some clustering, some discussing with their participants, calculated a bunch of centrality measures, used a method from Guimera to find "hubs", and they determine if links between the clusters are more of a transfer type or collaboration type depending on their robustness to the removal of one or two author nodes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their results:  The extracted clusters matched up with the scientists&amp;#39; immediate research groups plus a few external regular collaboration partners. In some fields, the PI-led groups were almost in a perfect star &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/christinaslisrant/WindowsLiveWriter/67e3cf585140_11F89/star.png"&gt;&lt;img style="border-bottom:0px;border-left:0px;display:inline;margin-left:0px;border-top:0px;margin-right:0px;border-right:0px" title="star" border="0" alt="star" align="right" src="http://scienceblogs.com/christinaslisrant/WindowsLiveWriter/67e3cf585140_11F89/star_thumb.png" width="132" height="126"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;network shape where as in others, it was still hierarchical, but there was no one node that dominated the cluster.  Some of the clusters only had one or two authors connecting them, where as others had lots of collaborations. The authors asked about these connections, and found that the one or two author connections resulted from visiting professorships, career migration, one-off commissioned work, funded project collaboration of a sub-group leader. The many to many connections resulted from large collaborations on methods and the subject. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two of the research specialties had mostly large clusters, whereas the third had many more small clusters. The size of the cluster was correlated with the numbers of papers published (not surprising). The field with more small clusters also had a lot more single-hub clusters whereas the other two fields had multiple hubs per cluster. The collaboration type (vs transfer type) connections are more likely to be geographically proximate. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Field A apparently requires large, expensive equipment, so there is some incentive to stronger integration/collaboration. Apparently collaboration isn&amp;#39;t funded in the US for field C so there aren&amp;#39;t as many in the US as there are in other parts of the world. Field B is some area of synthetic chemistry and fields A and C are some field of physical chemistry - so there do seem to be differences in the ways these authors work. B has more hub and spoke with a PI and his or her lab whereas A &amp;amp; C have more equal distributions with denser connections. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Commentary: Is this combination of methods useful, is the article successful, and did we learn new things from it?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure the combination of methods is as new as I originally thought, but they certainly did integrate expertise from their participants at many different stages - and that&amp;#39;s healthy. So often we just talk about the discipline level and that&amp;#39;s really inadequate when you consider the diversity of research within chemistry, for example.  Elsewhere Velden et al discuss the difference between synthetic type chemists and other types, that seems to hold in this study, too. This paper was mostly about the methods (appropriate for the venue), but it would be nice to see this integrated with some of their other studies (I guess I&amp;#39;ll have to wait for the dissertation). It&amp;#39;s unfortunate that more detail can&amp;#39;t be given on the precise research areas. That information is omitted to protect the privacy of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* the authors say that network methods are quantitative - I disagree. For one thing, they are about the connections, not about actor attributes. For another, you can't do regular statistics on them because they violate all of the independence of samples, normal distributions things... so any statistics have to be done by bootstrapping.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/christinaslisrant/2010/04/review_of_an_article_using_bib.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Now, because of an internal memo that made some mild jests about confronting the Pope on his British visit with the consequences of his policies, &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/7632259/Pope-could-cancel-UK-visit-over-offensive-Foreign-Office-memo.html"&gt;the silly men in dresses are threatening to stick their noses in the air, sniff, and refuse to come&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One highly-placed source in the Vatican said: "This could have very severe repercussions and is embarrassing for the British government - one has to question whether the action taken is enough.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"It is disgusting. Britain's ambassador to the Holy See has been in to see the Secretary of State and explain what happened and this will all be relayed to the Pope.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"It's even possible the trip could be cancelled as this matter is hugely offensive."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Cardinal Renato Martino, the former head of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, said: "The British government has invited the Pope as its guest and he should be treated with respect.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"To make a mockery of his beliefs and the beliefs of millions of Catholics not just in Britain but across the world is very offensive indeed." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, &amp;quot;very offensive indeed.&amp;quot; Merely joking about asking the Pope to defend himself outrages the Vatican…but we&amp;#39;re supposed to overlook the effects his lies about birth control, disease, and the treatment of children have had on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay home, Ratzi, stay home. Hide in your palace surrounded by your sleazy sycophants, and stuff up your ears when others dare to point out that you are an evil old man running a corrupt establishment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/no_sense_of_humour_at_all_part.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/6RQ7WxNUAr4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272224494705"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=13607">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d2a6588203e9ae3c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">AI: SkeptiCal and other Conferences</title><published>2010-04-25T19:00:27Z</published><updated>2010-04-25T19:00:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/ai-skeptical-and-other-conferences/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5fbe618e00e7572fe179f8952e0d6d2a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we held our inaugural Northern California Science and Skepticism conference, &lt;a href="http://www.skepticalcon.org/"&gt;SkeptiCal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Last night, I had the absolute pleasure to hear &lt;a href="http://www.gotomidori.com/"&gt;Midori&lt;/a&gt;, one of the top violinists in the world, play with the Oregon Symphony Orchestra.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For those of you wondering, she was &lt;i&gt;spectacular&lt;/i&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does Midori sound like?  Here's her playing Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto fifteen years ago with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/AW9So5ky-38%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I recognize that classical music may not be to everyone's taste, I believe that much like a quality education and quality science, everyone should have access to a quality arts program, too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the philanthropic work that Midori is undertaking to those ends is simply phenomenal.  You can read a full biography of what she's been doing &lt;a href="http://www.gotomidori.com/english/biography.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I thought I'd share some highlights with you.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The first organization she founded to tackle this issue was Midori &amp;amp; Friends, started in 1992 in response to serious cutbacks in music education in New York City schools; over the last 17 years, over 160,000 children have benefitted from this program. Midori &amp;amp; Friends provides comprehensive music education (including instrument instruction and general music instruction), workshops and concerts to children who might not otherwise have the opportunity for involvement in the arts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 2003 Midori created another non-profit organization, Partners in Performance. The aim of "PiP" is to broaden the audience for chamber music by bringing high profile chamber music performances to small community-based organizations in the U.S. Among the communities where PiP has been presented since its inception are Randolph, Vermont; Manasquan, New Jersey; Plymouth, New Hampshire; Reno, Nevada; Barron, Wisconsin; Richland, Washington; McHenry, Maryland; and five small communities in Montana, Minnesota and Missouri.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;2004-2005 marked the inauguration of Midori's Orchestra Residencies Program, in which she spends a week with a local youth orchestra which has ties to a small professional orchestra; Midori performs with both orchestras, coaching young musicians, appearing at benefits and subscription series concerts and working with both orchestras to raise arts awareness within the community.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Midori feels passionately that people must have access to a variety of great music, regardless of their age, race, social class, geographic location, or financial means. In 2007 Midori was designated an official U.N. Messenger of Peace by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who cited her community engagement work as a model of exemplary commitment to worldwide goals shared by the U.N.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Isn't that amazing?  And for all of this -- her virtuosity with the violin and all of these education efforts -- Midori &lt;i&gt;isn't even 40&lt;/i&gt; yet!  So whether you're a fan and patron of the symphony or not, I hope you find this story of someone just taking the initiative to make this quality of music and of music education available to everyone uplifting and inspiring.  I know it certainly inspires me!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a great weekend, and I'll be back with more about the Universe for you on Monday!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/04/weekend_diversion_midori_and_t.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272219091548"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/beautiful_antarctica_feature_o.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c89b16711e001452</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Environment"/><title type="html">Beautiful Antarctica feature on BoingBoing</title><published>2010-04-25T18:56:59Z</published><updated>2010-04-25T18:56:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/NPfsnTdcBFc/beautiful_antarctica_feature_o.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/beautiful_antarctica_feature_o.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dynamic.boingboing.net/cgi-bin/mt/mt-cp.cgi?__mode=view&amp;amp;blog_id=1&amp;amp;id=109668" title=""&gt;Maggie Koerth-Baker&lt;/a&gt;, who I finally met in person at AAAS meeting, just designed an amazing feature on BoingBoing - the &lt;a href="http://www.boingboing.net/features/antarctica.html" title=""&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's about the Antarctic Geospatial Information Center, a group of researchers based at the University of Minnesota who do the information processing and visualization that makes other research on the Frozen Continent possible. The story features some great details about life in Antarctica and tons of photos taken by the AGIC crew.

&lt;p&gt;Quick fun fact: Do you know how researchers use satellite images to find packs of penguins? Turns out, they look for huge smears of brownish-red penguin poop across the white landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Australia, school kids can opt-in to take scripture classes, and the kids who opt out get to sit in the school during those hours doing nothing, which seems a bit of a waste. So the schools have a new plan: while the religious kids are off memorizing bible verses, the secular kids will get classes in ethics which will "cover topics including respect, bullying, animal rights and questions about life and death."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sounds reasonable to me, and a good use of time. Guess who doesn't like the idea, though? Church leaders! There is actually a rule that prohibits secular students from any formal learning during that special scripture time. The Catholics are whining that giving non-Christians an introduction to ethics could "jeopardise the future of religious education". Ministers are complaining that it's unfair to give an introduction to ethics without input from their religious point of view. Apparently, if you're not a Christian, you're expected to spend your time working on coloring books or perfecting your thumb-twiddling, rather than actually learning something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now there's a poll on this subject. It looks like a lot of people in NSW are in favor of enforced idleness for secular kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ow.ly/1CLog"&gt;Should ethics classes be introduced into NSW primary schools?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's an Italian cafe/deli round the corner. It's a quiet place, which seems to suit the proprietors well in a &lt;em&gt;Black Books&lt;/em&gt;-sort of way (although without the personality defects): they open when they feel like it and there are rarely more than three people in at any one time. They do a fine line in double espressos and ciabattas, and sell cheese. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we perused the cheese counter last weekend we came across something neither of us had heard of before--taleggio cheese. Sounded interesting, and through the wonders of the internets, iPhones and (despite local mad environmentalists objecting to phone masts) a wavering &lt;span&gt;GPRS &lt;/span&gt;signal we found out that it is a 'semi-soft, washed-rind cheese from the Valteggio region in northern Italy.' Sounded good, and &lt;strike&gt;Bernard&lt;/strike&gt; the East End/Italian proprietor said it would go well in a salad, so that's what we're having with dinner tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unfortunate side of this story is the actual website I found describing the taleggio. The &lt;span&gt;URL &lt;/span&gt;is www.artisanalcheese.com, and if that doesn't make you laugh, maybe the following rambling anecdote might give you a clue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{FX: wavy lines}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when online publication of journals (how did we get from cheese to journals? Well, never mind) was still relatively new and exciting, my boss at the time was editoring a certain journal. And because online publication was still relatively new and exciting, he and the rest of them were quite interested in hit counts for the papers (article-level metrics; way before PLoS got in on the act). And they noticed, as the story was related to me, one paper getting masses of hits. As in orders of magnitude more than the rest. 'Strange,' they thought, 'what's so exciting about &lt;strong&gt;Molecular dissection, tissue localization and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binding of the ryanodine receptor of &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ?'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then someone read the abstract, and all became clear. This quiet, unassuming paper, which was getting absolutely &lt;em&gt;hammered&lt;/em&gt; by search engines, happens to bear, in the abstract (which is freely searchable, even if the rest of the paper isn't) the line (and bear in mind that 'and' is usually treated as an operator, not a search term)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;CeRyR was found in the body wall, pharyngeal, vulval, anal and sex muscles of adult worms and also found to be present in embryonic muscle, but not in non-muscle cells.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a moral here, but I can't think what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

And the campaign has begun against &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Christian-Delusion-Why-Faith-Fails/dp/1616141689?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;link_code=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969"&gt;The Christian Delusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;l=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1616141689" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important;padding:0px!important"&gt;.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some guy who goes by the name of Winston Smith is doing it. He goes by so many different names on Amazon and in several Blogger accounts I cannot remember them all, like KC James, Frank Walton, Andrew, D. Christensen, Anna B, possibly Brenda here at DC, or whatever name he comes up with next. Winston Smith (Frank Walton, et al.) just made a veiled threat about several negative reviews that he claims will be posted about this book on Amazon beginning on Tuesday. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2010/04/brief-review-of-loftus-delusion-book.html?showComment=1272202233043#c9055692379833647405"&gt;See here.&lt;/a&gt; As I said he has many email, Amazon and Blogger accounts and uses them in an attempt to smear me and this book because he's threatened by it and cannot answer it. &lt;b&gt;He is deluded. He thinks the Christian truth must be defended by a host of lies, and THAT should give him pause to think he is one of the brainwashed ones, but he's so brainwashed he won't even consider this possibility.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David Eller said that people like him have "a different set of eyes than we do, and they cannot see what we see. Criticizing them, even poking them in the eye, simply does not improve their vision. They are deep inside a Christian box, and until they see the box and the world outside of it, their view is fatally limited."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another possible name Frank goes by is Lenny, and he has attempted to smear David Eller on Richard Carrier's blog where Richard offers a review of our book. &lt;a href="http://richardcarrier.blogspot.com/2010/04/christian-delusion.html?showComment=1271688825166#c7774460618311215036"&gt;See here&lt;/a&gt;. But I did not let him get away with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Smear campaigns. Yep. That's how to defend the Christian truth. Right. It's laughable if it weren't so annoying.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-4439560240730815677?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  plan is that by the end of 2010:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80% of people at risk from malaria are using locally appropriate  vector control methods such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLins),  indoor residual spraying (irS) and, in some settings, other  environmental and biological measures;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80% of malaria patients are diagnosed and treated with effective  anti-malarial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;treatments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in areas of high transmission, 100% of pregnant women receive  intermittent preventive treatment (iPT);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the global malaria burden is reduced by 50% of the 2000 levels:  ~175-250M cases annually and less than 500,000 deaths annually from  malaria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rollbackmalaria.org/gmap/images/figure2-21.gif"&gt;&lt;img title="figure2-21" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/figure2-21.gif?w=300&amp;amp;h=207&amp;amp;h=207" alt="figure2-21" width="300" height="207"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This graph &lt;a title="PDF" href="http://www.rollbackmalaria.org/gmap/"&gt;from the Global  Malaria Plan&lt;/a&gt; shows the projected effects of these interventions on  different timelines.  Acting quickly &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; save lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we, as individuals in the US, do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nothingbutnets.net/its-easy-to-help/"&gt;Nothing but  Nets&lt;/a&gt; is one way to contribute.  Let major pharmaceutical  corporations know you applaud (and expect!) their efforts to lower  pricing on malarial drugs.  Lastly, let your legislators know you  support funding for malaria research and aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last one is hard–right now things are pretty tight in the US for  a lot of people. I’m having some serious issues in my life right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m still so, so privileged to live in a place with clean water  and electricity on demand and little threat of infectious disease  (relatively).  Don’t forget that even now, as financial times are hard,  we &lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt; are pretty darn lucky compared to our brothers  and sisters in Africa, Asia, and South America struggling with malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will YOU do today?&lt;/p&gt;

This is perfectly reasonable, but he chose to &lt;a href="http://johnmckay.blogspot.com/2010/04/our-mollusk-overlords.html"&gt;illustrate the concept&lt;/a&gt;, and my SIWOTI syndrome kicked in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noooo! He&amp;#39;s got an arrow for a &amp;quot;large brain&amp;quot; pointing to an enlarged fleshy flap above the eyes. That&amp;#39;s not where the cephalopod brain is located! They have a ventral nerve cord — the central brain would be deep, between the eyes and behind the beak, wrapped around the esophagus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this alternate universe, the intelligent cephalopods would be speculating  about how those primitive, stupid vertebrates could have evolved into something as clever as they are, and they'd draw something frog-like and point to a puffy throat-sac and say, "look at its big brain!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strip's premise: Jaques is dependent on a dictionary for the interpretation of one critical word or phrase in each instruction he's given, while being unaware of the existence of polysemy and completely devoid of common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://www.barnaclepress.com/cmcvlt/DictionaryJaques/jaques121201.jpg"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; from which the illustrative detail on the right is taken, Jaques' employer introduces the new kitchen maid and tells him to "present her to the chef". Jaques looks up &lt;em&gt;present&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&amp;quot;Zee deectionary say &amp;#39;present&amp;#39; mean &amp;#39;exhibit to view&amp;#39; — now I look up &amp;#39;exhibit&amp;#39; Ah! Ze word &amp;#39;exhibit&amp;#39; mean  - &amp;#39;force into notice&amp;#39;. I do so at once.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it turns out that he wasn't actually supposed to shove her into the kitchen, grasp her firmly and lift her up so that the chef is forced to notice her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would make sense for Carey to have used the glosses from an actual dictionary. A &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;amp;as_brr=0&amp;amp;q=exhibit+%22force+into+notice%22&amp;amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;amp;as_miny_is=1800&amp;amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;amp;as_maxy_is=1912"&gt;bit of web search&lt;/a&gt; suggests that he might have found the "force into notice" phrase in the &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=VkoZAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA261"&gt;entry for &lt;em&gt;display&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=VkoZAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;New Websterian 1912 Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;, although the &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=VkoZAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA309"&gt;entry for &lt;em&gt;exhibit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; merely gives the gloss "to present to view; display; show; manifest publicly; present formally or officially; administer".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carey also seems to have used a bit of poetic license in the several strips that depend on Jaques' inability to distinguish between the presence and absence of [h] at the start of words, or rather his tendency to get it exactly backwards, which is presented via the comedic premise that &lt;a href="http://www.barnaclepress.com/cmcvlt/DictionaryJaques/jaques130413.jpg"&gt;his aristocratic employer speaks a a sort of hypercorrecting Cockney&lt;/a&gt; in which [h] and non-[h] are reversed:&lt;/p&gt;

Forgive me if that is &amp;#39;immoral&amp;#39;, but I&amp;#39;m not Christian and thus am not obligated to be intellectually monogamous. So there.Onychophorans (velvet worms) are fucking adorable. Now, whether they are more or less adorable than, say, hypotrich ciliates or Apusomonas proboscidea, is open to debate (I remain loyal to my tribal academic affiliations in that regard), but there&amp;#39;s no way you can look at this wonderful creature and not think it&amp;#39;s damn cute:Something about onychophoran morphology resonates quite nicely with our innate aesthetic senses...or maybe it&amp;#39;s just me. Some of them have really pretty patterns too, or come in absolutely bizarre colours. (Mayer &amp;amp; Herzsch 2007 BMC Evol Biol)A while back someone was waxing poetic about social spiders in class, which led me on quite an adventure. Since I had something very important to do that night, like an exam the following day or something, I got a lot of procrastination done: read about various social spiders (who also have an interesting story of evolutionary dead ends and conflicting levels of selection; oh, and a species with observed cooperative transport of large prey -- apparently fairly rare in arthropods), made my way to social pseudoscorpions (some of them apparently disperse by riding large insects like bugs or beetles), and then I hit upon this paper:Social behaviour in an Australian velvet worm, Euperipatoides rowelli (Onychophora: Peripatopsidae) (Reinhard &amp;amp; Rowell 2005 J Zool)Social behaviour in onychophorans? Seriously!? On a second thought, why the hell not? And then came a complete overload of cute that could&amp;#39;ve only been enhanced by better images...velvet worms who cuddle!Awww =D Reinhard &amp;amp; Rowell 2005 J ZoolAs cuddly as they may seem, these guys also have a strict social hierarchy involving an alpha female. Reinhard and Rowell (2005) describe a feeding process where a cricket was thrown into the petri dish and attacked by the adult onychophorans (who trap their prey with sticky salivary secretions). After subduing the cricket, the first female fed on the prey for nearly an hour, biting and chasing off any other individual that would approach. After that hour, other females were allowed to feed, and then eventually males and juveniles. Most of the males were feeding after the females left. A feminist&amp;#39;s paradise.The interactions between individuals were observed and classified into dominant vs. subordinate: biting and chasing were done by the dominant individual (with the subordinate fleeing) whereas climbing was done by the subordinate and up to the decision of the dominant whether or not to be tolerated:Juveniles were generally left alone and tolerated. Meanwhile, the adults were involved in a constant display of aggression and submission. Females were dominant to the males. When groups of onychophorans from different logs (thus, different social groups) were pairs, individuals of both groups acted aggressively to each other, and despite the males insisting on climbing, no aggregations were formed as they were ruthlessly rejected. Thus, the social groups are stable and at least these onychophorans seem to be capable of kin recognition.The dominance hierarchy seemed largely size-dependent, with smaller females almost always being subservient to the larger individuals. It is believed that as in many other instances of sociality, social behaviour here aids in the cooperative capture of large prey. Curiously, the strict hierarchy when it comes to feeding, with the alpha female hoarding the entire prey, is not known in any other invertebrate.Onychophoran behaviour doesn&amp;#39;t receive much attention, perhaps at least partly due to the onychophoran&amp;#39;s idea of a perfect habitat not coinciding all too well with that of an ethologist: velvet worms love cold, damp places. So it wouldn&amp;#39;t be too surprising if an entire group of social species were eventually discovered, perhaps even with separate origins. In fact, Reinhard and Rowell (2005) state that it is not even known whether sociality may be common for onychophorans in general. On the topic of behaviour, despite their cute and almost fluffy appearance, onychophorans can also be quite vicious. This one devoured a spider bigger than itself:Sticky spit vs. sticky silk. Quite surprisingly, the spit won this battle. (while checking whether this spider actually produces silk, found out that apprently tarantulas secrete adhesive silk from their feet...)It is thought that in order to partake in such complex social behaviours, the onychophoran must have a fairly well-developed region for higher level sensory processing. (considering the complexity of the visual and olfactory cues likely involved in this case, it seems quite plausible. That said, there may well be fairly intricate social interactions out there that do not rely on complex neurology, by executing much simpler rules...) Curiously, they seem to have structures similar to &amp;#39;mushroom bodies&amp;#39; in arthropods responsible for visual and olfactory processing and regulating complex behaviours. Actually, that was just an excuse to show this stunning image:Onychophoran nervous system. Pseudocoloured to reflect the nerve depth in the confocal projection. Parts of the nervous system arise in a segmented fashion (eg. leg innervation), parts are repeated but not in a segmented way, and they also lack segmental ganglia as those in arthropods. Thus, onychophorans are slightly segmented in some respects, if you will, but still quite different fr...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reading through all this, I was reminded of John Dewey, who began his  philosophic career as a Hegelian but said he finally came to realize  that a system of thought can be internally coherent and still be crazy. &lt;em&gt;What  Darwin Got Wrong,&lt;/em&gt; at least across the three parts, doesn’t even  have the virtue of being consistent. If “selection for” attributes to  nature an intentionality that it cannot have, then “constraint on,” the  favored conception of the first part of the book, must also operate  under the tainted assumption. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini read the first chapter of the &lt;em&gt;Origin&lt;/em&gt;,  they would have seen that Darwin argues there not so much that  artificial selection is a model for natural selection as that it is  exactly the same thing. Darwin regarded the breeder’s intention,  correctly I believe, as simply another environmental condition—one that  rarely has a predictable outcome, as he discovered when he tried to  breed fancy pigeons back to their original ancestral colors. Darwin thus  directly demonstrated natural selection at work. And we do the same in  the case of drug resistance. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors, in a denigrating mode, claim that a historical account  cannot be supported by counterfactuals, as if evidence and  generalizations were unknown to the historian. History and thus  evolution are both, they say, “just one damned thing after another.” Yet  they concede that many historical narratives, that is, causally  sufficient accounts, are “reasonable” and “plausible.” Unless this is an  utterly empty concession, they must allow what the historian takes for  granted: namely, that he or she, on the basis of evidence and supported  generalizations, can uphold the relevant counterfactuals—counterfactuals  to the effect that if the significant antecedent conditions mentioned  in the narrative had not occurred, neither would the event of interest,  at least not in the form that it did. If the historian could not defend  such counterfactuals, then it would be impossible to assess his or her  narrative as “reasonable” or “plausible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historical accounts depend on evidence and generalizations derived  from observation, and evolutionary explanations have the added advantage  of experiment. These well-honed techniques of inquiry form the basis  for the kinds of discriminations that Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini both  deny and grant the laborers in these fields. The authors thus  orchestrate a medley of contradictions that can delight only the ears of  creationists and proponents of intelligent design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, finally, the scathing conclusion, which is just about right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the legendary meeting of the British Association in 1860, Bishop  Samuel Wilberforce attacked the Darwinian defender Thomas Henry Huxley  with this barb: Did Mr. Huxley claim his descent from a monkey through  his grandmother’s or his grandfather’s side? Huxley reputedly whispered  to a friend: “The Lord has delivered him into my hands.” Huxley retorted  that he would rather have a monkey as his ancestor than be connected  with a man who used great gifts to obscure the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little birdie tells me that there will be a couple more important reviews appearing shortly. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

What's noteworthy is that it happened during the years of the Hays Code (1930-1968) when "scenes of passion" were extremely restricted and kisses were limited to seconds. To get around the regulations, director Alfred Hitchcock cleverly filmed Grant and Bergman exchanging a series of interrupted kisses as Grant answers a telephone call. So each kiss takes just moments, but the entire scene is nearly three minutes.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Many women who do not dress modestly … lead young men astray, corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society, which (consequently) increases earthquakes.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If some random person said it, we wouldn’t care.  But this was a man with an important title.  And some people might actually believe his bullshit theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jen McCreight&lt;/strong&gt; (rhymes with “kite”) posted a &lt;a href="http://www.blaghag.com/2010/04/in-name-of-science-i-offer-my-boobs.html"&gt;quick, random response to this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Time for a Boobquake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, April 26th, I will wear the most cleavage-showing shirt I own. Yes, the one usually reserved for a night on the town. I encourage other female skeptics to join me and embrace the supposed supernatural power of their breasts. Or short shorts, if that’s your preferred form of immodesty. With the power of our scandalous bodies combined, we should surely produce an earthquake. If not, I’m sure Sedighi can come up with a rational explanation for why the ground didn’t rumble. And if we really get through to him, maybe it’ll be one involving plate tectonics.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=116336578385346"&gt;Facebook page created&lt;/a&gt; for it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few days, Jen has been &lt;a href="http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/04/22/blogger-show-cleavage-to-test-cleric%E2%80%99s-quake-theory/?hpt=T2"&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; all &lt;a href="http://www.sydsvenskan.se/varlden/article794149/Kvinnor-tar-bone-%C2%AD-ledare-pa-orden.html"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/To-counter-Iran-cleric-student-sets-off-boobquake/articleshow/5850729.cms"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;.  On Monday, unless some breaking news hits, she’ll be appearing on FOX News and CNN’s “Situation Room.”  That’s amazing, considering this was something she put together a few minutes before she went to go watch an episode of &lt;em&gt;House&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve gone through something similar — getting &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400073472/wwwfriendlyat-20?creative=327641&amp;amp;camp=14573&amp;amp;adid=18W1JCWJJJSG4NQGMG7Q&amp;amp;link_code=as1"&gt;a lot of media attention&lt;/a&gt; for what was really a random thing I just happened to do one evening with relatively little thought put into it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why did Boobquake go viral?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I can offer a number of reasons, many of which parallel my own experiences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It has a memorable name&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to remember “Boobquake.”  It’s easy to Tweet &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23boobquake"&gt;#Boobquake&lt;/a&gt;.  And it’s just fun to say.  (Just like “eBay atheist” and “selling my soul on eBay.”)  If this had some long, drawn-out description, I think it would’ve stopped at her blog.  The title helps.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The timeline is perfect&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen posted about Boobquake on &lt;a href="http://www.blaghag.com/2010/04/in-name-of-science-i-offer-my-boobs.html"&gt;Monday, April 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  And she planned for the actual “event” to take place a week from that date.  If she had it take place a couple days after her initial posting, it couldn’t have generated enough support to get real attention.  If it were to take place in a month, people wouldn’t be talking about it at the rate they are right now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week was enough time to get people excited, able to spread the word, and get the attention of the media (which sometimes needs a day or two to write an article or set up an interview).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I did my eBay auction, the auction lasted a week as well.  Most of the media came in the last few days.  There was anticipation for how it would end and I doubt that could’ve lasted for more than that long.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a clever way to handle a serious subject&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are very cautious about how to approach serious subjects like religion.  They’re even more cautious when they deal with Islam.  Case in point: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/201_(South_Park)#Censorship"&gt;South Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this rebuttal to an Islamic leader was smart and witty.  It doesn’t sound like it’s anti-Islam, but in its own way, it’s taking on the oppressive environment to women that Islam fosters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s also why people were drawn to an atheist visiting churches.  It was a serious subject… but somehow, it felt less threatening than other attempts at linking those two worlds.  People felt more comfortable talking about it or participating in the discussions surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was started by a young person&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is debatable, but I don’t think Boobquake would’ve have worked if it was started up by a woman in her 40s.  Maybe not even in her 30s.  The fact that it was a college student spearheading Boobquake helped make this story that much more media-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I think it helped that I was just out of college when the eBay stuff happened.  It just wouldn’t have been as captivating if it was a 50-year-old Christian pastor buying “the soul” of a 50-year-old atheist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There was just enough room for misinformation to take hold&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name Boobquake lends itself to curiosity.  &lt;em&gt;What does it mean?  Is this about feminism?  Is this only for women with bigger boobs?  Do they actually think an earthquake will happen?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the questions are ridiculous, but they do call for a more nuanced explanation of what Boobquake really is.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means more interview requests for Jen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ditto when someone wants to know if I’m really “selling my soul.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s about boobs.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That totally gets attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got nothing to top that.  Cockquake just wouldn’t have had the same appeal &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I’ll announce the winner when I return from Vancouver on Wednesday. The contest was closed, by the way, at 5 p.m. Friday, though if you want to tout one of your favorite books, by all means post on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a winner in the &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/17/caturday-felid-part-deux/"&gt;How-did-Charles-the-Cat-get-to-Chicago? contest&lt;/a&gt;.  Many of the entries were quite clever, but I judge &lt;strong&gt;Bimston&lt;/strong&gt;‘s entry (post #12) the victor.  It clearly required a lot of thought, and was very clever, what with the names (Don Gato cartel, whiskertap, Fluffers Jimenez and all), and the intricate scenario in which Charles is tracked to Chicago by federal agents for possession of catnip.  Just an excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.20.10&lt;br&gt;
F. Jiminez apprehended after stakeout of Holiday Inn alley near  Springfield, Ill.  Jiminez and unknown felid resist apprehension,  resulting in death of felid (traffic) as well as agents Sqeakers and  Whiskerman (predation).  Upon bath interrogation, perpetrator indicates  that C. Alex left the day before and is likely headed north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.01.10&lt;br&gt;
Informant Yippers *name redacted* reports seeing perpetrator in Chicago  area while on her daily walk.  Subsequent raid of nearby dumpster  reveals evidence of predation (avian class 1, rodent) but olfactory and  gustatory analysis (feces) indicates that C. Alex had abandoned the  dumpster 36-48 hours previously.  Whisker-tap indicates the perpetrator  may be attempting escape into Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bath interrogation” is mucho lolz: waterboarding for cats!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bimston, whoever you are, please email me (my address is widely available on the internet) with your address.  An autographed paperback of &lt;em&gt;WEIT&lt;/em&gt; will be sent your way.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s a new online course that is being produced by the University of New Hampshire by Dr Henn, about skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2008/11/on-quantum-and-parapsychology/"&gt;the course I did in Parapsychology&lt;/a&gt; online via the &lt;a href="http://www.koestler-parapsychology.psy.ed.ac.uk/cwatt/OSTeach.html"&gt;University of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;, this one features podcast interviews with people. One of which will be on me, about my studies, my travels and all the other podcasty/bloggy stuff that I get up to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m very flattered – you won’t hear many interviews of me out there, less than a handful – the &lt;a href="http://www.skepticzone.tv"&gt;Skeptic Zone&lt;/a&gt; has only ever &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/podcast/"&gt;played the interviews I’ve conducted or lectures I’ve sent in&lt;/a&gt; (I think there’s two of those). However, you do hear me with all the lovely people that I interview for the show, on a fairly regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently had a hand in the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; ‘&lt;strong&gt;Best Interview I’ve Ever Done, That I Actually Didn’t Do&lt;/strong&gt;‘!&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The first one, funnily enough, was conducted by the same University professor I mentioned previously, &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2008/09/mark-gravy-roberts-a-911-conspiracy-theory-debunker/"&gt;Dr Mark Henn, with Mark ‘Gravy’ Roberts.&lt;/a&gt; That was done for the very first Skeptic Zone podcast, recorded in New York in my hotel room – because, as you can hear by the audio, the best person to do the interview was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second interview is pretty much the same circumstances, with Milton Mermikides as the best-qualified-and-yet-not-directly-involved-with-the-album kindly agreeing to do it for me. He certainly didn’t need any help on my part! I don’t quite know when it’s going to be released, but you can hear George Hrab refer to Milton Mermikides asking him questions about Trebuchet, in the most recent Geologic Podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So – why mention all of this now? Because I just zipped Dr Henn a question about something regarding dowsing. Daniel Loxton, as you can see in his ‘Tweet-stream’, has a bit of a challenge – finding a good dowsing-looking stick, in the middle of a city. My first response was ‘why a stick? Why not wire?’ I remembered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/podblack/status/12793819714"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last time I was in Albany, West Aust., was told: ‘bit of fencing bale, from the property where you were dowsing’?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Back then I was told that it was all down to a certain twist-to-the-wire, taken from the farm where you’re looking for this hypothetical well. Not that this is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way people dowse for water, of course. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nor do they only dowse for water, as you might very well know! One of the interviews I did for the Token Skeptic, with Professor Bruce Hood, has still not resulted in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://brucemhood.wordpress.com/2010/02/24/chopsticks-are-just-as-good/"&gt;ADE651 or GT200 ‘bomb dowsing’ devices to be completely pulled from the market&lt;/a&gt;. I even remember people linking to stories about &lt;a href="http://paranormal.about.com/od/dowsing/a/aa110705.htm"&gt;dowsing for ghosts&lt;/a&gt; and even an ongoing claim for the JREF million dollars about dowsing for gold. None of them, hoewever, have successfully gone past tests for their validity – &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8PSmRpA_gA"&gt;as Dr Chris French has shown in the Dawkins documentary ‘Enemies of Reason’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magician Derren Brown even featured a segment on the topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rOqyMykIso"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rOqyMykIso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So – I asked Dr Henn for a summary of what he has in his office, in terms of dowsing implements – he replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I currently only have several sets of bent brass L-rods in the office (I have used them for water and for gold; remarkable how they always find my ring, even when my eyes are closed, so long as I know where it is). Victor probably still has the pendulums–we had a $300 set of pendulum dowsing bobs (along with their radiesthesia healing pendulums for distance or direct diagnosis and healing).  Some 20-30 different pendulums, each tuned to a different substance, so I can separately dowse for gold, silver, or other stuff, or see if you have lead or arsenic poisoning, or exactly what.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dowsing-rod/id314074433?mt=8"&gt;&lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Picture-23.png" alt="" width="305" height="242"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have also used maple and willow forked sticks, and I had a friend use a coat hanger to not find (well, he thought he had found it) my water pipes.  A student also had a crystal pendulum her mum used to use for determining the sex of babies for pregnant women. Worked about half the time…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way – YES there is someone who has created an &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dowsing-rod/id314074433?mt=8"&gt;application for the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, about a year ago. &lt;em&gt;“You are an excellent Dowsing master if you walk around it earnestly while you catch iPhone between a thumb and forefingers like a genuine dowsing rod easily and keep iPhone horizontally.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the reviews are less than… raving.&lt;/p&gt;

by Puppylover17 – &lt;em&gt;This is the stupidest game ever. I am so glad it didn’t cost anything don’t waste your time getting it like I did. Dumb.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
by Sils213  &lt;em&gt;What is this thing an how is it supposed to work?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of all? &lt;em&gt;“I used this dowsing rod application when I was in the desert to find water. An arch nemesis left me in the middle of the desert with only a bottle of motor oil, after he threw me out of the CEO position of my multi-national corporation.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The threat was issued after South Park’s episode “200” in which all the people that South Park ever made fun of, led by Tom Cruise, teamed up to get back at the town.  To protect themselves from the ridicule of South Park citizens, they plotted to capture Muhammad and steal his secret ability to not be made fun of.  To avoid breaking the rule against depicting the prophet Muhammad, Stone &amp;amp; Parker dressed Muhammad up in a bear suit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Never mind that Muhammad had co-starred sans censorship in the 2001 episode “Super-Best Friends”, since played as a rerun hundreds of times without controversy, and that Muhammad appeared hundreds of more times amongst the other Super-Best Friends in post-2001 intro graphics for the show.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the threat was issued, and after Comedy Central began to kowtow to the terrorists by increasing the censorship of the show, the sequel episode “201” revealed that it had not been Muhammad in a bear suit after all, but Santa Claus.  Despite the complete non-depiction of Muhammad in the show (in the non-bear-costume shots, Muhammad had been hidden behind a CENSORED box), Comedy Central has now taken even the censored version of episode 201, and the old Super-Best Friends episode, off its website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what’s the connection to evolution?  Well, I was watching a CNN discussion which featured a clip scrolling through RevolutionMuslim.com’s blogposts.  Here’s the cowardly “kill people who disagree” (I’m paraphrasing, obviously) post…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolution - Fact or Fiction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday, 19 April 2010 17:52 | Written by Abu Juhayman | PDF | E-mail&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To claim London was built by coincidence (by rainfall and storms) is ridiculous. Just like to claim the cell was created by accident is ridiculous. The cell is the most complex structure in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human species contain more than 200,000 protein molecules. The emergence of one protein with 500 ammo acids by coincidence is the odds of 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;950&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biogenesis entails the fact that life can only come from life. Who created the first life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[52:35] “Were they created by nothing, or were they themselves the creators?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tornado ripping through the jungle could not form a Boeing 747. Then how can an explosion such as the big bang cause the effect of such a perfectly formed Universe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, how can an explosive occurrence such as the big bang result in the perfect formation existing today? Usually an explosion causes destruction and chaos, however today we find following the big bang; advanced life structures made up of complex cells have resulted from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[30:27] “And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it (after it has been perished); and this is easier for Him. His is the highest description (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but But, and there is nothing comparable unto Him) in the heavens and in the earth. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural selection cannot produce new DNA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutation to DNA can only be negative and harmful, so how could we evolve in DNA positively? If DNA is broken, and mutilated, you could grow an arm on your back, etc. There are only negative mutations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[22:73] “O mankind! A similitude has been coined, so listen to it (carefully): Verily, those on whom you call besides Allaah, cannot create (even) a fly, even though they combine together for the purpose. And if the fly snatches away a thing from them, they will have no power to release it from the fly. So weak are (both) the seeker and the sought.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no fossils for “transitional forms”. There are over 100 million fossils today, but not a single fossil is of a transitional form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fossils show species appear in their unique form. There is no gradualism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All phyla appeared all of a sudden. There is no evidence (fossils) for ancestral forms. They are complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[2:117] “The Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it: “Be!” - and it is.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fish breathe by their gills, how would they turn into lungs? How would fins turn into feet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amphibians were always amphibians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say the original flight happened by dinosaurs chasing flies. Where did the ancestors of those flies get their wings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.5 billion years old bacteria fossil found in Australia is exactly the same as present-day bacteria fossils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fossils of ants 100 million years ago are the same as today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot underestimate the soft-tissues, the reconstruction of half-man/half-ape is down to the imagination of the sculptor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sculptors mould the plaster replication of a human onto the skull of an ape, make it appear to have human eyes and call it “the ancestor of man”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[17:81] “And say: “Truth (i.e. Islamic Monotheism or this Qur’aan or Jihaad against polytheists) has come and Baatil (falsehood, i.e. Satan or polytheism) has vanished. Surely, Baatil is ever bound to vanish.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolution in itself does not necessitate the non-existence of a Creator because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[25:2] “He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Who has begotten no son (children or offspring) and for Whom there is no partner in the dominion. He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[25:3] “Yet they have taken besides Him other aleehaah (gods) who created nothing but are themselves created, and possess neither harm nor benefit for themselves; and possess no power (of causing) death, nor (of giving) life, nor of raising the dead.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[56:57] “We created you, 0 then why do you believe not?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Googling shows that the text is identical to &lt;a href="http://www.supportersofsunnah.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;amp;view=item&amp;amp;id=19:evolution-fact-or-fiction?&amp;amp;Itemid=7" rel="external "&gt;this text posted March 23&lt;/a&gt; on another Islamic website.  And the claims are presumably taken straight from Harun Yahya materials, which are known for an extra-strong fixation on the idea that the fossil record shows no evidence of change (and &lt;a href="http://sciencereligionnews.blogspot.com/2009/02/evolution-of-harun-yahyas-atlas-of.html" rel="external "&gt;for confusing fishing lures with the real insect&lt;/a&gt;).  And of course the Stephen Meyer DNA/information argument, the Fred Hoyle Boeing 747 argument, etc., have been copied by the Muslim creationists from the Christian ID/creationist movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it’s utterly standard antievolution silliness.  I wouldn’t draw any particular guilt-by-association conclusions about Christian fundamentalist creationism/ID from this – after all, no one can control what kooks will take up one’s ideas.  But I do find it entertaining to ponder what RevolutionMuslim would think if it knew the agenda and political associations of the folks who manufactured the antievolution arguments they use, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

I hate that it's a natural impulse--in fact, a necessity of communication--to lump people together and assign characteristics to those lumps. I hate that stereotypes are almost always based around some kernel of truth, so that a legitimately true statement can be dismissed as "propagating a negative sterotype" or "[insert group here]ism." But what I hate the most, what really rankles my hackles up, is when people act in ways that reinforce those stereotypes. I hate seeing liberals who are indignant vegan newagers. I hate seeing racist homophobic Republican NRA members driving rusty pickup trucks with Confederate Flags on the back. I hate seeing disgustingly socially inept nerds like &lt;a href="http://occasionalsuperheroine.blogspot.com/2010/04/fan-behavior-that-embarrasses-everybody.html"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbFjePdOpK8"&gt;assholes&lt;/a&gt;. I hate hearing Michael Steele talk about things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which is why I'm upset by the reaction to &lt;a href="http://www.blaghag.com/2010/04/in-name-of-science-i-offer-my-boobs.html"&gt;Jen McCreight's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23boobquake"&gt;Boobquake&lt;/a&gt; idea. Here's the Cliff's Notes version of Boobquake, for the uninitiated: a Muslim cleric said that women dressing immodestly causes adultery, which in turn causes earthquakes. Jen reasoned that the proper response to this ridiculous (but empirically testable!) claim was to ridicule and empirically test it. So was born Boobquake: a suggestion for women to dress immodestly on a specific day (this coming Monday, April 26th), either causing worldwide earthquakes with their abundant cleavage, or falsifying the cleric's inane hypothesis. It's a cute idea, reminiscent of Rebecca Watson's recent &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/03/the-great-apple-experiment/"&gt;Great Apple Experiment&lt;/a&gt;--both taking a ridiculous claim and simultaneously giving it the (lack of) respect it deserves while also taking the opportunity to do some good science and promote skepticism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The response has been enormous and &lt;a href="http://www.blaghag.com/2010/04/quick-clarification-about-boobquake.html"&gt;unexpected&lt;/a&gt;. Most of it seems to be pretty positive. Some of it is from the "duhr hurr hurr boobies" wing of society, and some of it seems to &lt;a href="http://negarpontifiles.blogspot.com/2010/04/why-i-won-be-joining.html"&gt;miss the point entirely&lt;/a&gt;. But then there's been a &lt;a href="http://blog.iblamethepatriarchy.com/2010/04/23/spinster-aunt-reads-boobquake-emails/"&gt;particular&lt;/a&gt; flavor of &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/life/broadsheet/2010/04/22/boobquake_open2010"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; from some self-described feminists talking about just how horrible this whole idea is, because it objectifies women and plays right into the patriarchy's wishes to see see scantily-clad women. It's "'Girls Gone Wild' with a cause slapped on it," and "capitulating to Dude Nation’s fondest desire," and "Since when did we 'stick it to the man' by wearing low-cut shirts or short shorts?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kYu2r3RVPhY/S9PmTxAqr5I/AAAAAAAABVM/vxif5e0-a0w/s1600/temperance_446.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:400px;height:225px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kYu2r3RVPhY/S9PmTxAqr5I/AAAAAAAABVM/vxif5e0-a0w/s400/temperance_446.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" title="This entire post will be dismissed because I used this image." alt="This entire post will be dismissed because I used this image."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And this is where I have a problem, because I don't like it when feminists--who I agree with and would generally count myself among--reinforce the Limbaughian stereotype that they're sex-negative humorless man-hating bluenoses. And yet, here we are. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I see two big problems with the reasoning of this position. First, there seems to be an assumption that there's one "the man" or one "patriarchy" to fight against. I can't imagine the cognitive dissonance which must occur to be able to hold that assumption in light of this situation. Here we have an explicit rebellion against the misogynistic rules of patriarchal fundamentalist Islam, which force women to dress in a way that hides any hint of their sexuality. Of course, in order to defy those rules, one would have to dress in a way that &lt;i&gt;doesn't&lt;/i&gt; hide a woman's sexuality, and coincidentally there's a closer-to-home patriarchy that marginalizes women for &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; flaunting their bodies (also, for flaunting their bodies too much--we have a very picky patriarchy). I'd think that this is clear evidence of (at least) two distinct patriarchies with different ways of marginalizing women and different sexual values, but apparently we're all one Clan of the Dangling Penis. Even when you fight against them, you're working for them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second big problem is an apparent inability to understand the difference between choice and coercion. I won't deny that our society rewards women who fall within a certain range of body types and who dress in such a way as to walk a fine line of sexual objectification, largely ignoring those who fail to fit or comply. It'd be silly to deny that. But there's a missing step between "society objectifies women by forcing them to dress provocatively" and "women who dress provocatively are being forced to do so by society." To make the claim--implicitly or explicitly--ignores the fact that women have agency. A woman can choose how she dresses, regardless of what society expects of her. Women are, in fact, capable of &lt;i&gt;choosing&lt;/i&gt; to dress provocatively, and may even be capable of doing so for reasons other than gaining male attention. When one is &lt;i&gt;forced&lt;/i&gt; to do something, regardless of what that thing is, it breeds resentment and foments a rebellious attitude. When one &lt;i&gt;chooses&lt;/i&gt; to do something--even if it is the &lt;i&gt;same thing&lt;/i&gt;--there's no reason to resent or rebel. Who would you rebel against? Yourself? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I was a child, I was often forced to take naps. I did not enjoy it, I didn't want to do it, and I faked sleep or read surreptitiously or did other things besides napping. Now, I frequently take naps by choice--am I therefore playing into the hands of the parents and teachers who wished me to take naps in the past? I have had jobs in the recent past where I was required to wear a tie every day. While I liked my array of ties, it was time-consuming to put them on and restricting to have them on all day, every day. The dress code at my current job is more relaxed; I still wear ties, but only when I choose to do so--and I do it because I like my ties, and I like the way they complement my shirts. I'm not vindicating my old bosses every time I spend a minute or two on a Full Windsor knot, I'm exercising control of my wardrobe through personal choice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I quoted a bit from a Salon article above, and I'd like to examine the full quote in more detail, because I think it's emblematic of the whole problem:&lt;blockquote&gt;Since when did we "stick it to the man" by wearing low-cut shirts or short shorts? When women burned bras back in the day, there was a statement there, full of boldness and righteous anger. This type of happening feels like feminism lite, "cute" feminism or "male-friendly" feminism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;I like that she follows up her "we never protested by flaunting sexuality" clause with the example of burning bras (which, strangely enough, &lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/history/american/burnbra.asp"&gt;apparently never happened&lt;/a&gt;). Sure, bras represented the uncomfortable yoke of male expectations and enforced femininity, but is she really suggesting that there weren't any men at the time who would have supported the idea of women without bras? I wasn't around for those protests--but apparently, neither was Beth Mann--but I have a hard time imagining a world where no man enjoyed seeing nipples through shirts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But again, we run into the problem of "the man." I don't know, if your point is to "stick it to the man," doesn't that depend on what "the man" wants you to do? Like, going braless was a response to "the man" enforcing certain standards of femininity (like wearing bras, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_brassieres#Feminist_protests.2C_Miss_America.2C_and_.22bra_burning.22"&gt;and fake lashes, and makeup, and so forth&lt;/a&gt;). If "the man" wants you to hide your femininity under a veil and a burqa, are you still going to throw away your bra and makeup? Would that really make any sense? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The point of the protests in either case would be against the enforced standards of femininity. In one case, those standards included wearing bras and makeup, so women went braless and threw their makeup away. In the other case, the standard is extreme modesty, so wouldn't the &lt;i&gt;equivalent protest&lt;/i&gt; to be to throw away the burqa and veil and dress immodestly? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, there's the pejorative of "'male-friendly' feminism." Yes, heaven forbid and saints preserve, the &lt;i&gt;last&lt;/i&gt; thing any feminist should want is to be male-friendly! Why, that might make men think they could support women's rights and feminist causes without being derided or denigrated, that they could participate in rallies and marches without others saying that they're just there to gawk and pick up chicks, that they could call &lt;i&gt;themselves&lt;/i&gt; feminists without worrying that they might be using the term presumptuously. Certainly, feminists would have no use for male allies--why, they're the &lt;i&gt;patriarchy&lt;/i&gt;, and clearly they're all equally part of the problem, and it's no sense being friendly to any of them so that you might actually get them to see how they might even unconsciously contribute to oppression. No, the feminists have gotten so far by being branded "man-haters," and that term certainly isn't ever used to dismiss what they have to say, so they should wear it with pride and continue to practice a staunch policy of borderline misandry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess this is what it boils down to for me: On one hand, there's Jen, a Ph.D. student who is responding to misogynistic religious mores by suggesting that women choose to dress immodestly for the sake of an actual scientific experiment. On the other hand, there are women who call Jen a bad feminist because her flippant academic suggestion means women will expose their femininity, which might cause men to think dirty thoughts. I don't know about you, but I'd say the real feminist cause isn't the one that encourages women to refrain from doing things because of what men think. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then again, what do I know? I'm part of the problem.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20494433-1482117187970303091?l=dubitoergo.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Foss</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Dubito Ergo Sum</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272182279680"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=5611">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1afaf45ea3280dd4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Freedom of Speech"/><category term="General Science"/><category term="Global Warming"/><category term="News From Around The Blogosphere"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="atheism"/><category term="religion"/><category term="Andrew Weaver"/><category term="Big Bang"/><category term="Canada"/><category term="defamation"/><category term="Islam"/><category term="Mohammed"/><category term="Nick Clegg"/><category term="South Park"/><category term="Trey Parker"/><category term="UK"/><title type="html">News From Around The Blogosphere 4.24.10</title><published>2010-04-25T07:57:30Z</published><updated>2010-04-25T07:57:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2010/04/25/news-from-around-the-blogosphere-4-24-10/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:W_wdLVRW8vThcM:http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/images/danish_cartoon_muhammed_1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:W_wdLVRW8vThcM:http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/images/danish_cartoon_muhammed_1.jpg" alt="" width="98" height="122"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://www.newser.com/story/86948/may-20-is-everybody-draw-mohammed-day.html"&gt;May 20 is “Everybody Draw Mohammed Day”! &lt;/a&gt;- Obviously this is inspired by the recent controversy surrounding the show &lt;em&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt;. But as my previous post shows, I got started early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://movieshows.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/The-Big-Bang-Theory-Season-3-Episode-14-The-Einstein-Approximation.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://movieshows.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/The-Big-Bang-Theory-Season-3-Episode-14-The-Einstein-Approximation.jpg" alt="" width="213" height="154"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/south_park_evades_a_positive_a.php"&gt;Where the &lt;em&gt;South Park &lt;/em&gt;creators got it wrong &lt;/a&gt;- I’ve written two defenses of Matt Stone and Trey Parker’s recent 200th and 201st episodes of &lt;em&gt;South Park &lt;/em&gt;over on my Examiner page (&lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-9090-NY-Atheism--Skepticism-Examiner~y2010m4d20-Muslim-radicals-threaten-the-lives-of-South-Park-creators"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-9090-NY-Atheism--Skepticism-Examiner~y2010m4d22-South-Park-creators-lives-threatened-over-depiction-of-Santa-Claus"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). However, Trey Parker was just quoted in a Washington Post “On Faith” article and what he has to say about “atheism” is so extraordinarily idiotic that it merits the kind of mockery worthy of &lt;em&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Parker says atheism is more ludicrous to him than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Out of all the ridiculous religion stories — which are greatly,  wonderfully ridiculous — the silliest one I’ve ever heard is, ‘Yeah,  there’s this big, giant universe and it’s expanding and it’s all going  to collapse on itself and we’re all just here, just ‘cuz. Just ‘cuz.  That to me, is the most ridiculous explanation ever,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um, what?! Putting aside the ultra straw man he presents that doesn’t accurately describe the physics, this isn’t just some wacky ideas scientists made up out of whole cloth. It’s empirically testable and measurable. This is not up for debate. It’s scientific fact. And I’m sorry, Trey, if you’re unimpressed by this bastardized version of the science but that’s just too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nonicoclolasos.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/clegg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://nonicoclolasos.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/clegg.jpg?w=222&amp;amp;h=133" alt="" width="222" height="133"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/04/24/could-an-atheist-be-the-uks-next-leader/"&gt;Could the winner of the UK’s next top leader be an atheist?&lt;/a&gt; – When asked if he believed in god, Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrats’ new leader in the UK, said no. And it seems as though he’s now leading in the polls. Unfortunately, I don’t know anything about Clegg. But assuming he isn’t a nutter or a wanker of some sort or another, I’m rooting for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:AysvcOlHK2vvdM:http://shipbright.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/climate-change-burning-globe1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AAysvcOlHK2vvdM%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fshipbright.files.wordpress.com%2F2009%2F11%2Fclimate-change-burning-globe1.jpg&amp;amp;w=150&amp;amp;h=140" alt="" width="150" height="140"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/apr/22/climate-change-libel-action-canada-national-post"&gt;Canadian climate scientist Andrew Weaver sues newspaper for poisoning the well on climate change&lt;/a&gt; – I’ve been saying for a while now that we need to start holding cranks more accountable for their potentially libelous accusations, so I’m all for this. It’s quite different than when the cranks sue their critics like when the British Chiropractic Association sued Simon Singh, because there we’re talking about frivolous lawsuits used merely to intimidate critics. But when the cranks inevitably launch into their grand conspiracy theories, they make serious accusations that often do satisfy the criteria of defamation. And when you’ve got a legitimate defamation suit there’s no shame in taking legal action. And if Weaver is correct and this newspaper did publish articles that promoted “grossly irresponsible falsehoods,” he may have a good case. Of course I don’t know the Canadian statutes on defamation but I’d be surprised if they radically differed from those in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lynn does a great job of remaining cool and collected while being subjected to Megyn Kelly’s massive revisionist history. He stays on target and doesn’t let her asinine statements sidetrack him. All in all, I think this was a win for those of us on the side of reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good job, Reverend Lynn!&lt;/p&gt;

It was once said (by a straight white male Christian, probably), that "If half the people who make speeches would make concrete floors, they would be doing more good."  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/if_you_dont_understand_that_th.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/if_you_dont_understand_that_th.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/pCZAxRSbNsI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272171983473"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2010://2.4599">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f79f06b2e4e5053f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Assault on Science" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="asa" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="ASA"/><category term="randyisaac" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Randy Isaac"/><category term="signatureinthecell" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Signature in the Cell"/><category term="stephenmeyer" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Stephen Meyer"/><category term="stevematheson" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Steve Matheson"/><title type="html">Two analyses of Meyer&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Signature in the Cell&amp;quot;</title><published>2010-04-25T04:46:01Z</published><updated>2010-04-26T01:06:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/04/two-analyses-of.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Meyer’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Signature-Cell-Evidence-Intelligent-Design/dp/0061472786/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1272164597&amp;amp;sr=8-1" rel="external "&gt;Signature in the Cell&lt;/a&gt; is the latest entry in the “it’s too complicated to have occurred naturally, therefore ID” genre.  &lt;em&gt;Signature&lt;/em&gt; joins Behe’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Black-Box-Biochemical-Challenge/dp/0743290313/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1272164634&amp;amp;sr=1-1" rel="external "&gt;Darwin’s Black Box&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Edge-Evolution-Search-Limits-Darwinism/dp/0743296222/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1272164679&amp;amp;sr=1-1" rel="external "&gt;The Edge of Evolution&lt;/a&gt; as the modern-day instances of that strain of argument coming out of the Disco ‘Tute.

&lt;p&gt;There have been a number of reviews of the book, some of them favorable (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, Thomas Nagel’s &lt;a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article6931364.ece" rel="external "&gt;controversial plug&lt;/a&gt; for it as a 2009 “Book of the year”) and some less so, &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://biologos.org/blog/signature-in-the-cell/" rel="external "&gt;Darrell Falk’s review&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;BioLogos&lt;/em&gt;.  However I know of no reviews in scientific journals or popular science magazines like &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;.  (A lawyer &lt;a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;amp;id=5621" rel="external "&gt;reviewed it&lt;/a&gt; in American Spectator, though.  That’s the same rag that published Wells’ &lt;a href="http://www.discovery.org/a/1209" rel="external "&gt;Survival of the Fakest&lt;/a&gt;, used by John Freshwater as support for his proposal to pollute the science curriculum in my school district.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all of the reviews I’ve seen, laudatory or critical, are from theists.  And a couple of theists, both scientists, are blogging their way through the book–well, actually, one has finished and one is still in progress.  On the new American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) Book Discussion board Randy Isaac, ASA Executive Director, a physicist, has just finished a &lt;a href="http://www.asa3online.org/Book/page/3/" rel="external "&gt;long series of posts&lt;/a&gt; on the book (the link is to the first page of posts; there are three pages).  Steve Matheson, a developmental biologist at Calvin College, is &lt;a href="http://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/2010/04/signature-in-cell-chapter-8.html" rel="external "&gt;up to Chapter 8&lt;/a&gt; (Matheson’s whole series to this point is in &lt;a href="http://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/search/label/Book%20Reviews" rel="external "&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt;, along with a few non-Signature reviews as well).  I recommend both series of posts to your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some stray remarks on them below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the ASA Book Discussion blog, in addition to slogging through the book itself, Randy Isaac spent 13 posts on a dozen ID predictions Meyer laid out in an appendix to his book.  I read all those predictions, along with a fair part of the rest of the book, some months ago, and I wouldn’t have had the patience (nor the forebearance!) that Isaac displays.  One thing that struck me as I read through the predictions was the lack of any connection to ID “theory” that Meyer provides for them.  Nowhere did I see a sentence (or paragraph) of the form “In ID theory, this principle predicts that this specific observation should follow, because of the process of generation that ID theory posits.  This follows because …”, … um, well, for some reason or other drawn from intelligent design “theory.”  But one doesn’t see that kind of reasoning.  One sees flat claims with no clear connection to any sort of developed conception of intelligent design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example,  prediction Number 12 is &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The functional sequences of amino acids within amino acid sequence space should be extremely rare rather than common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural first question is “why?”  Why does ID imply that functional proteins should be rare rather than common?  What principle of ID implies that predicted observation?  Meyer is clearly merely making an anti-naturalistic argument here, not an ID “prediction” drawn from some coherent conception of intelligent design  The subtext is that if those sequences are rare, naturalistic processes are unlikely to happen on to them, and therefore &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;God&lt;/span&gt; the Designer did it.  ID doesn’t imply that prediction; anti-evolution does.  Intelligent design, at least by analogy with human design, would seem to predict the reverse: for mass production of designs, to the extent possible the designer would more likely use easily available off-the-shelf components rather than rare hard-to-find ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found another prediction interesting because it invokes a property of a putative designer.  It’s Number 10:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an intelligent (and benevolent) agent designed life, then studies of putatively bad designs in life–such as the vertebrate retina and virulent bacteria–should reveal either (a) reasons for the designs that show a hidden functional logic or (b) evidence of decay of originally good designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup, it was the Fall that done it.  I presume that’s the same benevolent designer that devised the ichneumon wasp’s habit of paralyzing a caterpillar and then laying eggs inside it so the wasp larvae can eat the still-living caterpillar from the inside out.  I doubt whether the caterpillar sees that as the act of a benevolent designer.  And I suppose it’s the same benevolent designer that (according to Michael Behe in &lt;em&gt;The Edge of Evolution&lt;/em&gt;) designed the malaria parasite that is so successful at killing children.  Again, benevolent from the parasite’s perspective but not so benevolent from the human point of view.  I’m disappointed that Meyer didn’t mention &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/09/introduction-to.html" rel=""&gt;Multiple Designers Theory&lt;/a&gt; in this connection.  Meyer is sitting right on the edge of a theodicy mine field here.  Where in ID “scientific theory” does that “benevolent” come from?  (&lt;em&gt;Apropos&lt;/em&gt; of that question, I read an interesting essay by Steven Law the other night in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/50-Voices-Disbelief-Why-Atheists/dp/1405190450/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1272168149&amp;amp;sr=8-1" rel="external "&gt;50 Voices of Disbelief&lt;/a&gt;.  Law argued that all the traditional arguments for ‘solving’ the problem of evil if God is benevolent work equally well with no changes for a God that is malevolent.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac &lt;a href="http://www.asa3online.org/Book/2010/04/13/id-prediction-summary/" rel="external "&gt;concludes&lt;/a&gt; his series by writing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is laudable that Meyer takes the step to explore predictions that ID would make. Predictions that are testable are a vital part of the scientific process. But just making a prediction isn’t sufficient to indicate viable science. Astrologers and tasseologists can also make predictions and sometimes they may be right. Predictions must also be based on causal factors that are understood independently to exist and whose adequacy can be independently verified. The predictions must clearly differentiate between competing hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unfortunate that this set of dozen predictions is very weak on all counts. It is unlikely to make any difference in the debate. These tend not to be definitive in terms of distinguishing between ID or non ID and will only extend the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Weak” is too kind a word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matheson, a developmental cell biologist at Calvin College, is, as I said above, just up to Chapter 8, so I’ll won’t comment at length until he’s done except to note that he has been very critical of ID claims in the past and from all indications sees Meyer’s book in that same critical light.  There’s a foreshadowing in Matheson’s &lt;a href="http://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/2010/02/signature-in-cell-chapter-3.html" rel="external "&gt;post on Chapter 3&lt;/a&gt;.  Noting an obvious error in Meyer’s text, Matheson wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course, Stephen Meyer &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; a layperson. He’s clearly not a biologist, or even a person who’s particularly knowledgeable about biology. (That paper in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington&lt;/em&gt; became infamous due to political disputes; I thought it was most notable for being lame.) This is obvious from my reading of this book and his other work, and the mistake on page 66 just serves to remind me that despite the thunderous praise from fans on the dustjacket and in the ID-osphere, Meyer just isn’t all that impressive as a scientific thinker. Call me a jerk, but I expect a hell of a lot more from someone who wants to rewrite science (and its history). [Emphasis original]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, read the posts in those series.  They’re valuable background when someone comes up to you (as someone did to me) and says, “Meyer really made a strong case for ID.”  He didn’t.  Reading the book helps, and I think critics should know the arguments first hand, but reading Isaac’s and Matheson’s analyses will also help a whole lot.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of us have a mouth full of them, and some are  prone to rot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An  opinion is merely an opinion. Without some underlying fact, even the  most reasonable assertions of belief — such as: “Jet airplanes are  powered by Bette Midler songs!” — are just so many words and have very  little value. An oft quoted corollary of this — one you usually hear  just before losing an argument — is that while you are entitled to your  own opinion, you are not entitled to your own facts. There is some  disagreement about who originated the axiom, but whoever it was never  took the time to explain things to Jenny McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_McCarthy"&gt;McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; is a former model  who seems to be famous for her naked buxomity. More recently, she  has become a very loud (and presumably sincere) proponent of the  opinion that vaccines cause autism. In fact, Jenny McCarthy is probably  the most famous person in the world when it comes to the topic of  vaccines and autism. Jenny McCarthy has the recognition and agreement of  more people on this topic than any other single person alive today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy  was &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1967796-1,00.html"&gt;recently  featured&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine, and her mantra that vaccines  cause autism was writ large, albeit in crayon. The article is awash in  soft and middling arguments that effectively exclude no point of view,  and have all the intellectual rigor of a tender-hearted school teacher  who doesn’t want to hurt your feelings by saying your toddler sucks at  math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To its  credit, the article does mention the unequivocal findings of science in  the autism and vaccine debate. It even cites the &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1967796-1,00.html"&gt;Autism  Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which states that there have been 22 studies  into the matter with no causal relationship ever being found. However,  in a rare feat of passive-aggressive journalism, the article ends on  this &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1967796-1,00.html"&gt;vomitous  note&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…as I was driving out to the San Fernando Valley to see McCarthy  and realized she was right: parents will never stop hoping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus does  the article explain why the anti-vaccine movement is so popular. In a  further, drool-inducing act of equivocation, the writer leaves  unquestioned McCarthy’s assertion that she “recovered” her own child  from autism, and does not need real science because &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1967796-3,00.html"&gt;she  has her own&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny’s  homegrown version of science is derived from her subjective experience  of her son’s horrible illness and recovery. While none of us should  reduce or belittle this experience, it is a colossal disservice to  equate it with science. Understanding that McCarthy’s motivation derives  from the parental nightmare of a seriously ill child, we are  nevertheless responsible for our fidelity to the hard-won facts of very  difficult and meticulous research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an apparent  supplement to the piece in &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;, McCarthy&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jenny-mccarthy/whos-afraid-of-the-truth_b_490918.html"&gt; penned a column &lt;/a&gt;for &lt;em&gt;The  Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;, an organ as open-minded as a person recently struck  in the forehead with an axe. In it, McCarthy asserts that vaccines must  be toxic and dangerous, or else the federal government of the United  States would not have paid out over 1.9 billion dollars in damages as a  result of vaccine related illness and death. She is even so helpful as  to provide a link to the site that reports these awful and damning  numbers. She wants you to fear these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s  some fact checking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the  last 22 years, the US government has paid out on 2,428 claims at an  average cost of about eight hundred thousand dollars &lt;a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation/statistics_report.htm"&gt;per  claim&lt;/a&gt;, and none of these claims were autism-related. In the same  period, at &lt;a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005067.html)"&gt;an average&lt;/a&gt; of 4 million per year, 88 million children have been born in the United  Sates &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Features/dsChildImmunization/)"&gt;and about  67 million&lt;/a&gt; of these have been vaccinated. This means that the US  federal government has paid out a vaccine claim for less than 0.004% of  all vaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s 1  in about 27,950. By comparison, about 1 in 2000 people die from &lt;a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/gallstone-removal"&gt;complications&lt;/a&gt; arising  from having their gall bladder removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real  problem is that none of these numbers actually matter; they are like the  license plate of an oncoming car. They ought to matter but they don’t,  and this is why Jenny is both not even wrong and all but unassailable.  Jenny McCarthy does not espouse a position, but rather an identity. It’s easy to  debunk her facts because they are anything but, but she never really  needs to defend them: She is a suffering parent, and to question her is  to question that. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is Jenny’s science.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jrefbrandon@gmail.com (Sean Sturgeon)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272164086969"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/teabaggers_explained.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/410886427386a696</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Republicans"/><title type="html">Teabaggers Explained</title><published>2010-04-25T03:27:54Z</published><updated>2010-04-25T03:27:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/-rh7t5kV9AM/teabaggers_explained.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/teabaggers_explained.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In their own words ... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/teabaggers_explained.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/teabaggers_explained.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/-rh7t5kV9AM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272163384556"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/no_sense_of_humour_at_all.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/24afb54a597b9c4c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">No sense of humour at all</title><published>2010-04-24T23:44:19Z</published><updated>2010-04-24T23:44:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/-pd41T-Dag0/no_sense_of_humour_at_all.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/no_sense_of_humour_at_all.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some wag in the British government made a half-joking tentative itinerary for the Pope&amp;#39;s visit to England…and it got spread around and &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/7628752/Ministers-apologise-for-insult-to-Pope.html"&gt;made some stuffed shirts very angry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rt Rev Malcolm McMahon, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Nottingham, was astonished and angered by the proposals.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He said: "This is appalling. You don't invite someone to your country and then disrespect them in this way.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"It's outlandish and outrageous to assume that any of the ideas are in any way suitable for the Pope." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href="http://politicalgraffiti.wordpress.com/2009/03/19/papal-prophylactic/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/04/no_sense_of_humour_at_all/popehat.jpeg" width="200" height="168" alt="popehat.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fellow who made the list has been chastised and transferred. Representatives of the government have crawled to the Vatican to apologize and beg forgiveness. It must have been a tremendous lampoon; I imagined it would propose all kinds of degrading behaviors, like "flounce around in a dress" (oh, hey, I think he's going to do that one) or "wear a funny hat" (dang, another gimme) or "drink until swozzled" or maybe even "lose virginity to a mature and consenting woman". You know, the kind of thing a joker like me might suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no. Here's the &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01623/pope2_1623149a.jpg"&gt;list of proposals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Launch of 'Benedict' condoms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Review of Vatican attitude on condom use&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bless a civil partnership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reversal of policy on women bishops/ordain woman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open an abortion ward&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speech on equality&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Statemen on views over adoption&lt;/b&gt; (change of stance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Training course for all bishops on child abuse allegations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harder line on child abuse—announce sacking of dodgy bishops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vatican sponsorship for network of AIDS clinics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meet young unemployed people&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Apologize for… …&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Canonise/pseudo canonise a group&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Announce whistle blowing system for child abuse cases&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to job centre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Debate on abortion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All catholic schools should be free entry to all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speech on democracy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vatican and C of E funded committee on dialogue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch helpline for abused children&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hang on…those aren&amp;#39;t half bad. It&amp;#39;s not even a very funny list. They all propose confronting the Pope with the actual reality of his policies, or with the real problems that people in the country are facing. The list is clearly informed by opposition to the follies of Catholicism, but how should one greet the head of a bizarre but influential cult that continues to promote bad ideas and protect criminals? With simpering deference? Apparently, that&amp;#39;s what the appalled members of the government and various other institutions think. How dare some rascal in the ranks actually propose to make the Pope face facts or defend his policies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'd &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; to see the Pope in a debate on abortion, where he would actually have to address difficult questions and defend his own ideas. Best idea yet would be a debate on various controversial topics, like birth control, abortion, the role of women in the church, and homosexuality…with the Pope on one side, and Stephen Fry on the other. It could be perfectly respectful, and it would be &lt;i&gt;hilarious&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if we just want to see the Pope flensed and the wounds rubbed with salt and sulfur, they could bring in Christopher Hitchens as the opponent.  Either way, you know that the Pope would be demolished by bringing in &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; confrontation that didn't simply bow obsequiously to his antique office.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/no_sense_of_humour_at_all.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/-pd41T-Dag0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272161776947"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=3193">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/af0d1d6539a89278</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Events"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Podcasting"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="You Tube"/><category term="comedy"/><category term="George Hrab"/><category term="Little kitten"/><category term="NECSS"/><category term="news"/><category term="Novella"/><category term="SGU"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">Little Kitten – The Twitter Song From NECSS 2010</title><published>2010-04-25T01:50:17Z</published><updated>2010-04-25T01:50:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/uNf4zVjKJFs/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/2010/04/little-kitten-the-twitter-song-from-necss-2010/"/><content xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b43Qa_aTjU"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b43Qa_aTjU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If you are a physiologist, this is like the "fuck yeah" of scientific meetings. As you have probably read by now, Dr. Martin Frank, Executive Director of the American Physiological Society, and I have a friendly wager as to who can gain the most new Twitter followers by Tuesday night. Even though I am going to hand Marty's scientific posterior to him in this little challenge, you have to realize that it's all for a good cause - bringing awareness to our wonderful society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there is the satisfaction of teaching Marty a thing or two about the interwebz 's power to mobilize women, minorities, and trainees in science and give them a voice and a community. No one does it like Dr. Isis Plus, I really, really want to win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, imagine my dismay when I met up with Marty Frank today and learned that he is planning to solicit followers from the podium at the opening ceremonies? He'll have the captive attention of thousands of physiologists. As a pseudonymous blogger, I clearly can't do that, All I have are the powers of the interwebz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I offer you this. For every new Twitter follower I gain during the meeting, I will donate $1 to the &lt;a href="http://www.the-aps.org/education/minority_prog/stu_fellows/porter_phy/ov_pp.htm"&gt;Porter Minority Development Fund&lt;/a&gt;, up to $500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have no how bad Mama wants to smack down Marty Frank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[UPDATE]: &lt;/strong&gt;My Twitter feed is &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/drisis"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Remember that the tally will be made on Tuesday, so keep following.  The Porter Development Fund is already $50 richer!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/04/martin_frank_starts_playing_di.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/kbRTeh9Nxxc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272152364268"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/real-time_news_gathering_-_140.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3bcc11ea71141a7b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="#140conf"/><title type="html">Real-Time News Gathering - #140conf (video)</title><published>2010-04-25T00:24:34Z</published><updated>2010-04-25T00:24:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/593CiNZWa2w/real-time_news_gathering_-_140.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/real-time_news_gathering_-_140.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Andy Carvin (@acarvin) - Senior strategist at NPR;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt; Birtherism is here to stay. And not because more people are going crazy, but because crazy has been redefined. Birtherism isn't the only example. Consider how conservatives accuse Obama of peddling "socialism." Sure, some of them genuinely think that Obama is going to usher in a new Soviet state in which the government owns all means of production. But most right-wingers use it as shorthand for government overreach. So now that's what "socialism" means.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a fairly major difference between birtherism and the socialism charge: Birtherism has been disproved by facts. But they're similar in the way they get tossed around without much connection to their original meaning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He isn't very clear in the way he puts this: "crazy has been redefined" isn't quite right, because everyone agrees that craziness is irrationality or mental disorder of a sort that gives rise to unpredictably strange behavior.  But the idea that the word &lt;i&gt;socialism&lt;/i&gt; has actually changed its denotation in modern American English might not be so crazy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Having grown up in England and then moved to America, I do actually recall reading books about socialism, and knowing actual socialists.  Very few Americans have ever met a socialist.  The socialists at the University of York that I knew in the 1970s were divided into various factions and microfactions depending on their exact interpretation of the degree to which Trotsky had been right to break with Lenin, and the the degree to which Lenin had betrayed the ideas of Marx, and the degree to which the murderous Stalin had utterly wrecked the strategy of Lenin.  But all of them would laugh at the idea that the Labour Party, often referred to by the newspapers back then as "the socialists", were socialist at all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be a socialist, at least of the Trotskyite stripe (and everyone to the right of them was dismissed as being to some extent fascist enemies of the people), you had to believe not only that capitalism and private ownership of homes and businesses was a massive evil for humanity and had to be eliminated, but also that capitalism was almost certainly going to be destroyed, in a revolution that would involve the working people rising up and completely destroying the state and its political machinery.  The people would seize the "means of production" and would reorganize society into a system where councils of workers would determine everything about the economic, political, and social life of the country, and indeed, the world.  There would be no conventional political leaders leading this revolution, and it certainly would not be televised.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National borders would soon cease to matter, so it wouldn&amp;#39;t matter who was foreign-born and who wasn&amp;#39;t — the division between Indonesians and Kenyans and Americans was just another trick of the fascist capitalists to divide the workers.  After the revolution there would be no Members of Parliament in the UK or Senators in the USA because there would be no Parliament and no Senate.  There would be some inequality of income due to differential level of work contributions, but even that was supposed to be only a transitional state on the way to the final perfection of communism.  Ultimately, under the communism that socialism would lead to, there would be no bankers for any president or government to bail out because not only would there be no president or government, there would be no banks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that the Soviet Union was socialist (let alone communist) was also derided.  The true socialists in Britain in the 1970s regarded the Soviet Union exactly as Ronald Reagan did: it was an &amp;quot;evil empire&amp;quot;, ruled by a corrupt Russian dictatorship.  Russia needed a socialist revolution perhaps more than any country in the world, and had done since Lenin began to betray the 1917 revolution some time in the early 1920s.  In the UK you could stand on a box at the famous Hyde Park Corner free speech area and shout that the government was a corrupt bunch of plutocrats and should be destroyed by a popular uprising, even if there were policemen walking nearby; whereas in Russia if you did any such thing, or even considerably less, you would be sent to a camp in Siberia for decades.  The difference was that they regarded the British government as a corrupt plutocracy as well — and the American government as considerably worse.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socialism meant complete and utter dismantling of the capitalist system — the very idea that you could have private property and own a house and have a bank account and run a profit-making business and keep the profits.  It meant no more politicians or kings or queens or presidents.  The idea that socialism might be compatible with a charismatic politician holding the office of President of the United States, and working with a Congress that passed laws, and heading armed services that could be directed to fight wars, and protecting the world financial system by having a Secretary of the Treasury (formerly president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) regulating the banking industry and bailing it out of its problem with &amp;quot;troubled assets&amp;quot; would have seemed a total sell-out to the real socialists.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the fact of Hitler's party having chosen the term "National Socialist" for itself was treated as just a bizarre semantic perversion.  Nothing could have been further from the ideals of socialism than the ruthlessly racist and militaristic nightmare that Hitler unleashed.  If you wanted to wear a socialist button, first, at the very least, you had to be anti-racist, internationalist, and opposed to wars that had the people fighting each other for the interests of nation states (though that did not mean being opposed to violent struggle to bring about the revolution).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When today's Tea Party activists declare that Obama is a socialist, do they seriously commit to any of the foregoing principles of socialism?  Do they even know about them?  Do they seriously think Obama is working to have the people rise up so that he has no presidency, and no armed forces to be commander-in-chief of, and he simply has to work in a collectively owned factory to contribute to the material well-being of society like anybody else, and lend his voice, one among equals, to the discussions in the worker's committees that would run the factory?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable to think that they do not think this at all — that they use the term &amp;quot;socialist&amp;quot; as a kind of general term of abuse aimed at anyone in the political establishment who is involved in government control of things like the Federal Reserve, the Department of Education, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and so on.  Their &amp;quot;socialists&amp;quot; are exactly the sort of people who would have been the first target of the real socialists who were attending meetings of Trotskyite factions at universities in Britain in the 1970s.  The socialists that today&amp;#39;s radical Republican right-wingers rail against are the very establishment that the Trotskyites aimed to deprive of their power.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, we have to allow for a massive polysemy in the word &lt;i&gt;socialist&lt;/i&gt; today (the &lt;i&gt;Webster's&lt;/i&gt; dictionary entry quite properly begins with &amp;quot;any of various theories or social and political movements…&amp;quot;).  A word must be flexible indeed if it is to cover early Christian communities who gave up private property; Trotsky&amp;#39;s atheistic plans for a worker-controlled Russia; the bureaucratic authoritarian Soviet Russian state as it actually existed between 1920 and 1990; the Labour Party of postwar Britain with its nationalized industries alongside privately owned ones; and &amp;quot;government overreach&amp;quot; such as the Democrats&amp;#39; guarantee of insurance coverage permitting Americans access to their country&amp;#39;s largely private and profit-making health industry.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English is, of course, fully adequate to the task of providing words with this ridiculous degree of polysemy.  After all, there are words like &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2079"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2148"&gt;charge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

While their followers believe them to have special powers, a new brain imaging study by Uffe Schjødt at Aarhus University in Denmark suggests that it&amp;#39;s all just a product of their imagination.In fact, the brain imaging study is only part of the story. What&amp;#39;s even more remarkable is what it says about how some people come to fall under the spell of these charismatics.What they did was to take a small group of pentecostal Christians and a matched group of non-believers. Both were chosen so as to represent the extreme ends of the belief scale.They were asked to listen to prayers being read by three different people who, they were told, were a non-Christian, an ordinary Christian, and a Christian &amp;#39;known for his healing powers&amp;#39;. In fact, they were all ordinary Christians...So there was no real difference between the prayers (the speakers were mixed up to make sure differences in speaking style could not affect the experiment). The only difference was what the listener was told, but what a dramatic effect it had!When asked, the pentecostalists rated the one they were told was a healer as the most charismatic, and the person they thought was non-religious as much less charismatic (see the graph). For the non-believers, there was a slight trend in the same direction, but it was small and insignificant. Basically, they weren&amp;#39;t taken in by the deception.But the pentecostalists were. Just telling a pentecostalists that someone has healing powers makes them think that they are highly charismatic. What&amp;#39;s more, they didn&amp;#39;t feel God&amp;#39;s presence in the prayers read by the person they were told was a non-Christian.So where does the hypnotism come in? Well, specific regions of the pentecostalist&amp;#39;s brains became somewhat activated when listening to the prayer from the &amp;#39;non-believer&amp;#39;, but highly deactivated when listening to the prayer from the &amp;#39;charismatic healer&amp;#39;. The prayer from the ordinary Christian resulted in deactivation too, but on a small scale.And the regions that were deactivated by the &amp;#39;charismatic healer&amp;#39; were all associated with &amp;#39;executive function&amp;#39; - the part of the mind that evaluates, monitors, and makes decisions. A similar response has been seen in the brains of people undergoing hypnosis - as well as meditation.In other words, they went into a bit of a trance.What Schjødt thinks is happening here is that, when we listen someone we trust implicitly, we switch off our critical faculties, and just let what they are saying wash over us. In the words of the researchers, &amp;quot;subjects suspend or &amp;#39;hand over&amp;#39; their critical faculty to the trusted person.&amp;quot;Now, in this scenario the atheists were immune to the powers of the charismatic preacher. But we shouldn&amp;#39;t run away with the idea that this is a particular characteristic of religious people. Stage hypnosis shows that you that you can see similar effects in secular situations - and Milgram&amp;#39;s scary experiments in authority also spring to mind.What strikes me most about this study is that the charisma of the preacher was all in the minds of the subjects. They  were willing dupes.And what this study also shows is just how closely linked the razmatazz of charismatic preachers is to the showmanship of stage hypnotists. They seem to be exploiting a common human weakness - and one that has enormous power!Hat tip: Paliban Daily and New Scientist.Schjoedt, U., Stodkilde-Jorgensen, H., Geertz, A., Lund, T., &amp;amp; Roepstorff, A.

&lt;p&gt;I promised I wouldn’t write about what happened last Saturday night and I’m a man of my word. But after that night, I can officially say that my investigations into the claims made by Anita Ikonen are now at a sorry end. All the evidence I needed to see was put before me and as much as I hate to judge … it’s over. This is the last word you will hear from me about the Ikonen Saga unless she manages to levitate over The Statue of Liberty.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t belabour any more about her intentions or suggest  further inappropriate insinuations about with who or where she or her ilk might spend their time, I will instead point out other people to fill in the blanks about what happened. It’s all on video. For starters, read about it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;http://montereycountyskeptics.blogspot.com/2010/04/falsifying-anita-ikonen-vision-from.html  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a4iTEAusM"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a4iTEAusM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now everyone can watch the videos and see for themselves. Be patient with the sound, but if it gets too hard to take, at least watch the last ten minutes of  the Part 4 video. It’s quite revealing. And then there’s much more to put the cap on this epic (she’s finally been banned) at the JREF forum under “&lt;em&gt;Put a Fork in Her, She’s Done.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All anyone could ever want to know about this claimant has now been torn apart, dissected into tiny bite-sized pieces and totally eviscerated. As far as this drama goes, I don’t think Humpty-Dumty can ever be put back together again. If JREF wants to keep on “investigating” Anita, they will have lost my vote as unbiased impartial investigators. You don’t need to be a player to know you are being played. I have spent the last twenty-five years in the company of psychics of all stripes and I can confidently say that what I have recently been a party to leaves a lot to be desired – even as entertainment – which this silliness clearly is not.  If anyone tried to pull off these sorts of naive shenanigans at a psychic fair, private party or store front fortune telling shop around here, they would be quickly asked to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/S1056349.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:138px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/S10563491.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="S1056349" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/S10563491.jpg" alt="" width="128" height="96"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Impromtu Finger Test &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anita is undoubtedly an attractive person who could go far – and many now wish she would. She has a certain charm and allure, but it’s my opinion such attributes would be better utilized in a modeling career rather than as a psychic – or a wannabe skeptic. As we waste more and more time paying attention to things totally unproven or outright falsified, (as the soon to be released IIG documents will reveal) real harm is being done to real people. Giving further attention to falsified claimants is like the wild goose chases police get led on by phony psychics when they might better spend their time and resources looking at real evidence. Imagining Anita’s game of x-ray charades going on in hospitals or medical facilities is just well, …unimaginable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we put up with this? If a person came up to you at a park bench and began to tell you how marvelous your intestines looked, wouldn’t you tell them to get the hell away? I would. Because I have made myself available to look at such claims, I’m given the dubious opportunity of dealing with many people who might otherwise be carted off to the bug house. It’s frustrating, but there’s no other choice. How else might we stumble upon something substantial? We probably won’t – ever, but that’s the deal. Either way, I don’t care what they look like. After they have failed; they failed, period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t see anyone offering further encouragement to Regen Traynor do we? He accepted his failure at IIG and quietly went away. Nobody made any further invitations for podcasts or dinner dates with him did they? Gee, I wonder why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As skeptics who have found ourselves drawn into a line of bullcrap that rivals anything Geller ever tried to foist upon us. We should be ashamed of ourselves for pandering to such ridiculous cajolery. I hope that Anita will now go back to North Carolina feeling happily falsified, find a real job in real estate or modeling, get herself a purse chihuahua and disappear into the mists of Avalon from whence she came. She has a bright future as a pretty face and she should make the best of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Mark_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_27181.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:138px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-7768" href="http://skepticblog.org/2010/04/24/enough-is-enough-again/waiting-for-the-woo/"&gt;&lt;img title="waiting for the woo" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/waiting-for-the-woo.jpg" alt="" width="128" height="96"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waiting for the Woo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I will admit that I was initially charmed into her game like many others. There is no doubt that when an attractive woman levels her smouldering Swedish green-eyed leer at you and you are unaware of the strings that might be attached to it, any red-blooded American male would be hard pressed to remain skeptical for too long. In such rare instances, knees begin to wobble and all the best intentions and convictions may get thrown to the wind. That’s how psychics work. Charisma can be a dangerous thing in the wrong hands. Manipulative personalities who have successful careers as psychics or mediums are literally full of it. Anita is no exception and her animal magnetism can be disarming to say the least. I can understand how at other times in history women with these qualities might have been mistaken for “witches.” Fortunately, my days of rescuing or cuddling confused woo women has been over for quite some time. I’m immune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one skeptic wrote to me: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; “This is a psychologically disturbed person.  She has serious emotional problems that require professional medical attention and we (individuals and the skeptical community at large) acting like we have anything to offer her is irresponsible.  Like there is some intellectual high road we’re walking.  “Maybe she’ll turn away from the “woo”!”   Bullshit.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stated in my post &lt;em&gt;“Sex in the Seance Room,” &lt;/em&gt;these dissolute distractions are nothing new in parapsychology and I want to make it clear that Anita is not alone in her ability to spin a web of intrigue and scandal. Eventually at some point, the web becomes an unsustainable trap for the spinner.  You can only bullshit for so long. In my case I might add;&lt;em&gt; don’t bullshit a bullshitter. &lt;/em&gt;We are seeing Anita’s web unravel in blogs that are popping up all over the Internet denouncing both the simplistic conning that has been going on as well as her barrage of bizarre claims, contradictions and the inevitable excuses that follow each of her “tests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:143px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/esp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="esp" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/esp.jpg" alt="" width="133" height="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Sign of the Times?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anita Ikonen is an important case study we need to wake up to. As I predicted back in February of 2009, we are poised on the precipice of a whole new breed of ” psychics.” Expect to see many more like Anita: intelligent, attractive and oh-so-cunning. The days of rumpled little old ladies in lace dresses and gold cameos are over and now even the era of the new age tie-dyed hippie priestess has had its day. It’s a slick new modern highly trained “executive psychic” or university graduate who pretends to project a persona of befuddled skepticism that we have to be on our guard for now. If you don’t believe me, try Googling &lt;strong&gt;ESP Bootcamp&lt;/strong&gt; and you can read for yourself what we are up against. The days of infiltrating &lt;em&gt;their &lt;/em&gt;world is over. Now seekers of “higher knowledge” are working to charm even the most skeptical and get a foothold in ours. If they can sway us and get under our skin, they win. I’m not being paranoid here, just a realist. Witchery has a new name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it hasn’t happened yet, &lt;em&gt;I’m calling for a complete blackout on Anita Ikonen. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s next? Will she blame us for a nervous breakdown – or worse? Unless we pull the plug on this exploitive situation, skeptics risk a whole lot more than just a waste of time. We as a movement will lose credibility in the hearts and minds of serious investigators and the greater public we strive to connect with. So let’s move on. There’s lots more serious work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough is Enough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt; ”…who could predict then that from a little fibber you’d grow into a dangerous paranoid liar?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-Eddie Lawrence, The Old Philosopher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://nyc2010.140conf.com/speakers-2" title=""&gt;speaker line-up&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://nyc2010.140conf.com/schedule" title=""&gt;program schedule&lt;/a&gt; had to be slightly modified as a few people got stuck in Europe under the volcanic ash and could not come in time. But there were plenty of smart people in attendance who could readily jump in and join the panels in their place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a total of about 1000 people the first day and only slightly fewer on the second day. There were only a handful people there who I've met before, e.g., &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu" title=""&gt;Jay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/" title=""&gt;Rosen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://joetrippi.com/" title=""&gt;Joe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/JoeTrippi" title=""&gt;Trippi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/" title=""&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/davewiner" title=""&gt;Winer&lt;/a&gt; (who must have left after his talk as I did not get to catch up with him at all), &lt;a href="http://www.cc-chapman.com/" title=""&gt;C.C.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/cc_chapman" title=""&gt;Chapman&lt;/a&gt;, and the only other ScienceOnline2010 attendee there - &lt;a href="http://cassierodenberg.com/" title=""&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/cassierodenberg" title=""&gt;Rodenberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this was a great opportunity to meet new people, including several who I have followed online for a long time, e.g.,  &lt;a href="http://girlsintech.net/author/tommy-jenkins/" title=""&gt;Tommy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/tommj" title=""&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/" title=""&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jeffjarvis" title=""&gt;Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/digiphile" title=""&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://digiphile.wordpress.com/about/" title=""&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/SusannaSpeier" title=""&gt;Susanna&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.susannaspeier.com/" title=""&gt;Speier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://web20classroom.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Steven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/web20classroom" title=""&gt;Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://burningdinner.tumblr.com/" title=""&gt;Lauren Rae&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/MsLaurenRae" title=""&gt;Bertolini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mp_w" title=""&gt;Mary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/marypaulwells" title=""&gt;Wells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/NMHS_Principal" title=""&gt;Eric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://cms.schooleffects.com/esheninger" title=""&gt;Sheninger&lt;/a&gt; and many others. &lt;a href="http://angelashelton.com/" title=""&gt;Angela&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/angelashelton" title=""&gt;Shelton&lt;/a&gt; was too popular and busy for me to get to meet in person, but we communicated on Twitter during the meeting. As she is a NC native, perhaps it will be relatively easy to invite her for one of the future events in the Triangle - TEDx, or Ignite, or The Monti...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have already posted a few videos from the conference (check them all under the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/140conf/" title=""&gt;140conf category&lt;/a&gt;) and will post a few more later, but you can check them all out - they are &lt;a href="http://www.ippio.com/140conf" title=""&gt;collected here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a palpable energy in the air, lots of excitement, and a bunch of excellent - both informative and inspiring - talks and panels. Unlike &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/twitter_and_science_presentati.php" title=""&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, there was nobody talking about science. I hope that is remedied next time (there is a 140conf somewhere in the world almost every month) and I have offered to do it myself if Jeff is interested for one of the upcoming events (perhaps the one in D.C.). One of the often heard words was 'serendipity' and attending the various sessions was an exercise in serendipity. I may not be interested in, and thus not following, what is happening in the areas of fashion, sports, real estate or comic strips, but listening to people from these industries, hearing how they deal with the changes that the real-time Web has brought, seeing some of their practices, was most definitely useful for me - I could use some of that thinking and see how to apply it to what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, as a conference organizer, I kept watching the little details behind the scenes, comparing how Jeff organized things to what we do at ScienceOnline, see what he did better than we do so we can adopt it for next year (as well as being happy about the details where we do it better already).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You already know &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/on_organizing_andor_participat.php" title=""&gt;my thinking about organizing and presenting at modern conferences&lt;/a&gt;, but this one also provoked an excellent &lt;a href="http://eloquentwoman.blogspot.com/2010/04/all-i-really-need-to-know-about-public.html" title=""&gt;new post about it&lt;/a&gt;, pointing the strengths and weaknesses of the 140conf model using tweets by &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/acarvin" title=""&gt;Andy Carvin&lt;/a&gt;. See also &lt;a href="http://www.dontgetcaught.biz/2010/04/remixing-conference-5-cues-for.html" title=""&gt;another related post&lt;/a&gt;. What they did better than we do is have everything livestreamed and then have each talk/session segment cut separately almost immediatelly and placed online for everyone to see - this is something we'll try to do better next year. On the other hand, we had kick-ass wifi (#2 requirement for a successful conference) provided by SignalShare, while wifi was very scatchy at 140conf, especially the first day with more people in the audience, and everyone trying to get online (many gave up on wifi on the second day so there was more juice left for others). Coffee (#1 requirement for a successful conference) was flowing on the second day, but it was on-and-off on the first day, so in the end Cassie Rodenberg and I had to go accross the street to get some mocha for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All-in-all this was a great conference, a very fun and useful experience, and a great networking opportunity for me. I'll try to go again when it is nearby (e.g., DC or NYC or Boston) as well as try to bring it to the Triangle if I can find a good local venue and local sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the conference, Bride Of Coturnix and I had some time to just wonder around NYC as we like to do every year. My brother happened to be in town at the same time so we got to see him twice, as well as some of his friends I have been hearing about for 20 years and have not managed to meet in person until this week. And we have met our friends for two dinners, including &lt;a href="http://millikandaily.com/" title=""&gt;Arikia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/arikia" title=""&gt;Millikan&lt;/a&gt; (and her awesome room-mate), &lt;a href="http://cassierodenberg.com/" title=""&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/cassierodenberg" title=""&gt;Rodenberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://missbakersbiologyclass.com/blog/" title=""&gt;Stacy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/StacyCBaker" title=""&gt;Baker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/maiasz" title=""&gt;Maia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.helpatanycost.com/#About" title=""&gt;Szalavitz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/nparmalee" title=""&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.photoshelter.com/c/nancyparmalee" title=""&gt;Parmalee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/lalakat" title=""&gt;Alla&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://allakatsnelson.com/" title=""&gt;Katsnelson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/arvindsays" title=""&gt;Arvind&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://arvindsays.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Baddepudi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/bnroberts" title=""&gt;Byron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/emergent_phenomena" title=""&gt;Roberts&lt;/a&gt; - that was great fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker #4:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://primate.uchicago.edu/dario.htm"&gt;Dr.  Dario Maestripieri&lt;/a&gt;, professor of evolutionary biology, on “What Primatology and Evolutionary Psychology Tell Us About the Evolution of Human Behavior”.  Some evolutionary biologists consider the study of behavior to be outside the realm of their field – this is because behavior is notoriously difficult to quantify and measure.  Another reason is that many think that behavior is an effect of environment and culture.  Then there is the dreaded “free will” problem, and some people are uncomfortable with the idea of their behavior being the product of some kind of deterministic evolutionary process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lieberman Experiments: people were wired up to electrodes and asked questions, and the result was that the electrodes read that their brains had actually made decisions before they had consciously decided on the answer.  The point is that it seems that we have the illusion of control and that we make decisions even before we are aware of them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most evolutionary biologists study fruit flies, but Dr. Maestripieri studies monkeys and other primates, in order to study and make conclusions about human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Maestripieri also does research on humans in order to analyze the evolutionary processes which influence human behavior.  This sort of work is very controversial because of a variety of reasons, so not many evolutionary biologists do this kind of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, some evolutionary biologists think that the field of evolutionary psychology is non-scientific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic Outline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*brief history of primatology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*some basic concepts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*primatologists, evolutionary psychologists, human behavioral ecologists, and their critics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*evolutionary psychology: science or bunk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1872, Charles Darwin wrote “The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals” where he focused on the behavior &amp;amp; emotions of animals and how that reflects the psychology of man.  He felt that these behaviors in animals (primates) formed a continuum with human behavior.  In the process, like in his earlier research, he gathered evidence from around the world and attempted to formulate a theory of human behavior via evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/602darwin.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="602darwin" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/602darwin.jpg?w=286&amp;amp;h=340" alt="" width="286" height="340"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;From 1900-1940, there were many experimental studies of primate cognition (by Kohler and Yerkes).  Also, in these years there were systematic observations of primate behavior in the field, and there were attempts make to teach human language to chimpanzees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After World War II, three fields of study started to get more attention from academia: psychology; anthropology; and ethology, ecology &amp;amp; evolutionary biology.  By the 1960s and 70s primatology is well represented in all branches of scientific psychology, due to the cognitive revolution which overcame behaviorism.  Eventually, the research even got to the point of asking questions of whether or not apes had minds or if they even had a sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early attempts to teach apes human language was partly an effort to “learn the secrets of nature” from them or to train them as soldiers/pilots.  NASA was also interested in potentially sending them out into space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 1970s, there have been a series of longitudinal studies on various primate populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until the 1960s, evolution had really only been used in population genetics and understanding speciation.  Then scientists began to think that evolution could be used to understand behavior.  How adaptive is behavior?  If behavior is the result of natural selection, then we should be able to measure behavior in relation to environmental factors, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were the “golden days” of primatology.  Then things changed…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s and on into the 1990s, there came to be some overlap between primatology and psychology only in communication and cognition research.  Little or no presence of primate research in developmental, social, clinical, and biological psychology.  Rise of biological anthropology as the main discipline supporting primate behavior research in the U.S.  Some research at this time began to look into primate “theories of mind” – that is, are primates aware of the minds of others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to this day, primatology is mostly supported by anthropology as opposed to biology or psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last decade (2000-2010), biological anthropology (more biological and less anthropological) continues to be the main discipline supporting research on primate behavior and ecology in the U.S.  Primatology strengthens its connections with 2 branches of psychology: cognitive neuroscience/neuroeconomics are modern examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic Concepts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Behavioral Adaptation: behavioral trait that evolved in the past by natural selection because it enhanced the survival &amp;amp; reproductive success of the individuals.  The implication is that people are behaviorally adapted to their current environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: when you’re hungry, you try to eat.  The advantage of eating is very clear – you don’t die so you can reproduce.  You can look at the behavior among different individuals or you can manipulate the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Historical definition of BA: a trait that evolved in the past by natural selection because it enhanced the survival/reproductive success.  Natural selection is not currently on the trait, so it is no longer adaptiive or functional.  Implications are that people are not behaviorally adapated to their current environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Suppose I show you a watch, and you’ve never seen one before.  You start to formulate a hypothesis about what is the purpose of the watch, and you start to look for certain features and make predictions about the structure.  Then you open up the watch to see if you’re right.  This process is called the “argument from design”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Exaptation: trait that evolved in the past by natural selection, and this trait is currently under selective pressure, but for a diifferent function than in the past.  A by-product here is that the trait hasn’t been under direct selective pressure for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, at this point I have to leave the conference.  I hope that you found this record useful! &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Karen Stollznow, a linguist and researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, explains that “though glossolalia is the utterance of feigned language, this is not to say the subject intends to deceive. Instead, this phenomenon is more psychological than linguistic (a kind of localized mass hysteria). MRI studies have shown that when people speak in tongues they are using the emotion parts of the brain, rather than the linguistic centers.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As for the claims that modern folks suddenly begin speaking fluently in ancient tongues they’ve never heard, these reports are always unverified. Stollznow adds, “It would be very, very easy for any halfway competent historical linguist to determine whether a case of speaking in tongues is cognitive access to a foreign language known to the subject, or if they’re talking gobbledygook.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/mystopher-and-wife.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="mystopher and wife" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/mystopher-and-wife.jpg?w=252&amp;amp;h=343" alt="" width="252" height="343"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He became interested in magic &amp;amp; deception from the shell game which takes place all too often on the streets of Chicago.  He calls himself Mystopher because when he wanted to bring this magic show to his church but ran into resistance his fellow church-goers didn’t want to do it because “magic”, “illusion”, etc were somehow evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, Mystopher is now working on his tricks, so I’m going to stop blogging because I’m going to miss them!…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the difference between magic, luck, and miracle?  “God did it!” (joke from the audience)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just got pwned in a great card trick by Mystopher – very slick &amp;amp; well done! &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the straight-jacket is coming out – this is going to be good… he has been put into the straight-jacket, tied up with locked chains, and is now escaping this mess – wow!!!  He has one arm free and is opening an envelope to get a deck of cards so he can perform a reveal… undoing the back of the jacket now, both arms free… less than one minute to go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30 seconds to go… he’s free and the revealed card is coming out of his mouth! Awesome!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next trick is to disappear a $20 bill, make it into a $1 bill, and the original $20 bill (signed) was reappeared into a lemon.  I have no clue how he “miracled” the $20 bill into the lemon. Nice…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for some mentalism.  Mystopher’s wife Carolee has come to the front and been blindfolded by Adam Walker’s tie.  In the meantime, Mystopher is regaling us with some poetry… miracles for less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now some interesting mentalism from Carolee, using “clairvoyance” to tell people’s names on their nametags, what is in their pockets, how many fingers they’re holding up, the name on the back of a man’s tie, a picture in an envelope, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s basically Skepchick, but live on the streets of Chicago. Monday I’ll be announcing our first two events. One is an outing and the other is the kickoff of our new lecture series (ok it’s Skeptics in the Pub but with more vagina power.) I’m really excited about our first speaker as everything kind of fell into place timing-wise with her. Right now, she’s someone everyone is talking about. But more on that Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have other projects in the works including a science themed art expo and a science fair for grownups and some advocacy work. I’ve got a lot to get done before I pretend to go on leave at the end of May! And tomorrow I meet with the board to brainstorm some more ideas and get some of my ideas skewered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m asking you to do some of my work for me. Because I’m lazy… Um… Pregnant. I’m pregnant and need help doing some of this stuff because my belly is in the way… That’s what I meant.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be a cool skeptic-themed outing or event that would get you excited? Where do you think skeptical outreach is lacking? Who are speakers you’d like to see in your town? What should I do with my organization?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afternoon Inquisition (or AI) is a question posed to you, the Skepchick community. Look for it to appear Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays at 3pm ET.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Elyse</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272135643859"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2276">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e677f2f52fbc03bc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Writing Systems"/><title type="html">Mair on pinyin on BBC Radio 4</title><published>2010-04-24T18:59:49Z</published><updated>2010-04-24T18:59:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2276" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;BBC Radio 4's &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00s0d1d/Word_of_Mouth_20_04_2010/"&gt;Word of Mouth program for 4/20/2010&lt;/a&gt; deals with relations between Mandarin and English.  Victor's segment of the program is about the role of pinyin.  LL commenters may find a nit or two to pick with the program's online self-description, but Victor thinks they did a good job in weaving the interviews together to create the program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Chris Ledgard looks at the Chinese and English languages, and the meeting point between the two. Will the Chinese language be affected by the growing influence of English? Pinyin is the Chinese method of writing Chinese characters in our alphabet. It produces a simplified version of Chinese for children to learn, and is also used for texting, slang and to make it possible to type on a keyboard. It also helps the rest of the world to understand Chinese words. Beijing is a pinyin word, for example. Will the use of Chinese characters eventually die out as the influence of pinyin and English is felt there? And we hear about the language war raging in Singapore, the only country in Asia with English as its first language, between standard English and Singlish, the local variant. Contributors include William Zhou, Chen "Cathy" Liu,"Pinyin Joe"- Joe Katz, Victor Mair and Singaporean podcaster extraordinaire "mr brown", aka Kin Mun Lee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the online version of the program will only be available for a few more days. (Why? I have no idea.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s from Lawrence, Kansas, and he’s here talking about evolution &amp;amp; creationism (and the newest version of creationism – “intelligent design”).  One argument by creationists often used is to “teach the controversy”.  In ID, there are basically no new arguments – the roots of ID are actually older than Flood Geology, Biblically based Young Earth Creationism.  Thus, these ID arguments have been thoroughly refuted for a long time, yet the argument is back with new terminology.  Essentially, the ID argument boils down to claiming that “we have proved the existence of God using science!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a pretty enormous claim, especially considering that there is no science in modern ID – it’s just a bunch of essays written by the proponents.  They use all the standard creationist arguments against evolution which have been debunked for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Paley’s Watchmaker Argument: from the modern ID movement, it is clear that their version of the Intelligent Designer is their view of the Christian god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irreducible Complexity &amp;amp; Specified Complexity – IC is complexity which can not be broken down any simpler.  SC speaks to specific functions (i.e., DNA, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law of Conservation of Information: basically, it is impossible for natural processes to come up with SC – wtf?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire ID argument boils in large part down to an argument from incredulity – “I cannot conceive that God didn’t do it, therefore evolution is wrong &amp;amp; God did it!”  When presented with explanations via evolution for what we observe, they essentially deny the evidence &amp;amp; rationalize it away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another ID argument is known as god-of-the-gaps… in the past, in the absence of natural explanations for various phenomena (earthquakes, volcanoes, storms, etc) the explanation of “God did (does) it!” comes to the front.  However, as we learn more and more about the natural world, the god-of-the-gaps gets smaller and smaller, which is one reason why intelligent theologians do not like this line of argumentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Center for Science &amp;amp; Culture via the Discovery Institute pushes ID through their Wedge Strategy, internal memos which explicitly state that they are attempting to push a Christian theocracy on U.S. society.  They believe that this “wedge” will lead to a replacement of evolution in science by ID, and this will better society as a whole – note that they say specifically that they aren’t interested in science, rather they are interested in pushing their ideology.  Questions such as Young Earth Creationism vs. Old Earth Creationism are said to be answered &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; evolution is replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least in YEC, there is some kind of model to be tested, making it at least a legitimate pseudoscience, whereas the modern ID movement is not even wrong, it’s not even a pseudoscience, because it doesn’t even have a model which can be tested in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ID proponents claim they have a theory, yet they don’t – no model to test – just a bunch of articles.  They take advantage of the public’s misunderstanding of the word “theory”, which they imply is “just a guess.”  Sadly, many high school texts don’t help with the manner in which scientific terminology is mangled (e.g., hypothesis is more than “a prediction”).  This includes mixing up various terms such as scientific law, theory, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no ID “theory” – it is simply an assertion.  And scientists shouldn’t even use such language in reference to ID, because it gives them more credit than they deserve. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five Models of the Earth in the Past Compatible with ID:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood clotting in humans or bacterial flagellum as examples of IC.  Only humans have that blood clotting process, and only bacteria have that particular flagella, so this would suggest, in the creationist view, that each (humans &amp;amp; bacteria) would have to be separately created.  Thus, there are many, many separate acts of creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe there was a single, original created kind of living thing which was miraculously created.  It had every single IC structure within it to begin with, and as the present day fluora &amp;amp; fauna were developed from this original organism there were various bits lost to form what we see today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe the original, miraculously created critter (OMCC) had all of the genetic material for past &amp;amp; present organisms within it.  So there was selective loss of genetic material over time to yield all the organisms we see today.  A problem with this is exactly how is any of this material preserved without beign degraded – answer: miraculous maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model actually predicts fossilized transitional forms, which puts it at odds with many other versions of creationism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; OMCC is hanging out, and God tinkers miraculously with all the critter’s IC parts/genetics.  So the organisms can develop, but it requires constant maintenance (miraculous tinkering) on the part of God.  So things like vestigial structures had to be added in.  This, too, predicts fossils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; There were separate miraculous creations at the species level.  It could be a gradual or punctuated version of creationism.  They would be created and stuck into the ecosystem, but unfortunately this process seems to have stopped – probably because the best creation, humans, has been reached.  These folks say the fossil record should be taken at face value, by which they mean that if a fossil is discovered to have appeared suddenly it literally means that “poof!” it appeared suddenly (no transitional forms).  So, you’re walking around in the Mesozoic, and all of the sudden “Poof!” there’s a whole herd of brontosauruses appears! &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same argument would have to go for sudden disappearances of organisms – no gradual extinctions.  It all happens at once – “poof!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; The Standard Bible-Science Creationism: this is a model the modern ID people have ever repudiated this view, because they want to have a “big tent” in order to further their ideological agenda (very different from in modern science where different camps argue all the time).  All species are created separately &amp;amp; miraculously all at the same time in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, when it boils down to it, what you really get at the fundamental level here is nothing more than explanation by miracles.  So everything that happens is an act of God – welcome to the pre-Enlightenment world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual science has made a (unintentional) political mistake in this battle with creationism.  That is, science has actual content, models &amp;amp; theories which make it easy to attack, and the ID people avoid that trap by not having any content at all!  Thus, there is a double standard: science can be criticized, and ID cannot.  This is the political problem that YEC have… they proposed content and got pwned because it is so obviously wrong.  This makes a problem for creationists because the ID people are not willing to repudiate YEC despite it’s obvious falseness – so since they don’t distance themselves from YEC, critique ID by critiquing YEC…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Take the fossil record, it contains huge gaps that argue against YEC – were all these gaps also created at the same time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Also, according to the Bible, flowering plants came into existence &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the Sun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*How would you get &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the animals onto the Ark?  There are at least 800 genera of dinosaurs alone!  YEC responses are ludicrous: maybe they’re all babies or in eggs, maybe they were all plant eaters (???), there were various “created kinds” from which modern critters descended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*By YEC calculation, the Flood was 4300 years ago, which is within recorded archeological time!  And no intermediates between “created kinds” and modern creatures have been found, at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when creationists have a model, it is clear they suck.  So in order for ID to gain any kind of scientific credibility, they have to propose a model that is at least better than YEC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the evidence, it seems that God actually wants us to see evolution in the universe.  Is God deceiving us?  Is our faith being tested?  Or is it Satan trying to use this false evidence as a way of trying to steer us away from the true path?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final word:&lt;/strong&gt; this is a big movement, so pay attention to who you vote for on your local school boards, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

They're so infatuated with tearing down that they never bother to build up. &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/undergod/2010/04/faith_in_south_park.html?hpid=talkbox1"&gt;Trey Parker has an odd comment in an interview&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the religions are super funny to me," Parker said. "The story of Jesus makes no sense to me. God sent his only son. Why could God only have one son and why would he have to die? It's just bad writing, really. And it's really terrible in about the second act."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But Parker says atheism is more ludicrous to him than anything else.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Out of all the ridiculous religion stories -- which are greatly, wonderfully ridiculous -- the silliest one I've ever heard is, 'Yeah, there's this big, giant universe and it's expanding and it's all going to collapse on itself and we're all just here, just 'cuz. Just 'cuz. That to me, is the most ridiculous explanation ever," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nah, he doesn't even get the physics right. We're here; we have the observations and measurements and experiments to show how we got here; it just &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;, no because about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s the cowardly part of his statement: he implies he&amp;#39;s not a Christian, he implies he&amp;#39;s not an atheist — neither of which are particularly interesting comments — but nowhere does he say where he thinks we came from. You know why, and he knows why: he&amp;#39;s made a profession out of tearing down and ridiculing ideas (no problem there, it&amp;#39;s often a good thing to do), and he is well aware that if he actually gave even tentative support to some idea, not only would others reciprocate and rip into it with ridicule, but he&amp;#39;d be expected to do a show where he laughs at it himself. Of course, it may well be that he accepts the physical explanation of the universe — or even the Christian story, for that matter — but still thinks it is ridiculous because that is his only response to everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think his show is often funny, and it does sometimes do a good job of satirizing even stuff I like (and often does a bad job, but heck, 95% of everything is crap), but the depressing pattern it constantly exhibits is that it is so damned hollow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I think the recent Mohammed episode falls into the 95%, and I really don&amp;#39;t believe their claim that the network forced them to censor it — I find it hard to believe &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; they say, and think it's just Parker and Stone gaming their audience some more. Just 'cuz that's what they do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/south_park_evades_a_positive_a.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/6A5rnpGOr_U" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272132263901"><id gr:original-id="http://www.begin2dig.com/2010/04/hypertrophy-happens-from-day-1-and.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b2416388e6a134ed</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Hypertrophy: More sets are Better than 1, from Day 1</title><published>2010-04-24T13:29:23Z</published><updated>2010-04-24T13:29:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/lTNkQru1GXU/hypertrophy-happens-from-day-1-and.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.begin2dig.com/2010/04/hypertrophy-happens-from-day-1-and.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Strength is about at least two things: neural adaptations - muscle firing patterns - to be able to lift stuff, and structural changes to be able to support these loads without tearing ourselves apart.

But despite their differences, all breeds of dogs are still the same species as each other and their ancestor. How do species split? What causes speciation? And what evidence do we have that speciation has ever occurred?

Critics of evolution often fall back on the maxim that no one has ever seen one species split into two. While that's clearly a straw man, because most speciation takes far longer than our lifespan to occur, it's also not true. We have seen species split, and we continue to see species diverging every day.

We give medications that work directly against the parasite itself, but oftentimes it&amp;#39;s insufficient, and people die due to their body&amp;#39;s inflammatory response to the invading parasite. Predicting, early on, who will die, and what we can do about it, is an active field of research, with some innovative discoveries over the past few years.Adding to this is a mouse study looking at charcoal in the treatment of malaria. Oral charcoal doesn&amp;#39;t get absorbed through your gut and has been safely used for years for adsorbing ingested toxins; it also has been shown to be an anti-inflammatory through unconfirmed mechanisms. It may be able to adsorb any intestinally-mediated toxins, as well as cytokines from the blood through a mechanism that I don&amp;#39;t completely understand. Regardless of mechanism, these investigators randomized mice experimentally infected with malaria to oral charcoal or not, and the results were striking. All untreated mice died and only 55% of treated mice died. They reconfirmed their results with just the charcoal itself, and not its diluent - this time none of the untreated mice survived and 60% of the treated mice survived at day 10.Mechanistically, there seems to be a moderate effect on the production of inflammatory cytokines, specifically by various T-cell lineages. They also looked at whole blood global gene expression analysis and found a significantly different profile amongst the treated mice, one that more closely resembled uninfected mice. Most importantly, they also wisely included a phase I human study, seeing if charcoal had any effects on the pharmacokinetics of antimalarials, one of the main concerns of this potential treatment (antimalarial overdose is often treated with activated charcoal, for example).  It didn&amp;#39;t have any effect on drug levels, but they used intravenous antimalarials - it remains to be seen if it is safe with administered with the more commonly given oral antimalarials.Like they mention in their discussion, charcoal can never be used as a stand-alone therapy. As an adjunct in severe cases, it holds promise, given its safety and affordability. More importantly, understanding its molecular mechanism of activity in using the gut to reduce systemic inflammation in the malarial response could yield many other avenues of research. Human trials will need to happen, and I&amp;#39;m skeptical as to whether or not it can be given with oral medications, but a valuable addition to the adjunctive therapy in malaria literature.de Souza, J., Okomo, U., Alexander, N., Aziz, N., Owens, B., Kaur, H., Jasseh, M., Muangnoicharoen, S., Sumariwalla, P., Warhurst, D., Ward, S., Conway, D., Ulloa, L., Tracey, K., Foxwell, B., Kaye, P., &amp;amp; Walther, M.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There's a new slogan making its way onto car bumpers and across the Internet. It reads simply: "Pray for Obama: Psalm 109:8"

&lt;p&gt;A nice sentiment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The psalm reads, "Let his days be few; and let another take his office."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presidential criticism through witty slogans is nothing new. Bumper stickers, t-shirts, and hats with "1/20/09" commemorated President Bush's last day in office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the verse immediately following the psalm referenced is a bit more ominous: "Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/biblical_obama_bashing.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/_zMFhQWuN5k" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272124746558"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=10961">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9ba7f58d3e38843e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Saturday thumbs</title><published>2010-04-24T15:58:55Z</published><updated>2010-04-24T15:58:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/24/saturday-thumbs/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thumbs down&lt;/strong&gt;: To Comedy Central for &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/arts/television/23park.html?scp=1&amp;amp;sq=South%20Park&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;censoring South Park’s episode on Islam and Muhamed&lt;/a&gt; out of sheer cowardice.  South Park has satirized many faiths, and even went after Dawkins, but only the Muslim episode was censored.   We all know why: the “religion of peace” threatens to kill people who make fun of Islam, or even name a teddy bear “Muhamed.” &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many&lt;/em&gt; thumbs down&lt;/strong&gt; to the Revolution Muslim organization, who showed a dead body on their webpage that criticized South Park, and whose spokesman, Abu Talha Al-Amrikee, said this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have to warn Matt and Trey [the producers of South Park] that what they are doing is stupid, and  they will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show. This is not a threat,  but a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not a threat?&lt;/em&gt; What a contemptible lie!  And &lt;strong&gt;thumbs down&lt;/strong&gt; to the “moderate and peace-loving Muslims” who refuse to speak up against this call for murder.  A bit of Googling has failed to reveal one Islamic organization that decries the murderous irrationality of Revolution Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thumbs down at a 30-degree angle&lt;/strong&gt; to Michael Ruse, who continues to mystify with his bizarre mixture of faitheism and atheism.  Over at BioLogos, he’s mercifully concluded his &lt;a href="http://biologos.org/blog/accommodationist-and-proud-of-it-part-vi/"&gt;six-part intellectual autobiography&lt;/a&gt;, “Accommodationist and Proud of It.”  He admits that religion is a “delusion”, and is not a way of knowing, but then plays favorites among the faiths.  He doesn’t for instance, have much truck with Mormonism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really find it very difficult to respect the Mormons.  The whole thing  seems to me to absolutely ludicrous, from wearing silly underwear to  not drinking tea and coffee, to all of that stuff about golden plates,  not to mention the already-mentioned lost tribes of Israel, now  supposedly alive and well and living on reservations out West.  Why do I  not feel the same way about Christianity?  Is turning water into wine  any more stupid than thinking Joseph Smith got special insights in  upstate New York?  Is it simply that one is older and I grew up with it?   Is wearing a fancy pair of knickers anything different from wearing  your collar backwards?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to all three questions, Dr. Ruse, is “yes.”  So why does he favor Christianity?  Because it has a &lt;em&gt;theology&lt;/em&gt;!:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the reason I can legitimately separate your basic Anglican or  Roman Catholic from a Mormon rests on the fact that traditional  Christianity (this may also be true of Judaism and other religions) has  worked hard at what I will call philosophical theology.  I came to  appreciate this while working on &lt;em&gt;Science and Spirituality&lt;/em&gt;, a  book that goes much more deeply into theological questions than my  earlier writings.  Such Christianity has labored to give philosophical  meaning to the claims, say, about the nature of a necessary God and so  forth.  I think this also holds in areas like ethics, where (to name one  branch of Christianity) Catholics have tried to give some meaning to  natural law and so forth.  (Protestants have done similar things, as I  know full well from my own background.)   So as a philosopher I can  appreciate the efforts to try to answer the basic metaphysical  questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never mind Ruse’s admission that religion is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; “a valid way of knowing” (and kudos for that admission).  All that matters to Ruse, apparently, is that they have &lt;em&gt;tried&lt;/em&gt; to answer the metaphysical questions, even though, as Ruse believes, their answers are likely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both thumbs completely down for &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/skye-jethani/what-evangelicals-and-ath_b_549775.html"&gt;Skye Jethani at HuffPo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who wrote a whole column showing the similarities between atheists and fundamentalist Christians without once addressing atheists’ arguments about the lack of evidence for God and the palpable dangers of faith.  Jethani’s piece, as you might expect, is all about &lt;em&gt;tone&lt;/em&gt;.  As we all recognize, the emphasis on atheists’ shrill and militant “tone” is merely a way to avoid engaging our substantive arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the new breed of atheists and evangelicals may have more in  common than they’d like to admit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some within New Atheism are proselytizing their beliefs  with the fervor, and in come cases anger, more often associated with  evangelicals. From an international ad campaign on buses dismissing  belief in God, to rallies at universities inviting students to exchange  their Bibles for pornography, atheists are no longer content with a  live-and-let-live approach to those adhering to religion. Instead, they  are actively trying to convert (or is the word &lt;em&gt;un-convert&lt;/em&gt;?) the  masses. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I believe both the New Atheists (advocating life over God) and the  Constitutional Evangelicals (advocating life under God) are far closer  in their values and worldview than either would like to acknowledge.  They are two sides of the same coin. But there is a third dimension; a  third way between “live over God” or “live under God.” There is also  “life &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; God” — the Good News of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thumbs mildly down for &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,  which continues to show an emphasis on style over substance.  Its articles on books, culture, and literature are increasingly dominated by writers who don’t have much to say but try to say it in lovely prose.  This often falls flat.  For example, &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2010/04/19/100419craw_artworld_schjeldahl"&gt;a recent article by Peter Schjeldahl &lt;/a&gt;on one of my favorite photographers, Henri Cartier-Bresson, contains this sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cartier-Bresson has the weakness of his strength: an Apollonian  elevation that subjugates life to an order of things already known, if  never so well seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds nice, but what the bloody hell does it mean?  What’s worse, Schjeldahl manages to write a whole piece on Cartier-Bresson, including giving a potted biography, without even once mentioning the man’s nationality (Cartier-Bresson was French).  Oh, and in the latest issue Jill Lepore strains to produce New-Yorker quality prose in&lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2010/04/19/100419crat_atlarge_lepore"&gt; a review of a book about the publisher Henry Luce&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Magazines are ephemeral, timely at the expense of timelessness. They evanesce.  Each new issue displaces the last; a magazine molts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not say it five times, just to make sure that the reader gets the point?  Lepore reminds me of &lt;a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~ebarnes/python/dead-parrot.htm"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘E’s passed on! This parrot is no more! He has ceased to be! ‘E’s expired and gone to  meet ‘is maker! ‘E’s a stiff! Bereft of life, ‘e rests in peace! If you hadn’t nailed ‘im to the perch ‘e’d be pushing up the daisies! ‘Is metabolic processes are  now ‘istory! ‘E’s off the twig! ‘E’s kicked the bucket, ‘e’s shuffled off ‘is mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the bleedin’ choir invisibile!! THIS IS AN EX-PARROT!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, two enthusiastic thumbs up for Pedro Almodóvar&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the new movie &lt;a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/brokenembraces/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Abrazos Rotos&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Broken Embraces&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a wonderful, complex and layered film about uncontrollable passion, duplicity, moviemaking, and blindness.  Almodóvar pulls another great performance from Penelope Cruz (they’ve made some great films together) and from Lluis Homar as the blind director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker #2: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fnal.gov/"&gt;Dr. Michael  Albrow &lt;/a&gt; , physicist at FermiLab, talking about “What’s True and What’s Untrue  in Physics Today?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening joke: please take away from this that physics is much simpler than biology! &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some knowledge is as certain as certain can be, while some things are necessarily uncertain.  There is much we know is not possible, but there is much which we know is also outside of our domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of modern science probably started with Galileo and his conflict with the Church.  Differences between science &amp;amp; religion…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*distrust authority / only Nature is authority&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*criticism encouraged&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*all hypotheses are testable by repeatable experiments / observations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*try to fault existing theories, make progress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*theory = explanation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*disagreements are healthy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*accepted standards of statistics &amp;amp; evidence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Religion/Nonsense/Nonscience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*dogmatic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*questioning / criticism not encouraged&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*not fundamentally upheld to testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*”theory” = speculation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*disagreements discouraged / when scientists disagree that mans they’re wrong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*poor understanding or misuse of statistics &amp;amp; numbers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the idea of perpetual motion is okay (the Earth moves perpetually around the Sun, atoms move perpetually due to thermal energy, etc).  But perpetual motion machines… or energy generation… is impossible.  That is because whenever energy converts from one form to another, due to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, some random heat is made.  These transformations thus have a maximum level of efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about grabbing energy out of the vacuum? Only possible when looking at extraordinarily small time scales (due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;/strong&gt; don’t go buying “free energy” shares anytime soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noether’s Theorem (1915):&lt;/strong&gt; To every continuous symmetry there corresponds a conserved quantity.  This includes symmetry under rotations (angular momentum), translations (linear momentum), and translation in time (energy).  Energy conservation is as certain as certain can be… but what about in the big bang?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantum Mechanics:&lt;/strong&gt; let’s talk about Schrodinger’s Cat… put a cat in a box with a radioactive source.  If the source randomly emits a particle it sets off a device which kills the cat.  The box is closed and time passes – is the cat alive or dead?  The answer, in the view of QM, is that before the box is opened the cat is in a combined state of being both alive &amp;amp; dead simultaneously!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the role of the “observer”?  Well, the universe evolved for billions of years without any observers (except the “gods” &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;  ).  So the notion of a wavefunction suddenly “collapsing” when an event is “observed” is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wavefunctions “collapse” when quasi-irreversible event occurs, such as radioactive decay, ionization, neutron decay into a proton-electron pair, etc.  This is because while energy is conserved, the level of entropy increases.  So this has nothing to do with “observers”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonically Conjugate Variables: momentum &amp;amp; position, energy &amp;amp; time, and angular momentum &amp;amp; orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP):&lt;/strong&gt; you cannot know both precisely the values of these CCVs, so there is an absolute limit to our knowledge.  This is another nail in the coffin of determinism.  However, usually the HUP applies at the (sub)atomic level; but some quantum events can be amplified to macroscopic proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside… where do thoughts start?  Are they simply the result of quantum fluctations in the brain at the neuronic level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from QM, there are examples classically that the future is not determined by the past.  For example, look at classical physics branch points: unstable equilibrium of a pencil standing on its tip, asteroids (interplanetary billiards &amp;amp; death of dinosaurs), and volcanoes in Iceland!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate quantum amplification is probably the Cosmic Background Radiation (CBR), where the early universe had tiny variations in density &amp;amp; temperature in the microwave background only about 300,000 years post big-bang.  These variations are only colder or hotter by about 1/1000th of a degree Kelvin.  From this, and other info, we know the universe is about 13.7 Byr old (not 6000!).  In addition, the behavior of the universe’s expansion breaks down as follows: matter we understand 4%, dark matter 26%, dark energy 74%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, 13.7Byr ago… inflationary theory tells us that a “dot” about 10^-33 cm across came into being.  It wasn’t really BIG, and it wasn’t so much an explosion so there wasn’t a BANG.  But it’s still exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the National Science Board held its biannual survey of scientific literacy in the U.S. deleted two questions and the results from its report…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The universe began with a big explosion” 33% yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Humans evolved from earlier forms of animals” 45% yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defense was that we don’t want to ask science questions that are “value related” – WTF?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astronomy, Cosmology, etc:&lt;/strong&gt; There are roughly 10^11 galaxies in the universe, with about 10^11 stars per galaxy, so how many have life, intelligent life, and even advanced civilizations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about interstellar space travel?  What is fiction vs. reality?  According to time dilation, what takes many years according to a stay-at-home person takes much less time for a spacewoman if she goes really fast.  But it only helps if you’re traveling a really high % of the speed of light, and this then begs questions of fuel storage and whatnot. What about travel through wormholes or other spacetime fantasies?  Almost certainly not, because “stable” wormholes” would be extremely small (~10^-33 m).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antimatter rocket fuel or bombs?  FermiLab generates 60 MW for one day –&amp;gt; ~ 10^-9 grams of antiprotons –&amp;gt; 60W x 15 sec.  If you could bottle this, you’d only have ~10^-20 grams (???)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often extrapolate wildly (“100 years ago no one thought we could fly”) and hope this leads to seemingly miraculous technological progress in the future.  But it butts up against fundamental physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider Gravitation: &lt;/strong&gt;Pre-Newton – falling to the ground was the “natural state of things”, and ditto for the Moon and Sun in the sky.  Newton – Force = mass x acceleration and iit is a brilliant unification that almost fit everything.  Still: “every mass attracts every other mass…” could be disproved but never proved 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lititle problem with Newton was things like Mercury’s orbit precessing.  Einstein came along and used general relativity to revise Newton’s theory.  It fixed the problems with Newton’s theory, and so far every test of GR has confirmed the theory, but is there anything deeper / more correct (say, at the Planck scale) that we haven’t discovered yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accorgind to GR, space &amp;amp; time are bent by curvature due to graviity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einstein Wannabees (EWs): Point to the fact that Einstein was also an unknown with no PhD working in a patent office, etc.  His relativity was also “difficult” to understand and has strange consequences.  But the difference is that Einstein’s ideas stood up to scientific scrutiny!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Particles:&lt;/strong&gt; they are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; tiny!  Probing the very, very small we find the Standard Model…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/standard_model2.gif"&gt;&lt;img title="standard_model2" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/standard_model2.gif?w=416&amp;amp;h=400" alt="" width="416" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each one of these particles has an anti-matter partner.  In addition, the mass of these particles is the same here as it is everywhere.  Why?  This is where the hypothetical Higgs boson comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Force carriers: the electromagnetic force is carried by photons, weak nuclear is carried by W, Z bosons, and the strong nuclear is carried by gluons.  We haven’t yet detected the carrier for gravity – the graviton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for neutrinos: difficult to detect because they have no charge &amp;amp; practically no mass.  It took decades to finally detect them because there are three different types (flavors) that oscillate after leaving the Sun and change flavors, and the detectors were designed to detect only one flavor!  Here’s an example of a deep-underground neutrino telescope…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/neutrino-detector.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="neutrino detector" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/neutrino-detector.jpg?w=225&amp;amp;h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FermiLab: has the particle accelerator called the Tevatron (4 miles around).  Looking to answer questions like: what is dark matter? What is dark energy?  Does the Higgs boson exist? Are there higher dimensions to our universe?  String Theory?  Can we re-create the big bang in the lab? etc…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LHC: an even bigger particle accelerator in Europe created to answer similar questions.  This thing is &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;!!!  The LHC is exciting because it will be probing energies about 10x higher than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about “Theories of Everything” such as superstring theory?  Sounds neat, but it isn’t yet testable, falsifiable, and perhaps therefore not (yet) a full science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of “miracles” for us to get here… designed? Just is? The Goldilocks Dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there other universes?  If so, where are they?  What are their properties, laws of physics, etc?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this, how can &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; leave school still thinking creation was only 6000 years ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lynn is good, though, and shows how to gracefully cope with an interview with a moron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/I1FlqJ9AV2A%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=248" width="425" height="248"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barry-w-lynn/who-needs-a-national-day_b_541107.html"&gt;Lynn has an excellent defense of the decision that the national day of prayer is unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt; (even if it is on the odious HuffPo), where he makes the case that the NDP has always been a sectarian and blatantly religious event, of exactly the kind that the government is forbidden from endorsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, if more Christians were like Barry Lynn (or like &lt;a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/apr/22/its-a-clear-cut-issue/"&gt;Sam Venable&lt;/a&gt;, for another example), those danged New Atheists would have very little to rail against, and we'd all kind of cool down and go take a nap, or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, they aren&amp;#39;t like that, and right now we have the Department of Justice gearing up to appeal the decision against the NDP, and Obama still intends to honor the National Day of Prayer (thanks, Mr President — you are apparently the kind of disreputable Christian we oppose). The &lt;a href="http://ffrf.org/legal/national-day-of-prayer-victory/"&gt;Freedom from Religion Foundation&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href="http://ffrf.org/legal/national-day-of-prayer-victory/stop-the-national-day-of-prayer-petition/"&gt;petition asking Obama to respect the court decision&lt;/a&gt;, and is also looking for contributions to their legal fund.

She wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to the usual scientific stuff, the twitter smack-down between Dr. Isis (@drisis) and Marty Frank of the APS (@ExecDirectorAPS) begins at 0800 PDT on Saturday, April 24. Isis currently claims 1105 followers, while Dr. Frank has 139 followers. For those of you who do not wish to follow the link above for the rules, here they are: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The challenge: sign up new Twitter followers (Tweeple or Tweeps) during Experimental Biology in Anaheim. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will certify the number of followers each has at 7:59 am PDT on Friday, April 23, just before on-site registration opens at the meeting. When a predetermined deadline has been reached, I will once again check the number of followers for each. Whoever has the most new followers will win. For those of you more mathematically inclined:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New followers = N(deadline) - N(start)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am letting the fighters determine the "prize" which may also determine the deadline. For example, if a tweet-up with the loser buying drinks is involved, we should probably end on Tuesday to allow that event to occur. If clown services at some point in the future are involved, well, we can go to the last minute on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle begins today! So, spread the word and ask people to follow &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/drisis"&gt;@drisis&lt;/a&gt;. Not only will you get the best coverage of the Experimental Biology meeting, complete with pictures, but you'll help Dr. Isis retain her crown as Queen of teh Twitterz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday night I will tweet information for an EB tweetup so that you can join Marty and me for a drink. And, you'll have the opportunity to watch him pout when I totally pwn him at this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, spread the word! Sign up and have your readers sign up. And don't forget to follow @drisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future is you! Probably.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/04/the_eb_battle_royale_begins.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/FcLuyaJLQC4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272120924706"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=14166">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/16f28e1be1bd90d6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Ironic Sans"/><title type="html">New York Times depicts life on Venus and Mars… in 1912</title><published>2010-04-24T14:00:31Z</published><updated>2010-04-24T14:00:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/8vdizWpSFR4/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/24/new-york-times-depicts-life-on-venus-and-mars-in-1912/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the cooler blogs out there is Ironic Sans by David Friedman (the same guy who made &lt;a href="http://www.ironicsans.com/2008/02/idea_scientist_valentines.html"&gt;scientific Valentine cards&lt;/a&gt;). He’s started a new blog called &lt;a href="http://www.ironicsans.com/2010/04/announcing_a_new_blog_sundaymagazine_org.html"&gt;SundayMagazine.org&lt;/a&gt;, where posts and discusses old issues of the New York Times Sunday Magazine from the ancient archives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his first one, he found quite the catch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/nyt_sundaymag1912.jpg" alt="nyt_sundaymag1912" title="nyt_sundaymag1912" width="610" height="576"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How cool is that? The article is about a lettered French scientist speculating about what life would be like on other planets. David has a PDF of the article as well, which is an absolute delight to read. How wonderful to see something like that; an apparently scientifically-minded article, but free to have fun and take the reader to a totally different place than what they might expect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s inspiring, in fact. Given that kind of freedom today, I wonder what other famous scientists of today would write about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/chicagoskyline1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="ChicagoSkyline1" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/chicagoskyline1.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=215" alt="" width="300" height="215"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s about 100-120 people in attendance today, and a nice number of people who are from out of town (about 20%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Walker is talking about how we should (as Americans) be reigniting the love of learning, learning how to ask questions, digging deeper, rejecting pat answers.  However, we see tens of thousands of young people tromping through the Creation Museum in KY – of course the Grand Canyon was carved in a weekend!  We also see the Obama administration appealing the ruling by a federal court ruling that the National Day of Prayer is a constitutional violation of church-state separation.  We also grit our teeth as the State Board of Education in Texas is giving Phyllis Schlafley the same status as Thomas Jefferson’s framing of the Constitution equal importance in history textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where groups like CFI Chicago comes in: we stand for reason &amp;amp; rationality.  We also provide opportunities to skeptics &amp;amp; freethinkers to join together and socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s topic is “Dangerous Nonsense”, because when America allows itself to be influenced by fakers &amp;amp; deniers because it eats away at our core principles of the Enlightenment &amp;amp; rationalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Pigliucci"&gt;Dr. Massimo Pigliucci&lt;/a&gt; cannot attend.  He was apparently detained by the Vatican in Rome (just kidding!), so…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker #1:&lt;/strong&gt; Our first speaker is &lt;a href="http://drdrantz.blogspot.com/"&gt;Dr. Veronica Drantz&lt;/a&gt;, professor of physiology, speaking about myth, science &amp;amp; sexuality.  To start with the big myth, we’ll talk about Adam &amp;amp; Eve – which is of course a myth because it gives the impression there are only two types of people, and it excludes gays, bisexuals, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll start with the science and then get on to the nonsense.  First, we’ll talk about the formation of genetalia, also known as the organization activation mechanism.  A typical male has a Y chromosome, whereas a female has no Y chromosome.  The absence of the Y chromosome makes one female.  A really important gene is the SRY gene on the Y chromosome, which is what helps to express other genes that create proteins which affect physiological changes the gonad from female to a male testes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally, in the embryonic stage mammals start out as hermophrodites, with the sexual organs of both male &amp;amp; female.  The question is which set of organs develop &amp;amp; dominate.  By the 7th week, the external genetalia are starting to reorganize into either male or female – with the clitoris turning into the penis in males, and the outer labia turning into the scrotum in males. Without any influence from the Y chromosome, the gonads in the mammal will naturally develop into an ovary, which makes females the “default sex”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the gonads are organized before birth, and later during puberty hormones activate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cause the female organs to whither away, the male has to make two hormones which also allows the female body plan transform into the male body plan.  Surges of testosterone for males come three times: as a fetus, shortly after birth, and at puberty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of hormone molecules as little 3D keys which will fit into a receptor which allows it to bind to DNA in a certain way that will allow certain genes to be expressed, thus allowing for the transformation of the female body plan into the male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thus:&lt;/strong&gt; to physiologists, there is only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; sex, because males are really just adjusted females!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this entire process is governed by hormone levels, then there can be uncommon results beyond the standard heterosexual female &amp;amp; male.  In addition, sex has many levels…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*genetic sex – chromosomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*gonadal sex – ovaries/testis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*hormonal sex – estrogen/testosterone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*somatic sex – body anatomy/physiology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*psychological sex – sexual identity (is this biological or learned?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*and, of course, sexual orientation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core Sexuality – Nature or Nurture?  Genetalia are obviously inborm in other mammals, but what about people?  What about sexual behavior?  Is the brain organized by the presence or absence of sex hormones before birth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Money, a psychologist, has a psychosexuality “neutrality-at-birth” theory.  Sexual behavior is all nurture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milton Diamond, a biologist, has the “sexuality at birth” theory.  Sexuality is inherent as “built-in” due to hormonal &amp;amp; evolutionary influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1959 – Breakthrough at Univ. of Kansas: Female guinea pigs were given hormones as embryos, and after birth they &lt;em&gt;acted&lt;/em&gt; like males!  This means that animal’s (mammal’s) sexuality is influenced quite strongly by their biology, and this includes humans!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamond (as a grad student) challenged Money on this, and Money (having much prestige) kept responding with “but those are &lt;em&gt;animals&lt;/em&gt;, people can change their behavior!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Money was allowed to get involved in the John/Joan “Twins Case”, where there was a pair of identical twins, where one of the boys had an accident and had his genitals mutilated.  Money said that the parents should castrate him, do some surgery, and lie to the child, telling him that he was in fact a girl and everything would end up just fine.  Money kept reporting that the “girl” (Brenda) was doing well growing up &amp;amp; happy, when in fact she was quite miserable.  Feminists at the time loved Money’s views on this, but the fact is that sex is partly destined by biology!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, when Brenda was given estrogen treatments, things started to unravel. Finally, the parents started to question Money, and at age 14 Joan/John became Brenda/David when he said that he “just felt male”.  David eventually married a woman and had a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire time John Money kept telling the medical community that Joan/Brenda is a happy girl/woman and then claims to lose track of her; Milton diamond finds Joan/Brenda living as David!  It was discovered that thousands of intersex babies have suffered a similar plight, and sadly these people have been lost track of over the years, so many don’t even know they are intersex!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curtis Hinkle: “The fact that the binary sex system is a fiction is written in the bodies of intersex people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incidence of intersexuality is about 1.7-2.5% of the population, and there are a wide variety of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, what happens if the androgen receptor doesn’t work, and as a result testosterone hormones don’t work?  These people have XY chromosomes, but because the testosterone doesn’t work, they have absolutely no internal sex organs at all.  They end up looking like women physiologically, but they don’t have any menstruation during puberty.  Many high-powered fashion models fall into this category, believe it or not!  This creates a lot of problems for these people because there is no place in society for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other conditions can result in very ambiguous external genitalia, leading to a lot of personal issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Drantz brought a friend, Alex, who is an intersex person, with her.  At birth, his parent’s were told he was male, but a few hours after that they were told he was female.  In keeping with John Money’s ideas, the parents had him undergo “corrective” surgery, and he has had a very difficult life as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, all lot of sexuality is literally in the brain.  Research has shown that homosexuality is quite common in the animal kingdom, which is a result of the influence of the hypothalamus.  All animals have a hypothalamus.  For example, about 8% of rams (male sheep) are exclusively homosexual, and these rams had adjusted hypothalami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Samoa (which is essentially a non-homophobic society), there is a third sex called fa-afafine, gay males who fill a role in society, acting like females (helping babysit, etc).  These people are happy &amp;amp; well-adjusted because they are fully accepted into Samoan society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex is not gender!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex is biological, and gender is cultural.  There are numerous examples worldwide of societies where gay, lesbian, intersex, etc people are fully accepted &amp;amp; integrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dangerous Nonsense from ACP: ACP is a southern anti-gay group which pushes a lot of the old nonsense.  Their motives are religiously-based, because they view things like homosexuality through a fundamentalist lens of sin &amp;amp; evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medical profession should not mess with the genitalia, they should just allow the kid to grow up, develop, and figure out who they are on their own without society attempting to mold them into something they don’t want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many pediatricians (guided by the APA) view an intersex infant as a “major crisis” that needs to be “corrected” by hormonal therapy, surgery, etc.  How about teaching the parents that this is natural?  How about leaving the genitals alone and allowing the kid to grow up a bit first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also a host of issues with transgender people.  Most of it boils down again to the idea that because our society is so locked into the Adam &amp;amp; Eve duality, we don’t have a place for these people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Word:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Difference&lt;/em&gt; does not equate to &lt;em&gt;Disorder&lt;/em&gt;!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations to Shinyhappycarrie, who just won Blisstree’s Earth Day Best Green Tip Contest! She will receive a special eco-friendly prize from Blisstree!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Here’s Shinyhappycarrie’s green tip: &lt;em&gt;Cook food as quickly as possible! Meaning, after you get  your local ingredients, pick the recipe that takes 15 minutes instead of  the recipe that takes 45. Less energy required and more time to do other  things. A win for you &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;and a win for the environment!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Didn’t win? Not to worry! Check back often for more Blisstree contests and giveaways.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks for entering – and stay green!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I especially enjoyed blog bff Scicurious's take on the study:

Budgetary requirement: $5000 for series of expensive remote control helicopters.  

Source: Toys R Us.

Justification: Need something that can fly close to a whale and collect snot for measurement.  Also, this is the only kind that comes in red, and the gunmetal grey ones suck.

This day, however, we will travel farther, er, south. Through the mouth, down the esophagus, into the stomach, detour through the intestines, take a left at the sphincter, but, what, what's that blocking your way? 

It's whale poop, friend.  Read the rest of this post... | Read the comments on this post......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

 &lt;br&gt;
Description: Our panel of journalist-blogger hybrids - Carl Zimmer, John Timmer,  Ed &lt;strike&gt;Yimmer&lt;/strike&gt; Yong, and David Dobbs- will discuss and debate the future of science journalism in the online world. Are blogs and mainstream media the bitter rivals that stereotypes would have us believe, or do the two sides have common threads and complementary strengths? How will the tools of the Internet change the art of reporting? How will the ongoing changes strengthen writing about science? How might these changes compromise or threaten writing about science? In a world where it's possible for anyone to write about science, where does that leave professional science journalists? And who actually are these science journalists anyway?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_rebooting_6.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/bI7-1hZg0RI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272116224631"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=23584">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dbe2858cc443267b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Could an Atheist Be the UK’s Next Leader?</title><published>2010-04-24T13:00:16Z</published><updated>2010-04-24T13:00:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/04/24/could-an-atheist-be-the-uks-next-leader/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;How much do I know about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010"&gt;British politics&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This much: |—|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article3074541.ece"&gt;what I do know&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrats’ new leader, has defied political convention with a frank admission that he is an atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a round of media broadcasts on the morning after his election to the post, he was asked by one interviewer: “Do you believe in God?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No,” Mr Clegg answered simply, during an appearance on BBC Radio 5 Live.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, that’s old news — that Clegg is an atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real news is that Clegg &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/interactive/2010/apr/06/general-election-2010-polling"&gt;has taken the lead in several polls&lt;/a&gt; over the past couple weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, his atheism is a non-issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Razib Khan&lt;/strong&gt; at Gene Expression is &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/04/the-strange-land-of-atheist-politicians/"&gt;amazed by this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is of course in sharp contrast with the United States where all politicians operationally have to avow a religious affiliation, and the higher that a politician ascends up the ladder of achievement the more vocal and thorough the assertions of sincere faith have to become. And yet it is Britain which has an established church, where the head of state is the head of the church, and, religiously oriented schools &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_school"&gt;receive public funding&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love for someone more knowledgeable about this election to shed some light on Clegg and what his victory could mean for non-theists.  Will it have any effect at all?  I know little about the man’s politics, so please enlighten me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/jen-mccreight.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="jen mccreight" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/jen-mccreight.jpg?w=404&amp;amp;h=272" alt="" width="404" height="272"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blaghag.com/2010/04/in-name-of-science-i-offer-my-boobs.html"&gt;In  the name of science, I offer my boobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-ml-iran-earthquakes-promiscuity,0,6333394.story"&gt;little  bit of supernatural thinking&lt;/a&gt; has been floating around the blogosphere  today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many women who do not dress modestly … lead  young men astray, corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society,  which (consequently) increases earthquakes,” Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi was  quoted as saying by Iranian media. Sedighi is Tehran’s acting  Friday prayer leader.I have a modest proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedighi claims  that not dressing modestly causes earthquakes. If so, we should be able  to test this claim scientifically. You all remember the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/jan/29/sceptics-homeopathy-mass-overdose-boots"&gt;homeopathy  overdose&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for a Boobquake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, April 26th, I will wear  the most cleavage-showing shirt I own. Yes, the one usually reserved  for a night on the town. I encourage other female skeptics to join me  and embrace the supposed supernatural power of their breasts. Or short  shorts, if that’s your preferred form of immodesty. With the power of  our scandalous bodies combined, we should surely produce an earthquake.  If not, I’m sure Sedighi  can come up with a rational explanation for why the ground didn’t  rumble. And if we really get  through to him, maybe it’ll be one involving plate tectonics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So,  who’s with me? I may be a D cup, but that will probably only produce a  slight tremor on its own. If you’ll be joining me on twitter, use the  tag #boobquake!

I think we have another reason to be afraid--very afraid--of homeopathy/ Apparently New Agers have developed a &lt;a href="http://www.newsbiscuit.com/2010/04/20/new-age-terrorists-develop-homeopathic-bomb/"&gt;homeopathic bomb&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The world has been placed on a heightened security alert following reports that New Age terrorists have harnessed the power of homeopathy for evil. 'Homeopathic weapons represent a major threat to world peace,' said President Barack Obama, 'they might not cause any actual damage but the placebo effect could be quite devastating.'

&lt;p&gt;The H2O-bomb has been developed by the radical New Age group, The Axis of Aquarius. In a taped message to the world, their leader, Professor Hubert Pennington, said: 'For too long the New Age movement has been dismissed as a bunch of beardy weirdy cranks and charlatans. But now we have weapons-grade homeopathy and we demand to be taken seriously.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homeopathic bombs are comprised of 99.9% water but contain the merest trace element of explosive. The solution is then repeatedly diluted so as to leave only the memory of the explosive in the water molecules. According to the laws of homeopathy, the more that the water is diluted, the more powerful the bomb becomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder why no one (well, besides Charlene Werner) has ever thought of this before. A homeopathic bomb could render nuclear weapons obsolete. Heck, it could even be like the doomsday bomb in &lt;em&gt;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Dr. Strangelove, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&lt;/em&gt;. There is that little problem of succussion to overcome, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/fear_the_homeopathic_bomb.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/32aYf4VrgHI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272111377192"><id gr:original-id="http://www.badscience.net/2010/04/evidence-based-voting/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b784ee2c67aa4d91</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="bad science"/><title type="html">Evidence based voting</title><published>2010-04-24T12:15:30Z</published><updated>2010-04-24T12:15:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscience.net/2010/04/evidence-based-voting/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscience.net/" type="html">Ben Goldacre, The Guardian, Saturday 24 April 2010

Those, too, are smoked and barbecued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody could claim that this food is good for you, but every few weeks I have a hankering for the stuff and head down to &lt;a href="http://www.lthforum.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=8434"&gt;Uncle John’s BBQ&lt;/a&gt; on 69th street, a short drive from the University of Chicago. In this humble storefront, &lt;a href="http://chicagoweekly.net/2009/05/28/masters-of-the-pit-in-search-of-chicago-style-barbecue/"&gt;amiable pitmaster Mack Sevier&lt;/a&gt; works his magic.  And I always get the same thing: tips and links.  It’s ten dollars, and enough food for three meals.  The hot links literally burst in their porky juiciness when pierced by a tooth, and the rib tips are a wonderful mixture of crunchy outer bits and tender inside meat, which you gnaw to get every last shred off the bone. Here is food for the gods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Rib tips &amp;amp; links, Uncle John" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/rib-tips-links-uncle-john.jpg?w=456&amp;amp;h=609" alt="" width="456" height="609"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;Figure 1.  Tips and links from Uncle John’s.  If you want to make a comment about the unhealthiness of this food, do me a favor and refrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to today’s felid.  I am a denizen of Chicago’s premier food discussion group, the “&lt;a href="http://www.lthforum.com/bb/index.php"&gt;LTH forum&lt;/a&gt;” (named after a Chinese restaurant, the Little Three Happiness), and a while back there was a thread on the splendor of Uncle John’s BBQ.  One poster, “geno55″, was photographing a tips and links combo for the thread, but without warning a &lt;a href="http://lthforum.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;amp;t=6156"&gt;ninja barbecue cat&lt;/a&gt; darted into the picture to snatch a rib tip.  Here’s the photo:&lt;/p&gt;

For many of us, chemistry is something we remember with groans from high school. Periodic Table of the Elements—what a pain to memorize, and what was the point, anyway?

So how do you take a subject like chemistry and make it exciting, intriguing, and compelling?

With her new book The Poisoner’s Handbook, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Deb Blum has done just that. Blum takes a page from the "CSI" franchise, and moves that familiar narrative of crime, intrigue, and high tech bad-guy catching back into the early days of the 20th century. There, in jazz age New York, she chronicles the birth of forensic chemistry at the hands of two scientific and public health pioneers—the city’s chief medical examiner Charles Norris, and his chemistry whiz side-kick Alexander Gettler.

And while chronicling their poison-sleuthing careers, Blum also teaches quite a bit of science. Her book is a case study in science popularization, and one we should all be paying close attention to.

Deborah Blum is a Pulitzer-prize winning science writer and has been a professor of journalism at the University of Wisconsin-Madison ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/4s14o3slbqnbbtt5h00bhpgldc/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fintersection%2F2010%2F04%2F24%2Fnew-poi-deborah-blum-murder-and-chemistry-in-jazz-age-new-york%2F" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272096237523"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/clock_quotes_635.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6daa50fb3843a0e1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2010-04-24T08:56:50Z</published><updated>2010-04-24T08:56:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/x-q3i5ZMWQ4/clock_quotes_635.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/clock_quotes_635.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Men talk of killing time, while time quietly kills them. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could they do to top that this year? Who could they possibly get as a commencement speaker for the class of 2010 to signify exactly how deeply into Wingnuttia they are? Who could possibly stand up and show them their future?&lt;/p&gt;

Most people are exposed to this mild persistent herpesvirus over the course of their life; it causes few obvious symptoms, but over time more and more of your immune system resources become uselessly specialized to fight it. An immune cell dedicated to remembering the signature of CMV is unavailable for other uses - and eventually you run out of cells to protect you from new threats, destroy cancers, and clear out senescent cells. This process is one part of the frailty and increased risk of death and disease that comes with old age. A recent study quantified the risk that comes with a CMV-focused immune system. Mortality rate and incidence of frailty were compared against levels of anti-CMV immune activity, as judged by concentration levels of antibodies: Cytomegalovirus Infection and the Risk of Mortality and Frailty in Older Women: A Prospective Observational Cohort Study Present understanding is limited regarding the long-term clinical effect of persistent CMV infection in immunocompetent adults.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported on Thursday that WellPoint, the largest U.S. health insurer by enrollment, was using a computer algorithm that automatically targeted patients recently diagnosed with breast cancer, among other conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The software triggered an immediate fraud investigation by the company as it searched for excuses to drop coverage, according to government regulators and investigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WellPoint has excuses. One that is &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; reasonable is that they automatically scan claims for pre-existing "conditions that patients would likely have known about when they applied for insurance, but insisted it does not single out women with breast cancer." Which is only almost reasonable until you think it through and realize that they're admitting that they do actively search for reasons to deny coverage to women with breast cancer, and that their other justification is that they do the same thing for &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; on their plan who comes down with a disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know. They just want to make a profit for their shareholders, and they take it for granted that they profit more if they deny health care to people in need. It seems to me that that is the problem, though: relying for health care on companies that have an incentive to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; provide health care doesn't sound like a smart move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, &lt;a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/in-response-to-a-letter-from-the-us-department-of-health-and-human-services-wellpoint-issued-the-following-on-behalf-of-angela-braly-chair-and-ceo-of-wellpoint-inc-91934059.html"&gt;WellPoint has published a lengthy counterargument&lt;/a&gt;. They do point out that they have a lot of clients and they do have detection and prevention programs in place, which is good; nowhere do they refute the news report that they "automatically targeted patients recently diagnosed with breast cancer, among other conditions." In fact, they're basically admitting it, and all they say that's relevant is that they do not single out women with breast cancer. Which the original article did not claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one small piece of WellPoint's letter that is unintentionally amusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madame Secretary, a three-story pink ribbon hangs in the lobby of our Indianapolis headquarters for many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate those stupid ribbons for everything: they seem to be more a blind and completely empty acknowledgment of a problem with no solution or even any real effort behind them. Want to claim you support something? Slap a magnetic ribbon on your car. Done. If you &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; want to pretend you care, put up a three-story tall ribbon in your lobby. Is anyone impressed?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/why_do_we_need_to_get_for-prof.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/pCHyRw3jtzQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272075383514"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=5609">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/746e8af5b7db1f14</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Freedom of Speech"/><category term="religion"/><title type="html">Have you seen this Muslim prophet?</title><published>2010-04-24T02:16:15Z</published><updated>2010-04-24T02:16:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2010/04/23/have-you-seen-this-muslim-prophet/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/132/l_a2c52ab7fb1947279f46c2ef315347ea.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/132/l_a2c52ab7fb1947279f46c2ef315347ea.png" alt="" width="306" height="404"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Thoreau&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
20 years ago tomorrow, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope"&gt;Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; was launched into orbit.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/File%3AHST-SM4.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/File%3AHST-SM4-thumb-500x375-47692.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="File:HST-SM4.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't look that impressive, and maybe it shouldn't.  After all, what is a space telescope?  It's a couple of mirrors, a camera, some stabilizing gyroscopes, some electronics and an antenna, all wrapped in a reflective coating and powered by some solar panels.  Doesn't sound so hard, does it?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Hubble has vastly increased our understanding of the Universe, and I'd like to share with you some of the highest highlights of what we've found with it.  (And feel free to share &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; favorite bits in the comments.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/lores.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/lores-thumb-500x390-47694.jpeg" width="500" height="390" alt="lores.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.) SN 1987a&lt;/b&gt;.  In 1987, a supernova went off in the Large Magellanic Cloud.  As far as we can tell, that's the closest supernova to us &lt;i&gt;since 1604&lt;/i&gt;!  The image above is what that supernova remnant looks like as of 2007, the most spectacular image of a recent supernova ever taken!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/ngc2818_hheritage.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/ngc2818_hheritage-thumb-500x282-47696.jpeg" width="500" height="282" alt="ngc2818_hheritage.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.) Planetary Nebulae&lt;/b&gt;.  When our Sun dies, it's going to blow off its outer layers of gas and collapse into a white dwarf.  Thanks to the Hubble Space Telescope, we have unprecedented pictures of what these planetary nebulae look like.  Some are asymmetric, such as NGC 2818 (above), while others are almost perfectly spherical, like the Ring Nebula (below).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/See%20Explanation.%20%20Clicking%20on%20the%20picture%20will%20download%250A%20the%20highest%20resolution%20version%20available.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/See%20Explanation.%20%20Clicking%20on%20the%20picture%20will%20download%250A%20the%20highest%20resolution%20version%20available-thumb-500x375-47698.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="See Explanation.  Clicking on the picture will download%0A the highest resolution version available.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are even other cases too, like the famous Cat's Eye Nebula (below), which is maybe the most spectacular one to my eye.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/See%20Explanation.%20%20Clicking%20on%20the%20picture%20will%20download%250A%20the%20highest%20resolution%20version%20available-1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/See%20Explanation.%20%20Clicking%20on%20the%20picture%20will%20download%250A%20the%20highest%20resolution%20version%20available-1-thumb-500x375-47700.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="See Explanation.  Clicking on the picture will download%0A the highest resolution version available-1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But out beyond single stars, Hubble has taken fabulous looks at clusters of stars!  These come in two different major types.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/ngc3603hst.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/ngc3603hst-thumb-500x514-47702.jpeg" width="500" height="514" alt="ngc3603hst.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.) Open Star Clusters&lt;/b&gt;.  These are regions of space where thousands of stars have formed recently, and Hubble is amazing for photographing these regions.  Above is NGC 3603, and if it doesn't make your jaw drop now, try clicking on it.  Just try and not be awed; I &lt;i&gt;dare&lt;/i&gt; you.  But there's another type of cluster of stars out there...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/384605main_ero_omega_centauri_full_full.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/384605main_ero_omega_centauri_full_full-thumb-500x597-47704.jpeg" width="500" height="597" alt="384605main_ero_omega_centauri_full_full.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.) Globular Clusters&lt;/b&gt;.  Collections of hundreds of thousands to even millions of stars over just a few light years, these objects -- many of which are found in our own galaxy -- are the densest collections of stars that we know of.  And Hubble, rather than showing us a faint fuzzy blob, can resolve individual stars of different colors at the hearts of these clusters, like Omega Centauri, above.  (Again, if you don't think this is impressive, try clicking on it.)  But not everything that Hubble does lives in or near the Milky Way...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/sombrero_hst_big.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/sombrero_hst_big-thumb-500x400-47706.jpeg" width="500" height="400" alt="sombrero_hst_big.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5.) Other spiral galaxies&lt;/b&gt;!  Whether it's an edge-on spiral like the Sombrero Galaxy (above) or a face-on spiral like the Whirlpool Galaxy (below), there are few sights as beautiful as a few hundred billion stars collected in one image like these, and Hubble continues to bring them to us like no other telescope/camera combo can.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/M51HST-GendlerM.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/M51HST-GendlerM-thumb-500x347-47708.jpeg" width="500" height="347" alt="M51HST-GendlerM.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Again, click for the big, huge, hi-res images.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all galaxies are spirals.  Hubble has photographed elliptical galaxies, irregular galaxies, but my rare favorite non-spiral?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/ringam2_hst_big.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/ringam2_hst_big-thumb-500x400-47710.jpeg" width="500" height="400" alt="ringam2_hst_big.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.) Ring galaxies&lt;/b&gt;.  Take a look at the bizarre beauty of Ring Galaxy AM 0644-741 (above).  But what  really strikes me about this image is something you won't notice at first glance... what happens if you take a look at the lower left portion of this image?  The part, I mean, that doesn't even include this Ring Galaxy?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/ring%20galaxy%20extra%20bonuses.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/ring%20galaxy%20extra%20bonuses-thumb-500x413-47712.jpg" width="500" height="413" alt="ring galaxy extra bonuses.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7.) New, faint, super-distant galaxies!&lt;/b&gt;  That's right, Hubble's "eye" is so powerful that it finds the faintest, most distant galaxies that we've ever discovered!  In fact, this brings us to my favorite image of all-time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would happen if you took a completely &lt;i&gt;blank&lt;/i&gt; patch of sky?  No known stars, no known galaxies, nothing at all?  What would happen if you just pointed your space telescope at it and left the shutter open on the camera?  Hour after hours, day after day, just sitting there, collecting photons one at a time?  What would you see?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing?  Something?  Anything?  Hubble did that, and it saw this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/opo9601c1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/opo9601c1-thumb-500x375-47714.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="opo9601c1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8.) The Hubble Deep Field.&lt;/b&gt;  Thousands and thousands of galaxies.  From hundreds of millions to &lt;i&gt;billions&lt;/i&gt; of light years away.  You think it's just a bunch of dots?  Try clicking on it; each "dot" is &lt;i&gt;its own galaxy&lt;/i&gt;!  In fact, after they switched out the camera that took this for a better one, they too an even better one: the Hubble &lt;i&gt;Ultra&lt;/i&gt; Deep Field!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/hudf_300dpi.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/hey_hubble_thanks_for_20_years/hudf_300dpi-thumb-500x500-47716.jpeg" width="500" height="500" alt="hudf_300dpi.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's what our Universe looks like, from individual stars up to the most distant  galaxies ever seen, all through the eye of this one magnificent telescope.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So thank you, Hubble, for 20 years of simply fantastic awesome service.  And make no mistake about it, I know you're not even close to finished yet.  Keep it up, and I'll keep on thinking of you.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stellardrive, Inlandsix&lt;/b&gt;: Reasonably good instrumental prog. They're
   not particularly exceptional, but they're decent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gong, "The Octave Doctors and the Crystal Machine"&lt;/b&gt;: Gong is a 
  perfect example of one of the differences between the great prog bands,
  and a lot of the neo-progressive stuff. I can't quite describe exactly what it
  is - but you listen to a band like Gong, and you never get bored. You can listen
  to it over, and over - and it's always interesting. Even though the individual
  features of the music are similar to what a lot of less brilliant bands do,
  they manage to put them together in a different way. I can listen to a neo-prog
  band like Jadis or Frost once or twice a month; if I listen to them more than
  that, they start to bug me. But I can listen to Gong twice a day, and never
  lose interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parallel or 90 Degrees, "Backup"&lt;/b&gt;: One of the really great neo-progressives.
  Po90 is Andy Tillison's other band, and they are brilliant. Not as brilliant as
  groups like Gong, but pretty damned amazing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jadis, "All You've Ever Known"&lt;/b&gt;: Here's exactly what I'm talking about.
  The beginning of this Jadis track is actually sort-of like the Gong track above.
  But somehow, it's &lt;em&gt;dull&lt;/em&gt; when Jadis does it. Listening to them right after
  Gong and Po90, they frankly sound terrible. I really like Jadis, but they can't
  hold a candle to the prog greats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;And So I Watch You From Afar, "If it Ain't Broke, Break It"&lt;/b&gt;: Really good
  post-rock. ASIWYFA is on the louder end of post-rock, and they're really good
  at it. They're one of my most recent post-rock discoveries, after being recommended
  to me by a reader of the blog, and I'm really enjoying them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genesis, "Your Own Special Way"&lt;/b&gt;: And now, my favorite band of all time.
  I love Genesis. Even after Peter Gabriel left, they still wrote some of the
  best prog rock of all time. There's a reason why so many neo-prog bands were
  inspired by them. Even when they're doing a song like this, which is basically a silly sappy ballad,
  they make it into something really special.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jacob Hoffman with Kandel's Orchestra, "Doina and Hora"&lt;/b&gt;: an incredibly old
  recording of traditional klezmer, led by probably the greatest Klezmer xylophone player
  ever. If you have any appreciation for Klezmer, this will absolutely knock your
  socks off. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Flower Kings, "Soul Vortex"&lt;/b&gt;: Ah, the Flower Kings. The only 
  neo-progressive band that I've found that's really as good as the original
  prog guys. Whatever that elusive "it" that the great bands had that made them
  endlessly listenable was, Roine Stolt and the Flower Kings have it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transatlantic, "The Return of the Giant Hogweed"&lt;/b&gt;: On their latest album,
  Translatlantic added a disk of covers of their influences. Naturally, no
  group made up of members of the best neo-progressive bands could possibly
  &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; include a classic Genesis track. It's a very faithful cover, and
  it works really well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marillion, "Forgotten Sons"&lt;/b&gt;: An old favorite of mine: one of the 
  lesser known tracks from Marillion's very first full album. From the
  very start, Marillion was really something special.&lt;/li&gt;

Not only is it all over the Internet (if you’ve opened your browser even once today, you’ve probably seen it), but I also firmly believe that this is not just a saga for teens. And I’m not the only one. Google “Twilight + adults” and the first result is an entire website built by and for adult women who are just like me: &lt;a href="http://www.twilightmoms.com/"&gt;TwilightMOMS.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tell you why I’ll be elbowing 13-year-old girls out of line on &lt;em&gt;Eclipse&lt;/em&gt;’s opening day (June 30), I need to give a full synopsis of my induction into the world of Mormon vampire love. I was no early adopter. At the start, I was quite uninterested in the tween sensation. It wasn’t until after &lt;em&gt;New Moon&lt;/em&gt; – the second &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt; movie – was released that I even saw the first one. In fact, I was much more surprised that my friends made me watch it than I was at my instant rapture with the world of Edward and Bella. I showed up in Ann Arbor to celebrate Thanksgiving with college friends who normally talk urban development, bike lanes, education, and farmers’ markets. But in a hungover stupor (we really shouldn’t have opened that bottle of port after the turkey), my friend busted out the werewolves. And, by the last scene, those of us who were most dubious about the teen sensation were hanging on the edge of the couch. I made a date to see &lt;em&gt;New Moon&lt;/em&gt; before I was home from Thanksgiving, and I will probably watch the &lt;em&gt;Eclipse&lt;/em&gt; trailer a minimum of 40 times this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But really, I swear: I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the kind of person who normally gets swept up in weak, cheesy plots and bad acting. And I fully acknowledge that  &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New Moon&lt;/em&gt;, and by all logic, &lt;em&gt;Eclipse&lt;/em&gt; are full of those things. Still, no matter how hard I laugh at schlocky closeups of Robert Pattinson’s smoldering eyes or clips of Kristen Stewart running through Forks, Washington in a pastel chiffon dress, I still genuinely love these movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not Mormon, I’m not a vampire, and I’m not into robbing the cradle, so what is it that I find so compelling about these films? Getting wrapped up in the classic drama of unrequited love makes me feel like a teenager. More specifically, it makes me feel like Bella. Most girls, even those who were pretty and popular in high school, had their insecurities. Even if you were all bubbly cheerleader the outside, you probably felt at least a little like Bella on the inside: Shy, insecure, undeserving, and not sure where you fit in. And what would solve all your problems? Meeting an Edward. You know, someone to show you the Olympic Peninsula from the tops of trees. Someone who would love you unconditionally, without pressuring you to have sex. Whether you’re 14 or 40, Edward is like the universal dream man: Gets good grades, looks hot on a motorcycle, protects you from danger, likes to spoon, and will watch you sleep all night without making sexual demands. (Okay, abstinence isn’t part of &lt;em&gt;everyone’s&lt;/em&gt; fantasy, but as long as the sex is always on Bella’s terms…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are a lot of things I shouldn’t like about these movies, and don’t get me wrong, I’m not following Pattinson’s every move in gossip mags (but if you want to, our sister site &lt;a href="http://crushable.com/"&gt;Crushable&lt;/a&gt; will give you the scoop), but I am breathlessly waiting for that &lt;em&gt;Eclipse&lt;/em&gt; release. I’m not a teenager, and I’m totally okay with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to our third reader giveaway! (And trust us, it won’t be     our last.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s Earth Week! Disneynature, the studio that brought you the  record-breaking film &lt;em&gt;Earth&lt;/em&gt;, is bringing &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://disney.go.com/disneynature/oceans/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OCEANS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to the big screen on April 22, 2010, and will help raise money during  its opening week (April 22-28), for &lt;a href="http://www.nature.org/"&gt;The  Nature  Conservancy&lt;/a&gt;’s work to save coral reefs in the Bahamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly  three-quarters of the Earth’s surface is covered by water,  and &lt;em&gt;OCEANS&lt;/em&gt; boldly chronicles the mysteries that lie beneath.  Directors Jacques  Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud dive deep into the very  waters that sustain  all of mankind – exploring the harsh reality and  the amazing creatures  that live within. Narrated by Pierce Brosnan and  featuring spectacular  never-before-seen imagery captured by the latest  underwater  technologies, &lt;em&gt;OCEANS&lt;/em&gt; offers an unprecedented look  beneath the sea in a  powerful motion picture that unfolds on April 22,  2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blisstree is partnering with Disneynature and Walt Disney Studios,  and for this week’s reader giveaway…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two&lt;/em&gt; lucky Blisstree readers* will win:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• One copy of Disneynature’s film &lt;em&gt;Earth&lt;/em&gt; on DVD, courtesy of  Walt Disney Studios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• An &lt;em&gt;Earth&lt;/em&gt; companion book published by Participant Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering our exclusive Disneynature giveaway is simple. Just tell us  by 9 p.m. ET    this Friday, April 23, 2010, what sea creature you’re  most excited to learn about in &lt;a href="http://disney.go.com/disneynature/oceans/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OCEANS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In honor of each moviegoer, Disneynature, through  the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund, will help establish new marine  protected areas in the Bahamas with The Nature Conservancy, one of the  largest conservation organizations in the world. These areas will  contain miles of vital coral reefs that provide natural habitats,  nurseries, and feeding grounds for hundreds of marine species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Giveaway open to U.S. residents only. Blisstree will     select two    winners at random and contact them after April 23, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* The  MPAA rating for &lt;em&gt;OCEANS&lt;/em&gt; is G&lt;/p&gt;

The Catholic priesthood hasn't just been abusing children in various places, but also has &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/news/catholicism/index.html?story=/news/feature/2010/04/23/next_catholic_priest_abuse_scandal"&gt;a history of abuse of women&lt;/a&gt;, especially in Africa and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crisis of religious abuse in Africa and India was brought to Rome's attention in 1998 when a four-page paper titled "The Problem of the Sexual Abuse of African Religious in Africa and Rome" was presented by Sister Marie McDonald, mother superior of the Missionaries of Our Lady of Africa. A March 2001 National Catholic Reporter article detailed McDonald's claims, which included accounts of sexual abuse by priests and bishops.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
McDonald quoted a vicar general in one African diocese who talked "quite openly" in Rome in 1996 about celibacy in Africa, saying, "Celibacy in the African context means a priest does not get married, but does not mean he does not have children."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The AIDS pandemic in Africa and India is said to have made nuns "safer" sex partners and, also for that reason, targets of priests seeking sex. (Some nuns also reported sexual abuse by mothers superior.) The women, culturally brainwashed not to challenge men or female figures of authority, felt they had no choice, and the priests took further advantage by arguing that Catholic rules for priests required them to have sex "only with virgins."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
More allegations came from Sister Jesme, an ex-nun from the Indian state of Kerala, who told of sexual abuse and forced homosexual relationships in a 2009 autobiography. But when the book was released, a spokesman for the Syro-Malabar order of the Catholic Church in India dismissed it as a "book of trivialities."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"It's her experiences," he said, "but these are things that might creep into a society of communal living." He added that the church would not be shocked by the allegations, concluding, "The church knows about these things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure Catholic dogma does not say priests are allowed to have sex with virgins, so on the one hand, this is clearly a bunch of exploiters in clerical collars going well off the reservation; on the other hand, these abuses were plainly spelled out to the Vatican, which seems to have responded with its well-practiced negligence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, another factor might be that, just as is the case in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/how_bad_can_a_catholic_priest.php"&gt;remote Inuit villages&lt;/a&gt;, running a diocese in Africa or India is probably a high-profit-margin affair. The Vatican patriarchy might see little to gain in helping women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/next_on_the_docket_nun-rapers.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/QKcs7ANXzMo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272054212894"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=11004">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/edb7f67bcba50f64</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Contests close today</title><published>2010-04-23T20:23:24Z</published><updated>2010-04-23T20:23:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/23/contests-close-today/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m., I will stop accepting entries to both the &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/contest-spring-reading/"&gt;“Recommended spring reading” &lt;/a&gt;contest and the &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/17/caturday-felid-part-deux/"&gt;“How did Charles the Cat get to Chicago?”&lt;/a&gt; contest.

The game is called "&lt;a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1234349/unofficial_rules_for_frustration_the.html" title="Frustration"&gt;Frustration&lt;/a&gt;," and it involves laying down a large number of cards on the table from time to time. My grandmother had a cat named "Misty," who I believe was named by someone &lt;a href="http://dictionary.reverso.net/german-english/mist" title="fluent in German"&gt;fluent in German&lt;/a&gt;. Misty liked to be where the action was, and would often jump up on the table and wander from person to person, looking for attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a particularly long  round, I laid down my cards. Just then, Misty  hopped up on the table  and faced my girlfriend, with her tail gently  swishing over my carefully  organized cards. I gave her a  gentle tug on her tail. And with an alleycat yowl she lashed out at my girlfriend, narrowly missing  a cheek with her furniture-shredding talons. I had apparently tugged a bit too hard for Misty&amp;#39;s liking, and Misty punished the wrong person. My girlfriend, surprised, lashed back - swatting the cat and sending her scurrying. The cat avoided my girlfriend ever after, fearing another unprovoked tug and smack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did this happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is obvious. I was behind the cat, unseen, and the cat's focus was on my girlfriend. The cat automatically associated the tail-tug with my girlfriend because that's the context she was in. Misty was justified in lashing out — someone was tugging her tail! — but her chosen victim was also innocent, and unrelated to the problem. My girlfriend rightfully defended herself, not knowing that I had actually caused the cat's reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could we explain all that to Misty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe we see a similar reaction in parents who have children diagnosed with autism. Something has happened to their child. It&amp;#39;s a doctor reporting it, the same doctor who recently gave the child a vaccine, and the same doctor who has no cure. A parent&amp;#39;s instinct is to lash out when their child has been injured, but alas, who is tugging the tail that is autism? No one actually knows, but it&amp;#39;s easy to point one&amp;#39;s claws at the medical community, which from the parent&amp;#39;s perspective has had all the control in the situation. And the medical community (which includes skeptics) lashes back at the parents, creating a toxic conflict that benefits no one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough, I say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents of children with autism need our support, not our criticism. If they're convinced that vaccines caused their autism or that diet can cure it, we should treat them with respect and offer our evidence to the contrary. Politely. Calmly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As frustrated as we might get at their blatant refusal to look at simple data, anger isn't going to help the situation. Consider it from their point of view: They're encountering groups that promote anti-vaccination rhetoric, and those groups welcome them with open arms, camaraderie and support. The skeptics, on the other hand, often react negatively, telling distraught parents that they're wrong and harming other people's children. Guess what? That's factually &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt;, but that doesn't mean we need to be harshly confrontational. We &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be supportive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not easy, and it goes against our emotions, but the burden is ours. When the cat lashes out, we can understand what's going on. In fact, we're the only ones who can. It's up to us to set the tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't say this to belittle parents or to let Jenny McCarthy off the hook. There is a huge difference between the soccermom who looks at the wrong website for her info and a person with a powerful media presence who actively promotes false information. Attack Jenny, but embrace the soccer mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as for the tail tugger that is the root cause of autism, we'll just keep looking. Together, hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;

Futuyma vs Coyne</title><published>2010-04-23T17:55:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-23T17:55:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2010/04/what-is-evolutionary-theory-futuyma-vs.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> &lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been under the impression that the distinction between the fact of evolution and evolutionary theory is not controversial—at least among evolutionary biologists. Even since Gould, the point has been that the facts of evolution include things like common descent and the history of life on Earth. Evolutionary theory attempts to provide a mechanism that accounts for those fact and observations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richard Dawkins makes this clear in his book &lt;i&gt;The Greatest Show on Earth&lt;/i&gt; (p. 17).&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Biologists often make a distinction between the &lt;u&gt;fact&lt;/u&gt; of evolution (all living things are cousins) and the &lt;u&gt;theory&lt;/u&gt; of what drives it (they usually mean natural selection, and they may contrast it with rival theories such as Lamarck&amp;#39;s theory of &amp;#39;use and disuse&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;the inheritance of acquired characteristics&amp;#39;). ... Nowadays it is no longer possible to dispute the fact of evolution itself—it has graduated to become a theorum or obviously supported fact—but it could still bedoubted (just) that natural selection is its major driving force.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The distinction is important. Things like common descent and the history of life are the facts that demonstrate evolution. Evolutionary theory offers a solid, widely-accepted, explanation of how evolution happens.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/S9Hpe5DIlOI/AAAAAAAAKkg/2id5K-DQPH8/s1600/Futuyma.bmp"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:300px;height:291px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/S9Hpe5DIlOI/AAAAAAAAKkg/2id5K-DQPH8/s400/Futuyma.bmp" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Douglas Futuyma has written one of the most respected textbooks on evolution. He agrees with this distinction—as do all other textbook authors that I know of. Here&amp;#39;s what Futuyma says in &lt;i&gt;Evolution&lt;/i&gt; 2nd ed. p. 4.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;The explanation of &lt;u&gt;how&lt;/u&gt; modification occurs and &lt;u&gt;how&lt;/u&gt; ancestors gave rise to diverse descendants constitutes the theory of evolution. We now know that Darwin's hypothesis of natural selection on hereditary variation was correct, but we also know that there are more causes of evolution than Darwin realized, and that natural selection and hereditary variation themselves are more complex than he imagined. A body of ideas about the causes of evolution, including mutation, recombination, gene flow, isolation, random genetic drift, the many forms of natural selection, and other factors, constitute our current theory of evolution or "evolutionary theory." Like all theories in science, it is a work in progress, for we do not yet know the causes of all of evolution, or all the biological phenomena that evolutionary biology will have to explain. Indeed, some details may turn out to be wrong. But the main tenets of the theory, as far as it goes, are so well supported that most biologists confidently accept evolutionary theory as the foundation of the science of life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;No doubt you're puzzled about the purpose of this posting. You are probably saying to yourself. "So what? We all know that, already."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/S9HqWhASU9I/AAAAAAAAKkw/VtksQbN9t9Y/s1600/Jerry_Coyne.bmp"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;width:320px;height:288px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/S9HqWhASU9I/AAAAAAAAKkw/VtksQbN9t9Y/s320/Jerry_Coyne.bmp" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Apparently, not all of us agree. In an otherwise excellent review of Richard Dawkin's book, Jerry Coyne says the following [see: &lt;a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20100510/coyne"&gt;The Improbability Pump&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Demonstrating the truth of natural selection is just one of Dawkins's aims, for the theory of evolution is composed of several more or less independent parts, which I like to describe in one longish sentence: "Life on earth evolved gradually, beginning with one primitive species; it then branched out over time, throwing off many new and diverse species--and the process producing the illusion of design in organisms is natural selection." This sentence constitutes a scientific theory, which is not just a guess but an informed statement about the general principles that explain many observations about nature. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I think that's very wrong. First, it's wrong because it states that the history of life is a theory. Second, it's wrong because it states that the "illusion of design" is part of modern evolutionary theory (it isn't). Third, it's wrong because it only mentions natural selection and modern evolutionary theory is much more than that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope this was just an attempt to (over-)simplify evolution for the readers of &lt;i&gt;The Nation&lt;/i&gt;. In that case it might be (just) excusable. But I can't wait until the creationists get a hold of this review. They'll be delighted to learn that, according to Jerry Coyne, the gradual descent and diversification of life is only a theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They'll also be happy to learn from a prominent evolutionary biologist that design is part of modern evolutionary theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-125372890135522478?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272047455777"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/dawkins_fodorpiattelli-palmari.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/22745917690f520d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Dawkins ↑, Fodor/Piattelli-Palmarini ↓</title><published>2010-04-23T19:19:22Z</published><updated>2010-04-23T19:19:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/H3IozBvkg6A/dawkins_fodorpiattelli-palmari.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/dawkins_fodorpiattelli-palmari.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The long-awaited &lt;a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20100510/coyne/single"&gt;review of Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini's anti-evolution book&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/22/i-review-what-darwin-got-wrong-and-the-greatest-show-on-earth-in-the-nation/"&gt;Jerry Coyne&lt;/a&gt; is now online in &lt;i&gt;The Nation&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;div style="display:block"&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I appreciate McCreight’s intentions behind this; she meant it as a feminist response to a ridiculous statement. Unfortunately, it seems to be turning into something else, with many men chiming in, with their “show us your tits” camera-ready attitude. Women on parade again … sigh. Since when did we “stick it to the man” by wearing low-cut shirts or short shorts? When women burned bras back in the day, there was a statement there, full of boldness and righteous anger. This type of happening feels like feminism lite, “cute” feminism or “male-friendly” feminism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reviewing the hundreds of comments that continue to pour into the Boobquake Facebook page, many women apologetically replied, “Sorry, I don’t have enough cleavage to show” or “I’m as flat as a board … sorry!” A movement that encourages more body issues! Yay for us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Women should be able to wear what they want. That’s a given. Women should be able to sexually express themselves how they see fit. Of course. And underneath it all, I guess that was Boobquake’s intention. Unfortunately, we live in a world that sees that kind of freedom of expression as a photo opportunity or another cheap thrill. All parties must be on board and in celebration of the cause in a way that doesn’t include lasciviousness, latent female hatred or sexual over-saturation. If not, then all we’ve got is “Girls Gone Wild” with a cause slapped on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The term "worm" immediately conjures up images of the red, squiggly things which crawl all over the sidewalk after it rains, but this imagery does not fit the boneworms of the genus Osedax. These worms start off life as sexless larvae, and the timing of their arrival at a whale corpse makes all the difference as to whether they will be male or female. If the larva lands on the bones of a whale first, it will grow into a large female which will digest the bone with the help of endosymbiotic bacteria which comes to live inside the worm. Once this starts to happen, the larvae which fall on the already-established females will have a different life history. They will become males and will remain tiny (0.2-1.0mm long) for the rest of their lives, accumulating in crowded harems inside the tube of the larger female and living off stored yolk from their younger days as they have no mouth or digestive tract to speak of.

His melancholy photos depict drought, forest fires, and ice melt – all consequences of fossil fuel dependency and pollution. Hall created this photo collection after a near-fatal cycling accident in 2007 that caused him to re-evaluate his life and work, and he now devotes his work toward representing the impact of humans on our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see more photos and find more information about his project, visit &lt;a href="https://michaelhallphotography.wordpress.com/"&gt;https://michaelhallphotography.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt; or email contact@michaelhall.net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remember John Dempster? He’s a licensed (and hot) Naturopath who practices in Toronto. This is our fourth conversation with the good doctor (&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/feel/10-things-our-hunky-naturopath-scolds-us-for-doing/"&gt;here’s the third&lt;/a&gt;), who will regularly contribute to Blisstree about health and wellness issues. Find &lt;a href="http://drdempster.com/"&gt;The Dempster Clinic here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring cleaning doesn’t just apply to houses, closets, and backyards; it’s also a chance to scrub our insides clean. Detoxing is a hot topic today – just visit a health food store to see row after row of the latest detox kits or fad diets associated with them. Proper detoxification is important to keep looking and feeling young, healthy, and vibrant, but it’s essential to do it properly. (Contact me at &lt;a href="http://drdempster.com/"&gt;The Dempster Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, and stay tuned for my next Blisstree post.) To help start you on your cleansing mission, here’s an arsenal of the top ten most powerful detox foods. (All evidence-based, these foods will help rid your body of the daily toxic assaults to which we’re constantly exposed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ten Best Detoxifying Natural Foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Dandelion greens &lt;/strong&gt;An excellent liver tonic high in vitamin B complex, vitamin C, and a vast array of essential minerals. The chlorophyll in dandelion greens acts as a powerful blood purifier. Perfect in a salad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Ginger&lt;/strong&gt; Ginger increases circulation, helping toxins to be excreted through the skin, bowels, and kidneys. Ginger also has powerful immune boosting and anti-parasitic properties. Plus, it helps to combat inflammation, and therefore can relieve pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Apples&lt;/strong&gt; These purify the bloodstream and increase lymphatic action. The fibrous pectin in apples helps with colon function and promotes the excretion of toxic waste. The apple’s high vitamin C content also aids detoxification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Lemons&lt;/strong&gt; This tart fruit aids digestion by increasing saliva flow and stimulating liver function. Lemons help dissolve and bind uric acid and other toxins in the body; they also alkalize the blood, and have diuretic properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Grapes&lt;/strong&gt; These stimulate the liver and promote bowel and kidney function. Grapes have a cleansing effect on all tissues and glands, and speed up metabolic function. Purple grapes are high in resveratrol, a powerful disease-fighting antioxidant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Artichokes&lt;/strong&gt; They stimulate the liver – the body’s major organ of detoxification. By increasing bile production, artichokes help to metabolize fats. Find artichoke extract in natural health food stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Beets &lt;/strong&gt;These root vegetables purify the blood, cleanse the liver, and stimulate lymphatic activity. They also aid digestion, and help flush out uric acid from the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Parsley &lt;/strong&gt;This little green herb has a powerful cleansing effect on the bloodstream. It stimulates the bowels and supports the lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen. Plus, it’s a great source of vitamins A and C, and detoxifying chlorophyll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Grapefruit&lt;/strong&gt; This citrus has a cooling and purifying effect on the body, cleansing the liver and gallbladder. A 2004 Scripps Clinic study determined that the frequent consumption of grapefruit before meals also promotes weight loss. If you’re on any medications, consult with your ND, as grapefruit can alter their effects on your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Chlorella&lt;/strong&gt; This powerful superfood is actually an algae. But don’t turn up your nose just yet – it not only helps rid our bodies of accumulated heavy metals (lead, mercury, etc.), it also acts as a powerful blood tonic providing us with many trace minerals and micronutrients. Splash some into your salad, vegetable juice, or even your glass of water.&lt;/p&gt;

"I'm a firm believer that when someone says something so stupid and hateful, serious discourse isn't going to accomplish anything - sometimes light-hearted mockery is worthwhile."

Back on Boobquake's Facebook page, McCreight took a moment to be serious and encouraged followers to consider donating money to the American Red Cross' disaster relief efforts or to the AHA Foundation, an organization that strives to "defend the rights of women in the West against militant Islam."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&amp;#39;d be more impressed with his contrition if it hadn&amp;#39;t arisen after the media started making a lot of noise about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems there is a small wave of resignations sweeping through the high ranks of Catholicism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bishop's resignation came just one day after church authorities in Germany said that Bishop Walter Mixa, one of the country's most prominent and outspoken conservative clerics, had tendered his resignation to the pope after being accused of beating children decades ago.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
On the same day, the Vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation of Bishop James Moriarty of Kildare and Leighlin, Ireland, under a code of canon law that allows a bishop to resign before the retirement age of 75 for a "grave reason" that makes him "unsuitable for the fulfillment of his office."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Monday (April 26), Amanda will be at The Brattle Theatre to talk about her new book, &lt;em&gt;Get Opinionated: A Progressive’s Guide to Finding Your Voice (and Taking a Little Action)&lt;/em&gt;. She’ll be discussing several topics of interest to skeptics, like why science should matter in politics, the political aspects of the anti-vaccination movement, and the creation of scientific “controversies” in the media. Find more info on &lt;a href="http://bostonskeptics.com/?p=765"&gt;BostonSkeptics.com&lt;/a&gt; or RSVP on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/skepchick?ref=profile#!/event.php?eid=119914681356383&amp;amp;ref=ts"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second of all, it’s Comment o’ the Week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my week was trashed by a big stupid volcano, I laughed especially hard at &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/skepchick-quickies-4-20/comment-page-1/#comment-100835"&gt;this contribution from Bjornar&lt;/a&gt;, which should go into Urban Dictionary &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought a dirty thunderstorm was a threesome including a man, a woman and a vandergraaf-generator…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Early in the chapter, the author discussed how according to a study, 4-year-old children tended to predict that a bully would feel happy after pushing around some poor chump on the playground, aka happy victimization (Arsenio &amp;amp; Kramer, 1992). However, at age 6, children who were probed further not only predicted that the bully would feel happy after bullying, but would feel a sense of remorse as well (4-year-olds stuck to their guns). Is this the beginning stages of moral development?Arsenio went on to describe the possible link between emotion dysregulation and this notion of happy victimization. The victimizer initially feels positive, but then recognizes the victims negative feelings. This then elicits an involuntary positive or negative affective response depending on a whole host of factors including temperament, empathy, and parental attachment. For most of us, emotional maturity takes its natural course and empathic development occurs. However, those afflicted with borderline personality disorder and psychopathy seem to either steer off the beaten path or miss the bus completely.Before we speak further about these two truly disturbing personality disorders, an important distinction should be made between two subtypes of aggression mentioned in the reading. 1) Reactive aggression = &amp;quot;hot headed&amp;quot; impulsive angry reaction (ex. I&amp;#39;ll punch you in the face because you really pissed me off). 2) Proactive aggression = &amp;quot;cold blooded&amp;quot; aggression used instrumentally to reach some desirable end (ex. I&amp;#39;ll punch you in the face because I want your lunch money). As I read on, I couldn&amp;#39;t help but associate the two very different subtypes of aggression with the aforementioned personality disorders. Were adults who displayed frequent and high levels of reactive aggression more prone to being identified as borderline. Similarly, were those displaying frequent and high levels of proactive aggression more prone to being identified as psychopathic? It seems to fit all too well to be disregarded. To clarify where I&amp;#39;m going with this, characterizations of the personality disorders and some solid evidence are in order.Borderline personality disorders1. Prolonged disturbance of personality function in a person characterized by depth and variability of moods.The disorder typically involves unusual levels of instability in mood; black and white thinking, or splitting; chaotic and unstable interpersonal relationships, self-image, identity, and behavior; as well as a disturbance in the individual&amp;#39;s sense of self.2. over-active amygdala (i.e. overly responsive to emotion-related stimuli) (Donegan et al., 2003)3. insecure attachment (i.e. history of verbally/physically abusive parent) (Aaronson et al., 2006)4. ability to empathize (Fertuck et al., 2009) = intact mirror neuron system?Psychopathy 1. An abnormal lack of empathy combined with strongly amoral conduct, masked by an ability to appear outwardly normal. They can use charisma, manipulation, and intimidation to control others and to satisfy their own need.2. under-active amygdala (i.e. unresponsive to emotion-related stimuli) (Blair, 2008)3. insecure attachment (i.e. history of verbally/physically abusive parent) (Saltaris, 2002)4. inability to empathize = dysfunctional mirror neuron system? (Fekteau et al., 2008)My speculative model in sum:Borderline personality disorder = insecure attachment + overactive amygdala response + functional mirror neuron system =&amp;gt; high reactive/impulsive aggressionPsychopathy = insecure attachment + underactive amygdala response to fear + dysfunctional mirror neuron system =&amp;gt; high proactive/unemotional + reactive/impulsive aggression Psychopaths = happy victimizers into adulthood?

Despite this fact, the environmental impacts of an abrupt move away from oil have not been studied and are not well understood. In fact, according to a new paper published earlier this week in Conservation Biology, “the impact of peak oil will be far more immediate, certain, and perhaps larger than that of climate change, although peak oil has received far less scientific scrutiny, press, and funding than climate change.”The paper’s authors argue that as peak oil makes it more difficult to meet energy demands, environmental considerations may be easily superseded in order to meet food, power and transport needs.To make this problem worse, most widely used global scenarios of environmental change – including the, including those of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and the IPCC - do not incorporate resource limitation. The development of resource-constrained scenarios, therefore, should be addressed immediately.These scenarios are critical because the impacts on ecosystems, in the authors’ estimation, are highly dependent on the policies that shape the transition to alternative energy sources.Depending on the speed and coordination of such a transition, significant changes could occur in forest management and agricultural practices. In the extreme, we could experience an “inverse ‘green revolution,’” in which agricultural intensity goes down (with less technology and more labor) and yields therefore decline.Developing these scenarios may facilitate the move toward a low-carbon society by providing “essential analysis and expertise that can assist society in making the transition to the postpetroleum world.”In the event of peak oil, the role of scientists and particularly ecologists is to provide the “tools to describe energy flows through complex systems and clarifying the consequences of changing energy availability.” After all, the authors point out, “ecological systems resemble social systems,” and at this point both depend on a reliance on oil as a ubiquitous source of cheap energy.Although scientists debate the limits of natural resource availability on ecosystems, “ecological economists have consistently pointed out that economic systems are constrained by the same biophysical limitations that constrain the ecosystems in which the economy functions.”There is wide disagreement on whether we will reach peak oil, if we haven’t already. According to the paper, some researchers believe that world oil extraction peaked in 2005. Peak oil is defined as “the point at which the annual rate of global oil extraction reaches a peak that is then followed by an inevitable decline in the annual extraction rate.”CZÚCZ, B., GATHMAN, J., &amp;amp; McPHERSON, G.

So begins a recent article by UT professor Michael Webber, who offers an interesting take on a subject that's long been debated. He suggests that what makes us human is the way we manipulate energy:
I contend that what really separates humans from all the other species is that we are the only ones to manipulate energy. The First Law of Thermodynamics tells us that energy has many forms (for example, chemical, thermal, kinetic, electrical, atomic, radiant) and that we can convert from one form to another. And though all species benefit from the natural conversion of radiant energy (for example, sunlight) into chemical energy (derived from, for example, photosynthesis), humans are the only species that will specifically manipulate energy from one form to another — for example converting chemical energy (fuels) to thermal energy (heat) or mechanical energy (motion).
And, thus, a new definition of humanity is born: Humans intentionally manipulate energy.
With this in mind, Webber argues that we ought to accept responsibility for its negative effects. In other words, his definition implores us to be better stewards of this pale blue dot. It's a perspective I like very much.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks for your column at Hemant’s blog. I’ve learned so much about communication and family dynamics from reading your insightful advice. Your column is really a jewel of the atheist blogosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I would ask you about trying to “convert” one’s parents. My parents are quite liberal Christians, and even though my father was a practicing minister for many years, my upbringing seemed quite secular, and thankfully absent of any typical “preacher’s kid” psychological baggage. My parents have always encouraged critical thinking, and their approach is nicely characterized by Galileo’s famous quote, “I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with senses, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use…” Still, God was always assumed, and it took me until my mid 20s to realize that His existence was a premise that could be questioned like any other. The rest (of my theism) was history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents know about my atheism, but it is not a source of tension, nor has it negatively affected our relationship. After reading many of your columns, I see how lucky I am that my parents’ acceptance of me is not conditioned on God-belief. And even though my acceptance of them is likewise unconditional, I wonder whether they might benefit from questioning their own beliefs. Seeing how relatively easy it was for me to reason my way from my family’s liberal theism to atheism, I don’t think it would be much of a stretch for my parents either. This leaves me torn between conflicting thoughts: Is it my place to gently “proselytize” for atheism and possibly jeopardize their involvement in church, which is really their only social circle? Why should I care whether they believe in God? I don’t, but all the same, I feel like I have encountered a new outlook that has been very personally fulfilling. I want to share it with them because it might benefit them too, and because they are likely to be reasonably receptive. I’m hoping that you will be able to help me sort through my conflicting thoughts about whether I should gently proselytize them away from theism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers and thanks again,&lt;br&gt;
Philip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Philip,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I find myself in times of trouble, mother Mary comes to me,&lt;br&gt;
speaking words of wisdom, let it be.&lt;br&gt;
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me,&lt;br&gt;
speaking words of wisdom, let it be.&lt;br&gt;
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.&lt;br&gt;
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.&lt;/em&gt;  –Paul McCartney&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the deepest act of love one can do for another is to not interfere with who that person is.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you are very lucky.  Your relationship with your parents is the envy of countless atheists. Cherish what you have and don’t blow it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your family is a good example of how a freethinking family is not necessarily an atheist family. It’s characterized by freedom to think whatever one thinks. Whether that results in rejecting or accepting religious belief is not the point.  The point is that freedom of choice is honored.  The parents may have their beliefs, and they have given their children an introduction to those beliefs, but they have also encouraged their children to think, question and investigate enough to be able to come to their own conclusions.  When those conclusions turn out to differ from the parents’ beliefs, they have not penalized their children or taken away the love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many believers are so insecure that they cannot abide someone in their midst who does not believe. Such people can be very self-centered; it’s all about them.  They build up converts around them only to prop up their own sagging faith, as well as to puff up their egos with trophies of their piety and proselytizing prowess. If the unbelieving person is their child, they think about their failure as parents, and they dread the condemnation of their reputations by society.  Again, it’s all about them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast, your parents are very selfless. I congratulate and praise them for their courage and maturity, and for their deep respect for you. They seem to have clear boundaries around what is them and what is you, and they have not intruded into your territory.  In that deepest act of love, they have not interfered with who you are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So perhaps you should follow their example and respond with an equally loving non-interference.  They are also, as you point out, dependent on their church for most or all of their social life. At this point in their lives, to lose that could be a high cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that you want to share your liberated way of thinking with them out of love for them, and your generous spirit is admirable.  But good intentions do not by themselves make an act wise or desirable. Consider this quotation from your letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like I have encountered a new outlook that has been very personally fulfilling. I want to share it with them because it might benefit them too, and because they are likely to be reasonably receptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could have been said verbatim by a young Christian who wants to convert his non-believing parents.  If you are uncomfortable with that idea, then perhaps doing its opposite counterpart should make you hesitate as well. It would be very easy to unconsciously slip across the line from wanting to influence them for their sake, to wanting to influence them for your own sake, just as those self-centered, ego-puffing believers do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your parents sound like they are very intelligent and worldly.  They have certainly heard of atheism, and they know about yours, so they probably have already been exposed to the basic ideas you might be sharing if you were to try your gentle proselytizing.  Yet those ideas have not brought them to the same conclusions as you have reached.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be because we are not just the product of our parents’ genes and training.  We are also creatures of the part of history in which we live. Each generation grows up in an utterly different world from that of their predecessors. Your parents reflect the times of their formative years, which were very different from yours.  To a great extent, you used your unfettered reason and intellect in the particular way you did because of your position on the river of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip, if you want to talk to your parents about these issues, I think that is just fine, but let your motive be to increase mutual understanding and mutual enrichment, rather than to try to change them. Who knows? They might change, but that should not be the point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start out by thanking them for giving you the freedom to have your own mind, and for being so accepting of the person you have become.  This could be a segue into a respectful and loving conversation that validates the persons each of you have become, with no alterations necessary. &lt;/p&gt;

Interaction designers are dead. Who is next?&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His argument is that "Commercial spoken dialog systems can process millions of calls per week", and therefore "one can implement a variety of changes at different points in the application and randomly choose one competitor every time the point is hit in the course of a call", using techniques like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning"&gt;reinforcement learning&lt;/a&gt; to adaptively optimize the design. As a result, "the contender approach can change the life of interaction designers and speech scientists in that best practices and experience-based decisions can be replaced by straight-forward implementation of every alternative one can think of".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I yield to no one in my appreciation for Big Data, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EScience"&gt;eScience&lt;/a&gt; (or in this case, I guess, eEngineering…), the &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/fourthparadigm/"&gt;Fourth Paradigm&lt;/a&gt;, and all that. And &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning"&gt;reinforcement learning&lt;/a&gt; is a fine technique, with interesting roots in the extraordinary &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescorla-Wagner_model"&gt;Rescorla-Wagner model&lt;/a&gt; of classical conditioning (though there are &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006421"&gt;other ideas&lt;/a&gt; around). Everyone should know about this stuff, and apply it where it works, in spoken dialog system optimization as elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think that David goes (or implies going) way too far: IMHO, the massive data accumulation in the digital networking of the whole world is going to increase, not decrease, the demand for scientists and engineers. I don't have time to say anything more about it, for now, so feel free to discuss the question among yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — Fernando Pereira, who is &lt;a href="http://sites.google.com/site/fernandopereira/"&gt;in a good position to know&lt;/a&gt;, has a &lt;a href="http://earningmyturns.blogspot.com/2010/04/death-or-birth.html"&gt;quick list of contrary bullet points&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Even with all that data — and I agree it's growing fast as voice interaction on smart phones becomes ubiquitous — randomized search will be swamped by the combinatorial possibilities of interface design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only way to manage the combinatorics is to impose intelligent biases on the search process. That is, we need engineers and designers who understand and know how to apply the relevant computer science and statistics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated tools do not achieve good designs by themselves, because we do not know how to quantify good design as a mathematical objective function, even if the combinatorial problem could be tamed. We need human designers to steer the tools, evaluate the results, and recognize potential disasters. Their training may be different, but they are not 'dead'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results looked like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/daily-mail-poll1-1430-230410.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/daily-mail-poll1-1430-230410s.jpg" alt="poll #1" width="500" height="373"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Click to enlarge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This picture was recorded after lunch at 14.29, so it says I’d already voted.)  At the time of writing it is still there, at &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/polls/poll.html?pollId=1017189"&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/polls/poll.html?pollId=1017189&lt;/a&gt;, though not for much longer I suspect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I saw on Twitter a link to the &lt;a href="http://refpls.wordpress.com/2010/04/23/daily-mail-rigs-poll/"&gt;refpls web site&lt;/a&gt;.  They had very smartly noticed that the URL for the poll, linked from the Mail’s front page, and from the article on the debate, had changed to &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/polls/poll.html?pollId=1017190"&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/polls/poll.html?pollId=1017190&lt;/a&gt;,  So I voted again there and this time I wasn’t told I’d already voted.  The result was utterly different. At about 14.30 it showed Cameron ahead (just).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/daily-mail-poll2-1429-230410.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/daily-mail-poll2-1429-230410s.jpg" alt="poll 2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Click to enlarge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly the first poll shows a pretty &lt;span style="line-height:115%;font-family:&amp;#39;Arial&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;sans-serif&amp;#39;;font-size:12.0pt"&gt;exaggerated&lt;/span&gt; idea of Clegg’s lead. That’s why on-line polls like this are worth next-to-nothing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the Daily Mail. not liking the result of their first poll, simply trashed it and began again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even by the standards of the Daily Mail, that is cynical dishonesty.&lt;/p&gt;

Weta is not just the name of a special effects studio; it’s the common name for one very large insect (pictured) that is found in New Zealand. Like many animals on New Zealand, it’s under a bit of pressure from introduced mammals, so there are definitely conservation implications if you can understand the mating system of the animal.

Wetas make an interesting case study for studying body size and mating, because they are large for their lineage, and there’s also a big size difference between the males and the females. In this particular species of weta (Deinacrida rugosa), females are about twice as heavy as males. There’s a lot of permutations and combinations to figure out what factors are important in mating in these species. Is having a large body size advantageous in either sex?

Four years of chasing wetas in New Zealand, radio-tagging them (yes, they’re big enough for radio tags), letting them copulate in buckets and burrows, and authors Kelly and company are getting closer to some answers.

Somewhat unexpectedly, they did not find any statistically significant relationship between body size of mating wetas. Big boys didn’t mate with big girls or small with small.

Second, heavy females received significantly less sperm than light females. This is again a bit unexpected, given that in invertebrates, large females almost always are able to produce more offspring. Typically, you find males will expend as much sperm on the highest quality females as possible. Additionally, male body size doesn’t limit how much sperm the males can produce, so there was no evidence of “the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.”

Why? One possibility is that weta males just don’t adjust their sperm allocation for mate quality. If so, this would be very surprising, given how often males in how many different species have been shown to be able to do this. Maybe female size isn’t an indicator of fecundity, though that also seems a bit hard to believe.

The authors also float the idea that large females are so sexually attractive, that males act as if they “assume” large, high quality females will be mated multiple times, and they produce less sperm so as not to “over-invest” in a competetive situation. The authors admit themselves that their data don’t support that; there isn’t a statistically significant relationship.

Description: Our panel of journalist-blogger hybrids - Carl Zimmer, John Timmer,  Ed &lt;strike&gt;Yimmer&lt;/strike&gt; Yong, and David Dobbs- will discuss and debate the future of science journalism in the online world. Are blogs and mainstream media the bitter rivals that stereotypes would have us believe, or do the two sides have common threads and complementary strengths? How will the tools of the Internet change the art of reporting? How will the ongoing changes strengthen writing about science? How might these changes compromise or threaten writing about science? In a world where it's possible for anyone to write about science, where does that leave professional science journalists? And who actually are these science journalists anyway?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_rebooting_5.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/WXOtY1YouE4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1272030242320"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-844240189774761890">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/33e94b94680549cc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">A Brief Review Of &amp;quot;The Loftus Delusion&amp;quot; Book</title><published>2010-04-23T11:33:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-25T22:33:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/fv--cY56cGw/brief-review-of-loftus-delusion-book.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/844240189774761890/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=844240189774761890" title="17 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2010/04/brief-review-of-loftus-delusion-book.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;I’m honored that some college professors use my book &lt;i&gt;Why I Became an Atheist&lt;/i&gt; (WIBA) in their college classes, like Dan Lambert at John Brown University, and Richard Knopp at Lincoln Christian University, &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/12/what-is-difference-between-education.html"&gt;as I mentioned earlier&lt;/a&gt;. I’m also honored that David Reuben Stone has decided to write a book against WIBA, called &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Loftus-Delusion-Messianic-Israelism-Prevails/dp/0557320631?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;link_code=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969"&gt;The Loftus Delusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;l=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0557320631" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important;padding:0px!important"&gt;. While I do not like the title of the book, which is misleading for a few reasons, including the fact that Stone does not deal at all with my most recent book, &lt;i&gt;The Christian Delusion&lt;/i&gt; (TCD), Stone's book is a respectfully written one. But anyone who reads Jason Long’s chapter in TCD will see quite plainly what Stone is doing. He’s doing his best to gerrymander around my arguments in typical political redistricting fashion in order to maintain his faith. It’s a wonderful case study in cognitive dissonance reduction. Let me explain by briefly commenting on his book, which he graciously sent me.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stone considers his book “the definitive critique of the anti-Biblical atheism of John W. Loftus” (seen on the back cover of his self-published book). [And to think, people don’t like my self-promotion ;-) ] Is he right?  Not even close. He asks me for a response to his critique in the interests of a “charitable dialogue” that “could benefit us both in our search for truth" (p. 162). Okay. Here goes, very briefly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stone begins his book with a “newly discovered mathematical proof” of a critical component of the intelligent design (ID) thesis in chapter one (which can be seen on Amazon). Don’t get me wrong here. I can do the math. It’s just that it takes time to work through it; time that I must think is worthwhile if I’m going to want to do so. It’s just that I have lots of reasons for thinking it’s not worth it, so I didn’t. This chapter is the kingpin of his whole book. It’s Stone’s natural theology. If he’s right about it then he seems to indicate the rest of his case follows. If he’s wrong then his whole case fails. It’s that simple. It’s very interesting to me that Stone says later that even “a poor design is design nonetheless.” (p. 97). I’ve never heard that before in defense of theism, have you? It’s really too bad I didn’t even bother to follow it, as I think most readers won’t. For there is nothing about the ID thesis I find compelling at all, and it does not lead reasonable thinkers to conclude anything other than that  &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2010/01/what-is-likelihood-that-trickster-or.html"&gt;some trickster god exists&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve written about &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2010/02/trouble-with-natural-theology.html"&gt;natural theology before&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from that opener this is not a well planned out book, but I won’t belabor this point. Let me instead focus in on a couple crucial parts related to my arguments. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He criticizes my “Outsider Test for Faith” (OTF) and proposes an alternative called “Stone’s Test Of Neutral Evidence” (STONE). He criticizes the OTF for arguing on behalf of skeptical agnosticism rather than for neutral agnosticism. He thinks we should be neutral agnostics rather than skeptical agnostics. Rather than starting our examination of the evidence “from above” with the assumption of God, or in starting “from below,” with the world, STONE argues we should start “from the middle,” even though he inconsistently admits that “utterly pure and complete neutrality may be impossible to attain with respect to all belief systems.” (p. 73) Now this is all high sounding rhetoric, but rhetoric it is. It’s the democratization of extraordinary miracle claims that Bob Price criticizes so effectively in TCD. Stone, just like Boyd and Eddy in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Legend-Historical-Reliability-Tradition/dp/0801031141?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;link_code=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969"&gt;The Jesus Legend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;l=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0801031141" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important;padding:0px!important"&gt;, wants us to take seriously all claims no matter how bizarre or outlandish so they can smuggle in their own extraordinary Christian miracle claims. This so-called middle position of theirs is a strange land to stand on. They never started on this piece of ground in the first place. No, they were born into a Christian culture and accepted what they were taught to believe in this culture. There is no middle position. Human beings are not Spockian type creatures. We are given our religious worldviews. They are inherited; caught, not taught. The question the OTF asks us is how can we properly test the ones we were given. Given the fact that we are born into them, and given the fact that the odds are that ours is wrong from the geographical distribution of religious faiths, we should test our handed down faith with skepticism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Stone wants to argue we should test all faiths neutrally then this does not lead to faith anyway; it leads to agnosticism, what I call the default position. If someone were to actually treat religious faiths all the same then the proper attitude when considering them would be skepticism, not faith. Agnosticism by definition is being skeptical (a la Thomas Huxley). We cannot be so gullible to treat every bizarre claim seriously. And if we actually were to do so, then we could not conclude much of anything until we examined them all, which is practically impossible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most amazing thing about Stone’s book though, is that after he argues against my skeptical control beliefs he dismisses the second part of my book where I criticize the Bible and its foundational miracle claims and doctrines. He does so in ten pages (139-149). He says: “Loftus’ unjustified Biblical perspectives may be dismissed due to their logical grounding in those unjustified controls beliefs.” (p. 139). For instance, since he thinks he’s undermined my skeptical control beliefs, then without so much as trying to answer my arguments with regard to the atonement he basically says that since my control beliefs have been shown wrong, I am unjustified in rejecting the doctrine of the atonement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wait just a minute, Stone. I was once an insider. The second half of the book describes why I could not remain a Christian GIVEN a believing set of control beliefs. It’s the considerations of the second half of WIBA that caused me to reject the Christian faith and led me to my skeptical control beliefs in the first place. So until or unless you actually deal with the arguments in the second half of my book, you have done nothing to support your natural theology project. And until you actually flesh out for us what it means to treat all religious truth claims “neutrally,” as you claim to do, then you must examine in detail the arguments in the second half of my book. You cannot merely say that with your neutral stance you would accept these biblical doctrines and claims. That’s NOT being neutral, you see, or very critical as a thinker. You need to show us from a neutral starting point why you would accept the claims of an incarnation, the atonement, or the resurrection, and you did no such thing.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s more to his book. It’s just more of the same thing. I do not recommend this book by Stone at all, except as a wonderful case of cognitive dissonance reduction by a gerrymanderer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm sorry, David, but that's exactly what I think.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-844240189774761890?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
